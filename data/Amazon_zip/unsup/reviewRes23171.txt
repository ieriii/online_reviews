More like 3 1/2.. I was told that this was the best Greek restaurant in Greek Town.. by my Greek friend. Anyway, this place was super busy. Guess that means they're doing something right :) I got the spinach cheese(feta) pie and the cold spread sampler. Both were pretty good, but nothing amazing. Everyone else thought the food was pretty good. They kind of rushed us out .. I guess it's cause there were so many people waiting.
