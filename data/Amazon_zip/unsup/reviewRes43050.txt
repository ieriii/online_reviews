Is it great pizza? I wouldn't say so, but it is definitely unique - worth a try if you are in the area. As for the chicken (their other specialty), I ordered the 1/2 chicken meal one afternoon with a side of black beans, rice, and a pita (all included for the 8 dollar price - also includes a soda). It was by far the BEST chicken dish I had eaten in as long as I can remember. It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The beans and rice - though simple - were equally as great. I could not wait to go back. And then i went back....Same order, except my sides this time were the garlic mash potatoes and yellow corn. The corn was corn from a can and the potatoes tasted like a powdered mix. Could not even bring myself to eat them. The chicken was still flavored nicely, but DRY DRY DRY! I don't know what to say, based on their pizza I give them a 3. On my first stab at the chicken special i would give them a 5. After my last visit, a 1. I guess i'll kind of split the difference and give them a luke-warm 3.
