The dcor is pretty bad (painted murals of an Italian city) but the pizzas here have earned press coverage, Zagat plaques, and a place on numerous best of Chicago pizza lists. They also have salads, sandwiches, pasta, BBQ ribs and daily specials. You can order whole pies or slices. They have many varieties of pizza to choose a slice from, including thin crust, pan pizza and their famous stuffed crust. The dining room is large, with TVs and shakers filled with parmesan, oregano and red pepper flakes. * Slice of spinach & mushroom stuffed crust pizza ($3.19): it's served w/o reheating, so the bottom of the crust is too soft, almost slimy. The tangy hearty tomato sauce on top is very good, a bit acidic with pronounced oregano flavor and the pizza is filled with a ton of gooey mozzarella cheese. The butter crust isn't as sweet or rich as some and has delightfully crunchy edges. Shame about the soggy bottom, this was a good pizza. It's better to order the whole pizza (they deliver) or go earlier in the day when the pizza hasn't been sitting around as long.
