I know there are hundreds of review on this place, but it deserves this much hype. The hot dogs are really original and tasty Go if you don't mind a line (the line was very long, but it moved) I waited 30 minutes but I brought a DS to play against my friends and there was neat stuff on the wall to look at.  Also thinking over the savory combinations on the menu posted on the wall passes the time. Some may raise an eyebrow at $8 hot dogs, or may not be adventurous enough to stomach the cranberries brie or whatever, but the more normal chicago style dog is $1.75 and was one of my favorite dogs. We ordered 5 dogs to split between us, each had very different flavors.  I missed out on the duck fat fries tho....
