Went for the seven course tasting on a Sunday (there is no menu, the chef just creates). It was superb. All of the courses were well executed and extremely tasty. I was slightly apprehensive because I am allergic to shrimp, however I let them know ahead of time and there were no problems. I really enjoyed everything I ate. All of the courses were well seasoned and beautifully plated. The chef did a really good job of integrating different textures to give more dimensions to the food. For example one course that stood out was an artichoke vichyssoise that had a pan seared Yukon Gold in the middle, the warmth of the potato contrasted the coldness of the soup. Also added were some sprouts, they added a delicious crunch. I was extremely impressed and cannot wait to go back. Bonsoiree is creative without sacrificing taste,
