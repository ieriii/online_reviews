Next time, I will be sure to yell, "FIRE". Then I think I will enjoy my breakfast. I would love this place, not if there were a fire, no that would be tragic and weird. I would love this place if people just cleeaaarrredd out.  Granted, I came on a weekend in January, when touching butts with strangers in an awkward waiting area sounds better than being outside for an hour while waiting, but still. I felt awkward having so many people uncomfortably stand so close to me while I was eating, and it made the place super loud, killing all the joy of catching up with friends over endless coffee. The decor looks like a slightly hipper Ikea showroom (without all those tags with unhelpful swedish names), but the waitstaff was helpful, if not a bit frazzled.  I made my own omelet (with delicious turkey sausage, spinach and tomato), and guzzled delicious coffee and ate moderately fresh fruit. I just wish there weren't like 50 people watching us, waiting for the plates to be cleared, sprinkling my food with guilt that we haven't left yet.
