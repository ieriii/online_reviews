YUM... So I was taken here as a surprise and I have to say that I most certainly thoroughly enjoyed it. We had Belgian style mussels which were absolutely perfect. The Cashew fig and cheese sandwich which though could have used a sharper cheese but was otherwise very good. Tuna Nioise sandwich that I didn't try but from what I understand was good. I liked the atmosphere it was perfect for a casual date the beer list was phenomenal as well :) I will definitely venture back to this corner of the city for a meal again:)
