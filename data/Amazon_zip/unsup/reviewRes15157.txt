As of this writing, there are 962 reviews of the Violet Hour. Nine hundred plus. That volume of information will give you a good idea of what you'll find here. If you're going to peruse all the available text to make a decision on whether you want to visit or not, I would suggest you experience the place yourself first-hand as it will save you from the massive amount of reading and you'll at least get a tasty drink out of the process. As I won't want to reiterate what's already been said in the previous 900+ reviews, let me give you my personal rules about the VH: 1 - Never on a weekend. Drinks after work hours during the week are usually good. If forced to go on a weekend, I would suggest earlier than later. Or, if pressed, later than later. 2 - 3 people, max. 3 - Sit at the bar. The seats are more comfortable (for me) than the high back chairs, you get to talk to the bartenders and see drinks being made. The "bar tending" show could be just that - a show - but I appreciate it the same. 4 - Whiskey. I haven't had a bad (see: unimpressed) drink yet. Keep up the great work, VH! 5 - Order the food. Their food selection is surprisingly good. I don't know why but when I first learned they served food, I was shocked. 6 - Big Star tacos after you leave. Yeah, I know you just had drinks and food but there are some tasty tacos right across the street available through the pick-up window. Enjoy.
