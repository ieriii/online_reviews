This place blows me away every time I go. I've never waited less than 40 minutes and I never care. Further, Doug is unbelievably nice. Talk about a people person. The last thing any establishment needs after 99.9% of their clientele is waiting outside in line for a minimum of 40 minutes is an a$$hole with a poor attitude greeting you from behind a counter. An a$$hole Doug is not. In fact, his entire staff is nothing but friendly. Everyone is willing to answer questions and help you out. The food, oy, the food...just...I mean...there really are no words. One of the most creative menus in existence, in my opinion, can be found at Hot Doug's. Yes, there are your standards chardogs and corn dogs, etc, but the "specials'...man, they are special. Some personal past favorites of mine include (but are not limited to) the: -Apple and Cinnamon Pork Sausage with Curry-Honey Mustard and Brie-Blue Cheese -Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Goat Cheese -Curry Pork Sausage with Curry Mayonnaise and Smoked Blue Cheese drizzled with honey and last but (certainly) not least -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie-Gras Mousse, and Fleur de Sel. Also, they have Duck Fat French Fries on Fridays and Saturdays. $3.50 and you get a ton. Seriously**, 2,000 pounds. So, go. Be prepared...no, be EXCITED to wait. The anticipation makes it even better. **Not seriously - but you do get a lot. OH! I almost forgot. One thing that always impresses me with the times I've been to HD is how fluidly their seating system works. I can't speak for everybody but, in my experience, I've never had to wait for a table (which is incredible considering how many f*cking people are in that line at all times).
