I just can't explain how good this place is. Delicious every time. Delivery can be tiny bit slow, but its easily overlooked once the food arrives. Deep dish and thin are both delicious. Their sweet and never acidy sauce is just soo good. My personal favorite: Deep. Sausage, mushrooms, onion, spinach. Yum. I'm hungry just writing about it!
