Had a wonderful experience last night at Carnivale. My bartender made me (pregnant) an alcohol free mojito..it was delicious. There were 15 of us there to dine. Service was on top of it! I got to try a lot of food as well so here we go.. My favorite appetizer was the Arepa-Berkshire pork, corn cheese cake, plantains, black beans, jicama, avocado, aji limo puree. (Yes I copied this from the online menu). The other apps we had were the Flores y Camarones Edible flowers, Mexican shrimp, corn tortilla, chihuahua cheese, tomatillo habanero sauce. I don't recall any flowers..and the salsa seemed more like a cilantro and hot pepper sauce. still good. Guacamole "Kleiner Style" Chunky avocados, cilantro, chiles, onion, garlic, lime, chips Yep just a good yummy old fashioned guacamole. I didn't like the ceviche selection, but that is just my tastes, so if like whats in the different ones go for it. Others at the table loved it. for dinner I had Costilla de Res- Braised short rib, Three Sisters Farm cheese polenta, carrot escabeche, spiced cashews. I could not get enough of the polenta! the short rib just fell apart. My niece had the Arrachera Grilled skirt steak, rice and beans, sweet red onion, chimichurri sauce. Yes I am reviewing this because I ate some of hers to. It was a good skity steak, but it was skirt steak none the less, I liked the marinade. Now my friends dinner... hers took the cake! I didn't see hers on the menu, so it must have been a special. It was cubed steak plantains, and sauces. I had forgotten how much I liked this place. I will be back.
