I enjoyed the milk braised pork shoulder and the roasted bone marrow smear. I guess what I loved most was that it was so conveniently located off Mag Mile and really offered a great alternative to the middle end not so good touristy places and the high end fine dining. Unfortunately service was a slight negative.
