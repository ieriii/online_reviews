My friend and I decided to go here because it's open late for dinner and it's in walking distance from his place. I had been here once before for drinks and liked the atmosphere. This time I ordered the Wilde Burger and got an order of buffalo wings to share. The burger was awesome and giant, but was it worth 12 bucks, uhh no I don't think so. The fries were pretty sweet, quite salty - just the way I like 'em. They have glass ketchup bottles. This annoys me because the ketchup never wants to come out and you end up shaking the bottle furiously until finally a little teeny plop comes out. Ok, so I can't fault Wilde for the creation of the glass bottles, and I know they look better than the easy to use squeezy bottles, but come on now... Back to the burger. It came with a ton of caramelized onions. So much that I took off about half, as did my friend with his burger. Service was pretty poor. It wasn't very busy at all, but after waiting about 5 minutes for a waiter to show up, my friend went to the bar to get someone. Once we finally ordered, the food didn't take too long to come out. The waiter brought our appetizer the same time as the burgers which was kind of funny, because the size of the burgers were so big, we had trouble also eating the delicious wings. Well when you're paying that much, you should totally leave REALLY full, which we did! Great job, Wilde!
