I really wanted to like it here. In fact, I did like it here. The atmosphere was great and relaxed (although the bathrooms were down in the dungeonlike basement and were very cold). The food was excellent: I shared the steamed mussels in white wine sauce and then had the brisket platter. The beer list was jaw-dropping, more Belgian ales and microbrews than I knew existed. All I could do was pick the first name that I recognized (I had the Ommegang ale; not my favorite beer but it was quite good.) One of the most enjoyable moments of the evening occurred when somebody in the table next to us asked for a Bud. The waitress didn't quite know how to respond.Which brings me to the killer. Our waitress was terrible. Now normally, I'm very forgiving of the waitstaff. I understand how horrible it is to work for 8 hours on your feet, keeping people happy and making sure that everybody's order is straight. But our waitress showed no interest in us, never came to ask how our food was, and then we had to wait 20 minutes before she even approached us so that we could ASK for our check. Whenever we needed water or bread, we needed to flag down somebody, sometimes making quite a scene.So my suggestion: if you're a beer geek, this is possibly the best place in Chicago to go. Otherwise, there are much better places to go, where you won't have an hour of extra waiting tacked on to your meal. Who knows, maybe we just came on a bad day. I like to hope so.
