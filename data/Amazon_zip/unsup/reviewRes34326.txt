Here you will find cheap eats: Lentil soup, chicken and lamb schwarma, falafel, hummus, great baba gannouj, jerusalem salad, tabbouli and others.Try their lentils and rice mixed with hummus and jerusalem salad, yum. They have a great salad bar with everything from vegetables to garlic soaked kimche and grape leaves. Sultan's has the best salad bar in the Wicker Park area, hands down better than Goddess. The guys that work there a cool, no haggel and are very hard working. The owner is a a bit of a haggler though. She tends to take her time with everything while everyone else is hustling. She also is notorious for overcharging on items. On the same note she will give you a break if you're short changed and tell you to pay next time. The place goes through mad rush periods where they get swamped very quickly. At busy times it may take a while before you order. Get your salad bar and go.
