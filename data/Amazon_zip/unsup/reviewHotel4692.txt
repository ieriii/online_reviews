My husband and I just spent 3 nights at Hotel Felix. We landed a stay here for $110/night via Priceline and were pleasantly surprised. Upon notification from Priceline we did some research on this hotel and most people complained how small the rooms are. In an effort to make sure we had the largest room possible, we called the hotel immediately and requested a room with 2 queens over 1. We also read in other reviews that the staff was quite rude. When we called about the room - the reviewers proved to be accurate. I was asked before I was given an answer where I made my reservation through and basically said I could upgrade if it was available but don't count on it. We arrived early for check-in and were pleasantly surprised by the VERY friendly doorman, and cordial front desk staff. We were told they were sold out - so we didn't end up getting the room upgrade.  When we walked into our room we were quite pleased. Clean-very clean room, yes very small, but the modern decor, comfortable beds, and excellent location soon made you forget about it's size. We would definitely go back, given we find the same deal. I'm not sure we would pay too much more to stay here, but would recommend it if it is in your price range.
