If you want chicago style pizza that's loaded w/tons of cheese, not the place for you...While I"m a fan of pretty much all pizza, this is a delicious unique spot (with TONS of street parking). This pizza is impossible to explain. If you're into a different kind of pizza (lots of ingredients on top, easy on the cheese, the kind you need to cut, etc...) just check it out. I"ve been twice in so many weeks, the arugula proscuitto white pizza is awesome, so is the italian sausage, mushroom and mozzarella one. Food is fresh, wine list is well-priced, cute outdoor patio, great service. The reviews seem all over the board here, but I've been w/2 groups of people and we all loved it.
