Every burger I've had here (3 visits total) has been delicious. This last time I had one with, I think, an onion and fig jam, topped with goat cheese. The chipotle dipping sauce for the fries was delicious. The beer is fair priced, and there are pages and pages of just beers to choose from. They seemed to have a dozen or more Belgian beers, and the Tripel was very good. I've never had bad service here. Twice our server has been the cute blonde girl with the glasses. She is very friendly, and won't wait for your glass to become empty before asking if you want another. All in all, hell yes.
