We went here for a firm dinner on Wednesday and it was met with success. Our waiter was a doll. The bus boys swooped in to refill glasses at the half full/empty point. The champagne margarita was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. So why only 4/5 stars? While the food was good, it doesn't come near to being a favorite meal. We all split an appetizer platter ($8 a person). The guacamole was tasty and for $8 a person to get this platter, they don't give you much. The jicama salad was refreshing. The fried enchiladas and taquitos were both super tasty. For my entree, I had the duck (menu description: Pato en Tlatonile: red chile-rubbed Gunthorp duck breast, cooked over the coals, served with Veracruz-style sauce of arbol and ancho chiles and sesame seeds; garlicky butternut mash, Tracey's Garden salad). This dish was good, but it wasn't near the top of my top 5 duck dishes. I should really do a Yelp list of those. Overall, it was a good experience. There were two British girls in the bathroom when I went and one was talking about needing to vomit and then saying she was okay and while I was leaving said, "Okay, I'm ready to head to the bar." Yeah, this is why I rarely go to places this buzz-worthy! Also, the host looks like he could be Rick Bayless' father?
