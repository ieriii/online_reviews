Cool hip place. Luckily we found seats at the bar because even during the week this place was packed. I was bummed the ipa I wanted to try was out, but there are many others to try if you're a craft beer lover. We had already eaten dinner before, but had heard great things about the popcorn so I caved and had some. So worth the calories- an awesome bar snack. I would like to come back & have dinner.
