word to the wedding-wise - the rooftop at Zed451 offers a perfectly intimate setting for your nuptials. i had the fortune to attend a college friend's wedding here last weekend. it was my first time at Zed451, and i absolutely fell in love with it! they reserved the roof deck for the ceremony - spectacular. (despite the city noises adding a bit of flair to their vows...nothing says forever like a blaring ambulance siren) afterwards, we had the entire upper level to ourselves. harvest table offered a ridiculous bounty. my friends warned us not to fill up because the main event was yet to come. but how could i resist - truffle butter and pretzel bread; nine different varieties of sausage from spain, italy and france; cold salads; hot soups; grilled summer veggies; and the cheese tray... of course i overdid it. and then came the skewers of meat...oh gluttony. from prime rib to lamb chops to chicken to salmon and everything in between. delish!! i don't know how, but we all manged to save room for the dessert spread, more cocktails...and then danced on top of that. what a wonderful wedding!!! and Zed451 helped make it happen.
