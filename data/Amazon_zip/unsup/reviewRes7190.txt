Amazing service and delicious food! My boyfriend and I took advantage of Restaurant Week and it was amazing. We had at least five people who were waiting on us, the owner came by and asked our opinions, and we had a great table. The location is also perfect with it being a block away from the Red Line. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't entirely impressed with their bbq sauces, which is saying something since they give you three different kinds. I would certainly come here again if my budget will allow it.
