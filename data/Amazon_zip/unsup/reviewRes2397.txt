Hot Dougs incredibly creative tasty satisfying hot dogs!! I love the Salma Hayek (Spicy Andouille Sausage) and The Keira Knightly (Fire Dog), Although I can clearly say if I keep eating these I will never look like their namesake's...I was actually lucky enough to only wait 5 minutes the other day (after 2pm weather was horrid) and Doug was as nice and friendly as can be. I am looking forward to trying the Duck Fat Fries- I hear they are mind blowing. I love the feel of this place it is a true Chicago neighborhood kinda joint. Dig the Viagra clock in between the restrooms it is so classic:) So then I started wondering while I waited for "The girls" was the clock a subtle implication for the male clientele?? I dunno the answer to that BUT there are a lotta hotties that come here for lunch....just sayin'.
