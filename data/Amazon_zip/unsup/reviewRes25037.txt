I only had their dessert so I'll just give you the run-down of desserts: Strawberry shortcake: so good~ oh so good. Fresh strawberries (not the overdone marinated in syrup too long strawberries) in each bite. There aren't many places in Chicago where they serve strawberry shortcake- cuz I had a bad craving for months and I looked around! Chocolate Eclaire: rich custard filling... yummm I wanted to taste more of the puff pastry but I got more custard... it's okay the custard was really good. Tiramisu: perfectly rounded dusted with cocoa powder. Only downfall was that it wasn't very moist and I could not taste the rum-ness. But it was good nonetheless. The service was good. Some of their patrons however are annoying! They will bump into you and be loud then yell out loud about how loud they are. So brace yourselves and try to sit near the front if you're looking for more romantic atmosphere.
