Cash is king here. Busy place and parking sucks. Truly authentic Mexican. Carne asada is outstanding. Tried the chuletas, pork chops, in a jalapeno onion tomato sauce tonight. A little hot but delicious. My friends had the burritos. One with cheese one without. I actually think they were bigger than la pasadita on Ashland. They were quickly consumed and left two very happy gringos.
