Following the advice of others I went to try out Le Colonial. I remembered seeing a little spot they had in their SF location on the Foodie Channel. Good stuff. I had the prixe fixe lunch - pho, chicken cari, and ice coffee. the pho was amazing, I havent tasted authentic pho like that since actually being there in HCMC. The chicken was great too, tasted authentic and stuff. the only thing that was bad was their ca phe sua da. it was weak and on the yucky side. i expected a lot more. service was awesome. there were like 50 waitstaff and bus people there or so it seemed. great stuff, would definitely hit that place up again.
