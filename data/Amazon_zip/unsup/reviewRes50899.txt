I like this place. Somehow, it's become an unconscious Thursday night tradition for me and my boyfriend. (Since we both live right by it.) While this place is probably at its best during breakfast/brunch hours, this Wishbone - at least on Thursday nights - has a nice lounge band, cozy atmosphere, and some awesome cocktails. My favorite is the Raccoon BIte - delicious. What I don't like though is their chicken...ANY chicken. Every chicken dish I've gotten here - at least three - the chicken has been tough, rubbery, or includes too many inedible fatty parts. However, just last night I got the Black Bean Cakes finally and they were AWESOME. Especially with the yummy red pepper sauce. Anyway, breakfast has always been good here - consistently. And of course, the corn muffins are a must. Overall, I enjoy this place. Just not the chicken...
