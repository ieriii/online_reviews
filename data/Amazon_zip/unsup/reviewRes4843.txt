What they said. The food is excellent, a monumental menu that makes deciding or limiting yourself quite difficult. Service was very good. I don't see myself coming here to wait in the winter, but sucking back some Alborhinia (sic) staring up at the Tribune tower is quite nice. Great wines by the 1/2 bottle. Very fair portions for a Tapas type menu Pig based cuisines always keep out the vegan/religious whackos. A great place to duck into when an out of towner insists on Michigan Ave shopping. This place can easily hit the five star mark, some of our choices were a bit salty or a bit too acidic, not far off but just kept me from that elusive five star rating. I will be back for sure.
