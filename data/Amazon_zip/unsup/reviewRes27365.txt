Not sure what the big deal is here?? I'll sum up my experience.. 1.) Took 2 hours on a sat night for our pizza,2 hours for our salads and 2 hours and 30 minutes for our over cooked and tiny bowel of pasta-- 2.) I'm not a fan o their thin crust ( their deep dish is good and the only reason w hy I'm giving them 2 stars!) They pretty much just slap a ton of meat on it and ignore putting quality cheese on the pie.. 3.) Service is BAD and they know it!!! Took 2 hours for our salads to even come out and the owner was sitting around socializing, our waitress was mia and flirting with the bar tender-- the people next to us walked out! Said I would have walked out myself but I know our 3 year old would have been heart broken! We got our pizza-- ate quickly and as possible and when we were ready for our check they brought out my over cooked pasta dish!!! Asked the waitress to please take it off because it looked disgusting.. She gave me this look and said she would have to talk with someone else and that if I waited another 35 minutes they could make us a new bowl-- you've got to be kidding-- I insisted that she take it off our bill... not worth your time!!! It's packed to the gills with loud/ drunk depaul students, not a good place for families!
