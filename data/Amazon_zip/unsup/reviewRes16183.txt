There's really no reason to write a review about a place that already has 408 written about it, but the drink I had at the Violet Hour compels me to do so.  I wasn't overly impressed with the scene or the prices or my Cymbeline or my friend's Moscow Mule (it's not a Moscow Mule unless it's in a copper cup. Call it something else). The servers and bouncer were all very friendly, but that's not really 4-star worthy either.  It was this: a friend I was with asked the server for a non-alcoholic drink recommendation and the server was on it immediately. She asked if my friend liked ginger and if there were any fruits she didn't like, and then returned with the most amazing drink I have ever ingested. It tasted like the bartender had invented strawberries and then improved on the design. The strawberry flavor was followed by a brief swirl of pineapple and ended with a snap of ginger. I like to recreate interesting drinks at home, but this one has me absolutely stumped. Really, really amazing stuff.
