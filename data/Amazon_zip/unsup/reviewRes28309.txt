I was a big fan when I first tried Pequod's! The deep dish was delicious - buttery, crispy crust and the filling was tasty. I was there for a work event so the service was on the slower side (probably a little understaffed). I'm looking forward to trying out their lunch special - 7" personal cheese pizza + 1 topping and choice of fountain soda or tap beer. Not a bad deal!
