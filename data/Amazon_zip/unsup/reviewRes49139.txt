hint: don't make a red velvet cupcake if you apparently don't know what it is. it is NOT a white cupcake with lots of red food coloring and splotches of batter that missed being colored. gross.  that being said--the chocolate with vanilla frosting was the best standard flavor. nice, substantial cupcakes and i like the wrappers they bake them in. the vanilla cake is a little dry though.  the seasonal pumpkin cupcake was DIVINE. moist without being gummy/chewy like they sometimes can be. perfect cream cheese frosting. a definite winner.
