I don't drink and I like this place. The food and service were both pretty good. If you want bar food (burgers, wings, etc), this place does that and more. They have a smokey sauce on their wings that was simply amazing enough for Bruno Mars to jump in front of a train for. I think if you go here, you won't be disappointed with the food and the lively ambiance.
