The rabbit ravioli with brown butter foam and brandied cherries was one of the best things I have eaten in my ENTIRE life. The first bite I took elicited an actual, physical reaction and a "holy shit that's good" to come from my mouth. I also loved the little goat cheese tarts with the super thin slices of beets on top--a very good, not too sweet dessert. I would return to Chicago just to eat here again.
