I usually don't write reviews, but please DON'T PLAN AN EVENT AT CARNIVALE.  My fiance and I picked this place for our engagement party and were so excited. We loved the theme/decor/food/etc. First their event planner lost our original menu picks. Then 3 weeks before our event she informed us that we did not have the space we had agreed to. She had booked it for another party. She basically called us liars and said she had never shown us the space. Afterwards the manager failed to return multiple phone calls and would not come out of his office to meet with us (after waiting for a very long time at the restaurant). They did not apologize and then tried to get our entire contract's worth of money after calling us liars and failing to meet the terms of our contract. I have never worked with a business so unprofessional. We promptly took our business to Sushi Samba and could not be happier with their level of professionalism, helpfulness and creativity. They offered an exceptionally large tasting in which the chef created a special gluten-free/dairy-free menu. Everything was delicious!
