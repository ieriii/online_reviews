I celebrated my first birthday in Chicago at Las Tablas after a friend recommended this byob and I had the best time! I still remember the evening very fondly. Their dishes are just delicious (it was my birthday so I made sure I tried every item that came to our table). We had 6 or 7 people and felt a little crowded, but the restaurant was more than accommodating for our large group. I dream of the day when I return to Las Tablas....
