I guess I should qualify this review by stating first that I didn't have to pay a dime for my dining experience here. Which will generally equate to a minimally 4 star experience. Wait, I just remembered that my group only had beer and wine covered, so that was a lie. I did have to plunk down about $10 including tip for each of a couple of caphirinas. Sorry for lying. Since we started off on the wrong foot, I'll try to keep this short and sweet, which is no small feat for me. The good: - The band was great...I really enjoyed the trumpet player, being that I dilly dally with that particular horn on occasion. He was great (and a nice guy, we chatted), as was the rest of the band. - The decor is colorful and lively, with no shortage of beautiful women adorning the walls. I don't mind that. - The skirt steak was damn tasty...I believe it's called Arrachera on the menu...could have been a a teeny bit more tender, but I loved the flavors, especially the sweet red onion and chimichurri sauce. The bad: - I could have eaten two of the steaks.But this is also good, because the flavor made me want more. I think we had a small salad, the steak, and desert (it was a choose from three entrees and here's your other two dishes type of thing...fairly large group). I ended up filling up on (free) beer, which I was okay with. Really not much else bad to say about this place. I had a great time, and would absolutely hit it up again if in the neighborhood. Definitely a perfect date spot for drinks, dinner and dancing, all under one roof. And that, my friends, completes the 200th review of Carnivale. From a California boy by way of Austin. Vaya con dios!
