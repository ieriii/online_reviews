Go here before 7pm to avoid a crazy wait time. Once you sit down start with the chicken wings...they are full of flavor and juicy. I have the say that the burgers are probably the best thing I've had there aside from the beers. If you have room after your meal and all the beer try dessert. The chocolate cake with porter ice cream is tasty.
