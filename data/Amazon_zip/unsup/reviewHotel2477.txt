This is an event posting didn't actually stay at Hotel. I had the best time at the hotel when Bitbull was performing live at the NYE 2010. The minute I walked into this place the lobby is nice. I saw all these beautiful people this was the place to be NYE this year. The playboy bunnies were there I talked to two of them nice girls. The had live gambling for a charity at the hotel in the basement. The International ballroom had over 3,000 people in it and I was one of them. This was a paid event. I would say if I paid for the ticket I wouldn't have been so excited to be there. Bitbull came on at the last minute after NYE right when I couldn't hold it in anymore (pee pee alert). I was in the front row the jump-smokers are great ! Took some video of them dancing on stage. The drinkers were unlimited and so was the food. The food was not that great mostly pasta and pizza. I would say the bartenders were doing a great job keeping up with the orders even though the line was a mile long. The confetti drop was nice but they could have spent a little more money and had ballons too. What was nice is that my boyfriend and I found his friends after an hour of searching in the crowd. We were begining to think that we wouldn't be able to find them but finally we did! Amazing night !
