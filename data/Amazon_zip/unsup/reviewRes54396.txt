I'm surprised this doesn't have five stars! It's the best pan pizza in the city! More dough, less sauce than most others, but that's why I like it. The carmelized crust makes it the most unique in the city. Start with the jalapeno poppers. Finish with pan pepperoni. And you'll go home a VERY happy person!
