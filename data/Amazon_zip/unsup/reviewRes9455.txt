I want to give this 4 stars but at the end of the day it is a noodle place, and a pricey one at that. I will say however that this place has very, very good food, just pricey for upscale noodles. This place is great for a group that likes to share or a date spot, very romantic decor inside and the upstairs tables are very "couple friendly" Portions a pretty good size and everything has great flavor. I don't remember the Vietnamese pronunciations so I'll just explain what we ate. We had a egg noodle dish with scallops, calamari, vegetables, and shrimp. A chicken plate with mango, eggplants and yellow curry, and an angel hair pasta w/ BBQ pork Everything was great and the service was really good and attentive. My only gripe again are the prices. I understand you're on Rush street but come on! Go here if you have a groupon, or really trying to impress a girl. Places like Urban Belly provide similar food in a less of an upscale scene for half the price and double the flavor.
