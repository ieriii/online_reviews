Outstanding service, fine authentic cuisine, and strong margaritas. What else could you ask for? The food in of itself makes Mayan Palace a good good day, but the service really puts it over the top. A pitcher of margaritas will knock even 2 of the most seasoned drinkers on their behinds. Everything I have had here has exceeded my expectations but the carne asada really stands out. Real nice sheltered back patio in the summer time.
