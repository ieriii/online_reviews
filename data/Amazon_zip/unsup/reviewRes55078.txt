Gilt Bar is the perfect place for a group or date. The decor is fabulous and the fun happy crowd just adds to the overall atmosphere.Food was excellent. Their red house wine was cheap and tasty. My table tried numerous things on their menu. All of it was good but my favorites were the corn bread, paris mushroom & truffle pasta, and chocolate cream pie. I definitely plan to go back!
