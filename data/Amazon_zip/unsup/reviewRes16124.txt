Every time I go to Calo I have a wonderful experience. The staff is very friendly and knows their menu. The owner and manager are very gracias and make us all feel like we are family. And the ambiance is nice. The food is out of this world. I highly recommend the grilled seafood platter, with its grilled octopus, shrimp, calamari, and scallops over sauteed spinich. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. It is all delicious.  I definitely recommend dinning at Calo.
