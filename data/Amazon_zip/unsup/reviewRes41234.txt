Great find- super cheap and byob, I found the food above average and will be going back very soon! I love restaurants like this that are off the beaten path! I am writing this to let everyone know you MUST go only if you have a reservation. I went on a Friday and they turned several people away (we got lucky and actually got a table as one of the reservations did not show).. but if you are making the treck you may be disappointed if you don't have one! So just a heads up! Enjoy - BTW- the lamb was amazing!!
