Went to Glenn's to celebrate my birthday with a few friends last week and it was great! The place was nice and non-pretentious, and the food was amazing! I ordered the king crab legs and almost fell off my chair when i saw the waitress aproach me with the huge plate of crab legs. My friends enjoyed the all-you-can-eat shrimp, some fresh fish and a boatload of apetizers. One of my faves was the clam chowder. It was magnificent! Creamy goodness w/ big chunks of clams and bacon....mmm! Oh and their peanut butter pie is the JAM!!! I have nothing but good things to say about this place. It was indeed a very happy birthday!!
