Piccolo, piccolo...I've been singing your praises for a long time...but you've let the media attention go to your head and your food quality has suffered (I'm left with no choice but to take away a star). Your four cheese ravioli didn't delight me like it did last year. Your grilled calamari and mushroom pizza were good, but not amazing, and the gnocchi was just average. The only star of the night was a pasta and meat dish that my sister's bf ordered (I couldn't remember the name of it and it is not on their online menu). The hazelnut chocolate cake was good, but the cheesecake not so good. The wine list is one of the most extensive ones I've seen and we had two bottles of a really good Pinot. We had to wait about half an hour for our table for 6, even though I had made reservations 2 months ago. I had been saving Piccolo for a special occasion (my birthday) and I hope my guests enjoyed it because I was quietly a little bit disappointed. Service was professional as usual, however, we had to flag down and ask many staff members to do something about our dying heat lamp, but alas, nothing could be done and we spent most of dinner shivering outside on their beautiful patio on a cool September night. I still love you my "little" Piccolo and I may give you another chance to make it up to me.
