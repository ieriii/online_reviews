I am a concierge at a downtown hotel and needed a quick place to bring three guests for lunch. I worked with the manager Kelly here and our experience was fantastic! We were immediate seated and our waiter was great. All were impressed with their lunch special prices, and portions. The cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory was great. Will definitely bring future clients here again, and recommend to hotel guests.
