Man, there's always a wait outside! But it's deceiving, it goes a lot quicker than you'd think! This place is pretty big, so the tables turnover pretty quickly. The front is a little chaotic with the host running back and forth busily seating customers, and customers paying their bills at the front cashier, but it's more normal-paced once you're sitting. The servers are quick, friendly, and nice. Not overly attentive b/c they're super busy - but it's not a problem at all. The fresh-squeezed juice is great! The skillets and omelettes all are a good sized meal. I've tried the countryside skillet (in my opinion, there are too many mushrooms in this dish that takes away from everything else, so next time I'll order without) and the El Torero Scrambler (personally I like Meli's spicy flamenco omelette better). The cinnamon roll french toast is like DESSERT - delicious! My brother says the "healthy waffles" or something like that are really good too - but I have yet to try those...everything else on the big menu is much more tempting to me! Great breakfast/brunch place. I'm going again! Check it out!
