The first time we went to Anteprima it was on a cold winter night, we were seated by the window and it felt romantic, like we were in a special place. The service was great and the food and wine were perfect. Last night we decided to go again for a celebration. First the service was odd, the server didn't explain any of the specials and made strange faces when we would ask questions. We ordered a calamari app that was completely inedible, it was almost like they poured salt on it to mask the fact that it was not fresh. We had to send it back. The server questioned our tastes by saying "do you want something that's not so strong", I had to remind her that it was inedible, over salted. The next app was just OK and the entrees were pretty flavorless and had the over salted technique again. The high point was the wine that was suggested. I'm not sure we will be going back...
