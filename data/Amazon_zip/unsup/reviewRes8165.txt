Just okay- we had a reservation on a Saturday evening and still waited an hour. The drinks were a little pricy and the salad bar was just okay. The meat was all very good, I tried a little bit of everything they had to offer.  The decor was not impressing, especially for the pirice. It seems like they have tried to fit in as any tables as possible, I felt like we were sitting on top of the other guest sitting near us. I am happy that I tried it, but probably will not go back.
