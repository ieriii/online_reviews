I love Thai food! I crave it like a fat kid craves for ice cream! But on this particular visit at Opart Thai, my heart just couldn't commit.My boyfriend and I ordered the Tiger Cry appetizer and he loved it. I thought it was too salty, so we asked the waitress for white rice to neutralize the taste. The white rice never came, and by the time the waitress came around again, my boyfriend had already inhaled the rest of the food. We also had the wonton soup, which we both thought was too salty, but who orders wonton soup at a Thai restaurant anyway? Finally, we decided to share an order of basil chicken. I love that they use ground chicken by the way. However we asked for medium spicy and I believe we got extra extra spicy instead. My tongue was numb by the end of dinner.Overall, I thought the place was okay. I'd definitely give it another chance. It's cheap, quick and did I mention byob?
