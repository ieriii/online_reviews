Stayed here for a brief Christmas get-away with my son and was very pleasantly surprised. #1 is the staff. From the doorman, to bellman, to desk clerk-- each and every one was above and beyond in courtesy and professionalism. I've stayed at many five star hotels and this staff is second to none. The hotel itself is cute on the inside. I was initially concerned because it's right on the el tracks, but once inside, didn't notice the sound unless I was specifically listening for it. The room was lovely. We had a suite with a king bedroom. The bathroom is enormous. Everything looked new and clean. (FYI, the suite has a double door between the living area and sleeping area, but the wall doesn't go all the way to the ceiling. I think it's to help air circulation. Since my son was on the sofa bed, this was a bit of a concern, but the sound was still muted between the two areas, so you can watch tv without disturbing little ones with early bed times.) There was a mini fridge in the room. The lobby is lovely, but the bar is in the diner restaurant on the first level. I inquired and the desk clerk told me it's fine to bring cocktails from the restaurant to the lobby. I'd recommend that. The restaurant serves comfort food. Nothing outstanding. Location is excellent. Walking distance to everything. A terrific value. We'll go there again.
