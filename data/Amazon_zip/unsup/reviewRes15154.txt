Drinks not a mixture here, they are recipes. And whether you're at the bar watching the drinks get made of in one of the seating areas, you're going to enjoy the scene. Everything from the unmarked entrance to the house rules to the ambiance make this a really fun place to head to with a small group of friends (too big and you'll be waiting forever) or a date night.  Working with a humble budget, I cannot get there every weekend but when I am looking to go a little big and change things up from the usual, Violet Hour is well worth the money and the wait!
