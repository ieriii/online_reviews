So I am a bit apprehensive to write this review because this place is tiny, and the deals are so good that I predict soon it is gonna explode and I wont be able to get near the entrance....but it is so good It cannot go unrecognized so here goes. I wandered in one night with a couple friends thinking we would grab a slice and go. What we found was chalkboard after chalkboard of some of the most unique pizza combinations ever, over 60 apparently. Then upon further examination we realized that all of the possibilities weren't even covered on the boards, but only on the printed menu. Much to our delight they were more than happy to do half and half pizzas so on our two pizzas we were able to try 4 different varieties. Since then I have tried a couple others and each was unique and delicious in its own right. The crust is perfectly crispy, thanks to the massive brick oven, yet thick enough to be chewy as well. All of the ingredients are fresh and abundant. We also tried these potato croquettes stuffed with pulled chicken that were borderline life changing, and should be included in any order. I could go on and on about this place but I think you should take my advice and try it for yourself, you wont regret it.
