Grand Lux has a great menu that continues to impress me. I've been visiting for over four years and have yet to try something I don't like. From appetizers to desserts, you're sure to enjoy the food. The ambiance is classy, but feel free to walk in after a day of shopping in jeans and a tee and enjoy the view from windows overlooking Chicago.
