I love this place. I went there for my 3 year anniversary (but I had been there before and was not disappointed) last Saturday night and everything was wonderful. The waitress Paula was very helpful in helping us decide on what to eat. We ate the baked clams, I had the shrimp w/vermicelli noodles in a Alio sauce(forgot the name), and my husband had the Filet Mignon in a lemon sauce(or juice not sure), and our drinks were perfect. I even had a drink customized and it came out perfect. Everything was excellant. Yes the decor seems outdated, as I've seen in previous posts, but don't you think thats what it supposed to look like that since its a old school Italian restaurant. If it were updated and modern then the look would not be any different from other new italian restaurants. Everything was professional and precise. I will be coming back again especially since its 5 minutes away from my house and the best part is the kitchen closes at 1230am on Saturdays (which by then is Sunday) and the bar closes at 2am.  Thank You Sabatinos
