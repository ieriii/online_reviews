If I could give this place 3 1/2 stars, i would. The food was good, not amazing, but good and I support the organic market. One downside was the price. Now, I was prepared to pay more for organic but $70 for breakfast for four is a little outrageous. The other downside was the portion size, at least for kids. I ordered the kids pancakes. I got sucked in by the animal-shape and fresh fruit. Maybe I overlooked it on the menu but I was disappointed when the waitress arrived with one pancake per kid. Not sure if my kids are unusual but they can easily eat an adult size stack and they are ages 6 and 4. So after spending $5 or $6 on each inadequate meal for my kids, I had to order them an additional adult size stack of buttermilk pancakes, which was at least another $10, i think.  I had the huevos rancheros. Good but if I go back, i wouldn't order it again. Can't remember what my dad had but he liked it. Anyway, nice looking spot. Clean, modern-rustic. Upscale casual. Service was friendly (but i would have appreciated a heads-up about the portion sizes).
