I come to Chicago for work frequently and typically stay at the McCormick Place Hyatt but they were all booked up for my travel date. I got a reasonably priced room at this location and was quite pleased. Pros: Extremely helpful, attentive, and friendly staff Excellent room service Clean room Comfortable bed Beautifully designed and appointed bathrooms Cons: This hotel is like a labyrinth in terms of layout where the front desk is on the second floor. The room I was put in is smaller than any of the other ones I've stayed in at the McCormick Place location. I'm not a fan of their toiletry products -- I wish they would upgrade them to a more luxurious brand, and while this isn't exactly a dealbreaker, it would increase my love of the Hyatt brand if they stepped it up a bit in this department. I was in the West Tower and had a bizarre view of an office building -- I could see in to their offices and they could see in to my room! But actually, it was fairly interesting...it must be some kind of advertising or creative media floor because it was quite good people watching and there were all manner of visual oddities to ponder (for example, a giant stuffed winnie-the-pooh bear in the middle of one of their hallways that stayed put my whole visit).
