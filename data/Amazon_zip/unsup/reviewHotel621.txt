Stayed here 4 nights during my first time visiting Chicago. Couldn't be more impressed: 1. Service: Every Doubletree employee was SO nice and helpful. They helped with directions, always had a pleasant demeanor, and let us check our luggage into a room since our checkout was in the afternoon and our flight was during the evening.  2. Beds- These beds are INCREDIBLE. I must admit that although I was excited to be exploring Chicago for the first time, there were moments that I thought about how excited I was to get back to the hotel so I can curl up in the bed. Yes, they were THAT amazing. 3. Location- the location is perfect. it's right in the middle of shopping & dining, and public transportation...we had no problems getting around and catching buses within a block from us. 4. The smell-I have no idea what scent Doubletree uses but I want to buy it in a bottle and febreze my closet, sheets, and apartment in this scent!!! The entire hotel smells sooooo gooood. Thank you, Doubletree Magnificent Mile.
