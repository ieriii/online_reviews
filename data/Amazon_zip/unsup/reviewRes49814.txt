We went to Bin 36 last weekend and found that it was very good in some ways and not so good in others. Possibly the most annoying thing was that the waiter, while attentive, was constantly trying to upsell us. I *hate* upselling--if I wanted a salad with that, I'd order a salad with that, no prodding needed, thank you. He actually seemed annoyed that we restricted ourselves to one cheese flight, instead of getting additional appetizers. The other thing I didn't like was the hugeness and noisiness of the dining room. It really is a lot like eating in the Ikea cafeteria. That said, the food was excellent. The aforementioned Italian cheese flight was delicious and interesting (although the servings were tiny), and we really enjoyed tasting the 2 wine flights and comparing the wines to one another. It's amazing the differences and complexities you notice when you have them side-by-side to compare. I had some kind of enormous pork sandwich which was so good, I ate the whole thing, and we shared a delicious orange-infused creme brulee for dessert. Altogether, our meal (1 cheese flight, 2 wine flights, 2 sandwiches, 1 dessert and 1 additional glass of vino) was about $100 after tax and tip.  The high-ish cost of a pretty basic meal made the upselling all the more annoying.
