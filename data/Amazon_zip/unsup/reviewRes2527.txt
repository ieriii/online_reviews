Wow! We visited Chicago this weekend and traveled by taxi and freezing wind to Avondale to visit Hot Doug's as seen on Yelp. We were NOT disappointed! Food Network was there filming for an upcoming show and I guess the line was not as long as it normally is so we were lucky.  I had the Portobella Mushroom Sausage with Brie cheese. Two others had the Game of the Week and the fourth guest in our party had the traditional hot dog. We also had an order of cheese friends WOW! Outstanding flavors and we received our food quickly. Doug was friendly and it's easy to see why locals and visitors come far and wide to visit Hot Doug's!
