Go for the beers! The beer was great but the food was pretty average. It was nothing you couldn't get from Leona's or any other fake Italian restaurant or decent sports bar. The atmosphere is really nice, though. The wait staff was thorough and attentive. I'd go back for drinks any time but I'd probably stop for a bite beforehand.
