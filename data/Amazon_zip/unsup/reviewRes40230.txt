This is the place to go for Korean BBQ in Chicago. Their kalbi is fantastic. Well marinated, tender and delicious. This is the place where I take folks to experience Korean BBQ. I love their large assortment of side dishes (aka ban chan). I still enjoy watching the faces of newbies when the huge tray of side dishes arrive at the table. The spicy miso tofu soup that comes with the BBQ arrives boiling on a stone pot. Another great compliment to the meat.
