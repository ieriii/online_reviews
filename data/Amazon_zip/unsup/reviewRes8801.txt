I went to Spacca Napoli with the Windy City Pizza Club and had a pretty good time. It is pretty far off the beaten path so there isn't a whole lot on the block nor did it seem that close to public transit but parking couldn't have been easier. We were able to wet our appetites with a tasty complimentary owner's creation although it reminded me of naan bread more than pizza. I enjoyed it although it really did not remind me of what I think of as pizza. It was a delightful surprise. I then enjoyed a margarita pizza which had some of the best cheese I had in a while. Otherwise, there was nothing particularly memorable about it.  This would be a great restaurant for a date but given its remote location and quiet atmosphere, I probably wouldn't go back with a large group or for a big night out.
