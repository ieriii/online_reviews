My boyfriend and I went to chicago for a Packers game and stayed at The Silversmith Hotel (thanks to name your own price and william shatner). The concierge, though a tad intense, got us reservations at the Gage. We were impressed. The dining room was intimate yet still had the city appeal with a visible and busy, yet cohesive, kitchen. For an appetizer, we had this fondue that was to die for. I had the roasted Amish chicken which at the time came with Cous cous and kale. He had the fish and chips and remarked that it was by far the best he'd ever had. For dessert, we had a poached pear stuffed with chocolate mousse. OMG. So good. Drinks were fairly outrageously priced, but that's my only complaint. Service was impeccable and we would definitely return!
