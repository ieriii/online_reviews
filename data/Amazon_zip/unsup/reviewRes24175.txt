Going in I wasn't really sure if I liked Greek food but this place has got things down to a science. The restaurant was packed for a weekday, we were there before a Bulls game and I imagine many people were as well. Since we had a game to go to we were in a little bit of a hurry, but everything was real prompt. The waiter reminded me of the greek grandfather from Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (uh... yeah, I've seen it). He answered all out questions and didn't seem to mind that I butchered every attempt to pronounce something. The food came out quick, the flaming cheese dealy was good, as was the chicken rice soup. My dinner was shrimp with feta cheese and spinach and it was great. The value for your money is pretty good. Bonus points for free valet parking. This would be an ideal spot to take people from out of town that want a touristy "ethnic" Chicago experience that still feels authentic.
