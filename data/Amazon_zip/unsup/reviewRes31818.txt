4.5 Stars If you have family/friends in town or just want something different try this place out. Eat a traditional plate and share it all.                             Food was delicious, reasonably priced and fun! Ethiopian cuisine is interactive and delicious. Service and Atmosphere are great. Hidden gem-would definitely go back!
