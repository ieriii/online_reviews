I LOVE Coast! My husband and I have regular date nights at Coast, and I'm never disappointed. The service is consistently great, the sushi is consistently great, the atmosphere is good (maybe a little loud though, since they thend to stay packed), and we can bring in a bottle of wine. Perfect!My faves on the menu: the hamachi carpaccio, sashimi platters, spicy miso, and spicy creamy. Everything I've had there is really, really good though.
