After 130 reviews I believe yelp has gotten the point across that this is the best restaurant in Chicago. Not only in Chicago, but a pinnacle for modern cooking. I do not feel the need to explain the greatness of this establishment because so many already have. I will just say that Alinea is one of the top dining experiences in my life and any diner would appreciate the art and the passion bleeding from this restaurant. I believe eating here is like watching Picasso paint or Mozart play. In years to come Chef Grant Achatz will be as important as Auguste Escoffier was to haute cuisine as Grant is to modern cooking.
