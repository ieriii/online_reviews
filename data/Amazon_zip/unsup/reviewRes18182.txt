Whenever we are in Chicago, we always stop here for dinner. The food is amazing- Mexican street food at its best, and well worth the line (usually 30min or so on a super busy night). This is the casual Rick Bayless dining option.  Here's how it works: wait in line (order a beer while you are waiting), place your order, pay, get a table, and they bring your food to you. The seating can be a little tight, but that's part of the new Chicago dining scene, right? Simplified, your choices are sandwiches in broth, sandwiches (think warm, crusty sub sandwich), and meals in bowls.  The hot chocolate and churros are amazing and make a great carry-out dessert.
