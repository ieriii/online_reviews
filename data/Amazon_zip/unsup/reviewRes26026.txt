I stayed in the Blackstone hotel for a wedding and had been urged by the bride-to-be to try the Mercat during my stay. I'm so glad I did.  My husband and I went for lunch. The menu has options to order anything a la carte. You can also select the "Catalan express" where you get a beverage, 1 item from the first course offerings and 1 item from the second course offerings. We decided to splurge and chose the chef's Tapas selections. Basically, for $35/person the chef selects 3 items from each area of the menu. We had a total of 9 dishes and were in love with each one. Every dish was incredibly flavorful and filled with surprises for your palate. By the 8th and 9th tapas dish, we were both so stuffed and could not finish it all. I highly recommend this restaurant.
