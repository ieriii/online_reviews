WORST SERVICE EVER!It took forever to have our order taken. There were three tables seated and two waitress so I'm not sure what the hold-up was. Took forever to get our food. The food was good so I was ready to overlook the service. It just got worse from there. Our waitress disappeared and never returned. After waiting for almost 20 minutes with dirty plates in front of us, I asked another waitress for water, to-go boxes and coffee. They had to make more coffee which took 15 minutes. I had to keep flagging the other waitress and owner down. We ordered the white chocolate cream and berries. What we got was one strawberry, pears, oranges, and mangoes. Those fruits do not go well with chocolate, but of course no one was around to complain to. I asked for the check and 15 minutes later I had to go and find the owner to get the bill. He then had the nerve to request the tip be put on the bill for me. He could of at least offered the dessert or coffees for free, but instead became angry when I refused to include his tip on the bill. What a shame! Never will go to this place again. Outrageous prices for poor service! I am more than willing to pay well for service, but this was awful!
