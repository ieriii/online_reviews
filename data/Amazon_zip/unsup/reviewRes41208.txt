Every course was absolutely well thought out and delicious. Favorites included the amuse bouche (pumpernickle covered mascarpone ball that just melted and collapsed in your mouth), smoky spare rib confit that came in a box, lobster sous vide in duck fat, deconstructed stroganoff, and scallop smores.  I am usually not a fan of tasting menus, as I feel that some menus are too crazy with weird combinations that look good on paper yet are not tasty. However, every dish on this menu was interesting as well as delicious. This place is BYOB, which is awesome since you can save $30-$40 easily by bringing your own wine.  After the meal, I was satisfied but not stuffed. I completely recommend Bonsoiree to others. I will definitely be coming back again!
