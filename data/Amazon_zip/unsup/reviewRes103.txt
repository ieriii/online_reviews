Comparing an Alinea experience to any other meal is dangerous. As such, I'm not going to call what I had at Alinea "a meal." Rather, what I had was a tour of culinary technique, paced over several hours, administered by unflappably polite and knowledgeable staff, in a refined and comfortable setting. This tour was one of the most memorable things I've ever done. The quality of what was served and how it was served left clearer imprints on my mind than any other food I've ever eaten. This was due to the fact that each of the eighteen courses was willfully prepared and stunningly arranged. The entirety of the staff endeavored towards a single end for every morsel of food prepared. And the result of that unified clarity of purpose resulted in clarity of flavor, clarity of texture, and clarity of presentation. Years from now, when I look back on this experience, the footprints left in my mind will be as deep and defined as they are now. Such is the result of the care and genius that the staff of Alinea demonstrates. I thank them a thousand times over for it, and strongly encourage all those who can to experience it themselves.
