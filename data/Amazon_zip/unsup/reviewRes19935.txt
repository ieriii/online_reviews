Came with my older sister on Tuesday Night. Checked in around 7:30PM. Waited 30 minutes. Pros - Agua de Fresca - Papaya is excellent (Limonada is also good) - TOrtas - The Mushroom one is very good (I'm a big fan of anything with goat cheese) - Churros were very nice. - Service is nice. They ask you when you want your dessert and bring it right on time, fresh too. Cons - the restaurant is on the smaller side, so being very popular, the size exacerbates the wait. - we sat inside. so it was loud. - the Pulled Ribs torta was a bit on salty side. Tips - If there is no line, go for the carry-out. There seems to always be a shorter wait with the carry out - Since there is always a wait, if you don't want to wait I would call and ask when it's non-busy or less busy hours typically are - Wasn't sure about tipping... gotta ask about that next time.
