A month or so after this place opened we decided one night to give it a try. It was about 9:50PM so they would stop seating at 10PM. We were told it was too late for us to be seated. I thought that was ridiculous especially for a newly opened place. I am now glad we were denied being seated because it looks like this place isn't very good anyways. Thanks
