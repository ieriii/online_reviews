I've tried both the chef's tasting menu and ordering a la carte. Food is good - flavorful and beautifully presented. No complaints about that.  However, the portion is smaller than other tapas places and the price more expensive. While I was happy with the food, I still felt that it was grossly overpriced. The whole point of eating tapas is sampling many small dishes - but the a la carte prices are prohibitively high. You'd have to break the bank to have a true tapas experience.  To add insult to injury, the service was not very good. My waiter in my most recent visit was forgetful and a bit rude when talking to us. He would have been better suited for places like TGI Friday.  Seriously, so many of these trendy high-end places will do so much better in service if they fire their waiters and promote their busboys to be waiters - they are so much more attentive. Just sayin.  For now, I'd still go to Cafe Iberico or Avec.
