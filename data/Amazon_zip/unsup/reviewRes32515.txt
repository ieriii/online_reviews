I went here with a group of 9 people and we had a great time! I've only eaten Ethiopian a couple of times so I'm no expert, but I thought the food was great. With such a large group, we got a little bit of everything and shared. The Ye-Siga Wat was my favorite. Everyone in the group thought the injera was fabulous. The service was good for such a large group of people and given the fact that the place was packed the entire time we were there. I will definitely be going back soon!
