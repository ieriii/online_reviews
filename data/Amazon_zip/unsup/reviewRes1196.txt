Simply delightful, and yes, I think it might just live up to the hype. Not just "going for a dog," this is more of an experience. I mean, geez, word gets around, the line was to the door practically 35 minutes before they were closing. For good reason, they got some good meats up in here! I love the primary colors dominating the decor, so appropriate in a hot dog place...ahem, excuse me, THE home of encased meats.  I loved the friendly cashier: He asked "Do you want your dog grilled or steamed?" My response, "uh, I don't know, whatever" To which he replied, "That is not the right thing to say, you need to ask me which is better." I did, and he gave it to me. Oh yes, he gave it to me: one hot dog, a polish, and a Tuben. Mmmm, and an order of duck fat fries. Very tasty. Crispy, salty and just enough different to make you wonder, "What's different about these fries?" (These are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, however.) There were so many choices of creative-sounding sausages, but the Tuben was the choice for me. I'm a sucka for all things kraut and cheesy. It delivered, that's for sure. Free refills on pop, and we were in encased meat heaven. Next time you want it, head over to Hot Dougs...trust me, they will give it to you.
