The ambience at Wilde is warm and open. I had dinner with two other people here about a week ago. We had hot wings appetizer, fish and chips, mac and cheese, and some beers. None of the food was that amazing (I am still on my quest to find the best mac and cheese! So far Schubas is winning...), but the service was good and the cost was average for this type of place in the area. The open front of the restaurant is cool.
