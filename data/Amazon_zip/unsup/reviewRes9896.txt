I don't know what was more dazzling- sitting in the outdoor garden in Chicago in the middle of March or Jay Cutler and Kristen Cavaliari slinking their way to a corner table?!?!?!? A gentle sized group of us ended up here for dinner. And like a three star rating on here- it was A-OK! We all started with salads...I had the beet and it was good, not outstanding. Kind of your average beet salad. For my entree I had the Short Rib at the recommendation of the server. He suggested it over the pork shank because the shank was really big...I'm not sure how that's a negative?!? Maybe because we were a group of ladies he thought it an unladylike dish? It was decent as far as short ribs go but again not outstanding- I was kind of wishing I had the Flintstone pork shank. Service was efficient. Most of the Ricotta cake was still left on it's plate at the end of the meal, but the chocolate lava cake thing almost instantly disappeared....
