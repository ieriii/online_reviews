I get Indie delivery a lot, living in Rogers Park. It's fine thai fare. The free appetizer when you spend $20 is a nice bonus. I wouldn't say it's my favorite, and the thai dishes lack a little of the flavor potency of others...but it's great for easy thai delivery. Entrees reheat well, Golden Triangle fried tofu appetizer...not so much.
