I don't care how "authentic" or "traditional" Fogo is or isn't. Bottom line: they serve an endless amount of mouthwatering meats. Yeah, the salad bar is good too but that's not what I'm here for! They get four stars, not five from me because I'm a little annoyed by the wait. I can appreciate the fact that they're busy on the weekends but I don't understand why, when we call in a reservation, we still have to wait 45 minutes to be seated. It also seems there is always someone around ready to help, that is, until it's time for the check. They stall, I think, hoping that you'll order more food/drinks. Bad strategy. Past the 15 min mark, your tip is getting smaller and smaller.
