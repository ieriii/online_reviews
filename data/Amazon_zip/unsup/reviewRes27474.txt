Big fat MEH. I might come back next time and order more non-vegetarian things. The only thing I remember was the jicama salad, which was just okay. Everything else was just small plates of whatever food, plated fancily. I'm really sorry, but the food doesn't compare to any Mexican restaurants in California. Hmm, our waiter at The Girl and the Goat (which is an EXCELLENT place to eat) told us to try XOCO, so I'll probably do that next time instead of coming back here. I really want to like a Rick Bayless restaurant.
