I really like the concept of a steakhouse and a lounge together. One half of the place is a steakhouse and the other half is a lounge. the FROMAGE and CHARCUTERIE BOARD there is very good. Have a decent collection of alcohol and the serving staff is very patient. For the ones with the artistic touch the steakhouse uses drift woods as tables. Eclectic Choice!!!
