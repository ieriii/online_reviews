I love love LOVE LOVE LOVE this place the food is absolutely amazing! I went there for my birthday dinner with 16 friends. YES SIXTEEN!!! Not only was the restaurant extremely accommodating but they worked out a fabulous p-fix pricing structure for us-- with a tasting of almost everything on the menu (that was even structured to fit the picky vegans in the crowd) and was so easy on the wallet. We ended up having pre-drinks AND 5-6 bottles of their Honey Wine on the table with a total of $30 for meat eaters and $20 for vegans (tip included!)...... I must say----AWESOMENESS!!!! Please go here. IF you think that Ethiopians only eat cockroaches and muddy water you are mistaken. Their cuisine is delicious and this place does it justice.. you be will return again and again.. i promise you.
