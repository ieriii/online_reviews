This was a great find. Good beer on tap made in house. The food was amazing try the pork chop best sauce I have ever eating in my life. The pretzel with sauce is good as well. Lets just say this place can make a mean sauce. The mix drinks were tasty. Friendly service. We spent a lot of money I mean alot so they gave us free desert that is how a restaurant should be run. I tried almost everything on the menu in one visit and the food is all really great best place I have
