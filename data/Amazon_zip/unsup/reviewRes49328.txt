Was in Chicago for Memorial Day weekend. Am a big fan of small plates, and decided to give Bin 36 a try. After looking at their website, I was looking forward to the experience. Sad to say, it was a disappointment. They have a page of cheeses, served by portion or as a flight of 4 - turns out the flight is a category of cheese, and you can't mix and match. Who wants to eat only 4 blue cheeses?? I am sure there is someone who does. On their website, they talked about a charcuterie plate, which was not on the menu at the restaurant. We ordered drinks, and decided to get the pork rillette while figuring what to order. What arrived was a dish of solid lard with shredded pork underneath, served with cold grilled bread....very unappetizing. Paid and left. Won't be back.
