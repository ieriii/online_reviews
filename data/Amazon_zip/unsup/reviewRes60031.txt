Since I'm Cajun, it was a real pleasure to discover Big Jones. It's what some would call Bonafide. I have not had such a true and satisfactory gumbo since I left Lafayette, my previous attempts at Heaven on Seven leaving me feel like my kind has been turned into a Disney attraction for tourists. They also make delicious cornbread like you won't find anywhere outside of the deep south, with white cornmeal and only the natural sweetness of good cornmeal and no sugar. Their beignets are not the same as you would get at one of the tourist spots in the French Quarter, but I thought they were spot on and a great start to our brunch. By the way, if you've never had a bowl of gumbo and a sazerac first thing in the morning on a hangover, you have not lived, my friend.
