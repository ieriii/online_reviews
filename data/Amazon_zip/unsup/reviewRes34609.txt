FYI it's byob... Would definitely have gone to sam's to pick something up if we had known. Otherwise good food that's cooked really well. We particularly loved the pancakes, potatoes and omlettes they made to our order. French toast combo was good but nothing special, but the southwest fajita omlette was delicious- very spicy if you add jalapenos. The wait was long and the service is a bit slow (so much so that I had time to yelp about them while waiting for the check) so we're not sure we'll visit again super soon.
