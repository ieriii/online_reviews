This place is fantastic. I had the guac and the pork chop which was huge followed by some awesome chocolate dessert of some sort. Excellent wait staff, cool setup with the open second level, and great food. Only downfall is that I think that it's a little too over priced. Really busy on the Friday night we went so better make a reservation or you're screwed. Lucky we had one, they were telling the people who were walk-ins it would be a 2 hour wait.
