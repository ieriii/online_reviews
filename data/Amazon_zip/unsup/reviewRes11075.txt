Its damn good beer.  The pizza is pretty solid too. Fiance had a bloody mary to fix her hangover. It was alright, but I would have expected a little more out of the bloody mary (since so many places have amazing bloodys on Sunday). I had the amarillo hoppy beer. It was nice and hoppy, good flavor We shared a white pizza with bacon and clams. It was really good, but a little greasy (not sure if it was greasy because of the bacon or if their standard white pizza is usually greasy. I'll be back to this place when I want a good pizza that is not deep dish.
