OK went back the next day as I was driving by at lunchtime and had the steak torta instead of the chicken like I had yesterday.  What? Aguacate costs extra on a torta? Today charged 50 more for 2nd helping of pico de gallo and not yesterday? OK I'm a cheap bastard and expect these items to be included at any Mexican place as I'm spoiled by other places that don't charge and I'm feeding a meter on top of it.  1 less star.  Although the 2.50 margaritas on Tues. sounds tempting (if it were Tues) I'm now back in search of a local mexican place to keep me fed.
