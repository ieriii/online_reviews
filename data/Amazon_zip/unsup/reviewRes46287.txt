I'm from L.A. and I've been to their Beverly Center Location several times. I recently went to the Chicago restaurant and it was better than LA because of the dual level setup and view of Michigan Ave. The food (my faves: Cajun Jambalaya, Lemon Cellos, Molten lava dessert)was the just as delicious, they never dissapoint in that area. They please every palate (my kids, my mom, my good friend who doesn't eat just anything). The service is always pleasant and I've never had a bad experience in the 15+ times I've gone. Getting the car afterwards was a 20min wait so I'll be following a tip here from Yelp and get the self service valet for $2 less.
