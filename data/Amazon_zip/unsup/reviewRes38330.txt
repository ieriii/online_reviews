If you like cheeese and you like bread....this is the place!!! The crust was so tasty, I ate all the crusts!! It was good and left the filling for my hubby. I would recommend stuffed - deep dish to anyone that wants a 2 in 1 deal. We got the sausage with mushroom and bell peppers and a salad for two people. We purposely got the 10" and thought it would be too small. We were soo wrong! It can feed like 3-4 people!! It was alot. I loved it alot!! My mom is such a big fan of pizza, I had to bring this pizza home to Los Angeles when we left. She loved it by the way!
