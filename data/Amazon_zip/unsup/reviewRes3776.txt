Love this place. I've only ever tried the Baby bowl though. Delicious, fresh tasting, so satisfying. I feel virtuous eating here: so many veggies in my bowl, I tell myself sesame oil is good for me too, and I really appreciate that you can swap out the white rice for organic brown rice for just a bit more $. they also have a really great diet soda selection, the only restaurant I know where you can get diet orange soda and root beer. This place is pretty crowded for dinner so you'll have to snuggle up to a stranger on their big communal tables, but who knows- maybe you'll be able to sweet talk some wings out of your new best friend?
