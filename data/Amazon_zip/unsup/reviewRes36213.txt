This place is awesome! Went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon, but actually got some breakfast. My friend ordered bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast. Good price for a hearty meal (under 10 i believe) I ordered the chicken omelette with whole wheat toast. The homemade jellies that came with our meal were excellent! My omelette was gigantic and amazing! All the ingredients were balanced and nothing was too strong or too week. I'm a suburbanite, so I had Red Apple Pancake House in carol stream as my standard. This place is on that level, and might be even above! This place was packed around 1, but we sat and ordered and got our food in under 10 mins. It's a bit pricier, but that might just be city inflation that I'm not used to. I'd highly recommend this cafe to anyone in the neighborhood!
