Bonsoiree has been on my list for years and I finally went on 09/15. I have to be honest, I was a bit disappointed with the meal ("summertime menu") but the service and presentation was amazing. I was very disappointed with the first meal - 3 strips of wagyu beef yaki. I thought there was a bit too much of the marbalized fat that made the meat a bit more chewy than I like.  I was also very disappointed with the natural fed, veal (5th meal). They seemed like they were over cooked and very spongy. 3 out of 4 of us at my table all agreed that this meal (tasting) was the most disappointing. The staff and chef were very apologetic and brought out a substitute.  I think my favorite meals were: #2 - 8 presentations of summer which were all bite sized. all of the flavors were really nice and fresh. #7 - the Japanese watermelon refresher was also yummy. The staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about wines. They were able to guide us with which wines we should pair each tasting with - which was very helpful. I would say that I had a nice experience but don't think I'll be coming back. I think I'm ok with just checking it off the list.
