Overall I enjoyed my experience at Bin 36 but for the price it only receives an A-OK. If there were a 3.5 star rating I would definitely give it the upgrade but I cannot go so far as to say that I am a "fan." I have dined there a couple times and everytime I recall thinking that the wine and cheese are good (very hard to mess that up) and the meal is so so. All in all I think you are paying for their rent more than the food. Check it out but don't expect to have your socks knocked off.
