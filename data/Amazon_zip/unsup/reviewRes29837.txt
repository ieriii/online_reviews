Damn good texas cut french toast with bacon. The bacon was actually cooked the way I like it, thick slices & crispy yet not hard. The 2 dudes working the counter were cool and chit chatting about the NCAA brackets. Very homely feel and I wish we'd discovered this before the last day we were in town. Everyone in The Chi should try this spot, it's really good. Heard their stuffed french toast (only avail on weekends) is the bomb diggy! All the way from Cali, I approve!
