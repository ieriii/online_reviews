We are big Hyatt fans and Gold pass members so it pains me to write this. However, our experience as this located was below average. The front desk is way understaffed. They had a total of 2 people working on a Friday afternoon. Needless to say, it took us 1 hour to check in. The valet was equally bad. We called down to have our car ready 15 min. in advance and of course had to wait an additional 20 min. each time we picked up our car. Not very good service for $52/day valet. The room were okay and clean, but nothing special. The only good thing is that the location is perfect and convenient to everything.
