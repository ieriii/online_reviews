Pizza and Beer! Pizza and Beer! Piece has really good pizza. They make thin crust (I love deep dish, but for them I'll make an exception!), with a couple sauces to choose from, and use fresh ingredients. But the goodness doesn't stop there! They also brew their own beer. Had the Golden Arm and I was impressed. I'm definitely coming back here again to try some of the others. The wait staff and bartenders are so friendly and always making sure your glass is full. It's a big place too, with large wooden rafters and skylights in the ceiling. Gives it a nice wooden lodge look. So do you like good pizza? (Correct Answer: Yes) And do you like good beer? (Correct Answer: Yes) Then give Piece a try, I know I'm coming back!
