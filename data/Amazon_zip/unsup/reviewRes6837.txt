Every dish that my 6 family members ordered was delicious. Our waiter was great and even knew to ask us about the Chicago half marathon that my friend and I were running the next day. We were allowed to split dishes. The Tiramisu was outstanding, and I normally don't like it. We had a great table outside. Everything was fresh and homemade tasting. We were even able to change our reservations with no problem at the last minute. I am glad I found a yelp review telling me to go there!
