Yum. Their lasagna was delicious. I actually haven't found good restaurant lasagna but the one at Calo is gooood! I also tried their calamari fritti which was a disaster. It was too tough and chewy and not good at all. I liked their cocktail sauce that they paired it up with though, unique idea instead of the usual marinara. Their Calo Special thin crust pizza was yummy. I loved the nice chunks of italian sausage on there and the veggie balanced well. It wasn't too much or too little of each ingredient. The cheese is a little thicker than I'm used to though but I loved the crust. It wasn't soggy or too bready. It was just right. The place itself was really clean, I wonder when it was built. It all looks quite new too. The service was nice but I had to wait about 20 mins longer than they said they'd take to get my carry-out order which was a bummer. Oh yes and there's a free parking lot across (diagonally) the street from the restaurant.
