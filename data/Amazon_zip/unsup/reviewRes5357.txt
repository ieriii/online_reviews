Oh pig sweet purple pig! Some friends and I stopped in here while on a business trip. Initially going in I was thinking cool trendy place. Pretty small inside. The wait wasn't too bad. The menu had some of the most bizarre food I've ever seen on a menu in my life. Thankfully a friend of mine took charge and began ordering all sorts of things which I was terribly frightened of. Pork neck bone gravy, pig's ear and so much more. I thought I was going to starve. That was until I tried the food. WOW! I could have never of guessed this weird sounding food could taste good. We probably ordered 12 different dishes. This is one of those places where it seems better to order a lot of different things and share among a small group. Out of all the bizarre things ordered I loved every single thing. Probably can't even remember what it all was. Would definitely return when I'm in Chicago again!
