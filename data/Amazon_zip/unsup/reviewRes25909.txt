OK, so the food isn't that great, but for some reason I just love this place. I think it is a really romantic spot, even though I've only been with friends :-( (lol). Its extremely cozy and the wait staff is nothing short of amazing. March special for $32 for 4-courses....can't beat that! I dropped $60 the last time I was there during restaurant week and I only drank water. Definitely recommend going to this place at least once in your life though. And for those of you that don't know.... you have to cook your own food!
