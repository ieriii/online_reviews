This place is amazing! The wings are HUGE. I made the mistake of ordering a 10 piece assuming the wings were on the small side. Big mistake! The wings are a drummette and a wing in one. So it was almost like I ordered a 20 piece. Seriously, the biggest wings I have ever had. I had the Seoul Sassy and BBQ sauce upon the employee's recommendation. Very good, can't wait to try the rest of the sauces. The magic mushrooms were amazing as well. I wish they had a place like this in W. Park. It is definitely worth the trip to Lakeview and I can't wait to go back!!
