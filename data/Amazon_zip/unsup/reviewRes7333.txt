This is the cutest little place, still with a high-end feeling without the terribly high costs. They serve bread and butter pickles while you wait for your meal which are amazing. I had the smoked half chicken, which may have been the best chicken I have ever eaten, no joke. We also ordered the mac and cheese which looked amazing at the table next to us, but was only so-so in my opinion. My bf had ribs and 2 types of meat, which he seemed to enjoy as well.  All in all I give this place big thumbs up. Make sure to make a reservation tho, we waited for a table outside for about 35 minutes on a Tuesday night.
