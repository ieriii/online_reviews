Ah Kate P. loved your quote, so I took it! "Love & gluttony justifies everything." --Oscar Wilde, Dorian Gray Such a nice bar, full of swag! A beer was $6, average for Chi town but the food looked really good. The guys at the bar seemed like regulars so it must be good food. Would be a great date place because the decor is simply amazing! Cozy and charming, our waiter was witty and quick. I would definitely go back and try the food!
