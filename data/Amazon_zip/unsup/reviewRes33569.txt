Falafelicious! Sounds dirty, doesn't it? Well it is, in that it elicits a profound gastronomical lust that only some fried chick peas packed in a pita with some humus, spicy sauce, and Jerusalem salad can satiate. "I heard that Sultan's a bad mutha-" "Shut yo mouth!" "I'm just talkin' 'bout Sultan's Market!" "Then we can dig it!" It's cheap, too! (Uh, unless you eat there a couple times a week due to said cheapness) Also, you gotta get up on some Chicken Shawerma and a Kefta Kabob once in a while. What are you waiting for?...GO!
