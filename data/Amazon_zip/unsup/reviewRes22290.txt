Love this place, especially the family style meal. Thats what I usually do, but make sure to come hungry! We had the flaming cheese, eggplant spread, and gyros for an appetizer. Everything was excellent! Each person also gets a greek salad! I have had a lot of the different entrees, they are all great, but my favorites are the lamb, dolmades, spinach pie, and a pasta pie (dont remember the names). Then you get a plate of baklava and other greek desserts and greek coffee! Can't wait to go back. Also the service was great, and there is free valet!
