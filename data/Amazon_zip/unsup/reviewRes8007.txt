Spectacular! If you wan't to take someone out for a business dinner and make a lasting impression (and are in Chicago) please take them here. You will not be disappointed. For around $60 per person (excluding drinks) you will be provided with access to a gigantic salad bar, which you're warned not to get filled up on, and unlimited amounts of amazing steak/chicken/lamb etc... As with all brazilian steakhouses the system is Redlight/greenlight whereas you have a little round card next to your fork one side red one side green. If you keep the green side up you will be bombarded with the servers trying to throw all kinds of meat on your plate, so keep an eye out:) I took a taxi to Fogo and walked back to my hotel when done... if I didn't walk I would have probably had a heart attack:) Enjoy!
