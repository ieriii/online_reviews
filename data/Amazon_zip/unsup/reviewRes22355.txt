Was in Chicago about 2 weeks ago visiting my boyfriend, and on my first night in town, we decided to stop by Irazu for some shakes (some friends insisted we had to try them). I got the avena (oatmeal) chocolate and my bf got the avena banana. Believe the hype - both of our shakes were unbelievably delicious, so much that we stopped by again the next day, and again the day after that. We would have gone the next day too, but they were closed! If this rating were based only on the avena shake, it would deserve a 5 hands down; i'd give it a 10 if I could. The customer service is also excellent; the people who work there are so friendly and even recognized us when we stopped by several days in a row.  Since the shakes were so great, we also had dinner here on one of the nights I was in town... the food was good but I'm not dreaming about it or craving it the same way I am with the avena shake :).. I wasn't too impressed with their guacamole, and my burrito was good but not over-the-top good. Boyfriend got the pepino sandwich, which he loved and I would recommend over the burrito (i had a bite). Now that I'm back in Ohio, I need to find a way to replicate that avena shake... now that I know such a delicious concoction exists I can't live without it!
