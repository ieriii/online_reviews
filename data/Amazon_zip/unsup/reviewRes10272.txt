Great wine list at this place...and love that they have decanters (spelling, not sure of) to pour the wine out of. The caprese here is awesome; it's served with sun-dried tomatoes instead of beefsteak tomatoes, which is a nice change. Service here is outstanding and again, the wine list is pretty impressive without being intimidating. I got the gnocchi and it was flavorful and delicious. Was not too-much at one time as gnocchi can sometimes be. Compliments went all around for everyone's dish. From prok chops, to the whitefish, no one had a compliant in sight. Small little place and means small dream in Italian, but definitely a place with big flavor.
