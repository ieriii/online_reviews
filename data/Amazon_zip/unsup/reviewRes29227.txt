I've always heard so many good things about Pequod's for years but never tried it until a few months ago. Sadly, we were very disappointed. It wasn't bad pizza because there really isn't such a thing as bad pizza. However, there is such a thing as average pizza and Pequaod's in my opinion was that....just average. Nothing on this pizza stood out to me as being anything special. I was hoping to love it. From all the good reviews I've read, I expected to love it. After finally trying the pizza, all I could say was "this is it"? Again not that if was bad or anything like that. The problem was it was very average and forgettable. I think there are far better choices out there and I believe some of the hype and popularity of Pequod's is just that. It almost has the feel or gives the impression that it's cool to go to Pequod's so that's why people do it. Would I go again if only based on the pizza? No.
