In all honesty, I can't tell the difference between one pho place and another. The only differences I can tell are how dirty the bathroom is, and whether or not I can ask for anything in English or do I just point to numbers and pictures. But anyhow, took a friend who was visiting Chi along with his friend from SF to Tank on the Sunday before St. Patty's. For the less informed, the weekend before actual St. Patty's is when everything goes off. An excuse to dress like a leprechaun, tell people 'they after me lucky charms', and stumble around bar to bar like a drunken fool. So after partaking in the previous day's festivities, my friend and his friend were in some need of a hangover cure: pho. They were surprised with the 'authenticity' of pho that was available in Chi, and so it hit the spot for them. They were expecting some 'white-washed' version of pho, kinda like orange chicken or general tso's chicken for Chinese food. So to say the least, they were happy with Tank's pho and spring rolls. As for me, since I'm not Vietnamese nor a true pho connoisseur, default to 3 stars like I do to other pho places.
