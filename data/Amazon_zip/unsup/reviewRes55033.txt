I brought my brother here for dinner a couple of weeks ago and we were both pleased with our meals. I like to try very different interesting foods so I went with the bone marrow and my brother had the pork belly special. I have never had bone marrow before and I loved it!!! My brother ate all his pork belly so I think he liked it too, lol. This is a great place for drinks or a fun dinner out with a friend, significant other or even sibling!!
