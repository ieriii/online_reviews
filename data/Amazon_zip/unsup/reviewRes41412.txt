Yeah yeah, I know it's a chain. Nevertheless, the service and food is so top notch at this particular Ruth's Chris, I think it's necessary to review. Wifey & I came here for New Year's Eve, and we were promptly seated when we walked in---no wait like you'll experience at the pretentious Joes! Wifey ordered the petite filet with green beans. I ordered the regular filet with a baked potato. Both filets were a perfect med. rare. The quality is so good, I literally was cutting my steak with a fork. Tender meat, with a perfect seasoning, and of course a lot of butter. In addition to the amazing filets and great apps, the wine & martinis were top shelf and tasty too. The service---impeccable, as usual. Petra was our server, and she was top notch! I've eaten at this particular Ruth's Chris a handful of times, and can say with the utmost sincerity that each visit was nothing less than perfection! Of course, I will return!
