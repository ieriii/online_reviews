When people tell you that the food here is amazing, they are not telling the whole truth!! It is beyond amazing!!! I reserved a private room for my wedding reception and they could not have been better! The food was by far over the top! The wait staff was so pleasant and more than accommodating!! I will forever be grateful to them for how they handled my wedding reception!!
