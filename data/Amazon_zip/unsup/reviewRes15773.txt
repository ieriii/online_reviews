Pretentious with a capital DOUCHE.  We had trouble getting a table on a Monday night at 8:45pm. I appreciate that they seat everyone so that there's not a giant group of hangers about everywhere, but it seemed a little silly. They have giant stage curtains everywhere. It seems like a bar where one of the more annoying characters in the Great Gatsby would go, only the ambiance isn't so pretty.
