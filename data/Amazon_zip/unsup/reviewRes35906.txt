We started going there when they were still at the Argyle Ave location. The new Broadway location was a welcome improvement for the ambiance. However, their food and service continues to 'rock'. We especially love the Peking Duck, though it's best to order it ahead of time. Likewise with 'Mike's Chicken'. Consistently delicious seafood has made everyone in our group great fans. Berns
