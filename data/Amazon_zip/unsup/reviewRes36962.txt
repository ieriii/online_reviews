I was excited to try this place in my neighborhood again with the new expansion work complete. The place looks great. We sat on the patio for lunch arriving at 1:15 PM today. After 10 minutes, the server arrived. Once a menu could be hunted down, we order iced teas, the asparagus soup, carrot salad, and two different sandwiches. The menu had some great interesting options. That is when it all fell apart. The iced tea arrived, but it took the server 15 minutes to bring sugar/sweetner condiments. There was actually no sweetener in the cup she brought, so having no luck hunting her down, I went to the bar and got my own. We finished our drinks and waited for our soup/salad...and waited...and waited. Finally, after 90 minutes in to our experience, we put some money on the table to pay for our iced tea and walked out to find someplace else that actually had food.  I waived to our server as we were leaving. She was working her inside tables. I am not sure if she was with it enough to realize that we had never even gotten our food, but she just smiled back. I really wanted to like this place. We will try it again in 6 months and see if they have their service issued solved. Until then, I am not willing to risk giving them another try too soon. That is such a disappointment.
