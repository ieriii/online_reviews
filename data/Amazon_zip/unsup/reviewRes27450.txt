Pizza is delicious! I love coming here and they have Peroni on draft, yummm! I try to comein before 8 because it always gets crowded after that. Service is always great, very consistent here! I'm not sure if it's the owner or manager, but he always checks in and asks how everything was. I recommend this place to everyone!
