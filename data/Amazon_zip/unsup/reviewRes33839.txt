Pot Roast Eggs Benedict. Did that get your attention? Because it should. Anywho, I think Yolk is pretty fantastic (forget going there on the weekends though, the line is out the door). You get these monster servings, within minutes of ordering, by super speedy servers ... and the fruit garnishes are ACTUALLY FRESH! Just a great deal.
