Soooo addictive Butter Pickles! Came here for a good friends birthday, and once we sat down, two appetizers were put down in front of us...freshly fried potato chips and those delicious butter pickles! I couldn't stop eating them, they were that good. As for the dinner, the wife and I split the q3, which was a choice of 2 pulled meats (we chose the Kobe Brisket and Pulled Pork) and Chicken or Half Slab of Ribs (we chose the Half Slab of Baby Back Ribs). Kobe Brisket was good and soft, of higher quality than other briskets I've tried, but was more leaner than I would of liked. Pulled pork was okay, as well as the Half Slab of Ribs. Three types of BBQ sauces and Ketchup were also served, I really didn't care for any of the sauces. None really appealed to me. Overall, good food, great service (very attentive and courteous), and okay prices (slightly higher than the norm BBQ joint).
