I had high hopes for this one after reading all the positive reviews about Meli Cafe and Juice Bar. It was my first brunch spot on the trip and while the bright and sunny atmosphere was a nice touch, the fact that our food came out in five minutes makes me question the quality. Two items were ordered: the baked oatmeal and an omelet. Both came out together. Mine was luke warm and so was the omelet. The friendly waitress was the only redeeming quality. I also tried a carrot, honey, ginger juice which was refreshing but not worth the price. Would not rush back to this one unless I was in the area.
