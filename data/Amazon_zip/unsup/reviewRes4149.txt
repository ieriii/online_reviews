Schwa doesn't need my rave because every foodie in the city (and in the country) who eats there will tell you that this is one of the most amazing restaurants in the Chicago area. It is Alinea/Trotters caliber with a much, much cheaper prize tag (nine-course tasting for $95 is not necessarily cheap, but you should see what you're getting) and it's BYOB, which obviously saves a fortune. The cuisine is creative but delicious and surprisingly filling for such small plates (as I said, it is NINE small plates, which is pretty significant). The service is wonderful. The chefs themselves actually seat and serve you and describe in detail what they have prepared for you. Despite the potential for pretension, it's a totally laid back place. At the end of the night on a quieter night lately, the main chef sat down at a table with some old friends and share a six pack of beer with them. I can't imagine you'd see Charlie Trotter do such a thing! Yes, the reservations are impossible, but weeknights are easier and they did have some cancellations the night that we were there in November. I'm already gearing up for the next reservation there in a few months. It's worth the wait!
