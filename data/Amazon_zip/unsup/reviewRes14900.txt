This place is so good, but I should warn you it's typically an older crowd. On weekends they have a piano player in the bar, which also pours a nice stiff drink. The restaurant is owned by 2 brothers (Enzo and Angelo) and most of the staff has been there for ages. They have a room upstairs that can also be rented out for events. The food is excellent and the prices very affordable. My family goes there for birthdays, etc. because you usually go home with a doggie bag and your wallet still in tact. All meals come with soup and salad, plus their special pizza bread (WARNING: any vegetarians there is meat on the pizza bread) and a loaf of italian bread too. Some of my favorites are the ravioli, the seafood stuffed ravioli (it's called something else), and the calamari. If your looking for really good, classic Italian food at a reasonable price this is your place. However, if you're looking for a trendy place to be seen and pick up guys/girls this is not for you.
