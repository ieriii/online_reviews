Really really appreciate this place and so glad it's expanding - Just wish they were expanding all the way to Atlanta : ) Pub grub as it is meant to be. Playful but still sophisticated. Excellent beer selection, again not taking themselves too seriously but there is no doubt they know what they are doing. The atmosphere is quirky and young, some might say hipster but I just think it has local color. Andersonville is a GREAT neighborhood and Hopleaf is a fitting flagship for it. Everything I've tried here in my meager 2 visits has been delicious and reasonably priced. SUCH a good deal!!!
