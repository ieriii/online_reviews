I took hubby and our visiting guest here last Saturday and we were lucky enough to get a table within 15 minutes, despite being told the wait would be 45 minutes. We each picked something we could all share family style. The focaccia di Recco was amazing - even hubby liked it and he is not a big cheese person. The crispy pork belly was nothing to write home about. I'm biased since I grew up on Filipino pork belly and also had the chance to have Cebu lechon...the best! However, the apple mostarda side did compliment the pork and enhance its flavors. We also tried the pizza della terra (mushrooms, leeks, taleggio, and truffle oil) which was good, but again, nothing very special. In fact, my other friend reminded me we tried this dish the first time I was here, but it was so unremarkable I didn't remember!! Otherwise I would have ordered something else.  The best dish had to be the cacio e pepe spagetti. The pasta was just right and the seasoning was perfect. I would go back over and over just for that dish. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any of the desserts this time around. I was hoping to because I wasn't really impressed with the dessert I ordered during my first visit (I can't even remember what I had). Maybe next time, I'll just get the focaccia, cacio e pepe, and save room for dessert!
