I'd love to give Xoco more stars, but the price and the set-up takes away from the flavorfull taste of the food Rick Bayless is known for. To start with the positives, I'd like to say that the Pepito sandwich is one of the most delicious sandwiches I've had. Even weeks later I can still taste the marinated pork , cheese and jalepeno combination. However, I have had great sandwiches like this one for far less than $11! (Go to Pastoral in the Loop, for instance) Plus, the dining area is just small and very cramped. I wound up sitting at the counter facing a wall and I felt like I was constantly being bumped by the clean-up staff. It takes away from the entire dining experience. My suggestion, get your food to go....that is, if you are looking for an expensive bagged lunch.
