Made a reservation for 9:00 pm for three people last Friday. We arrived on time, and they were running behind. Their own bar was full so they sent us down to Ombra, their sister-restaurant, two doors down. They would call us, they said. Fine. No problem. We're easy-going. But 15 minutes, nothing. At 25 minutes, we called again and were told 5-10 more minutes. Still OK. We can manage. At 9:45, though, we went back over to ask what was happening, and they still had not seated the other 9:00 pm tables. They told us they had no idea when or if they could seat us for our reservation. We were also told that parking in the neighborhood is bad nowadays, and so tables get out of whack as the night wears on. But if they know this problem exists, though, they really ought to start offering valet service or adjusting their timelines so they allocate reservations properly. The host staff wasn't even sympathetic about not honoring our reservation, and we ultimately had to go elsewhere. What kind of place does that? Won't be trying again.
