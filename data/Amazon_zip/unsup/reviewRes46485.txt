Not sure I get all the hype about the salad bar--based on what I'd read I imagined a huge selection like you might find at a Texas de Brazil or Chart House or similar--in reality its a somewhat pedestrian selection of greens and veggies perhaps 10 feet in length. Nevertheless, as a burger joint this place does a pretty nice job. Had the turkey burger and sweet potato fries and both were above average. Also, our waitress was fantastic and even comped our dessert--a yummy cookie-cake creation with vanilla ice cream. The location right across from the Park & Zoo is another big perk. There aren't a ton of sit-down choices nearby, so if you're hungry after a long day out this one would be a solid choice.
