I like the idea Milk and Honey, but it just falls a bit short. The food selection is fine, but I'm a fan of more traditional breakfast entrees. Where's my scrambled eggs with bacon, hash browns and toast? The closest is ordering all of the sides together. The coffee was really great though. I'm sure this is the biggest complaint - the way they seat you at Milk and Honey just doesn't work right. You have to order and pay for your food before you are seated, get your own water and condiments and wait for your name to be called to sit down. It made me really nervous that I wouldn't get my food while it's still hot or even be seated at all. Also, realizing I needed cream and sugar and having to get up and fight through the crowd to reach the counter to retrieve the items is very frustrating. Please start the traditional process of seating people and ordering food! Don't even try to go here on a Sunday morning for brunch. You'll be waiting a good 45 min in a crowded space. Not the worst place, but by far not the best in Chicago.
