It would have to take Alinea to get me out of my 2 years of not writing reviews slump. Holy crap, this place is the shit. Seriously. Save your money and go here before you die. I've never experienced anything like it. Each course could be put on display at the MCA and each course (with the exception of 2) was delicious. And Grant coming out for our last course to decorate our table with delicious chocolates, fruits, syrups, and nuggets?? F-ing surreal. It was surprising that such a highly regarded chef would come out and perform (yes, it was a performance) to an audience of two common folk. Believe the hype, this place is legit. I am already saving my money for another visit in the fall ..
