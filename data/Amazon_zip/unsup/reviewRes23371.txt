Lao is back baby!!! I can't describe the sadness I felt when we ventured to Chinatown for lunch on a random weekday only to find out that Lao was closed due to a fire. They moved quickly and Lao is open again! I love the new decor. I agree that the chairs looked really uncomfortable, but they were surprisingly comfy once I sat down. I had no problem with the way it was before, but now it looks fresh and modern. I'm sure we will get the usual malcontents complaiing of how now it has no character anymore. Here's an idea...don't go there if you don't like it! I don't think they will be hurting for business any time soon and it will be easier for me to get a table. Don't know if it was because we were so happy to be there again and loved the new look, but the food somehow also tasted better. Pot stickers are the best I've ever had. Tony's 3 chili chicken is a standard. La la la spicy pot is one of my favorite dishes in Chicago period. Don't come here and order egg rolls, wonton soup and sweet and sour pork and then write about how mediocre it was. You don't come here for that. YOU are the only reason they even have that stuff in the menu to begin with. Best Chinese food in Chicago hands down! I've brought at least 30 different people to eat here and have yet to hear otherwise.
