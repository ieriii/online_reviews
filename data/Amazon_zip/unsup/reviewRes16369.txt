I'm not all about having to wait in line to get into a bar, but because I had a friend in town and we were out with the girls, I sucked it up.  The drinks were fantastic. I don't mind having to wait a little longer for drinks or food if I know they are bring freshly prepared for me, which was the case at Violet Hour.  The atmosphere and decor were very cool. I found it hard to hear my friends over the music, however.  So, as an overview: The good: drinks, decor The not so good: the line, prices were a little high, it was very loud
