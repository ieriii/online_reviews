Before I begin this review, I have to explain that I went to Gino's on a weekend getaway a while ago and I am unsure about which location I went to while I was in Chicago. So anyways..... I had been dying to try some real Chicago-style pizza forever. I live in Los Angeles and the closest I have had to Chicago style pizza is Numero Uno. *Hang head in shame* So my Purdue Friends and I went to a Gino's location and had a pizza that was half supreme and half cheese deep dish style and calamari. The calamari was great and accompanied with hot marinara sauce; I love a good plate of calamari *drool* The pizza was an experience. The crust was sweet and kinda tasted like it had a corn bread based crust. The pizza was so thick and it had the toppings on the bottom, cheese in the middle, more toppings and then sauce. You literally had to use a knife and folk to partake in the deliciousness of this pizza. I really liked the pizza and I am now a fan of Chicago-style pizza. No tips or hints about this place. Just enjoy :-)
