I can not rave about this place enough.  The beer is really good, for the price - it's flippin awesome. I love the fact that they rotate a few of their beers seasonally, it just makes sense, and they make (for the most part) quality choices on their rotations.  It is rare that you find a place that is this small (brewery wise), that has great beer and great food. The appetizers and salads are definitely their strong point. While the entrees are good, I feel like they take more chances with their appetizers and salads which (IMO) pair with their beer much better than the entrees.  Given the quality of food and drink that is being served here, I would have to say that this place is pretty cheap.
