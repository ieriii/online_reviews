After one of the worst days in my 29 years of life, I needed something to smile about. Insert XOCOs homemade guacomole and chips. Then insert their reknowned churros dipped into a cup of their decadent bean-to-cup hot chocolate ( Mexico City version). Finally, the woodland mushroom torta rounded out an excellent late afternoon lunch. XOCO is always busy for a reason. Their food is damn good. So, even at 1:30 p.m. on a Friday, Kristina C. and I encountered a 40 minute wait. Alas, sometimes waiting is worth it. The setup to this place is a bit odd - we weren't initially sure what the deal was. Apparently, you wait in line to order, then get a seat assignment, and your food is brought out to you. Random, and frankly a bit confusing. The hostess was incredibly friendly though, and she even brought us out free dessert for having to move our seats to squeeze someone else in. No biggie - but free dessert is always welcome. Will I return? Perhaps on a Tuesday at 2 p.m. - the fact that it's crazytown busy ALL the time is a bit of a turnoff. But, at least you're rewarded handsomely for the time investment. Delectable Mexican is a handsome award indeed.
