The view was great, the room is clean while being in the middle of "no where" in Chicago besides the convention that it sit next to. This hotel deserves 4 stars for the hospitality of their staff and excellent concierge. The free shuttle to nearby shopping was most welcome since parking in Chicago is a pain! The $20 internet killed the deal; this is one of the few Hyatt that still charges for this modern day necessity. -- Especially when they catering to business people by their strategic location.
