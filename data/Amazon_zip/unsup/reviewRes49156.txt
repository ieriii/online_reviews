I came here with a group of ppl the other weekend, one of which included a wine supplier. He brought in several bottles which was not only extremely generous on his part but the selections, a few from the 80's, were fricken ridiculously good.  We had several small plates and the charcuterie platter and just kicked back, drank outstanding wine, snacked on some good food and took in the nice atmosphere. Service, impeccable. Not a lot not to like about this place, at least from this one time experience.
