The food is awesome and they have really good beers. I'm a picky eater, so the one burger I was really disappointed with was the Red Dragon one. It has egg, hash, and hot sauce on it. I was really excited, thinking it was going to have a great kick to it, but it was so flavorless I was heartbroken, and almost didn't come back. Since I live in the neighborhood, I decided to give it a second chance. I'm glad I did, because every other menu item I've had there has rocked. The garlic fries are so delicious. Overall it's a good atmosphere and good food and a decent price.
