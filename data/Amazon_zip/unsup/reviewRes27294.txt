We really enjoyed our experience here lats night. We have had many tasting menus in the past, all creative, all pushing the limits of our senses and understanding of food. Last night, we enjoyed "the collection" and were not let down. The team at Graham Elliott tested and tempted our tastebuds with creative combinations, perfectly cooked food and "all" enjoyed. There was not a single dish on the menu that didn't work for us. The service was excellent, the environment was casual, relaxing and unassuming. Why the 4 stars and not 5? Wine. We did the pairing and I was woefully disappointed. Nothing was bad, but nothing really stood out. I felt about halfway through that this pairing menu was the "value" menu, maybe their goal was to let us experience regions we may not have tried on our own, but they should have stated that. I still feel let down by it and while I will certainly be back, I most definitely will be skipping the wine pairing. Last comment - those of you who complained about portion size, I ask, did you leave hungry? There is no way. Try the 48oz Strip Steak at your local Outback and leave the seats at Graham for the rest of us.
