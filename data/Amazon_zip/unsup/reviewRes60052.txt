I am having a real hard time writing this review. I went with friends based on your reviews.I really wanted to like this place. The decor was very cute. inviting. I wanted a martini but they didn't have my Gin. Our server insisted he could duplicate a martini without Hendricks Gin. i believed him but it wasn't how i expected it to be. They had a table service menu which meant everyone at the table had to order from the price fixe menu. We decide on the fried green tomatoes and gumbo with pork shoulder as a 3rd appetizer. The fried green tomatoes were delicious and the gumbo grand wit a teeny bit of spicy. The rest went down from there.  The server was trying to impress my friend most of the evening which was annoying. Then again she always gets the attention when we go out. I had a meat pie and my date had the catfish. This all would be fine but the catfish was too sour and the meat pie had onions olives and peppers. This was heartburn ready to rear its ugly head. I really wanted to like this place. Toward the end of the meal the kitchen grease was entering the dining area and I felt like I was covered in oil. The only other place I felt like this was Geja's cafe for fondue. I began to feel nauceaus. If they fixed the vents n the kitchen it might have been more pleasant. i wouldn't feel covered in grease. I don't want to not recommend but I am leary. My experience wasn't horrible but I will think hard before i set foot in there again.
