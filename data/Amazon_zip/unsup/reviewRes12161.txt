to the people who wrote badly about Grant. you obviously dont know how a weekend at piece goes. It's super packed and a long wait at times. Grant has always tried his best to seat me while I've had to wait a long time. I live right around the corner which i'm sure you dont and have been treated well by the staff and i'm understanding of what goes on on during the weekends. please understand that there are weekends where there are long waits and the front wait staff are trying their best, they are just a little stressed, which i'm sure any human being would be.
