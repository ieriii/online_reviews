There were 8 of us... We ate for 20... Meat orgy... Meat gasm.... Meat explosion... Meat -A- licious... You know what? Next time I am just doing the antipasto bar option... Is the bacon wrapped filet mayhaps the best piece of beef I have ever had, well a close 2nd or 3rd anyway, WOW its really good!!! The Lamb chops yes I will take two more... um signature garlic beef, um slip away to holy meat heaven batman... Here is the thing, I find every time I get interactive in the meat orgy that is Texas de Brazil, I over eat, I can't help it, I am like a dog; that when the food bag pours out on the kitchen floor eats every last bite...  Sooooo Next time just the antipasto bar for me, the best part is, its freaking amazing! From hearts of palm, to asparagus, from aged parmesan to pickled peppers, from crazy freaking rock and roll lobster bisque to fresh mozzarella, from happiness to joy, the list goes on and on! Don't be fooled there is even meat on the non-meat orgy option, its cold its cured its salted and aged to perfection, all for half the price, its just as nice!!! Hopefully I will walk away not as stuffed and with a smile on my face in my wallet and in my belly... No matter the route you go you will be happy you made the journey!!! Oh and the service - off the hook, off the chain, off the map, its so sweet its off the dessert menu!
