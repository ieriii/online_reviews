After reading up on this place, I decided to check it out and have some delivered. I'm glad I did. Cuz, I love me some waangs. The Chicken wings are huge and delicious! I was a little hesitant at first about paying $9 for 5 wings. But once i got to the end of the second, and a bite or two into the third, i can honestly say i was already satisfied. Then my Man Vs. Food instincts kicked in and lets just say..add another victory for Man. I can only comment on the Chicken wings, (I've tried the plain Jane, Crisp BBQ, Crisp BBQ spicy, and the Seoul Sasssy) You will not be disappointed by either choice. One more thing, give there magic mushrooms a try. It will take you to places, you never dreamed of..(or was that another bag of mushrooms) hmm.regardless give them a try!  Overall , well worth it! =)
