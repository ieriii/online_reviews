We pulled up in front of the Dana, one month since our last visit, the Doorman greeted us by name, commented on the fact i was driving a different car this time & welcomed us back!! We didn't book a corner room this time but the Dana upgraded us to a room with a Balcony. Everything i loved before i still love but I'm upgrading the Dana to 5 stars. I will always stay here in Chicago & its is a foodie dream you are within walking distance of almost every great dining establishment in Chicago & the added bonus is some lovely wine bars within stumbling distance. Plus we enjoyed the twice weekly Free wine from 530pm to 630pm. They served Chateau St Jean Merlot & Chardonnay, not half bad for free wine
