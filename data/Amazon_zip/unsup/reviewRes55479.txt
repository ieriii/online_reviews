If you make a reservation here, be aware of long wait times possibly. I had a 7:30 reservation and I was not seated until 8:45! That is not acceptable for one of the better Italian restaurants in Chicago. I was extremely irritated and enraged because of the long wait time. When we finally were seated, the waiter and manager took care of us personally by offering us a complimentary a bottle of wine and an antipasti plate (both were very good). The food, ambiance, and decor were excellent and our server was excellent! I would recommend going there, but make sure to call ahead to find out if they are running on time with your reservation!
