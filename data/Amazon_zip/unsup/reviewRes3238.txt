I heard about this place in some Chicago magazine looking to highlight specific dishes that one should check out when in town. This is where I heard of the Seoul Sassy chicken about three years ago and I will never turn back! It's all I've had here and all I will ever have. No doubt they must have other good dishes, but the chicken is just too good. Very messy, but the sauce they use is worth the sticky hands you'll leave with. Sadly, this place isn't getting five stars purely for the seating predicament. :\
