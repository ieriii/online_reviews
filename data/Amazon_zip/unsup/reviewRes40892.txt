Came here to use my groupon before it expired. My date and I had the $95/person 6-Course Underground Special on a Saturday night. Compared to other 1-star Michelin or comparatively priced restaurants we've dined, based on price, and seeing such high overall yelp reviews, we were rather disappointed with the overall experience. I've rated each course on the 5 star system. Course 1) Raw Fish (***) Course 2) Gazpacho (***) Course 3) Grilled Halibut (*****) Course 4) Short Rib (**) Course 5) Watermelon w/ Sea Urchin (*) Course 6) Bread Pudding (****) Each dish was petite so don't expect to get full or stuffed off the meal. Service was fine, and it's BYOB. The interior of the restaurant is similar to the the exterior. It's rather bland and does not have a "fancy restaurant" feel to it. The meal was definitely not worth the $$ even after the groupon. Perhaps they justify the price using expensive ingredients like Sea Urchin and fresh sliced truffles. Anyways, there are many better restaurants to spend your money. I can't recommend Bonsoiree.
