I was excited to see a new cafe in Bridgeport since we don't have many nice restaurants. The decor is very nice, but the food wasn't good enough to support their pricing. Just to have toast on the side cost $2.50. You'd think it'd be included with the omelet! Won't be going back anytime soon. Bridgeport is a lousy place for the gourmet food person to live. Always have to travel north for good and reasonably priced gourmet food!
