I have been to Sunda on three occasions. The first visit was memorable. I am a vegan, my companion, a carnivore. We were greeted by friendly hostesses, who graciously took our coats. I informed our server that I was a vegan. She knew the menu like the back of her hand. She had wonderful suggestions and offered substitutions for different ingredients. My companion and I started off with the iced tea. It comes in a long, tall carafe with an interlocking mini-carafe with your choice of mango or pomegranate syrup. After one sip, both of our taste buds were esctatic. It was the best iced tea I have ever had! I have had the Indo corn fritters, garden veg rolls, mushroom baos and other items. They are all scrumptious. The server was extremely attentive, sincere and came to the table to numerous occasions to make sure everything was okay.  Sunda has a beautiful, trendy backdrop, impeccable, yet relaxed service and exquisite cuisine. You will not be disappointed.
