Went to Chicago on our honeymoon just to try food by Rick Bayless. The Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena has become my favorite dish of all time. If in Los Angeles, the Carne Asada Brava is a great substitute at Red O, but has a bit more spice. Great patio seating. Be sure to make a reservation! We made the mistake of not doing so and waited over 2 hours to be seated, on a Thursday! However, Starbucks is up the street if you catch yourself in a similar situation or sit at the bar (if you can find a spot.) Bayless offers the absolute best of Mexican cuisine at affordable prices. Look forward to another trip to Chicago just for Frontera.
