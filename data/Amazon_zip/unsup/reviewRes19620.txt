The reason for the 3 stars... the music is so loud that it has caused me to not return. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly but one of the times that I went there was on a date with my boyfriend and even though we were seated at the tiniest table and the place was dead, we still could barely hear each other. My voice actually hurt by the end of the night from having to yell everything I said. In my opinion thats too much effort for some sushi.
