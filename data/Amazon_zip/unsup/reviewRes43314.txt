In my opinion the best Chicago style pizza in town - ideal for delivery since it's more or a storefront with some cheap tables so not exactly a big night on the town eating there. The pizza is more of a traditional bread-like crust as opposed to the cornmeal you would get from Lou's or Gino's but it's very well made. The toppings are good (I'm a fan of the Art's Special - sausage, mushroom, onion, and green pepper) and the sauce is what really makes the pizza excel - great flavor and some spice, not watery, and just works very well with virtually everything except a lot of spicy toppings such as in which case it can be a bit too much. I personally like their thin crust pizza as well but people are generally more divided there - get the Chicago style deep dish delivered and you won't be sorry.
