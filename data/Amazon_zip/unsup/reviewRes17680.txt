We had a Groupon for India House and have heard a lot of good things about the food. Since I am not a big fan of buffets, we went to have dinner. Parking is, of course, hard in downtown and the restaurant was pretty crowded. That is always a good sign, that the food must be good. We ordered a couple of dishes and we thought the curry and tikka masala was very good. We got mini Naan rather than the crunchy dosa (I think that is what it is called) which I thought was different from other Indian restaurants. The food was well priced for the area it is in, comparable to the Devon restaurants. I did not particularly enjoy the service, compared to other downtown places, but all in all, the food was worth it.
