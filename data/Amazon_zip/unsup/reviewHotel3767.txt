Stayed here on a business trip and I have to say this one of the trendiest hotels I've stayed in. This hotel is very comparable to the W Hotels , but more on the boutique side. I arrived around 10pm at night and was greeted by the friendly door man w/ dreads. I was really hungry and he recommended me a couple of good places to eat throughout my stay. He offered to help me with my luggage, despite me only having a carry-on. Dana Hotel, if you're reading this, please recognize your doorman w/ dreads (or braids.. not sure!?!) As another reviewer was saying.. this place does have the sexiest shower ever!!!
