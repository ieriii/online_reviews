This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Great food, reasonable prices and a fun atmosphere. My favorite item is the Titanic Burger, though the Rubin and Kharma burgers are also fantastic. What I especially appreciate are the knowledgeable and friendly staff of the Chicago Diner. We have learned a great deal about living a vegan lifestyle from the servers. The are receptive to our questions and enthusiastic in giving very helpful advice. Now I just need to make it over there in time for another serving of biscuits and gravy...
