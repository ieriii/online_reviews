the hubs and i walked in here and we managed to get a table right away. free valet...too!  in the lobby is a case with the fresh fish of the day and several octopi...not a fishy smell in the house! we were sat at our table and immediately our waters were filled by the extremely attentive service staff. i wanted to use the ladies before dinner, and to my surprise and delight...there were FIVE ladies' rooms! (and one men's room!--finally!) the restroom was clean, too. my husband said the men's room was nice and clean. we each ordered a saganaki, cause we always end up fighting over the cheese and the grilled octopus. well, we ended up wrapping up half of the cheese (it was a lot--and really tasty), and we plowed through the tender perfectly charred octopus. my husband had a sampler platter which had dolmas, lamb, meatballs, rice and roasted veg. he was very happy with it and had to force himself to stop eating it. i had the whitefish special, it was simply prepared with olive oil and lemon--delish. i asked for the egg-lemon sauce on the side so i could dip...so good. we finished off dinner with the "ambrosia"--which always reminds me of 'edward scissorhands' (no pink marshmallows here!)...it was so awesome...shredded filo, nuts, honey, ice cream and caramel. not sure how greek that was, but it was awesome. the server was ok, his support team was excellent. we'll be back!
