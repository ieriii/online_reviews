For a dining experience, you pay for service and food. The service at Mercat did not live up to the food of Mercat. My wife and I entered the upstair seating and was greeted nonchalantly by the hostess. She informed us that we can wait for a table or be seated in the lounge area as she pointed in a general direction of the lounge. My wife and I just wanted a nice drink and some snacks, so I headed over to the lounge area. After being seated, we waited for 10 minutes for the menu along with another couple who was waiting for their dessert. After 10 minutes of waiting and about 4-5 waiters passing us without acknowledging that we were even there, I got up and asked the hostess if she had menus for us to order. She seemed shocked and realized that she had menus in front of her. I gladly retrieved the menu and began to look over the available list. Price is on the higher end and portion is skim. We were finally greeted by a waiter and I ordered a red sangria. While waiting for the sangria, the waiter brought out a complementary pan con tomato, but without silverware or napkins. I suppose lounge means lack of competent service?. After we ordered our food and drinks, I finally had to ask the waiter for silverware and napkins. We had the Tiger Shrimps and Ahi Tuna with 3 drinks altogether. Both dishes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Our bill came out to be about 110 with tax and tip. I just cant find the reason to come back when service is poor and price didn't meet the dining experience despite great food. Quite a shame when service ruin the dining experience.
