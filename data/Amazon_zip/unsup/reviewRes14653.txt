Ol' Skool...lol That was the first thing I thought when I first walked into Sabatinos. Thats exactly what I was looking for! I wanted AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD..and I got it! I wasn't a big fan of the seating arrangements or decor, but we managed fine. Calamari tasted fresh!, good crisp salad, portions were big! Pasta was delicious! I would definitely go again!
