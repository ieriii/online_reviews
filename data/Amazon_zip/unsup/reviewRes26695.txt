Ordered take out on a summer Sunday night. Restaurant looked nicely busy/lots of chatter. Owner was super-friendly when I picked up the food, and gave us complimentary fresh fruit salad (cherries, watermelon, cantelope, pineapple) AND a pineapple smoothie (which was DELICIOUS and we will definitely order next time we go back). We ordered one appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer was Saigonese Crepe, which was really the size of an entree, stuffed full of chicken, shrimp, and TONS of really fresh veggies and lots of good flavors). This was my favorite and I don't normally go for crepes! The entrees were Lemongrass Chicken and Pork Ribs. The Chicken was really flavorful and also packed full of super-fresh veggies. The Pork Ribs were also pretty tasty. One particularly nice touch about all the food was the variety of the fresh produce used, and the inclusion of both fresh and cooked chilli peppers and some herbs and greens that I wasn't familiar with. We'll definitely go back to sample some more.
