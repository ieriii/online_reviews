When I'm down in Andersonville, this has become THE place to have brunch. My boyfriend likes the Eggs Roshambo and I cry over the eggs New Orleans every time I have it, it's SOOOO good. Just to tast the orange juice (they squeeze their own organic oranges) and you can tell you're in a place that serves quality. The service is in a different league than any other brunch spot I've been to as well: they don't seem like they care if they turn your table it's like, "sit down, relax we're gonna take care of you for a while." Oh, and did I mention beignets???Only been to dinner once, but the BF freaked over his ribs (for good reason, I sampled one of course - delish!) and my trout special was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. Mississippi Mud Pie. Do it.
