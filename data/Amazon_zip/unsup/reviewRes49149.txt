Nice wine selection but GREAT cheese selection .. Maybe even the best cheese selection in the city. The back of the menu is about 60 cheese selections from various countries. I love sitting at the bar nearest to the fire and people watching. It's very spacious and the bar tenders are great. The wine is slightly above average - I'm a big huge red drinker and after all the recommendations - never really found one. We got a number of small plates for dinner, none exceptional enough to mention.
