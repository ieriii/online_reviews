Among the best thin crust pizza in the city (the best being Vito & Nick's on the South Side). I prefer the red, but sometimes go for the white. The beer is also outstanding. I have never had a bad time here, and the weekend crowd is a nice mixture of people. My friend and I once got approached by a group of women during the live band karaoke. When someone did 867-5309 one of them said "I bet you weren't even born when this song came out". It turns out I was one year old. She replied that she was in the eight grade at the time. Sweet.
