I can dig Wilde. Stopped by for lunch today with a friend and I was starving. I was ready to chow down on some good eats. Walking into the place, cozy was the first word that came to mind. Obviously for a Monday lunch it was very low-key and relaxing. Fireplaces, cozy leather chairs, and endless long layout with a library in the back and ample space for enjoyment. It was exactly the kinda place I needed for my chill lunch. We started with the Artichoke and Cheddar Dip which was delicious and good to split between two people. For our sandwiches we split the Ruben (awesome!) and the Burger. I was happy with both of the sandwiches and the options for sides. I was not so impressed by their onion rings though. There was so much batter surrounding them, I felt like I was at the carnival eating elephant ears rather than onion rings. Other than that, the burger had really good flavor. For dessert, we had the chocolate lava cake with peanut butter vanilla ice cream. YUM. They also have brunch, so that's something I would like to come back and try. Overall, I was impressed and I will be back to try more.
