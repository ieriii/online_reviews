Love Love Loved it- & I don't even like hot dogs! My brother convinced me that this wasn't just a hot dog joint & he was right-they had so many different varieties of encased meats that I forgot that we were choosing 'hot dogs'. I got a chicken & spinach dog-it oozed some sort of cheese-delish! my kids loved it too- & they had to wait for an hour to get in so that's saying a lot :) don't know that I am the best reviewer for the duck fat fries- they were good, but not sure I have a sop
