im a fan. i never thought you can get so much flavor out of a mushroom torta. im a carnivore but was a fan of the mushroom torta. the ahogada, what can i say. just good. only set back is the chocolate drinks for me. im not a desert person so i may be biased but damn chocolate milk or chocolate bar. them drinks couldnt make up its mind, the consistency was in between...
