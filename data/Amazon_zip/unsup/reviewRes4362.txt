It would have been 4 or 5 last week. But not this week, as I got closer. I went to Green Mill last Wednesday 5.18, after The Cars concert. It was cool and I was willing to pay the $6 cover charge to get in. I had a great time in there. I thought it would become a local bar I would patronize. Tonight I went to a winetasting downtown *80 Sips", and asked the cab driver to drop me off there. As a single female wanting to just get a drink, I thought the place was cool and I would have a nightcap there, and walk home easily after seeing what they had to offer. This was around 10 p.m. The big, bald bouncer guy seemed overwhelmed by the people lining up, asked for $12 to get into the place, and made a whole bunch of us wait, When I asked to get through, he said, "You have had enough" I think he meant alcohol. I hadn't, obviously, or I wouldn't be writing this; actually I had more alcohol in my veins the other night, with The Cars. I said "Really!" then left. I know better than to fight with a bouncer, but my impression of this place now really sucks. What a shame! Get some good people, Green Mill, who have people skills. A sweet, really cool girl like me who looks great,and who wants to patronize your business won't hurt your business. A bald, insensitive, thug who does not get it, will. It's up to you to understand this. Thanks. M
