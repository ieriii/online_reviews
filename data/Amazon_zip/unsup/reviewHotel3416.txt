Location, location, location! This nicely renovated hotel sits right in the middle of all the hub-bub on the Magnificent Mile. If you are a tourist, or simply love to be in the middle of everything, this is a good choice. I enjoyed my stay here very much. I noticed a lot of room size complaints.. I didn't feel my room was small but I did get a King size. It was big enough for two people and all their stuff for a long weekend Chicago adventure with friends. We weren't there except to sleep, shower, and get jazzy looking to go out. Only complaint, was that the shower drain had HAIR in it. EEEEW. GROSS. That is a huge negative. Aside from that the room was clean. Toiletries were minimal, linens fresh and clean, service friendly and hospitable, bar NICE. Also you get complimentarty martini tickets when you check in. I took full advantage.
