Best hot dog joint in Chicago. I'd even venture to say that it's the best hot dog joint in the nation. I know I haven't been to every single hot dog joint in the nation, but I'd put my money on Hot Doug's. Classic hot dogs, specialty hot dogs, duck fat fries are all amazing. Doug is the owner and he's a nice guy, too. He's the one taking orders all day, at least he's always been the one when I've been there. Pros: A lot Cons: Only thing is the wait. You'll be lucky if you're not standing outside of the building at the end of the line. Even if you go at 11AM, it's likely to be out the door already. I've been here several times and each time I had to wait outside. It does move pretty quickly, though. From the time you reach the door, it takes maybe 10-20 minutes to order.
