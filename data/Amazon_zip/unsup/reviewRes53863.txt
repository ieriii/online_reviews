I ate at The Purple Pig for the first time (finally) earlier this week with a friend, and I couldn't have been more impressed. We were greeted warmly at the door, and while we were told we had to wait about 30 minutes for our table, the staff was extremely welcoming, and promptly helped us get situated with some wine while we waited. Once seated (about 25 minutes later), we took the liberty of ordering a ton of items from the menu. I don' teat a lot of meat, and while I knew from looking online beforehand that there were several dishes I would be able to enjoy, I had no idea how many until the menu was placed before us...there must have been at least 25 or more items that involved chicken, seafood, veggies and more. A vegetarian could eat very happily here (the corn salad, the beets, and the butternut squash were my favorites). My friend - a really adventurous eater - was also in heaven. As the food poured out from the kitchen, there wasn't a single dish I ordered that I didn't enjoy. The chef, who we had a chance to meet at the end of our meal, executed everything to perfection. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient, and the manager (I didn't catch his name, but he has red hair/beard and a really fun, kind personality) stopped by our table a couple of times over the course of our 3-hour visit to make sure everything was to our liking. Tantalizing food, excellent service from top to bottom, and, in my opinion, unmatchable energy in the dining room. The Purple Pig truly reminded me of why I love dining out in Chicago.Love, love, love. Already planning my next visit!
