This place may not look like much from the outside (with the threat of rain, we weren't even sure there would be indoor seating) but don't let that turn you away. There are twelve barstools indoors and a host of outdoor seating should Summer ever come to our fair city. So, Cuban food. What do I know about Cuban food? Not much. My gringo-ness was nearly palpable so the cashier reached out and offered a printed menu (more detailed than what is up on the chalkboards) and offered his assistance as I chose my breakfast. In fact, the entire staff was SUPER friendly the entire time we were here - WONDERFUL people. I'm new to this whole plantain business, and this place has plantains up the wazoo. My sandwich was an omelette with sweet plantains and was served with plantain chips and washed down with a pineapple soda. Yum yum. Crowning glory of all the food was the red sauce we were encouraged to try with it. I started slow (I'm a Cuban-Newbie!) but eventually doused my entire sandwich with this stuff.
