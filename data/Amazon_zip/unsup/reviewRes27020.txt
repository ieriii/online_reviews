In town from San Diego, what a fun experience, just fabulous! Very impressed about the knowledge of all the serving staff, extremely well trained about all aspects of the menu and wine, Our waiter Jeff was a total foodie like me, and was just a joy. Also was great to go to a casual dress restaurant and not have to look at toes through flip flops!! (hint to men in So Cal, flip flops are for the beach and shower, that's it!). Food was imaginative and great, game hen and Wagyu steak dishes were to die for. Really interesting wine parings as well.
