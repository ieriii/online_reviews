Why do I love Violet Hour? Because it is like no where else I have ever been. Walking into the Violet Hour feels like walking into another time and place. They restrict the amount of people who enter so that everyone has a seat and it never gets too crowded. A policy that I adore. I went on a Friday night around 9:00pm, and so I had to wait about 45 min. There was also some minor confusion the night I went so I shall clear it up right here: You must give your name/cell number to the host at the front of the line. No matter what anyone else in line says. Once inside and seated you will notice the low lighting, gorgeous chandeliers and high backed chairs. The bartenders are dressed in traditional old-school bartender garb, which adds a posh air. On to the drinks: Amazing! All mixers are fresh and made on the premises. They pay attention to detail there, everything is presented beautifully. I have not yet tried the food, but from what I saw (and smelled) it is going to be delicious! If you are looking for a fun unique experience, you have to go to the Violet Hour!
