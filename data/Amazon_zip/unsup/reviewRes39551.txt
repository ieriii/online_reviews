This is one of the better kalbi restaurants in Chicago, yet like most Korean restaurants, if you don't know what you're doing, and you're not Korean or among Koreans, you will be lost. That said, the quality of meat and availability of panchan (side dishes) is usually pretty good, and it washes down well with Jinro.
