Went here over the weekend and pretty happy with the choice. We had a few drinks, appetizers, a couple of main dishes to share, and more booze. The food was actually pretty good considering I thought I would be having typical bar fare. Fried Chicken was surprising - It wasn't oily, yet lacked some kick in either the batter or the chicken itself. The Mac & Cheese with bacon and jalapeo add-ons was pretty good. The pepper didn't overwhelm the cheese and the bacon some salt and crunch. The only problem was that for $8, I wish the serving were larger than the double ramekin. Wines were interesting, and I really liked their specialty cocktails that all contain a little beer. I know, it sounds weird, but the addition of beer prevented the drink from being too syrupy or pulpy. The server was attentive and pretty informative since the place is new. Hostesses need a little help. They're pretty dingy. When I asked where the restroom was, one seriously took a few minutes to think about where it was. It was sort of crowded for the space, but nonetheless, I had a good time - as did my cohorts.
