Visiting Chicago on business from California, I was determined to find a really good BBQ Rib place in a nice part of town,close to my hotel near Navy Pier. After reading reviews on Yelp, We decided to try Chicago Q. Our waiter, LaTiff was wonderful, He took us thru the menu, made recommendations, and, to my delightful surprise, informed us that the person who was in charge of BBQ was none other than LeAnn Whippen. I had watched LeAnne compete on BBQ Pitmasters and knew she is considered a Grand Champion in the sport of BBQ. Without hesitation I ordered the Competition St. Louis ribs. Absolute best I have ever had. I passed on the 4 sauces that were served with it, as the flavor needed to be savored on it's own. The side of jalapeno corn bread was perfect. Oh,and those buttered pickles were a great start. My guest had the pulled pork which was wonderful as well.Make sure you check this place out..and ask for LaTiff for great service with a smile....
