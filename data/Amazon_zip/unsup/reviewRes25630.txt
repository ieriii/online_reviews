The food is delicious. The drinks are lovely. The space is breathtaking. But, maybe it's because I'm such a Midwesterner, but I find the portion sizes absurdly small in relation to the pricing. With a ton of tapas places in town, I wouldn't go here if I was really hungry. On a weekend, call for reservations if you want dinner anytime before 10pm.
