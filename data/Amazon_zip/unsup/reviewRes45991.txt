I love Grand Lux. I have been here countless times for everything from lunch with a friend to birthday celebrations. It is one of my favorite places to go simply because it is reliable and delicious. Every time you come here you know you will get great service, great food, a great view, and a sight to see. The architecture and design aesthetic of this place is pleasing to the eye and an unavoidable conversation starter. There are a bunch of tables overlooking Michigan Ave, which invites you with the great feeling of energetic city life. The food is fantastic. I usually stick to my favorites but there is so much to choose from that sometimes it is hard. Anything you get is bound to be good. Filling appetizers, refreshing - but satisfying salads, hearty entrees, and rich lush desserts are standards. My personal favorites are the asian nachos and the buffalo rolls. They are both appetizers but I get time for meals all the time. This is a good place to do some family style sharing because everything is so good! Just a thought!  The Make Sures: 1. Get there early... you will have a wait. 2. Order your dessert ahead of time - they make some to order. 3. Bring an empty stomach - it'll be worth it! This is no Chicago-Style eatery in my opinion, but it is simply fantastic and worth going to if you're cruising around Michigan Ave and need a pit stop. Just make sure you plan that pit stop ahead of time if you want to munch here. Chicagoans dig it, and so do I. Great Eats with Great Seats.
