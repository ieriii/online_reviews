Coming from Hawaii to Chicago roughly 3 times a year, I feel like I've had my fair share of exploring the culinary talents that the city has to offer. On every trip, I must stop at Gilt Bar.  The hand crafted cocktails are amazing and some of the best I've ever had in my life. Ambiance is dark and quiet but vibrant at the same time. I know that doesn't make sense but come here on a Saturday and you'll know what I mean.
