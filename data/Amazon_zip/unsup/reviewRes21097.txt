Oh my god. I remember the first time I stopped in this place, thinking it was somewhat of a coffee cafe. What I came out with was a refreshing cup of Mexican hot chocolate and a few churros. Needless to say, I had to go back for dinner. Since then, I have been back several times and the food has always been outstanding. If you are lucky, you might also get the chance to see Rick Bayless behind the counter, working hard to please the line of customers. Though I would not all of the items as traditional Mexican, the selection is wonderful. Just make sure you save room for dessert!
