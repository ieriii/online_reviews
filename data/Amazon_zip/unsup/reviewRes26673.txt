MY absolute favorite restaurant! We've been going here for years. The best cheap, authentic Mexican food in Chicago. The Sabinas Frijoles, FREE appetizers... yes I said FREE! Freshly made chips, Fajitas, Mole....etc. Its all so very good. Its a very inexpensive place to treat yourself to a truly filling meal. Its also BYOB!
