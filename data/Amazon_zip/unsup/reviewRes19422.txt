I really want to like Coast, and at one point 2 years ago, I did. But it's time to break up. And it's you, not me. I love BYO places. And I love sushi. Which is why I used to be in love with Coast. But now the maki rolls are mediocre, the noise is deafening, and the diners are obnoxious. They do not enforce their "one bottle per two people" rule which results in gaggles of sad, drunk, single girls having a girls-night-out, during which everyone yells and cackles in ear-drum cracking decibels at a table five inches away from yours. In addition to the overly-loud atmosphere, it is too dark to read the menu and to see what you are eating, which might be a good thing, since their food has gone down-hill. Since I have had to end my relationship with Coast, my new fave BYO sushi place is Wasabi on Milwaukee. Their maki rolls are much better, their prices are similar, its not that far away, and I don't leave wishing I had punched the drunk girl sitting at the next table.
