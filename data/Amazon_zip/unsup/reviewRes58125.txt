Interesting place - Here's my opinion...Went there on 1st date and was very happy with atmosphere and overall vibe of room. The place is beautiful. As far as the food, it's not an easy menu to order from and I didn't have a real good connection with the waiter. I started going with a few of his recommendations and was not happy.Very strange that our coats were tossed on top of the hostess stand -Bottomline I had a nice time - glad I went, doubt I'll go back.
