I just discovered this little gem of Southern comfort. It's a sweet restaurant after my own heart. After all, I am from the south and will proudly admit there are times when I really miss it. My date and I began with appetizers. My fried green tomatoes were perfect - crispy, not greasy and so flavorful. I had some kind of chicken dish with lots of pecans and mustard for my entree. The chicken itself was delicious. The rice it was paired with was odd. I don't think that rice was the most ideal pairing. Drinks were strong. Service was attentive. I will even go so far as to say our server was a bit cute. Yes, cute. All of twenty-five years-old cute but cute. The decor is a little off. I'm not quite sure it goes with the theme, but whatever. I'm there for the food, and it was great.
