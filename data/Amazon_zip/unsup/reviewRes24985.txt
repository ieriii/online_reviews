after returning from our honeymoon in costa rica & now living close to irazu we thought it would be an excellent opportunity to put their food to the test....... it did not disappoint! my husband got the arroz con pollo & i ordered the casado & we were both really impressed at how delicious & authentic it was. they didn't skimp on the salt like they do at las tablas ever since it became popular. we also split the tostones (more like patacones) con mojo which was pretty good but i'd much rather have them plain & salted. we felt like gluttons as we peddled home yet we had enough left over for another meal. we also took home a huge bottle of lizano (YUM) which cost less here than in costa rica
