I would have to say that was a pretty good pizza! But... considering I come from San Francisco, Land of the Awful Pizza, and I've never been to Chicago before, I really have no gold standard against which to measure really great Chicago style pizza. For all I know, the locals could say this place sucks (they did). I was quite annoyed when the waiter told me that my mushroom stuffed pizza would take 45 minutes, when the place was empty, but that one of the pre-made individual pizzas would take only 15, unless I wanted mushrooms in that, in which case it would take 35 minutes. WTF??? Well at least he warned me. So I got the spinach stuffed individual pizza and it was very good. But I really wanted mushrooms. WAAAAAAAH! Super cheap though...
