Every single item that I have ordered from here has been amazing. The wings are huge and the sauces they have for them make them taste unlike any other wing I've had before. The bowls are HUGE, probably meant for 2. They will last you for lunch & dinner. The best was the steak sandwich, a little sloppy so just make sure you're eating it by yourself b/c it will get messy. Anyone that complains about this place should be waterboarded on site.
