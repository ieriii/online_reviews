Loved it! I've been biking past Iruza for a year now drooling at the outdoor patio and wishing i was there. Tonight we finally had a chance to appreciate the warm summer night and indulge in the Costa Rican offerings. Service was on top of it. We were promptly seated and served chips, salsa and water. My glass never sat for a minute less than half full. I ordered a breakfast dish with Costa Rican Rice, eggs and fried plantains ($6.50 - for a heaping mound of food) My boyfriend had the Bistec Tico ($13.50) We also ordered a mongo-lime smoothie special. (yum!) Everything was very good, although a little on the salty-greasy side. It's BYOB so come prepared to relax and enjoy the great outdoors. yay summer!
