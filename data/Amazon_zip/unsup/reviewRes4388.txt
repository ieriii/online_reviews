The Green Mill is a staple point of Chicago rich with history and tradition.  I have heard about these secret tunnels that Capone and other gangsters used when leaving for "appointments." I don't know if they actually exist or not, but would love to take tour if they are in fact real. Awesome vibe inside and great place to experience the original slam poetry, swing and jazz music. I will have to admit that the slam poetry has lost some of it's crowd participation over the years. If you go there often, you'll know what I mean. I was lucky enough to be picked for a judge a few weeks ago and enjoyed it a lot. If you don't like being put on the spot in front of the WHOLE crowd, don't be a judge! You will get booed and heckled for bad scoring, as I was on a few times. I appreciated all of the performers, but will admit some of the poetry readers seemed a bit too nervous. If you are going to read, be prepared!  Bring some friends, have some drinks and have a good time.
