I'm so conflicted by this bar. On the one hand, the beautiful decor, (stained glass windows? seriously?) fireplace, the amazing, amazing baked macaroni and cheese my friend ordered, quality beer selection and the cozy booth we were seated in is great, ....but on the other hand I can't help but feel the pretentiousness oozing from the walls. Irish pubs are supposed to be all about authenticity, and this place is anything BUT. Its too new, too manufactured, too yuppie, too Lincoln Park. But hey- if your target demographic is 25 year-old women from Naperville living in LP, they love that s**t, so its dead on. You know, for girls who don't know any better. In addition, the BLT was a disappointment. At an Irish bar, the bacon should be thick, salty Irish bacon, not grilled peppered ham. I've worked at an Irish bar. I know what it should taste like, thankyouverymuch. To sum it up, I'll go back, if I'm thirsty and in the neighborhood, but Wilde would definitely not be a destination, and especially not on a weekend.
