If I had written this review a year ago, I would have given Irazu a much higher rating, but my recent experiences there have been subpar, hence the low rating. When I first started coming here, I usually ordered the veggie burrito, which was/is a great value--a huge burrito for under 5 bucks. However, I feel like something has changed in the taste department. I used to think this was one of the better burritos I've had, but on my most recent visit it was simultaneously way too spicy and incredibly bland somehow. Also, parts of it were hot and parts of it were cold, which was annoying. On another visit some months ago, I had a shrimp and rice dish that was also disappointing. The shrimp were not cooked well and the dish overall was pretty bland. I will say that the shakes here are pretty good. My boyfriend had a vanilla shake recently that was quite delicious. All in all, however, I feel like Irazu has gone downhill. At this point, I probably will not be returning.
