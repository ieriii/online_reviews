I am a little slow in doing my yelp reviews but here goes... We went here for my wife's birthday in July and having now been to what some may consider the big three in Chicago (Trotter's, L2O and Alinea), I can truly say that Alinea is far and away the best dining experience in Chicago. From a pure flavor experience, you are dealing with an outstanding restaurant but it is the creativity and uniqueness that separates Alinea. Having the centerpiece of the table being greens that later get incorporated into a dish was a surprise and the truffle explosion while being an Achatz standby was a fantastic bite among others. We will be back to Alinea to see how they can surprise us next.
