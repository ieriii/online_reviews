A few friends and I stumbled upon Chicago q and we are very happy that we did. First of all, the BBQ is reasonably priced and tasty.  I rec the Beef Brisket with fries. The bun is simply amazing. Be sure to liberally use their 4 bbq sauces! My gf had the Half rack St. Louis Ribs with cole slaw. It was enough to satisfy her, which is saying alot. The decor was really classy for BBQ. Almost too nice, but it made for a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience. The service was super attentive. My water was never more than half empty.  Go here if you can! p.s. Love the (complementary) chips and pickles! never thought iId say that.
