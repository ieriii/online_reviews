great little sushi place, all the rolls i've had are always fresh and really tasty. Last time i finally tried one of their "bowls". It's a big bowl with rice and veggies and meat and you mix it up with sauce, kind of like a korean bibimpap-type-of-thing. Super super great flavor explosion party in your mouth!!  Also, love their art pieces on the wall.
