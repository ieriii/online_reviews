LOVE LOVE LOVE Cafe 28! I happened to live nearby when they opened, and some friends and I tried them out the first month they were open. O.M.G. I was immediately enchanted with their breakfast burrito and the honey jalapeno porkchop was fantastic! I love their Mojito's, and I go on record saying this is a MUST VISIT for everyone in the city who takes their food seriously and like something more exotic than Mexican Velveeta! OH yeah, try their stuffed french toast, too!
