The BEST joint for unique, gourmet hot dogs! Our hotel was in downtown so it was about a 45 minute bus ride (with 1 transfer) to Hot Doug's. Goodness gracious, the line was already wrapped around the building. We ended up waiting 2 1/2 hours until we reached the counter. And lo and behold, it was Doug himself! He was a really nice guy and kinda took his time taking our order - no wonder the line was moving so slow. C'mon Doug, you need to think of a more efficient system so your customers aren't wasting their entire afternoon to grab a few hot dogs.  The Uber Garlic Pork Sausage and Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage are to die for - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! I also tried The Atomic Bomb, which was only ok. Everyone raved about the duck fat fries, the reason why we went on a Friday - sorry to disappoint, but it's totally overrated. I mean it's good, but I think I'd rather go on a weekday for shorter lines. For all you tourists, a visit to Hot Doug's is a must, but make sure you arrive at least 30 min. before opening to avoid a long wait.
