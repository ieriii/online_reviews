Absolutely fantastic. I was treated to a birthday dinner here a bit ago. We started the Mascarpone Polenta with ragu of the day (pork cheek). It was so delicious! Perfectly tender, juicy pork braised in a tasty "gravy" served atop creamy polenta. YUM. We also ordered the focaccia stuffed with soft, creamy cow cheese. The focaccia wasn't at all what I expected--it was more like an authentic thin-crust pizza that was halved horizontally and then stuffed with delicious cheese. Excellent. Finally we had the swordfish which was served with braised brussels sprouts with bits of pancetta. Another standout. We also enjoyed salad and a nice Montepulciano to round out the meal. With wonderful food, solid wine, good service, and a cozy ambiance, Davanti Enoteca should definitely be on your list.
