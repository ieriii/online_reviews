The Pasta Bowl has great food for decent prices. My boyfriend and I order take out from here - Farfalle Pollo, Spaghetti al Polpette, and Macaroni al Formaggi. All the dishes were great, especially for the price - $24 for all three. I liked the Farfalle Pollo the best. The spaghetti was very good but the meatballs were just okay to me. The macaroni and broccoli was the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. Really that is me just being picky about the meatballs, all three dishes were great and much better than other pasta places we have been to.
