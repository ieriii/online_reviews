Classy, clean and just all around excellent service. I stayed at this hotel on the magnificent mile. What can I say just wonderful things about it. It is quiet yet sits on a street where there is great shopping to be had, lovely restaurants and abundance of bars to wet your whistle. They got a nice pool that cooled me down in that hot, muggy weather. I got to say this is a real nice hotel.
