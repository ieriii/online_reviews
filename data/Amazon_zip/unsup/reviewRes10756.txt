Mmmmmmmmmm pizza and beer. It's excellent! I've been here a couple of times and I always really enjoy the pizza and their brewed beer. The restaurant itself is a really great, big place with a lot of tables decorated with standard restaurant stuff. Not a ton of crap on the walls like a Friday's, but just enough decoration to make it classy. On Friday and Saturday nights this place is packed! Come early and order your pizza because you'll definitely have to wait if you're not quick.  The pizza is delicious. It's pretty reasonably priced and it's HUGE. I recommend the following toppings: pepperoni, goat cheese, spinach, garlic and black olives - either alone or any combination thereof. The crust is crisp, the toppings fresh and delicious and the pizza is always piping hot when they bring it out.  They also brew their own beer! I am a novice beer snob, but I definitely know what I like - and I like the beer at Piece. The Top Heavy and Full Frontal Pale Ale are my favorites - try a pint the next time you visit! Last suggestion: don't order the pizza carry-out. I think it's soggy and just not as good once you get it home. It's really disappointing to get that stuff home and it's just bleh. Definitely keep it in the restaurant unless you know you can eat it like 3 minutes after you take it to-go.
