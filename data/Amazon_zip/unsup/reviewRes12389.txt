This review is limited to the weekend brunch (sadly, I've never partaken in Caf 28's dinner, but I hear that it's wonderful).  Caf 28 cranks out an excellent brunch, one of the best in town. Being a Nuevo-Cuban restaurant, Caf 28 offers a number of brunch options that you may not find at the more "traditional" brunch places, but which are every bit as delicious.  The Southwestern eggs benedict, loaded with chorizo, grilled potatoes, and a spicy hollandaise, is superb. The breakfast burrito could feed a small city. Awesome French toast, stuffed with cream cheese, and topped with bananas. If you're craving a big ol' hunk of meat, the honey jalapeno pork chops with eggs will meet your needs. Service is solid, and the room is stylish and pleasant, with bright colors and original artwork adorning the walls. Waits are typically quite reasonable even during peak hours, which makes it a good choice if you are in need of immediate sustenance.
