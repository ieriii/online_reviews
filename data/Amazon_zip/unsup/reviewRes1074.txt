Hot Doug's is very popular, and very small. That means the line is long, and is very often out the door. Even in the middle of winter. Here is my philosophy about waiting in line. If you are going to a place like Hot Doug's you probably know there is going to be a wait. And once you get there, you can plainly see there is a wait. Complain all you want until you get in line. Once you're there, shut up about it already. Anyway, once you get to the counter, you get greeted by Doug, who is very friendly and patient, even though you should have had ample opportunity to make up your mind before you get there. I had the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. Because I think if you can stomach foie gras ethically, physiologically, and psychologically, you're pretty much obliged to order it. I think it's always on the menu, but I'm not sure. It was encased meat nirvana, as you might expect. Other than the long line, super nice and enthusiastic proprietor, and heavenly encased meats, Hot Doug's is your basic kitschy hot dog stand. Open limited hours, so check before you go. Cash only. I'll be back, because Hot Doug's is worth the wait, unlike that heavy metal hamburger joint with the famously long wait.
