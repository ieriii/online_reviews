OMG, Purple Pig is awesome. The place was packed and the only seats that were open was at the bar. It was squishy but comfortable. I liked that under the counter were hooks for your personal items to rest while at this eatery. The menu had many delightful items and we couldn't order everything so we decided to start with something simple. To start we had "Roasted Bone Marrow w/ Herbs", two bones hollowed with spreadable marrows with a handful of toasted bread slices topped with cilantro and onion. Next was the "Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki", both were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The dishes were small but it was well worth the cost, guaranteed. I will say that I will definitely be back for more Purple Pig delights.
