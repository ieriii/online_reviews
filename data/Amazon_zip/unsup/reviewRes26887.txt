No Sweet meat!!!! I'm talking about my Mole sauce..O.K..alright Mole is supposed to be a little sweet because of the chocolate or cocoa powder,but a good Mole sauce will be balanced by spice and a little garlic flavor..this just totally ruined my enchiladas.The place had an average amount of customers at 2pm on a Monday afternoon and a LOT of servers..just waiting around patiently for the crowd that I imagine was on its way.They gave us a complimentary chicken and potato soup as a starter then we ordered the mini steak tacos(Very average).A good taco,IMO needs NO sauces or "bucking up.": its just perfectly seasoned as is and any sauce would just make it better..but these tacos would have been MEH..without my added lime juice,salsa,and pickled veggies.I can usually taste the lime marinade in the steak meat at my favorite taco joints,but the meat here was kinda bland and could have used a marinade before grilling.So,like I said above I had the Chicken enchiladas..They were filled with shredded chicken breast..which would have been good..EXCEPT..the inside of the enchiladas were super DRY..Cooking 101 tells us that when we are using chicken breast or any white meat we MUST not overcook the meat/and Or add sauces/broth to keep the meat moist...Remember that DRY a$$ turkey that your Aunt made on Thanksgiving...yea,that's kinda like how the meat was. They could have A: Added some of that Mole sauce to the inside of the enchilada or               B:Used a mixture of chicken breast and thigh. My rice was YUMMO..The refried beans tasted unusually Strange.Not good nor bad just weird and unlike any other.I did not eat all of mine just because I can't figure em out.... The lemonade was YUM!!! And I tasted my Love's Horchata which was Awesome! He even got a large Horchata to go-it was really good. So,I'm not sure if I'll return.I think that my enchiladas would have been really good with the red sauce W extra red sauce on the side for the dry a$$ inside meat.I can't live on Lemonade,chicken soup,and Horchata.I judge all meals on whether or not I eat all of my food..and 2/3 of my meal is in the fridge for my garbage disposal fiance's belly.
