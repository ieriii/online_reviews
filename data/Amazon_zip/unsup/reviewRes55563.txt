Bongo Room would be okay if it wasn't for the hype. I mean the food is good but it's just breakfast food. I mean it's pancakes not Sushi. I really dont understand why people wait for so long to get in here. Maybe just not enough other options. Its cute inside and you can get a $9 Mimosa. Unfortunately, they hire servers at the same place as Feast and Big Star. Is there a service out there i dont know about called mean hostile servers for hire.
