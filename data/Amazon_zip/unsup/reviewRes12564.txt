Best mojitos! EVER! I love the Taste of Cuba appetizer. The ham croquets are delicious. My favorite entrees are the pistachio chicken and the ropa vieja. Both are amazing. If you are really hungry, get the jalapeo pork chops. The food and service is always good. Their brunch is good, but usually busy. It is a good place for a date but still kid friendly too.
