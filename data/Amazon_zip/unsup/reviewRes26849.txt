LOVE THIS PLACE!!! By far my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza. I didn't really feel like eating pizza but my out-of-town guest couldn't leave Chicago without trying the deep dish. We were gonna go to another more famous Chicago joint but Pequod's was highly recommended. Everything was perfect including the atmosphere. There was no wait and the service was great. The pizza had the perfect ratio of bread, cheese, sauce and toppings. Oh and the caramelized crust was soooo yummy!!! I'm definatly coming back
