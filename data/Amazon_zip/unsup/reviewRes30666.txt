I have been back in Chicago for 3 years after spending 10 years in Scottsdale, and it has taking me 3 years to get to my favorite Scottsdale restaurant here in Chicago. From the moment you walk through the door they treat you as if you own the place....  When you ask for a drink you will never worry you will be out in 5 sips. The portions are great and the food is always prepared perfectly. For a steak and potatoes girl, a petite fillet, Mastros mashed and some asparagus is the perfect trio. Topped off with some creme brulee and a decaf and Baileys.... I cant think of anywhere I would EVER rather eat!
