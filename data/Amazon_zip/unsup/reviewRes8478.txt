Best Prosciutto e Rucola pizza in town. It's been our favorite here for years - so naturally we tried it at one of the new "hot" spots in River North, because it was nearby. New place? Did not come close to the finesse and freshness here. The owner and staff are fantastic. We held a wedding rehearsal luncheon here last fall and it could not have been better. Started off with Prosecco and foccacia with truffles, at the owner's suggestion. Then appetizers, several pizzas and a few different desserts. Everything was truly delicious. When we asked if anyone wanted to come back another time, they all said, I do! Ok, sorry, but you won't be sorry here.
