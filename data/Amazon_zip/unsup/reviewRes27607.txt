I must say that all the hype is true...I was expecting mediocre Mexican food, I mean its Mexican food, I eat it all the time how much better can it get? But Chef Rick Bayless really knows what he's doing. It's Mexican food to the next level. I can't even explain how good and flavorful everything was! If you are interested in trying this place out, what are u waiting for?! You'll def love it! I recommend the Blue Agave Margaritas (if your like me and love lime n salt), the enchiladas stuffed with carnitas and topped with tomatillo salsa and the queso fundido with mushrooms as an appetizer. The only downside was the long wait and the hostess had a major stuck up attitude - but once we sat down to eat I forgot all about that! It was totally worth the wait. Kudos to Rick Bayless!
