A girlfriend and I went here for dinner and sat in the bar as we wanted a more energetic atmosphere. The service, food, ambiance, and wine were all fantastic. My only disappointment was the amount of meat in the lobster appetizer - perhaps I simply wanted more as I enjoyed it so much. For a more intimate experience I would suggest sitting in the dining room.
