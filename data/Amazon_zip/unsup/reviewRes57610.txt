I love this place. Great for romantic evenings or for just a fun meal. Great wines and the veggies and meat are always fresh and great quality. They also half half bottle of wine nights and if you sign up for their mailing lists on their webpage you get a buy one meal get one free for birthdays, anniversarys etc.
