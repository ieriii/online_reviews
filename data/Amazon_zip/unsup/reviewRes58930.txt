This "trendy" place will go out of business for the usual reasons:Over hyped food. Extremely loud and uncomfortable atmosphere.Rude Host staff.Overpriced drinks $7.00 for a soda!Sushi that does not stack up to that prepared by authentic Japanese Chefs.The food was ok- maybe even good, but not to put up with the throngs of 30 something wannabees.
