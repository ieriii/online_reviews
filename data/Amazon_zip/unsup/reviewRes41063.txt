Ummm.....the food was awesome. Literally. I had the truffle omelet and toast. The whole thing was amazing. I felt the establishment itself was too classy to pick my plate and lick it...but I really did consider it. My three friends were equally as happy with there food...the only problem was the service. We had to ask for water...and when he brought the water, we asked for coffee and 15 minutes had passed before we got it. Also, they broke service, meaning some of us were served food and other had to wait an additional eight or so minutes. Perhaps our bad service was the result of only one waiter serving the entire outdoor area so perhaps request an inside spot!
