I came for the lunch buffet and really enjoyed it. The tandoori chicken, which they bring to your table when it's hot and sizzling out of the oven, is amazing. The rest of the variety is good. Although you pay more than you would elsewhere (around $15/person if I recall correctly), the ambiance makes up for it. The inside decor is classy and clean; you're definitely not in a dive or mom n' pop restaurant.
