I was attracted to Big Jones because I thought that the menu was unique to the neighborhood and that it stood out in that overwhelming row of restaurants. And of course the Daily Candy suggestion didn't hurt! We went on a busy Thursday night but were quickly seated. Our server was very friendly and gave great suggestions. All of the food was presented well-you could tell that everything was put on the plate with care and garnished nicely. The appetizers were delicious-we had a Crab & Wild Mushroom Pie which was like a savory empanada. We also had the Potato Herb Croquettes which just melted in my mouth.  I didn't think the Pickled Bean Salad sounded appetizing on the menu but I am glad my husband was adventurous because it was one of the highlights of the meal. I had the house salad which was fresh, but not as tasty as the other salad.  My husband ordered the Tallgrass Beef Burger and it was delicious! I would totally go back for that. And I will quite confidently say it was the best macaroni and cheese ever. I had the Baby Back Ribs which were cooked well-pulled right off the bone and nicely seasoned. And we loved that Plenty (fried onion, potato, okra medley.).  I will say that the peach fried ice cream was a little bland, but the mud pie was rich and delicious.  I have read the other reviews and I hope people give this new venture a chance.  I was a little leery of going to a brand new place but was really pleased with the experience.  For being new they had a lot of things going right and I think that with a little time this place could really be fantastic.
