I adore every single thing about this place. The crepes are to die for! The veggie soup, however, is something so delectable I will drive 45 minutes for that alone. I cannot help but order a hot mint and honey tea every time. For the plebeians out there, crepes aren't only about strawberries and cherries. Although they have sweet crepes too, go outside the limits of your imagination and build your own savory crepe. Figs, arugula, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, roasted peppers, fresh heart of palm... That's it! I'm going tonight.
