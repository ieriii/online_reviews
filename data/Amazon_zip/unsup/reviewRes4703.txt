If you like over-salted food, then this place is perfect for you! The menu reads nicely but the food doesn't match up to its descriptions. All the flavors are there, but if they'd pull back on the salt it would be so much nicer. Overall, I was disappointed. On the positive side, there are many small dish options which makes it easy to find something for everyone in a large group. But only if everyone in the large group is really into salt.
