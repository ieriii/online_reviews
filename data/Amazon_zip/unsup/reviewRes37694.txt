The bar gets three or more stars - great service, great selection. The dining room, on the other other hand, is suffering. The service was mediocre at best. However, this should be attributed to mismanagement, rather than any failing on the part of the wait staff: there just aren't enough people on staff to service the size of the room. You are moving up, Hopleaf; take the necessary steps. Also (and I would've preferred to send this as an email rather than a Yelp, but there is no email function on their website); I got a burned sandwich. Fine, it's Saturday, it's a rush, I get it. But the wait person tried to tell me it was dark bread and should taste different. First, I'm not a complete stooge. I know the difference between burned toast and black bread. Second, it's fucking burned. Like, black. It should never have come out of the kitchen like that. So, three stars on the bar; zero on the restaurant.
