I've been going to Sabatino's since my wife and I started dating in 1975. She's been going there since her family moved into Old Irving Park, in the early '60's! That's 50 years for her, 36 for me, folks! It hasn't changed in any significant way in that entire time, save for an expansion. We can still sit at the same table under the plastic grape arbor, with the wine barrel head in the wall, that we held hands at when we were dating. And that's not such a bad thing. Where else are you going to get forgotten classics like Steak Diane or Bananas Foster prepared at your table, I ask? And prepared well, too! If there is a quintessential Chicago Italian restaurant, this is it. And the menu has been updated, and includes seasonal specials, so it's not strictly old school, but if you want old school, I can't think of a better place to go.
