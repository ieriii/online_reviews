This is my third time to be here. I remember that the first two time, I had the stew lamp and it is really great. (I don't eat lamb usually, but I can eat loooots of lamb meat here). The third time I had another lamb dish because the stew one is not on the daily special menu. It was not that good though. The "fire cheese" is a must order, and it is entertaining!!!
