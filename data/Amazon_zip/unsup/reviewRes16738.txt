I love Indian food and India House did not disappoint. The ambience is elegant, but not overstated. I had the chicken paneer and the spinach cream sauce was excellent. My wife had the chicken tikka masala. She doesn't like spicy food, but the sauce was very mild. I will definitely try to go back to India House the next time I am in Chicago.
