Yep, I'm giving this one 5 stars. The food is good, however it's the experience that really blows me away. I've been here too many times to count both sober and wasted (it's open till 3am). Let me first start out by saying that the service is absolutely TERRIBLE unless you go with someone that speaks Korean. To get the best experience go with 4 or more people and get two orders of raw meat (if you get 1 order it comes precooked and there aren't many sides). I've had the Kalbi, Bulgogi, Chicken, Pork and Octopus and they are all good. THEN, they bring out a fire and you grill your own meat while munching on the 30 sides (potatoes, kim chi, seaweed, lotus root, etc) that are scattered across table (it's family style). Try the pork stew, it's good. I promise, you will leave stuffed, satisfied and smokey!
