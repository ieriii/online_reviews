I love this place! The ambiance is such that I feel as comfortable coming here for a family brunch as I do for a nice date night. The best meal, in my opinion, is the shrimp and grits. They melt in your mouth, and the shrimp is perfectly cooked. The tea menu is extensive, and I love the cornbread too. Service is pleasant, but I've also had slow service during moderately busy times in the past. I was surprised to see a couple recent bad reviews. When digging a little deeper, I realized that R.N has never given more than 2 star ratings to any business, and doesn't even like the Sweedish Bakery down the block! Seriously, who doesn't like that place? Ahhh...haters always gonna hate.
