I'm a fan. I would go back b/c I love Vietnamese food, the place is BYOB, and in Lincoln Park off Lincoln... great location by all the bars and nightlife to hit up after eating. The wait staff is very friendly and accomodating. There is NO CORKAGE FEE! :) As a matter a fact, the minute my waiter noticed I had a grocery bag of wine he took it from me immediately and iced our wine and poured everyone a glass. Got to love great service! I brought 2 out of town friends here and we had a great time. The place is small but in a nice intimate way. I read past reviews saying the place gets too packed. I could see how that would happen but we went on a Saturday night at around 9pm for a late dinner and the atmosphere was perfect for catching up with friends you haven't seen in a while.  I had the Lemongrass beef that you roll up into spring rolls--- super yummy! (~$8) The beef was cooked perfectly and the plate of condiments was great for people to pick and choose what they like in there spring rolls. I know my friend hates cilantro so she could leave it out, whereas already rolled spring rolls always have it inside. For my entree I had the lemongrass chicken (~$10) b/c I was craving something spicy w/ rice. It was OK. I would have liked it to be spicier and with more chicken and lemongrass flavor. I eat a lot of Vietnamese food and I've definitely had better but the dish was good. It actually kind of tasted like Chinese lemon, peppered chicken in a good way---- that's just not what I thought I was ordering. Anyway, yes, I WILL BE GOING BACK. Simply it is a cute place in a great spot with great prices. Great for taking a date and hanging out with friends over a bottle of wine. The portions are great for the price and you could easily serve the dinner family-style w/ everyone sharing and tasting all dishes ordered. Great BYOB in Lincoln Park.
