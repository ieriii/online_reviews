After reading a bunch of great reviews i thought 50/50 was a sure fire hit - fraid not. The beer selection is okay, the menu is great but quality down-right sucks and the service we had that night was horrible. The atmosphere is that of a loungey sports bar - not as dank as a typical sports bar but also lacks enough LCDs to comfortably watch any game. The food comes labeled as "fine-dining bar food" and for a bar theres a great selection but it sucks. The mini burgers are $3 each and a normal guy would need atleast 3 to fill up. The mac n cheese tastes like crap. On top of all of this, the service blows though that really depends on the waiter/waitress. Our waitress sent the same incorrect plate to our table 2 times. Begrudgingly we paid our dues with cash and some on credit and left. A few weeks later, we notice on our credit card statement she charged us the full amount and possibly pocketed the cash. Good thing management works quick.
