Years ago this was my #1 lunchtime pizza spot. I loved the fact that they sold deep-dish, pan, and thin crust all by the slice, something that was very unusual for a quality Chicago pizza place. Then it seemed underrated, but now people are saying "best pizza in Chicago". That's crazy talk, IMO. I was never blown away by it like I was by the Gino's sausage, the Edwardo's spinach and mushroom (when not undercooked:-)) or the Giordano's anything. It is really solid stuff though.  Truly delicious.
