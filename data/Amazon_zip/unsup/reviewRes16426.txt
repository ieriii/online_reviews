I'm slightly afraid that this place will become douche bag central since I saw that Violet Hour was featured TWICE in this month's GQ Magazine.  I had my first visit to Violet Hour like two weeks ago. I randomly met up with some friends on a Sunday night... no douche bags present. I had three different drinks and they all were amazing. I love the little glasses and pitchers they serve the drinks in. I also love the cozy booths and tall back chairs. It's the perfect setting for casual conversation. The bathrooms were clean too. I don't care who you are, everyone can appreciate a clean bathroom.  Drink # 1 = Summer Sidecar ... excellent! Drink # 2 = Summertime Old Fashioned ... excellent! Drink # 3 = Champagne Cocktail ... very good!  Go visit this place with some great friends and enjoy the cocktails. Hopefully the douches won't be there.
