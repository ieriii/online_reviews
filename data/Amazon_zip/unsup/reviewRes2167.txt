Large Variety, that is why I give it 5 stars, if you don't like one style, you will definitely find your dog within time. Love all the toppings they put on the dogs, the different types of meat, and atmosphere. Insane long line though! Ya, and just for hot dogs, i was waiting about 30-40 min until i was able to order my dogs, but......its worth it if you find your right dog.
