I feel like I could either keep this brief or write 6 pages. Suffice it to say that this is a thoroughly top-notch dining experience in every dimension. My tongue got whiplash from the tastebud roller coaster of this meal. The finest of fine dining I've ever had. Pay no attention to the celebrities you will no doubt be dining with.
