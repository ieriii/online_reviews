There is a reason that this place has won the James Beard Foundation Award. The food and service is superb. We ate outdoors on a beautiful June day and found it much to our liking. The food is well prepared and you leave wanting to go back again. It is owned by famed chef Rick Bayless who is the brother of Skip Bayless of ESPN and sports journalism fame. Great food and great atmosphere. Not only was the food good but so was the people watching. I will make sure to go back again the next time I visit Chicago.
