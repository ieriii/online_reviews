Garcia's is a fine mexican restaurant in Lincoln Square. So fine, in fact, that I suggest you stop reading this review, and go there now. I mean it. Haven't left yet? Well, here's why you should. 0) The corn tortilla chips and salsa is good, but don't over-eat what they bring; this would be a strategic mistake. 1) Portions. With the dinners, you get a good size of rice, beans, and condiments (lettuce, sliced tomato, etc.). The burritos are delicious and large. They also have some dinner platters. I had the Pechuga de Pollo, and can honestly say the chicken was some of the best I've had at any restaurant. 2) Price. For food of this quantity and quality, you wouldn't mind paying twice what they charge. Luckily, if you're like me, you only pay half of what you expect. Summary: the place is cheap. 3) Horchata. If you haven't had it before, try it when you go. It's a sweetened rice-water beverage with spices (this description doesn't do it justice). So, go already!
