After wanting to try L & E for the past few months I was finally able to sneak in on a Sunday afternoon and sit at the bar. I didn't know they featured such a great brunch menu and had already eaten my breakfast item for the day. So, I was left with some salad choices, some appetizers and then I spotted the pork belly BLT - oh yeah is all I can say. This is one of the best sandwiches I've had and certainly nothing like the plain old BLT you may get at a diner. The sandwich is on the right type of bun, perfect lettuce choice and of course the Bacon - yes it deserves a capital B - was amazing. With a stack of fantastic fries, a super friendly staff and a whole bunch of items I didn't get to try, I'll be back. Once I have dinner there I may add another star.
