I LOVE Piccolo Sogno. The two main reason I love this place are as follows: 1. The outdoor patio. It's GORGEOUS! You almost forget that you are at the corner of Halsted and Milwaukee and not in Italy... Except everybody speaks English. I've been a handful of times and intend to spend many more summer evenings out there. 2. The desserts are DIVINE! Don't miss the lava cake with the homemade hazelnut gelato with toasted hazelnuts. HOLY SH&T it's amazing. P.S I'm pretty sure it has a different name. So, why one star off? This last time that I went our waitress was a little slow. And I REALLY wanted that glass of wine that I ordered with my pasta. It would have gone perfectly. We all are allowed an off night though, certainly not an offense that will stop me from returning! Check this place out, or don't.... I don't care! It would be easier for me to get a seat on the patio! ;)
