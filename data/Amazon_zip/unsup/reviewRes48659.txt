I've been here twice... The first time was a few years ago... It was February and we just got into Chicago... It was late, and there was a wet snow falling... We were wandering aimlessly looking for a place to eat, when we came across The Publican. Inside it is elegant, but not stuffy. We were dressed "California casual" in designer jeans and shirts, where most of the other diners were "Midwest casual" in their slacks and dress shirts, some with ties, who wears a tie at 10pm? In another restaurant we might have felt under-dressed, but not here. The service was excellent, and the steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection... I enjoyed myself so much on that visit, that I made a point to go back on my next visit. I wasn't disappointed. Dressed "California casual" I had another terrific steak. I will definitely go back the next time I visit Chicago.
