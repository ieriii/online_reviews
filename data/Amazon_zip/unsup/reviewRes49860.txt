i stumbled across this place while attending the renegade art festival on 9/8/2012. i'm a burger guy, so i was anxious to try what they called the "triple secret burger"... i don't quite get what the "triple" was, but this thing did NOT disappoint... this was a HUGE burger - over an inch thick and larger than a dvd... i ordered it topped with lettuce, tomato, bbq sauce, and pear slices, which was an unusual topping but it gave the burger a really refreshing flavour... i ordered it with a side of waffle fries, which was also huge... (actually after that meal, that was the only thing besides breakfast that i ate the rest of that day - it was really filling!)... the service was quick and friendly... and the outdoor seating was great because it allowed me to bring my dog... (very important to us dog people)... the money i paid was well worth what i got... the only thing that prevents me from giving this 5 stars is the atmosphere... i prefer a more subdued dining experience... the music playing from inside the bar was really loud, and the music competed with the baseball game they had playing on the big screen tv's, which were also turned up way too loud....
