There are three components to this incredible cocktail bar that I appreciate. The first thing is music. This bar plays a who's who of the indie scene most nites and does so at a volume that is just loud enough for me to soak in the great music and maintain a conversation. If you are a music indie lover and looking for a nice place to enjoy a great drink I highly recommend this place. Secondly, I love the staff (although the last server I had was a bit off her game). Most people go to this bar when it is busy on a Friday or Saturday nite, but I recommend going there on a week nite and sitting at the bar. The bartenders are incredibly friendly and informative -- this is especially useful for the novices like myself. Third, I love the intimacy. Gentlemen, look no further than the violet hour if you are looking to take a lady out on a nice date. The high chairs, the lighting, and decor of the bar creates an environment that will help set the mood for a great nite. Oh I forgot to mention the drinks. They are simply the best in Chicago and despite other reviewers comments on here rival those of other establishments in DC and NYC -- in my humble opinion.
