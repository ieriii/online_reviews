First of all, lets talk about Taylor street. WOW, beautiful street. I hadn't been there in years and was really impressed with the area. Secondly, the food was excellent from the Truffle toast to the polenta board. But ABOVE ALL, the burger ! I love a good burger and this was up there with some of the best I have ever had. The cheese was excellent and the bacon jam rocked my world. The waiter told us they would be opening a large patio in the back this Summer and I look forward to checking it out again Al Fresco.
