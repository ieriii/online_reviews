I have to admit I am addicted to sweets. I love Alliance. They have an awesome red velvet cupcake. They are one of those special bakeries that can come up with a dessert that is both elegant and delicious. Their pastries really melt in your mouth. I would like to go there more often, but parking is often difficult to find. :(
