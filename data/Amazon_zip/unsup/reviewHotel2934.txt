It's tough to distinguish between the many 3 1/2 - 4 star hotels in Chicago, but I really enjoyed the Sheraton and think it compares favorably with all the others in its class.  The lobby and room decor is contemporary and very inviting. The valet and front desk staff were appropriately friendly and attentive. The bedding was exceptionally comfortably although it was the softest mattress I've experienced in a long time. It's really too soft if you need a firmer mattress. The biggest advantage is the location. Our view from the 30th floor on the river side was outstanding. We could see up and down the river and could see the lake and much of the loop. While the hotel is several blocks off of Michigan Avenue, it's an easy walk to all of the Mag Mile, Millenium Park, Navy Pier and State Street. I've noticed that the Sheraton's room rates are normally at the higher end of comparable properties, but we got a great rate with parking included. This made it an especially good experience. Unfortunately, they got our bill wrong, but a visit to the front desk got it easily corrected. Overall, I'd say the Sheraton is worth a visit, and if you can get it for a deal, it's definitely a worthwhile place to stay.
