We came here for the inital meeting of our newly formed Supper Club. It's really fabulous, I highly recommend forming your own supper clubs. Anyways, this was our first stop and half of our group had been here before, half of us were newbies. I had read on Yelp that the margaritas and salsa are phenom. And they were. I should have stuck with the chips, salsa and a pitcher of margaritas and it would have been heavenly. I got the tostadas suizas, one with beef and one with steak. It looked like at one point cheese had been melted on top of the tostadas but by the time they came out, the cheese had all congealed again. (Sorry I hate that word, congealed but I'm coming up blank.) Bummer, because that's really the awesome part about things that have "suiza" in their name.  The meat was totally overflowing from the tostadas so there was not a chance I was going to be picking them up to eat. Everything tasted great it's just that cheese that put me off a bit. Rice and beans were yummy and I was full and drunk so mission accomplished. Overall the restaurant was nice and we didn't have a single problem with service like others seemed to mention. Just skip the suizas.
