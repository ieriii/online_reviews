Sprout is amazing! Everyone seems to be raving about brunch, but dinner was the bomb! We all tried something different and every dish was incredible. The foie gras - I wake up in the middle of the night craving it! And the desserts - couldn't decide which one was the best since they were all delicious. I highly recommend!!! And Dale was kind enough to come out and take a picture with me, which completely made my day. You have got to try Sprout. You will love it.
