I went with friends here for dinner and absolutely loved it. The atmosphere is so relaxed with interesting artwork on the walls. The service was great. the food was great. We ordered a beautiful crocodile roll, a tasty sex on the moon, tom yum kung fried rice, wonderful special items and much more... delicious !Indie is still BYOB, they recently had their liquor license but there is a very tiny corking fee. Indie is definitely our valued restaurant, we also signed up for Indie Diners Club Cards, what's a good deal! we won't stop going back for sure.
