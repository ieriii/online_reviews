So one of the new places to be in Chicago, as a New Yorker that loves restaurants Sunda lives up to the hype. When we arrived it was very crowded, with a hip and good looking scene. One drink at the bar and seated at the sushi bar for dinner. Waitress was very good, knew the menu well and didn't rush us at all. Had a variety of different appetizers and specials, plus sushi, and everything was great. Tuna tataki, yellow-tail jalapeno... they do it right. It is a little loud but that is what I would expect in a hip, trendy, popular place. One of the best dining experiences I had in Chicago and cant wait to go back.
