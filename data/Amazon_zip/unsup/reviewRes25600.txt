SO FREAKIN GOOD!  everytime i go back home to milwaukee i make sure to get down to chicago to visit friends.. and we ALWAYS go to geja's.  you do end up reeking when you leave .......but it is soooo worth it. and yeah, its pricey... but it is soooo worth it. and yeah the parking sucks..... but it is soooo worth it it doesnt even compare to the melting pot...yuck.
