I have to write an update because I went again tonight with my fabulous dinner club ladies and it was just as delicious as the first time I went. Seriously, the ma po tofu - good. The mushrooms in oyster sauce - good. The salt & pepper seafood combo - good. The crispy shrimp in mayonnaise sauce - good. And when I say good, I actually mean mouth watering, want to lick the plate, stuff myself silly, good. The food here is just top notch in my book (and I now have about a dozen dinner guests I've gone with to back me up on that opinion). Also, just a note on the service. Yes, you will probably have mutliple people waiting on you, but it doesn't mean the service is bad! Just make eye contact or flag down anyone walking by and they are more then happy to help you. Its a different type of service yes, but bad service, no. And, I learned that they do allow BYOB. $10 per table - not so shabby if you are like me and my friends and bring 4 bottles for 4 people :-) So, not sure what you are waiting for. Go, enjoy!
