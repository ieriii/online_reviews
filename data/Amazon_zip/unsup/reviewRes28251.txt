Three words: authentic. delicious. inexpensive. Mexican restaurants can often underwhelm, but Nuevo Leon does not disappoint. The gratis chips and salsa include three (not just one) salsa options and the guacamole was very fresh and heavy of the avocado (rather than cheaper fillers). The menu is packed with tasty options (although vegetarians may find the list a bit lacking) and the BYOB and low prices really cut down on the cost; however, make sure to bring cash. I personally enjoyed the quesadilla appetizer (drenched in some sort of amazing verde sauce) and the stuffed poblano peppers.  Happy eating.
