I've gotten sick after eating there twice now! Thought it may have been a fluke the first time (there were many other things I ate that day) but the second time everyone at the table had issues! I wasn't violently ill but I know not to take the risk now! It's to bad too because i liked the whole atmosphere and service.. just my experience take it as you may..
