This place is everything I dream of a breakfast place being. My friend and I were totally undecided at noon on a Saturday about where to go for brunch. We were riding our bikes somewhere else when we approached it and I yelled STOP!!! My friend had mentioned how good this place was the day before. The wait was nothing. Maaaaybe 15 minutes. I like the size. I really appreciate how they have so many 4top tables that are only seating 2 people. It makes it far less crowded than most of the brunch places in this city. I have only amazing things to say about this place. I ordered some kind of smoothie with bananas and nonfat frozen yogurt and hazelnut and it was amazing. I got the standard two-egg breakfast and everything was as perfect and simple as you could hope for. The reds are sooooo good. Amazing fresh jams. Super good coffee. Everything cooked to perfection. And there are so many things on the menu I want to try. And they have a juice bar. I heart you Meli.
