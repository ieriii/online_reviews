Went here for the duck last week. Yum!! It is most definitely not a fancy place. I was a bit nervous when I first got there. But as I sat waiting for my friends to arrive, I noticed that there was a good mix of people. There were native Chinese as well as regulars from the area. Both of which are a good sign. The staff are so friendly and very attentive. The duck is definitely the way to go! Just don't forget to pre-order it. And their buns are excellent! We also had the shrimp stuffed eggplant. It was all super yummy!!
