Have only been here for brunch and I have only been disappointed once The good -Duck hash - great duck flavor, not gamey, but maybe too oily for breakfast? But yum! -Chicken and waffles - yummmmmm. Not your traditional chicken breast in a cereal crust. Almost like a popeyes fried chicken but larger, crispier, and served with a sweet and savory waffle and sweet potato hash. Sometimes the chicken can FEEL raw, but it's cooked! It's just the way they prepare the chicken -Peeky Toe Benedict: my fave dish for brunch b/c it's not heavy, it's fresh crab and is lightly topped with a subtle and not heavy hollandaise sauce. I usually HATE hollandaise and ask for it on the side. No need to here! - Whole hog crepinette - too heavy for my but my companions liked it! -French toast - it doesn't come with syrup so ask for it if you like it sweet. Otherwise, the spice truly stands out and makes for an interesting flavor on fluffy brioche DO NOT GET decontructed clam chowder - it's really just cream with 3 clams in their shell and 4 potato cubes (I counted b/c I was seriously disappointed). And it cost me $11
