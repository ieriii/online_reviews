Kinzie Chop House has a great happy hour! Awesome appetizers (I suggest the chicken skewers), great lunch options (Kinzie burger), and delicious salads (the arugula and pear is an awesome summer choice). Their steaks are very flavorful, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the location is great. If there's room, eat outside!
