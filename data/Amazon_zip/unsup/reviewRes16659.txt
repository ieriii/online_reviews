Why in Chicago are there not more "speakeasy" type places considering the city's history? I guess maybe there are more and I just haven't heard of them yet... I haven't gone to Violet Hour on a busy night, just during the week when the place is quiet and absolutely heavenly! I can only assume that when the place is crowded it is still a great place. I absolutely love the fact that from the outside you would have no idea of what lay inside, the boarded up facade a great addition. Violet Hour would not be the same with out that element of mystery. I only wish it was located in an alley or along a quiet residential street, or just somehow more removed.  The drinks, of course, are superb! In fact, I never liked gin until I came here. Not to mention, the care and expertise the bartenders prepare them with again add to the overall atmosphere of the place.
