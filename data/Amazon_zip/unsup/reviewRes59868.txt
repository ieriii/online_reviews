Very classy place with wonderful service and excellent food. My party arrived early and was seated right away. Our server Brandon was one of the best. Very attentive and very educated about the menu and the wines offered. We took up the table for three hours on a busy Friday night but never felt rushed. We ordered mussels for an app and they were very tasty. Not rubbery at all. Dinner included prime rib, kc steak and a variety of sides. The prime rib was some of the best I have ever had. Many options on the well thought out menu, the service and the overall ambience is why I list kinzie chop house as a five star. I also love gibsons but this place gives them a run for their money. Bravo!
