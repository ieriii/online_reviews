After a rough week I needed a good lunch date to get me ready for the weekend. A friend suggest XOCO and man am I glad she did. While the line was a bit long, it was well worth the wait. I got the chicken tinga and loved every bit of it. The flavors all worked well together and the chicken was tender and delicious. Yay to XOCO!
