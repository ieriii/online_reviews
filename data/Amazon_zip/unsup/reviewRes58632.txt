I was so excited to use my Geja's Groupon. Unfortunately, my three friends and I had a terrible experience at Geja's last night. We had a reservation but weren't seated until 40 minutes after our scheduled time. The space was packed and claustrophobic, the cheese fondue wasn't great (Geja's offers only one variety), and (though there was no posted notice on the menu or anywhere in the restaurant) there was a plate charge for my two friends who had come along for wine but not for food. I was embarrassed to have invited them along for such an unsatisfying experience. Next time, I'll happily take my business to the Melting Pot.
