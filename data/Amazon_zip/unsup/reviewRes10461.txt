To me this is an excellent restaurant. Have gone twice now and food has been consistently top notch. Last night had the appetizer special of parma ham, olives, pecorino cheese and roasted vegetables. Very fresh, can't get proscuitto like this in too many places. As a meal I had paparadelle w/wild boar sauce. The pasta is homemade and the meat in the sauce was so tender and flavorful. Full bodied, hearty, and seasonal. Tony (the chef) is always walking around and mingling which is admirable. The bar even made special request drinks w/Aperol. The place is on the small side so not every table's in the best spot but I really didn't mind.
