Hit this place up with a co-worker for happy hour a couple weeks ago.... Went based of the Yelp ratings. Pulled up in a cab and it took us about 10 minutes to figure out where the front door was....once we figured out that the door was blended into the wall that is decorated with grafiti, we made our way in.... This place is awesome and I definately want to go back when there's more of a scene. Drinks and service were both great and it's not the usual place I'd go to but can definately appreciate. Definately a place where you'd take a lady you want to impress. Great location with a ton of other great bar options. Agreed on the rules list - it is hilarious and classic.
