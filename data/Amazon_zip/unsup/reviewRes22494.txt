Hands down some of the best Chinese food (if not the best) I have ever had. How good you ask? *slap* DON"T ASK QUESTIONS! Let me share my knowledge with you, young padawan.  This place specializes in spicy. Right when you get your seat, they put a plate of cabbage soaked in chili oil, and fairy dusted with dried chilies. It's the perfect warm up for your meal. I ordered the chef special dry chili chicken and it was amazing. There are no less than 4 billion chili peppers in the dish and the chicken is crispy, spicy heaven.  Second I ordered the House Special Noodles, which are dry (somewhat), and coated with pepper dust. It had a ton of fresh veggies in it, and some meat. It was very delicious, and a nice component to the meal. Third, came the orange beef tenderloin which was my date's favorite. It was thinly sliced beef, fried, and then tossed in a sweet orange sauce, garnished with a sliced orange. We squeezed the orange on it and it really made the dish. It was slightly "Americanized" but hey...who gives a shit if it tastes good!  And last... and the real star of the meal....was the Dong Po Pork. Bite sized hunks of pork belly (fat with streaks of meat), braised in a killer sauce for hours. They then add fried pieces of tofu, and serve. It was one of the best things I have ever tasted....ever. It was porky, fatty, and I will forever look for it.  If you are in Chinatown and you're ready for a great, spicy, Chinese food experience, come here.
