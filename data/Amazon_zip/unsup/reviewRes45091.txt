I'd been to Anteprima last year and didn't have the best experience (thought it was noisy, slow service, and mediocre food), but after learning that an Italian friend of mine is an Anteprima regular, I thought I should give it another shot. And I'm so happy I did! My husband and I walked in on a Friday night around 7:45 p.m. without a reservation but were promptly offered a spot at the bar, which suited us just fine. We ordered the grilled octopus (with potatoes, red onion, chilis, parsley, lemon, olive oil) and fennel salad with oranges, walnuts, and parmigiano (one of the specials). Both were excellent and perfect for sharing. The octopus had a nice smoky flavor to it. The ingredients in both dishes were fresh and delicious. For entrees, we each got the smaller verison of two pasta dishes. I had the orecchiette with spicy house made lamb sausage, bitter greens, chilis, and pecorino. Even the smaller portion was still quite generous. My husband ordered the mushroom & ricotta ravioli with dried porcini cream, and parmigiano. It was nice to feel full but not stuffed at the end of our meal, and we prolonged our time by getting dessert - the cinnamon budino (sort of like a flan), which had a nice subtle flavor, and the apple walnut tart, which had a delicious crust. We had good service and although the restaurant was packed the entire time we were there (more than an hour an a half), it wasn't too loud. I am certainly going to be going back as there are a number of things on the menu I would love to try.
