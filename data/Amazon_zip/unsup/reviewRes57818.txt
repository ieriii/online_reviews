I have no idea what kind of restaurant these 1-star reviewers expected, but Nana's is THE place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning/afternoon. My girlfriend and I visit at least twice a month, and always sit at the bar to chat with the owner, her sons and the great and hilarious bartender. Service is fast and friendly, the food is delicious every time. This restaurant is EXACTLY what Bridgeport needed. Thank you Nana for opening this place!
