I usually don't review places that already have hundreds of thousands keystrokes devoted them. But I'm doing it for a specific reason. On paper Hopleaf is the kind of gastro-sassy, treat beer like wine to out snotty the guy next to you place that I would make fun of a little. I've been places with rabbit on the menu that take themselves and their station in the world a little too seriously. But I have to say I may need to reevaluate my prejudices. The place, the staff, the beer and the food were all outstanding. A friend and I wandered in around 4pm for a few beers and some food. The kitchen didn't open for an hour. The knowledgeable and articulate bartender kept us trying new things until we could order. Every beer he directed us to was perfect. When the kitchen did open we had the sausage plate and the steamed mussels Belgian style- again recommended by the bartender. Both were out this world. The sausage plate was a little small for $12 but was delicious. The mussels for two at $21 more than made up for it.  I'm usually wary of being the 1st to order from cold kitchen but it appears the back end staff don't walk in at open, they're ready to rock at open. Just great food. The whole place, including patrons, was down to earth and welcoming. I imagined snide and got neighborhood. My expectations couldn't have been more wrong. I will go out of my way to go back often.
