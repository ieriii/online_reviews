Good Vietamese Food! Great Value! Visited Simply It for lunch and ordered off of their lunch combination menu.  The chicken curry noodles were delicious. Only wish the vegetables were cut slightly smaller. Also had a strawberry mango bubble smoothie. Delicious! The lunch combo menu is available Tue-Sun from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM and includes an entree (about 14 choices), soup of the day, salad, egg roll, and steamed/fried rice (except noodle dishes), fresh squeezed lemonade/ginger iced tea/ginger hot tea, and dessert. All of this for between $7-$9 depending on your entree.  What a deal!
