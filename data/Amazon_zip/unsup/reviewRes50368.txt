*UPDATE* My wife and I went back and gave Big Jones another try. We went in for brunch on a Sunday morning and left very happy. The food was out of this world good. The complimentary beignets were to die for. I could have just eaten those all day long.  I ordered the crab cakes benedict. This is one of my all-time favorite brunch dishes and this version was one of the best I have ever had. My wife got the shrimp and grits. We both thought this dish was also quite delicious. The coffee was also great as was the service. We made reservations for 10 on a Sunday but probably didn't need them. It seemed to start to get real busy at about 10:30. This is probably our new favorite brunch place in the neighborhood (just passing M Henry).  I will admit that we probably just caught Big Jones on the wrong night before (see below). We will definitely be back. __________________________________________ I would probably give 2.5 stars due to the owner offering to pay for our appetizers. Overall our food was good. My wife and I had the crab cakes and pork belly for appetizers. Both were very tasty. Portions were quite small, especially for being $11 a piece. The remoulade with the crab cakes was especially delicious. I ordered a couple of micro brews. Both were good. My wife said her wine was delicious. I had the cassolette which had sausage, pork belly and crispy duck. My dish was fantastic and quite filling. My wife ordered the chicken and dumplings and it was above average but nothing too special. The chicken was well cooked but not too flavorful and the one small dumpling didn't add anything to the dish. My wife was hoping for something a little closer to actual chicken and biscuits for her birthday dinner. This interpretation was lighter but nothing close to the real southern original. Quite a boring dish in our opinion. The real reason for the 2 star review is the table we were seated at. Our table was seated parallel to the bar and about 2 feet from it. We spent our entire dinner staring at other peoples rear-ends and listening to their conversations. On top of that, our table was right next to the front door and it was FREEZING. The huge velvet curtains and two space heaters did nothing to warm up the area that we were sitting in. Almost as frustrating was the fact that we made reservations almost a month in advance and when my wife first got into the restaurant she said there were 2 or 3 open tables towards the back of the restaurant (I was still parking, because I would probably have asked to be moved. Once I sat down the restaurant was full). I might be able to understand being sat up front if we were walk-ins, but not when we have made reservations well in advance. It was a busy Saturday night and the front door was being opened non-stop. We were very cold all through dinner. One of the owners eventually came up to us and apologized for seating us so close to the crowd at the bar (he didn't mention the cold wind blowing across our table). He was very nice and took our appetizers off the bill. I hope the owners read this and realize that our table should not have been a table at all. It was far too close to the bar and the front door. Nobody forced to sit at that table in the middle of a Chicago winter is going to leave happy. We really felt like second class citizens after having made reservations 3.5 weeks in advance and still being sat at the front door when other open tables were available. Like I said, this was my wife's birthday dinner and we were very disappointed. We had planned to stay for coffee and dessert but were so cold by the end of the meal that we just left. A note to the owners of Big Jones, please don't seat diners between the crowded bar and the front door when it is 15 degrees outside. You can almost guarantee that anybody that you sit at this table is not going to be a return customer.
