In fairness to the restaurant, I will say that we did not have reservations. We arrived at 5:30 pm on a Saturday night, and they told us that they could seat us if we did not delay leaving after dinner. That was fine. We ordered pot stickers, which were delicious. My husband ordered pumkin shrimp and I had the beef tenderloin with aparagus. His dinner was rather bland but not bad. Althought the asparagus was very good, my beef was too salty. The staff hovered over our table most of our meal. Plates were removed before we could get our fork down. They had us out of there in 35 minutes. If seating us was such a problem, all they had to do was tell us they could not seat us.  The entire experience was very uncomfortable and we will not be returning.
