The service was excellent and the setting is a very pretty place for an upscale dinner. Some dishes were very memorable (came here in September so listing them out isn't relevant, nor do you get a choice of what to eat so the point is pretty much moot). Presentation was the same- some memorable, some I thought was the chef(s) just trying a bit too hard. There were a few bites I thought were spectacular and a few others that were forgettable. Everything else was in the middle. We did the wine tasting (which was very good but definitely not necessary) and our tab was over $1,000 for two people. I would not go back if I was paying for it, as it was good but not as good as it should have been for the price. Rating breakdown: -1 star for price: while a very tasty and interesting meal, with wine tasting I think the value of the meal is more around $700, not a thousand. My review would've been 4 stars, but: -1 star for sending me out of the restaurant the WRONG way: at the end of the meal we were asked if we wanted coffee or tea. I chose tea. I was very surprised to see a $4 charge on the bill for tea. When paying a thousand-dollar bill, being charged an additional $4 for hot water didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Just seemed- I don't know, cheap/chintzy. In my opinion this is a very dumb move by them.
