I hadn't been to Fogo in at least four or five years so I'd forgotten just how welcoming this restaurant can be. From the moment we arrived everyone from the hosts, servers, gauchos and management could not have been more solicitious. I can't remember the last time someone at a restaurant assisted me with my coat - what a breath of fresh air. The wine selection/stemwear is nice and the tables are a comfortable distance from each other, which is getting to be as rare as a 70 degree January day in Chicago! The salad bar is varied and upscale with prosciutto, shaved parmigiano reggiano, fresh mozzarella, asparagus, haricots vert, prepared salads and all sorts of roasted and raw vegetables. The popovers served tableside are cheesy and airy, but every once in a while you get one a trifle underdone. No biggie. The other accompaniments - polemta sticks, whipped potatoes and carnelized bananas - are good but a bit pedestrian. The meats are the stars and some of them really do shine. I'm a big fan of the cognac marinated chicken thighs ( juicy with crispy skin), all of the lamb chop dishes, the bacon wrapped filet, the pork ribs and the sausages. I skip the chicken breast and lesser beef dishes because I'm just not a fan of sirloins and round cuts - they're nicely spiced but not prime. I just can't eat enough to justify coming here often but I know where I'm headed the next time I feel the need for impeccable, gracious service!
