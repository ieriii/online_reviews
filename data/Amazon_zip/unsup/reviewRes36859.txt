I went here for brunch last Sunday with 3 friends (no wait at 9:00), and it was fantastic! Between the four of us, I was able to taste the Cajun Scrambler, the Fig Omelette, the Crab Cakes Benedict, and the Stuffed Apple French Toast. All I can say is, "holy wow!" The service was great, too, and my coffee was never empty. What more can a girl ask for?
