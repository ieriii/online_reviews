AAAAAAAAAAAAWESOME salad bar. I am a bigtime salad bar person, and this is one of the best around, with an interesting selection as well. I might even say it's better than Ruby Tuesday's, whose salad bar is in fact the only redeeming virtue of that chain. I also kind of dig RJ Grunts' 1970's cheeseball aesthetic. I like the '70's-era pictures of random young ladies decorating the walls. Decent service; it is what it is. I want some of that salad bar right now.
