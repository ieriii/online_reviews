I've been to The Gage, just once. I interior of the place was very classy chic, yet still had a bar feel. The food on the other hand was really not so good. The menu was full of standard American fare with a bit up of upper class flair- which to me means changing cheddar to some cheese I've never heard of etc... etc... The problem though is that it doesn't work. Instead of going, "oh that's interesting." I ended up going, "curry gravy on fries just makes the fries soft and taste like it has been standing under a light for a while". The sausages were tough and small, and I ended up paying too much for the quantity and quality I received. I gave The Gage 3 stars, just for being in such a nice location (right across from Millenium Park) with a comfortable feel. It's a good hangout...maybe for a drink. I'm sure they can't screw that up.
