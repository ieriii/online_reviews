Seems like a lot of people don't like this place. It was supposed to be pretentious, and yuppie, and snooty, and crowded. It was none of that when I went there. Saturday night, around 10:00 or 11:00, walked in grabbed a four-top right inside the front bar. Looked at the menu to see what was on tap. A good selection of varying beers was on tap, mostly leaning toward the Belgian ales, triples, and dubbles. Some standards, like Chimay, Duvel etc were there. But looking at the off-tap list was better. A lot of beers, organized sort of confusingly. Set up by country and in the case of Belgian beers in which they specialize by type. So they have an impressive list of Lambic style beers, and Belgian ales of varying sorts, but if you're looking for some type of beer in particular it could get confusing. Or if you know nothing about beer, watch out. Though the bartenders seem to point you sorta in the right direction. All of the beers were tasty for what they were. My English Bitter was good even out of the bottle, and served at the right temp. Snooty in that there are a ton of beers sure, but no more so than say a wine bar where you have no idea what the 2004 Napa Cabernet is gonna taste like, vs what does a Gueze style Lambic Cuvee Rene taste like.
