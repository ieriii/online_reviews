Wakmono is by far one of my favorite Sushi joints in the city. I have been going to Wakamono since it opened a few years ago and they have been consistently good. Their fish is always very fresh.. this is huge for me. The environment is unbeatable. It appears to be very trendy, but at the same time its very comfortable and welcoming. The adjacent lounge that they use as a waiting area/bar is also very well decorated and offers a full bar. One thing to note: If you walk in and there is no one waiting, take a glance over to the left into the lounge.. before you get to excited. They queue the majority of their tables in the lounge. I don't mind the small wait.. it's a great time to get a glass of wine and catch up before being seating.
