If there was a MadLib about Wishbone, here is how I would fill it out: Wishbone is very YUMMY. I like it because THERE IS FREE WIFI. I ordered the CRUNCHY FRANCH TOAST and it was DELISH. My companion ordered the LEMON POPPYSEED PANCAKES and they ALMOST MADE HIM PUKE BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GOOD. Plus, THE WAIT WASN'T SO BAD. Next time, i WILL GO THERE TO CURE A WICKED HANGOVER. Ok, that was stupid. But Wishbone was really good and there is a lot of seating and something called butter cake that Imran ordered in addition to his pancakes. We needed to lay down like WHOA after that meal.
