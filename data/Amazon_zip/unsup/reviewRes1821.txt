I love Hot Doug's. A friend turned me onto the place and I'm grateful to her for that. Great tasting, inventive dogs. Fun, chill atmosphere. AIl of this is offered at a pricepoint that pretty much anyone can live with. I took my dad and his wife there and they loved it too. I wish it kept more convenient hours. I also wish the location were a little more accomodating. However, in the grand scheme of things, it's a small price to pay for something that is cool like Hot Doug's.
