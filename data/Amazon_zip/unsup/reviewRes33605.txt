I went to Mia Francesca on a Friday night with 4 of my girlfriends for 7pm reservations. We were seated promptly at 7pm. As mentioned by other yelpers, the dining room is packed tight and the volume is fairly loud - but not so loud we couldn't carry a conversation with everyone at the table! Decor is simple/classy. Our server was a little slow to take our orders, but was very pleasant to deal with. Service the rest of the night was fine. The food was great. 2 of us had the Spaghetti Carbonara - a dish that is often tough to find. It was pretty good. The pancetta could have been a little better (more flavorful), but the dish was still fine.  We also had the calamari appetizer. The breading was too light for my taste, but the sauce was delicious. This is always a reliable choice in Chicago for Italian! On technical merits alone, I'd rate this a 3 - but I'll round up to 4 bcs it's consistent and reliable!
