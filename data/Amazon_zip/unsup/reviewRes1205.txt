NOW I KNOW WHY THEY DON'T HAVE FOIE GRAS EATING CONTESTS That stuff is RICH! Even Kobayashi and Chestnut couldn't scarf down more than a few of Doug's famous duck sausages with foie gras and black truffle butter. It was so intensely decadent that I think my heart literally skipped a beat. No really, I thought I was going to die for a second. Luckily my ticker rebooted and my paranoia subsided and I kept right on eating. If you haven't tried this $8 indulgence, I say go for it, but split it with a friend.  Equally thrilling was the Marty Allen (thuringer). Char-grilled to perfection and prepared Chicago-style, this was one of the best dogs I've ever had. My only regret was that it wasn't a Friday or Saturday so I could try the duck fat fries.
