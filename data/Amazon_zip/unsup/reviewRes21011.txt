Suckling pig torta was very nice and the pickled onions complimented it very well. The Habanero sauce it is served with could be addicting to those who love flavor while punishing their innards. If you're going to order that torta I recommend asking for extra onions, habenero sauce and topping it off with cheese. Overall Rick's Mexican street food rendition...5 stars. Watching Rick actually taste test and coach his team (yes he was in the kitchen!) while I waited to order...5 stars. Friendliness 4 stars. Value for the price...4 stars (where's the beef or pork for a $10+ sandwich?) Poor portion control or the cost of rent is the blame for that considering the location and the amount of staff Rick has working there during lunch. Nevertheless I much rather pay the few extra bucks for good food other than buying over priced Subway and Jimmy John's in downtown Chicago!
