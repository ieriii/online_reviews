It is A-Ok in my books. This place is nice and refreshing for Bridgeport. It is a tad bit expensive though. So most likely it will not be my go to breakfast/brunch place on a regular basis. However, I will definitely keep them in mind. The stuffed french toast was very good. Service was a bit on the slow side. I had to request coffee repeatedly before getting a refill. The people were very nice, but I guess just real busy. Nana the owner was very nice and warm as well. If you haven't been, and happen to be in the neighborhood you should check them out.
