I can't believe I've never reviewed Cafe 28. I've been here numerous times and it's one of my neighborhood favorites. Though they're probably better known for dinner, I actually prefer Cafe 28 for brunch. When I was taking classes at Lillstreet with some friends, we came here every week for brunch after class and it never disappointed.  There was never a wait and the staff is always really great. I've tried several of the brunch options, but my hands down favorite is the Southwestern Eggs Benedict. In fact, I single handedly credit this dish with my recent obsession with poached eggs. It's savory and delicious but not overly greasy/fatty like chorizo dishes can sometimes be. And the eggs are always poached perfectly. It's amazing. It's slightly pricey for brunch (entrees are around $12) but the food quality totally justifies it. I've also been here a few times for dinner. I've had the ropa vieja and, while good, I probably wouldn't recommend it - you can find better in the city. On my last visit I had the Yelp-hyped almond crusted halibut and it was really exceptional. Light, flaky, moist...so great. Once again, we didn't have a wait and the staff was wonderful. Dinner entree prices (around $20) push this into the slightly "special-occasion" range for me, but again, the quality justifies the price.  Cafe 28 is a can't miss choice for me. Street parking is easy and, if you look around a little bit, free. The food's always good . The staff is always great. Five stars.
