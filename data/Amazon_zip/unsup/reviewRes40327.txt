I always have high expectations from hole-in-the-wall places; is that weird? It was not busy but our food took a bit longer than expected. Also, the cashier ignored my question when I wanted a straw for my drink. It could be because he didn't speak English so I'll let that one slide. I tried 3 tacos, the steamed beef, steak, and tongue. The tortillas were soggy and breaking apart when I was eating it. Bad. The tongue did not taste good. Bad. The steak taco was solid. I'd come back just for that if I was in the area.
