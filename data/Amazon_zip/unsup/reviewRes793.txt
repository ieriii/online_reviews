Hot Doug's - are the hot dogs good? Yes. Are they worth the 45 minute wait? Not IME (and definitely not if you're waiting 1+ hours). As we were waiting in line, someone heading out suggested that we get the saucisson, so I saw it on the menu and ordered it. It was a bacon sausage and was it was not my favorite - the sausage was way too tough and it wasn't juicy as it should be. My bf's ribeye sausage hot dog was better and had add-ins that complemented it well, but it wasn't amazing either. We also split the foie gras and duck sausage, topped with truffle aioli and foie gras mousse. That one was better than expected, but once again, not worth the wait. We also got the duck fat fries, and I don't understand why everyone raves about them because they taste like your average fries. I give them props for draining the oil well so that they weren't greasy, but a few were already slightly soggy by the time we got our batch.
