I know I've found a good place when the food comes and silence spreads over the table, followed by voracious shoveling and groaning. Huge bowls packed with rice, meat, tons of veggies and deeeeelicious tangy slightly sweet sauce, with an egg that spreads its runny yolk goodness and takes it to a whole other level. I wished I had stopped long enough through my (huge!) bowl to think about taking half home, or to like, remember to breathe. Food comes out in about 10 min, fresh, hot and to order. The tables are huge and offer some nice communal seating arrangements, and I definitely appreciate the plethora of provided paper towels. It's clean, not too loud for such a small place, and the staff is friendly and great about answering questions. I don't even know what to say about the wings, y'all. I've had some chicken wings in my day and these are the crispiest, best cooked to crunchy perfection heavenly tangy chicken pieces I have had in forever. I have friends that still talk about them weeks later, so I'll be back for about 3lbs more of them any day now. I apologize for nothing!
