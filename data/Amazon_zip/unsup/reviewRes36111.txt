Amazing place. You don't have to put in a reservation for a Peking Duck at all. We got there and had about a 40 minute wait. After being sat down, we went ahead and placed the order for our duck. This is where the only problem came in. People that sat after us began receiving they ducks before us. After sitting waiting about 30 minutes and 5 other groups receiving their ducks before us and they sat after us, my friend said something to the manager. They were speaking Cantonese so I am not sure what all was said, but out duck came next. End of negative remarks!! The duck was fantastic. It was full of flavor, the skin was nice and crisp. This is the first time I had ever had Peking Duck and will not be my last. I had no idea they were so delicious. I didn't try the soup that came with it, but the duck fried rice was extremely delicious as well. As for the wait staff, they weren't the best but they did what they could considering how busy the place gets. If you are ever in the area and want a Peking Duck, I would highly recommend this as a lot of my friends from Chicago go to this place. The price is $49 for the Peking Duck dinner that feeds 4 people. You get plenty of food!
