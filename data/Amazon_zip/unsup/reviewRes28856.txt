Sooo when I think of Rick Bayless, oysters don't come to mind. But, wow...I had some outstanding oysters at Frontera Grill last night. The mignonette was delicious. Everything I have had at Frontera Grill has been delicious and interesting and fresh. Kudos to Chef Bayless for his creativity and his commitment to keeping a high standard for Mexican cuisine.
