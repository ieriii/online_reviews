After my second visit to Xoco, I knew I had to sing it's praises. Everything I've had so far has been amazing; Rick Bayless is a culinary genius. I had the Choriqueso which had just the right amount of kick to it spice-wise and very satisfying. Though, after taking a bite of my fellow foodie's torta, I realized that what I probably really should have gotten was the Saturday special- Barbacoa. The meat was amazingly tender and uniquely flavorful and the bread was perfection. Basically, if you're there on a Saturday- GET THE BARBACOA Also, you can't go wrong with the churros- 3 for $3 is a steal and the ideal way to end the meal. Definitely worth the wait.
