I have been here a few times just for snacks and maybe a glass of wine and I have liked their veggie dishes (not being a meat eater). I appreciate that they know how to give their vegetables a lot of flavor. I especially enjoyed a shredded raw brussels sprout dish they had a while back. On my recent visit with a friend, however, all the dishes we tried (corn salad, cauliflower, grilled green onions) were tasty but too oily. My friend actually stopped eating because of all the oil. And neither one of us are afraid of fat! Service has been ok my 3 visits, but not really that warm. I think they're just too busy to pay enough attention to people, and all 3 visits I've gone there are kind of off times, like 4 PM on a Saturday. But they're definitely crowded all the time, it seems! I suspect weekdays at odd times are much more bearable. I would come here more often for a bite if the waits weren't so crazy, but I don't know....maybe it's because I don't eat meat, but the draw isn't big enough for me to make it a destination.
