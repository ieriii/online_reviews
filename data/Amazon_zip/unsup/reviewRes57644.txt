What can I say? I've been eating here since I was a young buck. I absolutely love this place! I recently moved to Indianapolis and I have to say that one of the things I miss about Chicago is Nuevo Leon.  The salsa de molcajete is really good to start out with. There's one plate that I usually get that's not on the menu called Machitos. Machitos, consist of a carne asada, a chesse enchilada, a round grilled onion, french fries, refried beans and, a jalapeno pepper. I don't think the food has ever changed the refried beans still taste the same way they did when I was young. This place is reasonable cheap compared to other places in Chicago. The portions are large enough that at times me and my girlfriend share plates. The Enchiladas de Mole are also very good and very cheap. I know that whenever I go back home one of stop I HAVE to make is at Nuevo Leon. It's just too good to pass up.
