Just moved into the neighborhood and we were looking for pizza.  I looked here on yelp and decided to gicve Sano's a try based on the reviews here on Yelp.  We were not disapointed at all.  The pizza is wonderful, the crust delicious.  The fried shrimp were big and very tasty.  Delivery was quick and the order was correct.  I am very happy with Sano's.  I just wish the menu was bigger.
