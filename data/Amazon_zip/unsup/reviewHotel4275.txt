This is an incredible hotel. With an expansive conference center, a basement Starbucks, and nice rooms, the Palmer House is an incredible place to work and stay. They have everything from nice single and double rooms (I got to try a double room for 2 nights) to giant suites (which I didn't see, but I did see one of the suite-getters get a free bottle of water, so score there).  The hotel is also convenient to the Miracle Mile, Lake Michigan, and Millennium Park, so scenery. Overall, Palmer House is a massive win.
