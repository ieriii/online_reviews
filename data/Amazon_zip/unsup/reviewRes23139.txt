Amazing! Echoing other reviewers, LSC has the best Chinese food I've ever had. Four words--Tony's 3 Chili Chicken! This is an amazing dish. Quite spicy, of course, but it's absolutely fantastic. I also tried the Lamb in Cumin, which was also very good. The string bean with black beans appetizer was good. The flavor combination in this dish was new to me, and I enjoyed it. I will definitely be going back for Tony's 3 Chili Chicken. Bring a 6-pack of Tsing Tao and you're all set (they are BYO but also sell Tsing Tao. However, it's cheaper to bring your own. If you're like me, you'll need a bottle or two to soften the incredible spiciness!).
