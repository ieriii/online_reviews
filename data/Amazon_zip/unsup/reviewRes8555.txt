My husband and I went here for our anniversary. When I made the reservations, I mentioned that I would appreciate speaking to someone about the gluten free options - and they sent a manager over shortly after we arrived. He was extremely knowledgeable - and it is clear he's given this pitch quite a few times. The only things I couldn't eat (in the ENTIRE restaurant, not counting dessert) was the chicken (marinaded in beer), the tabbuleah (salad bar), and the salad dressings (they are not all made in house, so they aren't certain they are gluten free). I also avoided the sausage because it was on a skewer right next to the chicken legs and some of the meat was touching (plus, I think the same serving utensil was used for both items). And the most exciting thing? I could eat the bread. No problems afterward. Service was excellent and prompt, meat came at a SANE rate - there was time to eat what I'd gotten before it got cold, but not enough time to have an empty plate.  I can't wait to go back.
