So months after watching this place slowing open... I have finally tried the Crisp. I have been twice, once for the Philly Steak Sandwich and once for the Wings. The Philly steak was definitely nothing to rave about. The steak was great with a different sort sweet taste to it but the sandwich was all bread and barely enough meat to taste. Also, I ordered it deluxe (cheese, mushrooms and onions) and there was a sprinkling of each. If the sandwich got a revamp and uped the insides it would be my first choice! Now for the wings. I got the Korean BBQ and they were SPICY but great!! The portions were huge. I got french fries and 5pc wings and was only able to eat half the fries and two wings (and this was after a few happy hour cocktails). Definitely a big change from my first visit. All in all, a good place for a little take out. The owner is very friendly, the restaurant is clean and cute and best part is that it is around the corner and not some type of freaking noodle place!! PS. It is BYOB, I saw some people enjoying a few brews with their chicken with my own two eyes!
