I can't believe the reviews that this restaurant is getting! I am a foodie and open to interesting food experiences - but this place is a science experiment gone bad.  I would say that only 2 of the 24 tasting bites made me say wow. That's not the percentage you are expecting when you pay $1000 for 2 people for dinner.Too many freeze dried, liquid nigrogen items - this treatment was used on a least 5 of the dishes.  There is very little in the way of actual food.  Don't get me wrong, I love tasting menus, small portions and fine dining.  I expected just little bites - so it is not at all about the quantity of food - it is about the taste and flavours. So underwhelming.   This restaurant it all flash and illusion with very little substance. If you have money to burn and want to go for the ridiculous experience than at least do yourself a favour and skip the wine paring.  Wines are ordinary - and it the end since there is little food you just end up feeling drunk and getting a hangover.I have been to many high end restaurants around the world and was excited to go to Alinea.  It is safe to say it was the worst food experience that I have had.
