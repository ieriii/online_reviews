I've been to Caro Mio probably 10 times in the last 3-4 years, and I always leave there feeling the same way: wow, that was an expensive dinner for just okay food. Yes, I know the portions are large, but I still hate the idea of paying $20 + for so-so pasta. And $12 for (terrible!) caprese salad? That's $3 a.. a... caprese!! You're on Wilson off the Brown line, not Midtown Manhattan.If they would knock $5 or 7 off each entree and serve half the portion, they'd come out ahead, and people might not look askance at their prices.Oh, yeah, and the service here is always hit or miss - Thursday night, 8 pm, the place is 60-70% full, with a handful of 4 tops open. Where do they seat us? At a tiny 2 seat table, crammed against the wall, in what is basically a hallway. My friend and I were laughing because there was simply no room on the table for our bread plates, wine glasses, and then finally the ginormous entree plates. I had to resort to putting items on the tiny table (which was also crammed up against the wall on the other side of the hallway) - that or it was the floor or my lap. I get that they don't want to take up 4 places with 2 people, but it wasn't a busy weekend, it was a Thursday at 8 pm.Apparently too, according to their website, you're only allowed your table for 2 hours on the weekend - eat and get the f*ck out appears to be their motto.Oh, yeah, and they charge $2 for extra bread. We only received 2 pieces when we were sat, so I assume another 'order' would have brought us another 2 pieces at $1 apiece. I think you can figure out a way to charge people for the air they're breathing, too....Go to I Monelli on Western at Winnemac - BYOB, FAR FAR superior food, and better prices.
