I've only had pho a handful of times but this place is definitely knows what they are doing. You get a huge bowl of beef, noodles, broth and a side of veggies like sprouts and jalapeno peppers. Mix it all up with some hot sauce and you have a yummy very filling meal. I also had a delicious Thai tea bubble tea. This place is quick, easy and filled with delicious foods. Don't come here expecting a fancy atmosphere but its a good place to bring some friends and BYOB.
