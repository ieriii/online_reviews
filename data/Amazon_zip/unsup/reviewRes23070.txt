I came here long time ago with my friend and her parents for hot pot. It was only, but I have vowed to explore Chinatown, a place I have long given up on, so I am venturing into the unknown. We ordered the chili chicken bits, tea smoked duck, and green beans. Everything was done perfectly, not oily, not over fried/cooked, and very fresh. The portions were large and the price was right. We were very impressed with this place with its speedy service, and cleanliness overall. Now I can understand the long line in front on the weekends.
