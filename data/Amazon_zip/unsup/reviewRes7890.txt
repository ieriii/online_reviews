I'm going with 5 stars. Pizza was great, they have interesting specials and appetizers, white pizza, and they carry Italian beers. I've heard good things about these guys for years, and I finally tried it. We had our boys with us and got there early. We were seated in the center section of the restaurant which I think is where they put the families (good idea). I'm a red pizza kinda guy and liked it alot. I ordered the one with sausage and everyone wanted a slice. Even our boys were happy, quietly muching away at a basic cheese red pizza. Good times.
