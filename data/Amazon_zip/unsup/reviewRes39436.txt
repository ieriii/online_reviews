Well, it wasn't as AMAZING as everyone has said. Don't plan on going anywhere after...b/c you will leave stankin like bbq/smoke. I love the calbi. The bulgogi is so tendon-y....pretty disgusting (think Joy Yee's beef...stringy). The waitresses don't really try to explain all the plates of sides. scratch that...they don't at all.  The staff was TOTALLY on it when it came to reflliing our waters! all in all...luckily we had a korean w/ us...otherwise I would have been like Alicia silverstone and totally clueless. Although, you don't need to speak korean to know this spot is just a touch above mediocre.
