WOW, this place rocks. Granted I am biased because it is right across from me, but Fox and Obel knows how to do food. Somewhat pricier than the nearby Dominick's, but their selection is vast. I come to the cafe fairly often and the prices are sooo good for the quality of food you get. I plan on using them almost exclusively for dinners since today I discovered their "Brown Box Dinners." I have yet to have one, but these delicious meals sounds supper nom nom and they are cheap. (Seriously, 7.99 for half an oven roasted chicken?). Just last year, the dorm food at NU cost NINE bucks and the food was not nearly as good. Stay tuned for an update on the dinner boxes!
