.sloppy joes - awesome flavor, little bit of kick.. delicious.housemade pork sausage - great texture, not oily at all, seasoned well, more akin to a big, supertasty kebab .burger - classic, default is with bacon (score).bourbon - good selection w. 1 or 2 oz pours...great service - was thanked no less than 3 times on teh way out the door not to mention a yelp email from the owner for taking the time to review.. overall, great, hearty gastropub fare at a good price.. bourbon selection seals the deal, ill be back for sure..
