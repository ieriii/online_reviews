My affinity for "diner food" has placed me on either end of the diner spectrum, from greasy spoon to silver spoon--Glenn's Diner is definitely a silver spoon. Their take on a staple (scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast) includes melted parmesan and chives in the eggs and the tastiest potato pancake I've ever had. Breakfast is served all day, in true diner fashion, and often incorporates fresh fish specials, which is not my taste, but I've literally seen people drool over the crab cakes benedict. Speaking of fish, their full-wall menu board is covered in specials (the pretzled walleye caught my eye--might try it myself one day). For lunch, I've often had their salad w/ grilled chicken (and no iceburg-yay!) and it usually yields enough for two. The decor is fun and the staff is fantastic. You may be in for a wait if you come on the weekends, but believe me, it will be well worth it.
