This is my favorite Italian restaurant.  First off, the atmosphere is amazing. The dark piano bar and dim dining room sets the mood for a perfect Italian meal. The menu is huge and has everything you could want. I personally order the veal. I have had every veal dish and still can't decide on a favorite. In addition to that, all entres include choice of soup/salad and a side of pasta. Oh and I almost forgot, you are given complimentary pizza bread as an apitizer. Overall, the prices are low, the food is great, and the atmosphere is perfect. What more can you ask?
