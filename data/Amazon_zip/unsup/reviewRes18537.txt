This is truly a hidden gem in the city. I am very particular about where I'll eat Italian, and this place is on the top of my list. The restaurant is family owned, and guess what...they are all from Italy! Would you believe they make all their own pasta and sauces from scratch...and it really shows in the flavor and quality of the food. The setting is very warm but relatively formal. This is a great place to go for a date or out with an intimate group of friends. Usually there are 1-2 waiters working...but they are very attentive. I highly recommend the daily specials, they usually are very delicious combinations of their freshest ingredients.
