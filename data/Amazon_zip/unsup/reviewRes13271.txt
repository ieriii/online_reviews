I have been to Glenn three times and I absolutely love it! All of my experiences have been with their all you can eat specials. Yes, I LOVE all you can eat. The Thursday all you can eat shrimp is absolutely delicious. You have two options for the spices and can mix and match. BYOB makes it an especially enjoyable evening. Tuesday's all you can eat crab legs did not disappoint! The crab legs came out very fast, were always warm and our sever did not stare at us when we asked for our umpteenth leg! I think they recently changed their policy to no BYOB on Tuesdays. While I was disappointed at first, completely understandable. We ordered $5 dollar vodka drinks which were nice and strong. After 3 we had a good buzz going. Overall I LOVE Glenn's and highly recommend!!
