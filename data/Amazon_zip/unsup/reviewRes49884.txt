Las Tablas, you are my guilty pleasure. When I am with you I am so bad, because you are so good. No matter who accompanies me to your table, we always have a fantastic time, filled with laughter and delicious food. When we part, I am drunk from your sweet sangria, fat from your succulent meats, and my breath reeks to high heaven from your mouth-watering chimichurri. I swear- only you, Las Tablas, can make a girl feel good about being drunk, fat and stinky.
