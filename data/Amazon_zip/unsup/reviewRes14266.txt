This place was a little gem we just found recently... what a great and cozy place. We went for a late dinner on a weeknight and it was great. The service was spot on -- the waiter made recommendations, told us about special dishes, etc. And, the food was really good for being called "glenn's diner"... we weren't expecting all of the seafood.  the crab cakes were great, mac and cheese was really rich, but tasty. I'm a little torn on the potato pancakes... just a bit too rich in my opinion. But, all in all, great food at pretty reasonable prices. We'll be back!
