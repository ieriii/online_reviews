In terms of just groceries and quick lunch options, I would give this place a 1 star - Incredibly overpriced, not much to choose from, no salad bar, $9 airplane sandwiches/salads. Definitely my lowest rated grocery store if I had to compare it to Whole foods, Trader Joes, Marianos, Dominicks, Jewel, Bockwinkels in the area. The restaurant does have some nice outdoor seating, validated parking, and decent (still overpriced) lunches which is why I gave it a 2 star
