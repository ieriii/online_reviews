Holy Mary of Meat!!! I mean what can really be said about this place that has not already been said (which I believe has already been said).  I went here not knowing anything about it or what it was all about. The price was a little shocking at first, but completely worth it. $50 a meal without drinks, its a fixed menu, a fixed menu of every carnivore's dream. Let's just go through the motions. You sit down, with your chair pulled out for you nonetheless, and order your drinks. OK, easy. They will ask you if you have been here before or have eaten at a Brazillian Restuarant. Just say yes if you want to avoid an explanation. I will go ahead and do it for you now... You have a card, green on one side, red on the other. Simply place the green side up for meat, and lots of it, and then turn the red up when you want them to stop hovering over you. Now trust me on this, their awesome service is just what I stated. They will quite literally swarm you with meats and lots of it as long as the green side is up. IT IS SO GOOD. They also have a salad bar, which I went to in between meats. Whatever green sauce they had up there was enough for me to go back. Do not eat a lot of salad before your meats, that way you can save room for meat and go back to the salad bar in between. I wouldnt bring a date here if you are trying to perform later on because you both will just be miserable. I had to go sit down for a few hours, and could barely move. Its not worth coming here if you are not going to eat all the meat you can stuff in your meat pocket of a stomache. Oh god, just thinking about that green sauce was good. MEAT!!!!
