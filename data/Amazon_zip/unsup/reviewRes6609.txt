Came here for lunch with gf, everything we had was very tasty. Portions are smaller as it is a 'tapas' style service. We had: - bruschetta of the day... It was a tuna salad with lots of dill and very fresh and good, bread was great and chewy - burrata and roasted tomato salad... Had a nice pesto on it - rigatoni... This was my favorite, it all came together so f'ing good - grilled half chicken... This was really good too, it tasted like a what a gourmet buffalo chicken was meant to taste like from a good chef
