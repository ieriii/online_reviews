Sad to say my reviews of Uncommon Ground have gotten progressively lower, and after this last experience, I'm even more hesitant to go back. I went for an early lunch and ordered the seasonal flat bread--which was supposed to be sweet potato spread, spinach, onions, olives, and goat cheese. However, after trying a few bites I had a strange hunch that the sweet potatoes (the main reason I ordered it) were missing. I mentioned this to the server, who didn't seem surprised at all and confirmed "oh yeah, they ran out," with no further explanation or offer to fix this. Then as if to diffuse her mistake she laughed it off with "But I think you still made the right choice!" and walked away. I was stunned...what is a SEASONAL flat bread without its key seasonal ingredient?! It tasted good enough, sure, but had I been told beforehand (as I should've been) I definitely would've ordered something else. Above all I just couldn't believe the way the whole situation was handled (or mishandled) by the server...really disappointing!
