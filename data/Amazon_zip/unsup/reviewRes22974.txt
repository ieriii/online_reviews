We had some people in from out of town who wanted good Greek food. After a less that stellar experience at another place in Greektown we decided to give Greek Islands a try. Great service, great food, great, great, great. I had very moist chicken which is a big deal to me. Everyone enjoyed their food, the octopus salad had a tuna like quality to it. I didn't order it but thought I'd throw that in. I was somewhat confused on the multiple women's restrooms and the tons of ice in the urinals, but maybe that's how they swing it in Greece. And be careful when you drink any water, your glass will be instantly refilled. Maybe that's why all that ice is in the urinals. I dunno.
