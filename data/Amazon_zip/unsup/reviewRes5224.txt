Our group of 3 walked in around 6 on a lovely Sunday evening and were immediately seated (yay, my stomach was eating itself!) The waitress was really friendly and made sure that we were taken care of, even though the restaurant was about 3/4 full. I ordered the chorizo-stuffed olives, which were olive-y, and the octopus, which was... well... For dessert I ordered the bananan, nutella, and marshmallow panini, which I would have devoured but the crust on the bread was a bit too chewy for my weak jaws. Even though I was not amazed by any of my choices, I had my eye on so many other things on the menu that I will definitely be returning. For instance, there is a large selection of cheeses and since I have just lately become a cheese fan I have my eye on one that was called Truffle something-or-other. The prices are pretty reasonable if you are savvy,meaning some things on the menu give you a lot more food for about the same price as anything else (the paninis mainly). But if you just want to try something new they make that really easy too- I got like 8 of the olives for about $4. The ambience is upbeat and classy, but definitely for more intimate groups since the music was so loud I had to raise my voice just for two other people to hear me. And last but not least, the wine list is extensive and impressive.
