Simply It was an incredible little place we found one night while strolling down Lincoln Ave in search of a great BYOB. Me and my girlfriends were instantly impressed by the beautiful dcor and low lighting. The wait staff was all extremely friendly, helpful and very attentive. We had the waiter recommend a couple of dishes and they all turned out to be incredible!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Pineapple Calamari (which is served inside of a halfed pineapple) and the Jumbo Shrimp Entrees! This is one of those rare jem of a restaurant that turned out to be one of the best places I have been in Chicago!No corkage fee, friendly staff, good, fresh food and warming atmosphere! Will definitely be back!!
