When you walk in, you are greeted by a modern, chic restaurant that feels like a second home and smells so good it makes your stomach growl immeasurably. In the middle of all of the tables is a square shaped "Garden Bar", where there is everything- from 2 different Caprice salads to truffle butter on warm bread. They have about 25 different salads which include snap peas in garlic, deviled eggs on arugula, and so much more. There are three types of fresh bread- whole wheat, white, and rye. There are three different butters to go along with the bread- truffle, roasted red pepper butter, and some type of sweet one. I would groan with pleasure every time I would take a bite of bread loaded with butter. Zed is known as "a Brazilian Steakhouse", how they come around with meat on sticks and cut you a piece. My favorite meats were the Rump Roast, Venison, and the tuna "bite". Four words: Melt. In. Your. Mouth. As it was my birthday, they gave us three deserts, all which were AH-MAZING- Baked Alaska, sorbet with marshmallow, and three gelatos- raspberry, strawberry, and mango? The service was excellent- I felt like our server was my long- lost brother. "I'm coming home, coming home, tell ZED i'm coming home."
