Sultan's market is good and cheap middle eastern food. I've had food from here twice and it's been great both times - I love their lentil soup! It's awesome that they give you a wedge of lemon with it, because I always love adding lemon juice to my soups to give it that kick. The hummus and rice are good with the cucumber salad on it, as well as the chicken shawarma sandwich. If you ask for it spicy, they slather in some red chili sauce, so watch out for getting a big mouthful of it! The restaurant itself is casual and laidback, and the only thing is I wish that their pastry counter was not so separate from where you order because I always forget it's there until I'm walking out the door!
