Came here on a week night with a date. It was very busy, but we did get a table right away. The service was good. I ordered the shrimp scampi and when it arrived I was shocked to see it was on a massive plate filled with mushrooms in butter sauce, which must be a component for a lot of their dishes. So instead of making my dish the proper way they use the already sauteed mushrooms w/butter sauce, well I loath mushrooms. I tell our server that I can't eat it with all those mushrooms. She asked what I'd like instead, I said I want shrimp scampi they way its suppose to be prepared without mushrooms. She took it back and they did make me a fresh dish, I wondered if they'd just skim the mushrooms off but they didn't. It was good, but I have never had shrimp scampi come with mushrooms. I would go back but I would definitely want a private booth, I was bumped into where we were seated and I would make sure to ask more about a dish before I order so I don't end up with those darn mushrooms!
