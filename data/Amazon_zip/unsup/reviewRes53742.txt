WOW ..what an amazing place. I'm just upset that this is the first I've heard of it. I was walking around in my neighbor hood when i saw a long line to get in to this place. We peeked inside and grabbed a menu to go by the time we made it home we called in an order and walked back for it. Completely worth it. DELICIOUS.....my new favorite .
