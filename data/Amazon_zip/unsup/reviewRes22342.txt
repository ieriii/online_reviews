I'm not disappointed we decided on Greek Islands instead of one of the many other Greek places in the surrounding few blocks. The food was great, the servers were wonderful and the atmosphere was fun. The place was packed on a Monday. And this isn't a small restaurant. Three huge, multi-level dining rooms and not an empty table in sight. It only took 15 minutes to get a table though, and it's not so big that it feels overwhelming or impersonal. Only minor complaint: the bread was cold and wasn't great. We got the saganaki (of course), a gyro plate, grilled white fish with veggies and a baklava for dessert. Everything tasted fresh. The gyros were basic: meat, pita, onion, a slice of tomato and tziki sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Fantastic service. Our waiter was friendly, affable, helpful and fast. Couldn't ask for more.
