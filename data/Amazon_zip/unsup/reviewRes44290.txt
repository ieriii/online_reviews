Thank you, Alliance, for rocking my birthday girl's world with your red velvet goodness. I popped in on a Wednesday, in need of a cake for Saturday. The staff was very pleasant, brought out a cake to show me the size and what it would look like. Once it was determined that I would not be wanting THAT cake (come on, she had to have a FRESH cake) he set me up, and I ordered it with my desired message. Of course, I couldn't leave empty-handed, so I took a Key Lime bar and a Cheesecake bar to go. Yum. The Key Lime bar was tart and not too sweet, my general desire, and the Cheesecake bar made me look like a rock star girlfriend. Awesome. Cake was ready promptly on Saturday, the icing looked gorgeous, and I was outta there in 5 minutes. Impressive given the Renegade insanity outside. Oh, and Intelligentsia? Sure, I'll take a couple of iced coffees to go. (Perfection on a warm September day.) Fast forward to the party. Cake displayed to the tune of the birthday salsa (LOVE). Birthday girl given the task of cutting the cake (HILARIOUS). And everyone ooohed and aaahhhed, despite red velvet not really being on anyone else's radar. The cake looked wonderful, and tasted even better. I'll be back for more bakery needs, rest assured. Oh yeah, and for the coffee too.
