Really enjoyed this spot the sevvice the food where very good . My waitress Jacki was wonderful , gave us great info, it was a Saturday night I drove from Deerfield and got there in 20 minutes! I will go back everything was fun plus the music from the bar and all the people singing made me feel at home ASAP. This is a true Chicago Spot that I will return to.
