When you click on 5 stars on Yelp, it says: Woohoo! As good as it gets! Yep, I think Zed451 is as good a dining experience as I have ever had! Before I say anything about the food, I have to talk about the amazing service at Zed! Our waiter, Jacob, was absolutely outstanding.  We were at Zed last night to celebrate my birthday, and he made it a memorable experience. He did a great job recommending drinks and interacting with the table. He asked if he could buy me a birthday desert, and when I said I was good, he brought 2 tequila shots instead AND an amazing desert that you would have to see and taste to believe.  When we asked him to take a picture of the group(13 of us) he went and STOOD ON TOP OF A CHAIR to get the best angle! Pretty awesome, I don't think I would have even done that! The "Harvest Tables" were full of awesome food to start the dining experience off right: salads, meats, soups. ALL 13 of us loved everything in there. The proteins that were brought around: Amazing. Salmon, Wagyu beef, crab cakes, pork belly. I loved all of them. Drinks are fun and they sure did the trick. Sangria was great. Extensive wine list. Bourbon Lemonade, or the Basil Lemonade.  I would also say that the hostess/hosts were great to work with all week as the reservations went up in number, then down, then back up. They were always polite on the phone, and they were great when we got there.
