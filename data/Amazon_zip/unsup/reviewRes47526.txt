Best brunch ever. The chefs are the servers, coming out with spits of meat to cut directly on your plate or amazing chicken and waffles followed by a plethora of other well prepared dishes. Surrounding you are miniature desserts and an assortment of fresh fruit that foreshadows what's about to assault your taste-buds in a way that you can only say yes well past the capacity of your stomach. In conclusion, quality food, quality service, and culinary sorcery that will make you believe that you can consume more than what you're capable of. Physical pain may follow but the mental and emotional satisfaction of what just happened while sprawled out on your couch watching weekend tv will overrule your miniscule discomfort.
