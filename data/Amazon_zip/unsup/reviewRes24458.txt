A lovely, dippy, drippy (albeit expensive) date! Went out for a date night during restaurant week and took advantage of the seafood menu. Started out with a basic salad, then an appetizer fondue course wtih fruit and bread to dip in a cognac gruyere sauce. Who knew that grapes dipped in gruyere was the most amazing combo?! The seafood platter was massive! The restaurant week menu was intended to be ordered individually, so we got 2 seafood platters... it was enough food for 4! Shrimp, scallops and lobster that we "fondued" in oil, then dipped in our selection of 12 dipping sauces. The seafood was delicious and the waiter gave good instructions on how long to cook things for and how to use "anchor vegetables" to prevent your seafood from slipping off into the fondue pot. The dessert course was a brandy chocolate sauce with a mixture of fruits, marshmellows and poundcake for the dipping. They included a little pot of crushed graham crackers so you could make s'mores, which was really fun. The wine menu was solid - we enjoyed a bottle of the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Even though we went during restaurant week, we walked out of there $175 in the hole! The ambiance of the place is really nice - lots of sectioned off little rooms and alcoves, which makes it ideal for a date night.  I enjoyed my dining experience thoroughly, but given the novelty of the concept and overall expense, I doubt I'll be going back any time soon. More likely you'll find me at the library researching how to start my own fondue restaurant. Really wish I had jumped on that trend back int he 70's... this place must make a killing!
