Perfect! Great service! 4 of us went and had martinis...what they don't tell you is that the $18 martini you order is 2-3 martinis as they bring the rest of the huge shaker to the table, so it is actually a great value. Get the butter cake and sweet potato fries! Did not have steak so I cannot comment on that...
