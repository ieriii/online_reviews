Truly phenomenal meal and experience. I was able to book (way in advance) a table for 10 the night before the marathon to carboload and our table was ready within 15 minutes of everyone arriving. We were seated upstairs which is a tad less crowded and were served quite attentively by Erika. It was really busy and I can't say enough good things about the service she gave us. My mom, who is the only person in the world who hates garlic, ordered a chicken dish without asking about how much garlic was in there. When the dish arrived, she could hardly stand the smell and Erika was so wonderful about removing and bagging up the dish to take home (leftovers for me!). She brought my mom a bowl of pasta with a plain tomato sauce and made her very happy. She even took off the pasta from our bill. Then, another diner at our table was really unsatisfied with her pizza - it came out cold and she hated the way it tasted. Erika was, again, kind enough to remove that dish from our table and remove it from the bill. Instead, my friend ordered the mushroom polenta appetizer dish and it was THE HIT OF THE TABLE. One of the best dishes I've ever had. I, personally, ordered a pasta dish with tomatoes, artichoke hearts and goat cheese. It was FABULOUS and I finished the entire thing. To top it off, we shared a flourless chocolate cake and it was probably the best I've ever had.
