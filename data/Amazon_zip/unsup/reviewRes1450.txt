Can you believe Anthony Bourdain has Hot Doug's on his list of "13 Places to Eat Before You Die"? I can. Mind you, this list is not made up of places in the U.S., it's places spanning the entire world. This is not just a hot dog place, it is an experience like no other of all kinds of tubular meats: rabbit, duck, lamb, spicy Thai chicken, ribeye steak...the list goes on. They have items that are mainstays and they have daily specials that are updated every day on their website. My all-time favorite is the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. On Fridays and Saturdays, they have french fries that are cooked in rendered duck fat. mmmmmm. The lines get pretty long and could circle the block, but after having one of these delicious dogs, the wait will be well worth it.
