Oh my sweet baby Jeebus! This place is good! I had the Gunthorp Chicken sandwich one day and it was so good that I had to go back the next day again. The second time in I brought my lovely wife, and we started with the guacamole. It was a pretty small amount of guac, but it was probably the best I have ever had. We both had sandwiches of different kinds, and they were both AMAZING. This place is slightly pricey to make it a regular thing for my low-income self, but it's really really really good.
