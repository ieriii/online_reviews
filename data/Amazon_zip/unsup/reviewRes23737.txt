I give this place 5 stars despite the indifferent service- in fact, because we joke about how crabby and inattentive the wait staff can be! It's part of the experience. It's worth going for three things, specifically: their pot stickers, Tony's Chicken (HOT), and the Mayonnaise Shrimp (SWEET). That combination always works for my husband and I- we leave with about half of the food (for later or next-day's lunch) and go get a Bubble Tea down the square at Joy Yee's for good measure. It's an indulgence, for sure- and I don't vary from my favorites. Go here for the food, not the service or decor. The food IS the experience.
