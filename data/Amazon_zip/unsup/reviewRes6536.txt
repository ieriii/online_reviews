Wildfire is a good, solid restaurant to take guests, out-of-towners, etc. Reservations are key or you can wait in the bar for a long time. There tend to be a lot of work groups and family parties. The menu offers a host of choices, and the meals are tasty. The service is good considering how large the place is and how many tables get turned in an evening. I usually order either he filet trio or the tenderloin tips, both good. The wood-fired mussels are delish. I also enjoy the chopped salad quite a bit. The one thing I had here that was not good was a "skinny chocolate cheesecake." I know--what the heck was I thinking?! It was beyond bad. I should have had a bite of my husband's dessert, which is what I usually do.
