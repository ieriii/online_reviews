So, I am not a huge fondue fan, but my husband and I were craving some cheese fondue and decided to time our trip to Geja's with our anniversary. Why not, right? It is supposed to be one of the most romantic restaurants in Chicago after all. We arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait extra time for our requested booth table. We had a great time back at the bar where the bartender was a hoot. We ended up ordering the International with all the trimmings. However, it was simply too much and frankly, I did not realize how squeamish I am about touching and cooking raw meat. Further, I am not sure that steak tastes all that good cooked in oil. After all that food, we were simply too full for dessert. I give the waitress credit for realizing this and packaging up our dessert fondue to go. If I were to go again, I would probably just order the cheese and chocolate courses.
