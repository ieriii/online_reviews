I took my mom here for her birthday lunch today...the place was almost empty yet the servers and host didn't seem to notice we existed. Not friendly in the least, had to get up and get my own ketchup, etc., try to flag her down to refill our water on a 90+ degree day... The food was average, I had the burger, which was tasty, but the bun didn't hold up and was completely crumbled before I could finish it. My mom had the chicken sandwich, which was gigantic (2 chicken breasts), but tasty.  Overall, not worth the prices they are charging. Just because it's organic doesn't mean you have to charge an arm and a leg for it...or at least, make up for it with good service and a pleasant experience?  No thanks. Will not be back.
