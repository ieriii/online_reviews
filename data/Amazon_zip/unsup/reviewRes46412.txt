If you're looking for an extensive menu with reasonable prices, this is absolutely the place to be! With over 150 menu items including breakfast/brunch/lunch (which is served til 3 pm) Grand Lux Cafe surely stands up to its name- GRAND! Another delicious fact is that they are known for their famous "made to order desserts"! Order delicious, fresh desserts when you order your meal so that they can be prepared while you're eating your main course. I, personally, love the Beignets. An order includes five or six large beignets served warm with three separate dipping sauces. There are way too many good things to say about this restaurant. Take my word, you will NOT be disappointed if you choose to eat your next meal at Grand Lux Cafe.
