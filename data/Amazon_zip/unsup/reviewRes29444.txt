I'm vegan but I have omnivorous friends that go here everytime they are in town. I love the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and my wife usually orders a scramble but neither of them were on the menu last time we went in. There are still plenty of amazing options though. I almost deducted 1 star for taking some of the best items off the menu.
