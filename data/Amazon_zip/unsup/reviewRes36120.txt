We went to this restaurant when visiting Chicago on a conference. The experience was so good that we visited the other location as well. The ambiance was quite good and a little cerebral and the food was very good. We got there before 9 am and we took the last available table. By the time we were done there were quite a bit of customers waiting. The omelet was very good. My taste buds were very pleasantly surprised by the figs in it! The smoothies are interesting and good, but that would not be the reason for a visit. The second day I had the salmon crepes and they were very good as well. My bride ordered the nutella strawberry crepes and they were good, but sweets are not my forte so I would not repeat that. Service was cordial and attentive. I recommended to local friends and I would probably come back if I were in town. The reason for that comment is that Chicago having so many good restaurants, I would not limit my choices in exploring the different options, not that the restaurant was lacking My rating would be 3.5 stars
