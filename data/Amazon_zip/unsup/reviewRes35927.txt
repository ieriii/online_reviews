I went to Shaw's with one purpose--the lobster roll. I have been craving a good New England style roll for months and was scared to trust anyone who doesn't pronounce their "o"s as "a's. Luckily, there was a feature on ABC 7 with some places that serve lobster rolls being profiled. Shaw's was the one that looked most like the no frills straight up sandwich I was looking for and so we went. You can only order it if you sit in the oyster bar section, but we loved the casual vibe and bustling atmosphere so it worked out great. The roll was all I had been dreaming of and more. The roll was lightly buttered and grilled (they are made at a bakery in Highland Park? specifically for Shaw's), and the lobster was succulent claw meat. It was lightly dressed with mayo, a bit of lemon juice and parsley and that's it. Nothing more was needed to make this sandwich a home run. It comes with fries which were pedestrian at best and we also ordered the blue crab and artichoke appetizer. It was more crab and cheese than artichoke (which made us elated) and was served with thin crispy bread. It was delicious and decadent. We'll certainly be back when the urge rears it's head once more (sooner rather than later, I'd hazard to guess) for the magnificence that is the lobster roll.
