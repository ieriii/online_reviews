I've been trying to come here for months, especially after my roommate shared a slice of leftover pizza with me. My friend and I came here and were totally overwhelmed. Not knowing what to order, we deferred to the waitress for advice. Her suggestion: red pizza with spinach, fresh basil, and tomatoes. So fresh and so delicious. We ordered a medium and it was huge! We struggled to get through half of it so I've got leftovers for days. Yum. For drinks, we ordered the Golden Arm, which was delicious. The long list of pizza toppings (as well as three kinds of pizzas) are definitely a reason to come back. It's never-ending options! My friend and I pinky-swore to order the mashed potato & onion pizza next time. Can't wait.
