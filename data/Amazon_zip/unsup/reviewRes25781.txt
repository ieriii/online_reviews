I thought this place was good. It was a little hard to judge because I was there with a large group and one person pre-ordered for everyone. Also for some reason the people were pretty inefficient in terms of passing the entrees around the table... what's wrong with them? Take take pass... take take pass... They were more like take take hold... Anyway, so some of the stuff was cold by the time I got it. But it was still pretty good. I really liked the crispy noodles with veggies. Usually I don't like the BYOB thing, but it worked out for us this time. I guess I shouldn't hate on BYOBs as much, because it ends up saving everyone big bucks anyway. I'll have to go here again without the big group and re-review next time.
