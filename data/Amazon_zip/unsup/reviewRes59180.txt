The best fish in all of Chicago... short and sweet.What I like? Check out the followingHoney roll, Lava roll, Spicy Tako, Spicy Scallop... yum, yumI've been coming here for a number of years and have eaten all over the city. This place still has the best sushi out there. Not quite the see and be seen place, so if you're looking for that look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a chill, loungy place to eat with friends, and BYOB... this is your place.The cat's out of the bag though, so check it out on a weeknight cuz they don't take reservations. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.Jay
