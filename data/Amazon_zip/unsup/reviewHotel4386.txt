I came to Chicago for the first time with my architecture school classmates. We were all a bit hesitant about spending so much for a hotel (as most college students are) but in hindsight it was a wonderful decision. The staff was very courteous and prompt, especially while dealing with our group of about 45. We had a maintenance problem in our room that was fixed right away. The amenities were great- and well taken care of.  The location was great, with easy access to transportation in the area.  It was a most enjoyable experience... a simply stunning building... and I recommended it to anyone staying in the City.
