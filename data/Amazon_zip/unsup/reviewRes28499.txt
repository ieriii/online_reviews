I was impressed with everything about the restaurant. From the decor (mulling spices simmering at the hostess desk, tiny pumpkins in a cool mirrored display case along the wall, orange lights setting the autumn tone), to the service (friendly but not overbearing waiter, attentive bussers), to the drinks (London Calling cocktail with pimm's was awesome, brought me back to summers in London sipping pimm's at the pub) to the food (we had the buffalo chicken -- deliciously cooked, red wine risotto with braised beef-stuffed squid -- perfect consistency and the braised beef was AWESOME, duck -- I'm not a huge duck person, but it was very tasty, and the deconstructed lamb reuben sandwich -- SO yum and a huge portion!) to the dessert (apple fritters that reminded me of those apple cider donuts at the apple orchard, and deconstructed snickers -- so rich and chocolately!). Oh and the garlic popcorn was awesome, too! I will definitely be back. I must say I was nervous reading the mixed reviews, but really -- everything was great!!
