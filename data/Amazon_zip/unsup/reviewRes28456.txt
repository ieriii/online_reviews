I'm not in the restaurant industry. I've never worked in a kitchen, never waited tables. I have no idea what it takes to work a lunch or dinner service. However, I do love to eat out, lots of different types of places, and I understand that fine dining can get pricey, and plates tend to be on the smaller end. As Americans we're so accustomed to seeing big heaping servings of slop on our plate, when we're presented with something creative, beautiful and artisic, we can't appreciate it for what it is.  Until I spent a day in Chef's Bowles kitchen, I didn't understand how much goes into each and every plate on his menu. It's not just white fish, or pork, or spongecake. These plates have five, maybe six components that are all prepared separately and have all the chefs and line cooks working from 10 am in the morning til closing. These men and women come in everyday and prepare several sauces, foams, reductions, sabayons... the list goes on and on. And, even with such a busy place, each dish that comes out of the kitchen is beautiful, delicious and consistent. It's not just remarkable, it's frankly, misunderstood by people like me, until I saw it for myself. And then I see why these menu items are priced the way they are. Anyone who feels like they didn't get their money's worth should spend an hour or 2 in the kitchen with these incredibly talented chefs. You'll end up wanting to pay a bit more for your food, just in sincere apprecaition for what these people do day in, day out.
