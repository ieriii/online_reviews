Simply It is one of my favorite everyday restaurants. Their food is delicious (I'm a big pho fan and love their chicken version) and I love how they always give you complimentary fruit whether you're eating in or taking out. Their lunch deals are great and they are incredibly friendly and hospitable. You can tell that they take a lot of pride in what they do and the food is a reflection of this as well.
