OMG! Where to BEGIN? So, I've driven past this restaurant numerous times before and each time it catches my eye...This past Saturday, I dined and I fell in love! So my bf, loves cuban food and I love mexican food, what a crazy idea to come here! lol So, I made reservations and decided to surprise my love with this restaurant for our date night. We get there and its a packed house, I'm thinking thank God, I made reservations, we are graciously escorted to our table. The ambiance was nice and dimely lit and romantic, which just added to my excitement. We are greeted by our wonderful server and order drinks to start...as our drinks arrive, we order our food and enjoy each others company in the ambiance.The food arrives and dare I say, its to DIE for. My bf goes to cuban restaurants all the time in different parts of the city and was very impressed with his Ropa Vieja dish. I ended up getting cuban food as well and was very impressed as well with my Bistec a la Cubana dish. We were so stuffed that we contemplating just going home and making it a BB night, but instead indulged in a wonderful flan dessert and a few more drinks and then off we went for some dancing. Overrall we really enjoyed the restaurant and definitely will be back. Great Service, FANTASTIC FOOD, and Fabulous Prices=VERY HAPPY CAMPERS on our end! All Smiles!
