I was brought here by my Brazilian friend who was drunk after Summerfest.. he said we HAD to come! It's pretty small but it's worth squeezing into. We didn't know what to get but the staff was friendly (like so friendly it scares me, I wish we were related) and walked us through the choices that night. They described their appetizers and I settled for a coxinha (for hispanics: it's like a papa rellena but made of chicken instead of ground beef, for non-hispanics: it's like a fried potato puff with chicken inside.. that's just what it tasted like to me, I don't know if it's really potato or not) and a slice of tomato pizza. The pizza was flavorful but the coxinha was really, really good!! After experiencing something like Yelp Summerfest just a few minutes ago, I didn't think anything could amaze me further.. but Fogo 2 Go did. It was cute when the cashier noticed my husband's Yelp sticker and said "we've been getting a lot of reviews lately." Do they have their "People love us on Yelp" sticker yet?
