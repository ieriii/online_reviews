It's true: they've got great beer and a kitchen that is almost, but not quite, as good as the prices they charge. One gripe I have is that Hopleaf, just like most other high-end, serious beer bars, puts all of their efforts into Belgian beer, and gives German beer short shrift. This is crazy to me. It pisses me off. And I just had to tell someone.
