I recently visited Irazu for the first time (along with my family) and I can definitely say nobody left disappointed. We started off with the chips, of course; I can't offer comment on them, as I was saving my appetite for what I knew was going to be a delicious course. This turned out to be a wise move. The dishes, although very reasonably portioned, do contain a lot of food. I ordered the potato taco plate. The tacos themselves were nothing to write home about (through no fault of Irazu's; it's just not a particularly exciting dish), but everything else was great. The rice was perfectly seasoned; the cabbage salad had a lovely zing to it; and I have nothing to compare the plantains to, but they offered a pleasant new taste I'm not familiar with- as many have said before, somewhere between a banana and a potato. And let's not forget that famous oatmeal shake- I opted for milk over soy (sorry veggies). I certainly wasn't skeptical that it would be yummy judging by all the glowing reviews on here, but it delivered nonetheless. Except for the top part with all the cinnamon. That layer is rather bitter and yucky. But enough about me! My brother seemed to enjoy his Costa Rican sandwich and my parents raved about the steak casado. We were even treated to some SINFUL homemade bread pudding, hot n' fresh. Our waitors/waitress were wonderful and everybody was very friendly and understanding (especially considering it's blatantly obvious that we're out-of-towners in a serious way). Granted, we were eating a pretty early dinner, so there were only one or two other parties that came in during our meal; nonetheless, I was pleased with the service. All in all we had a great meal and it's safe to say we'd try it again in a heartbeat. There are still several delish-sounding items on the menu (namely the empanadas and the hor-cafe) that are callin' my name, so I just might have to pay Irazu another visit sometime very soon.
