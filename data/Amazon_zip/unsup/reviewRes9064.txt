Went here during a business meeting for dinner with a group. Food was good but average at best. Service was horrible but the good food made up for some of the slow service. The appetizers were great. Best spring rolls I ever had. When it came to the main course the food was overlooked and cold. I was with three people who had eaten here years ago and they said it had gone down hill. I wouldn't eat here again. Read more reviews on my blog: http://www.talesofatrave
