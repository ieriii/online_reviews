I heart Milk and Honey Cafe. Yes, its crowded (especially on weekends) and yes its a bit hipster but man, the food is good. I always get the same thing...BLT sandwich (YUM) and tomato mozzarella salad. Both are scrumptious. Beware of the wait on weekends but if you don't mind reading the paper while you wait...its sure worth it. My only gripe is the not so fabulous potato chips they serve with the sandwiches. They are rather tasteless but whatever, who needs the extra calories anyway?
