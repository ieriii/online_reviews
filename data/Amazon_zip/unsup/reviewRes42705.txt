A group of us came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. I liked the look and feel of the place, with the candlelit tables and the casual chic ambience. I'm a big fan of dirty martinis, and every place makes them differently. Some are too filthy, some are too neat. But the bartender at Gilt made mine perfectly. The only thing that could have made it better was bleu cheese stuffed olives. The frites...oh the frites...were spectacular.    Perfectly cut and very well seasoned. It was covered in some sort of garlic deliciousness. And I had them cold! I can't even imagine how much better they would be if I had them fresh from the fryer. The dinners and appetizers are meant to be shared family style. We had an array of "On Toast" appetizers, a couple of salads and a couple of enterees. My favorites were the bone marrow on toast and the pasta with mushrooms. The pasta was freshly made and cut in thick ribbons, swirled in a buttery, garlicy, mushroom based sauce and topped with fresh Parmesan. Our waitress was very helpful and attentive. We didn't have room for dessert. Bathroom is clean and has C.O. Bigelow hand soap and matching lotion. It smelled divine. Highlight - The ambience, the drinks, the frites! Lowlight - None that I can think of...
