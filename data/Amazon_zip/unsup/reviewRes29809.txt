Honestly, this place is average. Not terrible, but definitely not stellar. I must say I was very pleased with the way my over-easy eggs were prepared (it's rare to get them cooked so well in a restaurant - I'm very picky about my eggs). Sadly, my husband's scrambled eggs were not so good - runny, and we both had nearly burnt toast. However, the staff is pleasant and prompt and obliging. We were on the run that morning and they accommodated us very nicely. The place itself is cute, but I'd struggle to recommend it based on the food.
