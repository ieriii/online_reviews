i've only been here once so i don't know if i can give it the "as good as it gets" fifth star. but, if it's as good as it was last night the next couple times i go (and i definitely plan on going back at least a couple more times), then i'll update it with the 5th star.  of the top of my head i am unable to think of a better italian restaurant i've been to in chicago. the staff is very friendly. the food that i had was flawless (gnocchi di ricotta). the menu also changes daily with a plethora of option - much of which is vegetarian. the space is clean and comfortable. i think the wine selection was slightly high in price - if even only applicable to the house chianti at $36/bottle.  anyway... very delicious. def going back.
