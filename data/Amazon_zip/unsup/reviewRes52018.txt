I went here on the suggestion from several people. I shared a thin crust cheese pizza and garlic sticks. I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with the garlic sticks but the cheese pizza was great. I heard that the meatlovers deep dish was the pizza to try so maybe when I go back I will try that instead. The line outside is daunting but if you're willing to sit at the bar your wait will decrease significantly. we totally banked and were able to enjoy monday night football with our pizza. your experience at the bar may vary.
