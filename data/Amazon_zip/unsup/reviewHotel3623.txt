As Kerry J said, it's AFTERNOON Tea...not High Tea. Somewhere along the line we Americans got the terminology wrong. Afternoon tea is what upperclass people took in the mid to late afternoon as a bit to tide one over until a later meal, hence the little sandwiches and pastries. HIGH tea is altogether different. It was the evening meal which was taken at the HIGH table, or dining room table (instead of a parlor or lounge where afternoon tea was held), by the working classes and was a much more substantial meal. Any place that serves a proper afternoon tea will never call it high tea! Too bad we can't get out the habit either. !end rant! I went with a group of 12 ladies to the Palm Court over the weekend and found it to be a wonderful experience. The sandwiches were lovely, as were the scones and pastries. I was disappointed however that they used whipped cream instead of traditional English-style clotted cream. I would love to have their recipe for the egg salad sandwich. The tea I chose off of their menu of about 15-20 teas was gorgeous, with just the right amount of cream and one lump! What a treat. Sitting there in their comfy chairs, with the harp music and the beautiful surroundings, sipping tea, eating a delicate sandwich made me wish I'd been born in another time and place and class... LOL.  I've not tried afternoon tea at other places in the city so I've nothing ot compare them too (The Four Seasons or Peninsula being also at the top of the list supposedly), so if this is as good as it gets, that's great. And if the Drake's Tea isn't the best in the city, I can't wait to find the best!!
