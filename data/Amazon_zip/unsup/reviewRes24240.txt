Ok, so I'm a bit more of a flexitarian than a vegetarian when it comes to what I consider culinary anthropology so when my friend suggested hot pot I relented because I had no idea what that was. What it is is delicious, at least at Lao Szu Chuan. We ordered the split pot which came with a large soup pot with a metal divider separating the chicken based spicy broth from the non-spicy broth. With the lunch special we got a set list of goodies to boil in that broth at leisure - fish balls, some kind of seafood ball, baby bok choy, water cress, raw fish and other raw meats, cabbage, noodles and a few other unknowns in the vegetable area. I recommend asking for the glass noodles rather than the vermicelli the special comes with. The vermicelli tend to get too soggy, sticky and chewy. The problem with the glass noodles is the logistics of getting it back out of the pot without making a mess, but it's worth it. The dish also comes with three sauces to add. One is a sweeter oil base with garlic, another - soy ginger, and my favorite- peanut. Although you can do the individual order hot pot in which you choose individually priced items to boil (all veggies including black mushrooms) the dish would still not be appropriate for the true vegetarian due to the chicken base broth. Unfortunately that can't be altered, I asked.
