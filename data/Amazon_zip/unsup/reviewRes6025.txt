Maybe it was a bad first experience. First off, if I'm going to a fine Italian joint, I want bread and oil on the table. There was none. Secondly,we ordered a shaved artichoke salad, which was precisely what it sounds like. A pile of soggy shaved artichoke with no flavor. It was a very sad $10 salad. The pizza was a huge winner. Prosciutto with a nice blend of cheese. And our last course, a baked sausage and rotini was good but nothing very spectacular. Maybe the soggy shaving salad and lack of bread and oil was a bad start to my first impression. All in all, I'd much rather go to Francesca's.
