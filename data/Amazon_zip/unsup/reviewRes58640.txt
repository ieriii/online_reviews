With all of the wonderful Mexican food options we have available in Chicago, do yourself a favor and choose another place to eat. Having worked in the food industry for many years, I'm usually pretty easy to please. But I do care about customer service... which is something they could care less about at Neuvo Leon. I planned my small business' holiday party here because I'd heard it was a fun, inexpensive option with fantastic food, plus it's BYOB. When our party of 13 walked in last night, they had no clue we were coming, never mind the special family-style menu that had been selected the week prior. In fact, the manager thought it was more important to seal tortillas in bags rather than deal with this issue. They ended up throwing three mismatched tables together so we could squeeze into the very crowded and noisy dining room. Not exactly the perfect for a holiday party atmosphere that had been promised. From there, the service staff had to be flagged down for every little thing from menus to glasses to water to chips. The food was mediocre at best. The highlight of the evening was the margaritas that we brought in. A phone call to the other manager who actually planned the event with me the next day did little to change my mind about this place. He pointed fingers at the onsite manager and did nothing to try to make up for the botched evening. They don't care, but there are 13 people who will never visit their restaurant again.
