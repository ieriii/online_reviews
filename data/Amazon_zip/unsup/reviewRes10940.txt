I just don't get why people love this place so much. Go to Santullo's for a much better thin crust. Their beers (which everyone seems crazy about,) also left me seriously wanting. I'll probably not go back but heck, y'all get a second star for having live music. Take down all the enormous TV's distracting people from the band, their conversation, and even the food, and I'll come back with a third star.
