Some of us can go hot dog crazy, but my friend Sonia ordered 3 dogs from this place! And she took pics of it! I'm pretty sure it was because of their names" "The Elvis, The Paul Kelly, and The Dog". She was from out of town, so I let it go. I got the "Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris". With the name like that, I would have ordered another two or three - but I couldn't - one was enough.  The cheese fries were crunchy and spectac. I had to eat these because my friend was too full from the dog's that she has eaten. I didn't mind at all. If only I came on a Friday or Saturday, then I would have eaten the duck fat fries. I can't believe it took me this long to finally eat here. After seeing it on the Hungry Detective and No Reservations, reading about it in the Chicagoist, seeing it on Yelp's Most talked about and their top list, and seeing Doug Sohn himself at a lecture he did at my school - I was sure to visit soon, but I could not find anyone to go with. Thank God Sonia shares my love of sausage..errr...the edible kind.  Next time, I'm going to hope that this special is around, "Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy White Peach Mayonnaise, Creme de Brie Cheese and Roasted Plantains ". That's like word porn.
