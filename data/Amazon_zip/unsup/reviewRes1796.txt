Pure meat & intestinal casing heaven. This is the best hot dog/sausage place I've ever been to. The Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage with Black Truffle Sauce Moutarde, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris is a fantastically decadent experience. I don't think there's anything I can say about this that would be more illuminating than the name. The Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Pepper Affinois Cheese was my favorite. It all works together amazingly. The BLT was the only miss. It's a sausage made with bacon, with lettuce and tomato toppings. I just couldn't resist the idea of bacon on the inside of the sausage. This may be the only time I've ever had bacon that wasn't awesome. Somehow it just comes out as a dry, and only slightly bacon flavored. The duck fat fries just taste like good fries. I couldn't taste any trace of duck fat at all. For those who know their California hot dog places, this is like the best part of LA's Pink's, tons of tasty toppings (which make up for a mediocre dog), with the best part of Berkeley's Top Dog, an awesome dog (though maybe Hot Doug's dogs are even better).
