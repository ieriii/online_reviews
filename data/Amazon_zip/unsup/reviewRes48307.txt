Pork party!!!!!! Seriously. I walked out of the Publican on Friday night ready to put the hold on my pork intake for a while--I just had so much of it that night! We split a little gem salad (thanks to Colleen C's glowing review) and the apple salad. Both wonderfully scrumptious and the perfect vegetable/fruit starters to the very meat based meal to come. Split some frites, fried in pork fat so they're deliciously rich and, well, meaty! Drinks--they got an excellent beer list. Had Founder's with the meal. Good choice! Entree--split the pork belly topped with greens, a wonderful sweet sauce (maybe creme fraiche based? I forgot. But it was obscenely good), and pomegranate seeds. Also the country ribs which were perfectly charred and fatty. I gained a few pounds from that dish for sure. Served with a spicy assortment of rainbow cauliflower. Dessert-- I know the belgian waffle is the go to but we were craving chocolate and decided to split the chocolate tarte. Topped with an unsweetened whipped cream and praline pecans. Perfection. There's a reason that my uncle is constantly asking me if I've "been back to the Publican lately?"--it is just so good!
