I would say I came away feeling about the same as Christine B. conveyed in her review. The bar was set pretty high considering the pricing and reputation but ultimately everything seemed just pretty good with a couple of bad parts. The intention for me and my date was to each get the tasting menu. Our server made it seem like if we didn't upgrade to the "experience" menu then we were missing out and would be disappointed.... kind of made me feel like I was buying a car. We agreed to add on the octopus to the tasting menu. For the rest of the meal she was nice and attentive though. I won't go over each dish but I will say that the amuse bouches were the better parts of the whole thing. The caviar amuse with garden sorrel and panna cotta was very tasty. I also enjoyed the caesar deconstruction with the brioche twinkie. When the onion soup came out I was excited. There was whipped marrow in the bowl with gruyere and then a beaker of broth to the side for us to pour into the ingredients - great presentation but unfortunately the flavor just wasn't there. The broth was very bland and the ingredients were not potent enough to make up for it. I didn't have the nerve to ask for a salt shaker but that's what I was thinking as I struggled through it. Neither of us ended up finishing. Skate was decent, chicken was pretty good, and the chocolate ganache dessert was enjoyable. I wil have to say I've had much more flavorful/satisfying, relatively bigger portioned, small plate multi-course experiences at a more reasonable price. I just felt like I would have been happier purchasing a small TV for my kitchen which I could have easily covered with the amount I paid when the check came. It seems like a lot of other Yelpers enjoyed it and maybe it will be more enjoyable at the next menu change but for me personally I'm going to cut my losses and call it a one and done.
