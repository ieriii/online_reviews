OK. Listen vegetarians. The vegetarian Buddha chicken is absolutely fabulous. It's yuba (tofu skin) with a mushroom stuffing rolled and cut like a jelly roll. Served cold and delicious. Tri-color tofu is another winner. They use rehydrated frozen tofu, a green vegetable and carrots to create three colors. The texture is sublime, and the flavor subtle but very pleasing. Perhaps too subtle because it can be lost among the other strongly spiced food. The tofu appetizer with peanuts was a hit with the rest of the table. It wasn't anything I couldn't make, but it was done proper. Uniform small cubes of tofu, probably from frozen tofu as the texture was very firm with no hint of softness, well-sauteed on every side and served with fresh peanuts. I had the eggplant on the recommendations of other yelpers and the whole table enjoyed it very much. On my last visit I went with a much stricter vegetarian than I. After 14 years I've learned that, in places with a slightly disengaged waitstaff, that even if you ask if something is vegetarian and it has chicken broth they will probably tell you it is vegetarian. So don't ask don't tell. Be sure you ALL get the white fish with black beans. I think they are black soybeans. I've never eaten anything better in my life.
