I've been there twice in as many weeks and it just gets better. A lot better. Both times I've had Michelle as my server and she's awesome, really friendly, helpful and just kick ass, overall. I've been going there to get my fat guy on and she's definitely helped me by making it a little cheaper and a free shot of Jaeger. Their burgers are really good, I was a little thrown off by the 'Arson' but I think I overhyped the spiciness in my own head. I ordered the Bootleg burger which has kimchi in it, and it was terrific! The kimchi isn't super spicy but the flavor is there and it mixes well with the bacon and egg. I bit into it and I just paused, it was mind blowingly good. My friend couldn't help but comment on the stupid grin I had on my face the entire time. I went back Wednesday where their special is the $6 meatball sandwich, I thought, why not and ordered it. Oh man, it was magnificent! My sis and I went and I ate half of her 'Punk Bitch' which was also terrific, a little sweet at first and then the prosciutto and egg-my sis added an egg to it really mixed well. I still kind of wanted my whole Godfather though. My buddy and his gf showed up a little later and ordered. I went to Kuma's with him for his first time there and he was a little disappointed, but thought that the burgers here were good-and a definite improvement over Kuma's. I'm eager to go back to just eat and eat.
