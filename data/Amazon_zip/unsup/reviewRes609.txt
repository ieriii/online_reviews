Simply put, my 12-course meal at Alinea was the most memorable and creative dining experience I have ever had (and possibly may ever have), hands-downs. It was worth every penny. I use the word "experience" as opposed to meal because dinner at Alinea is more than just a meal. It was evident in the chef's and waitstaff's flawless execution that every detail has been thought of and precisely planned out, from the tableware to the presentation and delivery of the food to the consumption of the food. The food was not only a work of art but most importantly, it was delicious. When I left the restaurant, the hostess even walked me to the cab with an umbrella over my head to shield me from the rain. I look forward to the day that I can go back and have the 22-course (or is it 24-course?) meal.
