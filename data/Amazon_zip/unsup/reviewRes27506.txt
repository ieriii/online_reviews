Wow this probably one my biggest disappointments as far as eating. I walked 3 miles here to draw up my appetite because usually my eyes are bigger than my stomach. One slice and I tapped out. I couldn't believe it. The pie itself was amazing. I had sausage and spinach. This was really my first time eating deep dish. I definitely have to visit again when I come back to Chicago.
