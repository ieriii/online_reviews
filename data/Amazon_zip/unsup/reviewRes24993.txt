Ah, Gejas....Muy romntico! From the moment my bf and I were seated in a corner, dark-wood booth to the time we left this Spanish gem HOURS later, I loved this place. I had never gone out for fondue before and I actually thought fondue was food strictly dipped in cheese. (Perhaps being the Wisconsinite that I am?) But alas, there is much more to this fine style of cuisine!  We decided to do the three-course option and started out with cubes of bread and fruit dipped in a cheesy-red wine fondue. Then I ordered chicken, steak, and veggies while the bf went for the deluxe steak, shrimp, chicken, and lobster option....all served with a smorgasbord of sauces. We're talking LOTS of sauce, from horseradish to mustards to curry to barbecue and on and on.  And one thing that you should know about me is that I love, love, LOVE me some sauce - so my taste buds were hopped up. The only downfall was that you had to cook your own meats and veggies in a vat of oil, which was a tad unhealthy, not to mention difficult, even though the waitress was kind enough to share the different cooking times. Plus, I did rather get a kick out of watching Alex N. try to fish out food that slid off his skewers from spattering oil -ha!  We washed all this down with white sangria and prepared for the delicious finale of chocolate fondue. The waitress perfectly toasted a marshmallow for us before we enjoyed the other fruits and cakes. The dessert course also came with fresh coffee and real whipped cream. Delish! And the final perk, being our first time there, we received a $25 gift certificate to use on a special occasion in the future. Gotta love it. Enjoy this night with a hot date. ;)
