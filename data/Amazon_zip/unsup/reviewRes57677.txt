There were some allegations sent out on January 8,2008 via e-mail regarding food catered by Nuevo Leon Restaurant. Nuevo Leon Restaurant is a well respected family business located at 1515 w. 18Th Street.It has been in business for over forty- six years(1962).Over the years,the restaurant has served,and maintained thousands of satisfied customers,many of them have been coming to the restaurant for years and some of them come on daily basis.Our employees are also exceptional. Nuevo Leon Restaurant was accused of catering contaminated food for twenty-five people on November 17,2007 from which fourteen people supposedly had food poisoning.There werenever any samples taken by the Chicago Health Department or any reports from doctors or hospitals of anyone being admitted for food poisoning from such event. Our restaurant was never closed for business for this allegation. On November 17,2007 we had other catering orders with the exact type of food and no one came back with a complaint. Our food is cooked daily from fresh products and ingredients. We always strive to do our best, but as we all know, in any type of business where you have to deal with thousands of people, there is always the possibility of a costumer not being satisfied for one reason or another. Sorry for any inconvenience.                 Thank you for your support.               The Gutierrez Family and Staff.
