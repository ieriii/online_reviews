I've had the Q Burger, pulled chicken sandwich, and the bacon cheddar hush puppies.... All were delicious - def would recommend. The homemade potato chips and pickles that they provided were excellent as well. The decor is nice and the seating was comfortable; there is a dining area and a bar area with tv's. It took a bit for our server to realize that we had been seated and were waiting to put our drink order in otherwise the service was good.
