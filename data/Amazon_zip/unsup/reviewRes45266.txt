Three of us ate at Anteprima last night. I would go back even though we found the food somewhat inconsistent.  We ordered a platter with a sample of apps and it was tasty and would easily serve a table of four - great value. I should have sent my pasta entre back as the red paper flakes so dominated the dish I could barely eat it, and I like spicy food. My friend has a pasta with lamb sausage that was amazing. My other friend ordered a half order of pasta that was so ridiculously small I was surprised they would send it out. The space is lovely but LOUD. Wine prices quite reasonable given the quality.
