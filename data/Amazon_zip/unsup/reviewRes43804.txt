My wife, oldest daughter, oldest son and I have been here several times. This place is just so cute. With all the references to milk bottles in their decorations. The place is small, but that seems typical for a Chicago place. It was very crowded on the days we went. I guess I would be surprised if it wasn't corwded. The food and service are truly outstanding. It is very clean inside. The food was really good. They have some excellent specials, the only bad thing is that the next time they probably won't have the excellent special you just ate. The staff was very friendly. It was priced right for the food you received. I know the next time we are in the Wicker Park area we will be heading back.
