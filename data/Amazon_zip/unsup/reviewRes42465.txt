This place was incredibly busy, with one person managing lines at two entrances. That led to some confusion, but they did seem to have a system. The Pho was tasty, and just what I had in mind that night. The floor was littered with used napkins, and that bothered me a bit. Service was fast and accurate despite the full house. I would give it another go sometime.
