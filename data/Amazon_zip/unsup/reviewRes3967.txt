After living in Wicker Park for EIGHT YEARS, I finally gave up calling to make a reservation and walk in around 6pm on a Tues to test my luck. No one was there, blaring metal was playing and about 5-6 dudes were in the back kitchen, and I was nodded at to come back there. I was asked if I was someone's girlfriend, to which I said no and the Chef was like "C'Mon Back Then!" basically like "get your ass back here girl!" So, now I'm in the kitchen asking for a reservation and this guy, not one of the chefs (?) asks if I want a shot of whiskey he was lining up for everyone.  I said no, thanks though, and ask him if I could make a reservation. He basically said "we don't make reservations for larger parties." To which I apparently said the kiss of death "But I saw on Yelp..." to which he cut me off screaming inches from my face: "ARE YOU CALLING ME A FUCKING LIAR?!!! DID YOU JUST SAY YELP?!! YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN FUCKING GO (waving his hand in my face.) "GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!" Um. Okay. It's hard to believe people support a business like this, don't really care how good the food is.
