Fantastic experience! I went here with my family, though I'm no expert on Greek food, our experience was DEEELIGHTFUL. Here's how my score totals: 5 Stars! 1 Star - The SERVICE was fast and efficient. Every time we had the least bit of water missing from our cups, the bus boys/waiter would stop by without really interrupting our dinner. The bus boys took care of cleaning up TWO levels of the restaurant, while still providing fantastic service for our bread and water before the meal came. The waiter was also genuine (a huge factor in my restauranting experience). I know I'm not the only one that feels this way because the table next to us asked for his name and converse with the waiter. 1 Star - AMBIANCE was great. The restaurant was packed, every table from my view was filled. They sat my family and I in a corner table for 5, it was the perfect amount of space for the amount of food we ordered. Their corner seat was not squished into a corner, we had ample space and we sat comfortably. 1 Star - FOOD was tasty! There is a reason that the restaurant was filled during dinner time on a Monday. The dinner recommendation from the waiter was great. The waiter, Ariel, allowed us to order 3 group meals for 4 people because my family doesn't eat that much. We still had leftovers to take home WITH dessert (it came with the meal). The food was a tiny bit salty, but that would be my only complaint. The restaurant had a HUGE selection in food, and we were happy with our order. 1 Star - Because my family and I had a pleasant experience and felt relaxed. This may sound like it would fit in the two categories above, but my base rating is 2 stars. If I truly hated my restaurant experience, then I would demote the restaurant to one star. My eating experience at Greek Island was fantastic, and they deserve a 5 star rating. 1 Star - Yelp requires a 1 star minimum, and I would give the restaurant no less than 5 stars.
