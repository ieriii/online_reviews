The first time I went here a couple years ago I had the gyro and wasn't too impressed. Then finally, a couple months ago I went there again and I was quite taken with my meal. I had the Roast "Beef and Cheddar" and my boyfriend got the Jerk Chickin Wrap, both with sweet potato fries. They were pretty good. Of course you have to be in the mood for heavier dishes, but the next time I go, my boyfriend and I plan to split a dinner allowing ourselves to indulge in an appetizer and dessert. I really want to try one of their shakes!
