Good god. Cruelty to Animals burger... pulled pork, bacon, prosciutto, and white cheddar-- all on a burger with a pretzel roll bun. This thing lasted all of three and a half minutes in front of me, but they were a really good three and a half. With the incredible selection of draft beer and Unibroue available, this place easy killed any semblance of a diet that I was on. The atmosphere is a bit weird, with vintage metal (a la Kiss) on the televisions... But it all works well. Service was friendly and quick too. Great place.
