Went there for my brother's birthday with 4 other people, the bill was a ittle under $40 bucks and since it's byob, not bad at all considering we brought our own case of Pacifico. Our server brought out all of the complimentary salsas and we were each given a cup of homemade chicken soup (with shredded chicken, potatoes and vegetables...sooo good) on the house. We followed that up with the queso panela which I recommend (or the queso with chorizo - want to try that next time) There was no wait on this Tuesday night but the restaurant was relatively busy. I've heard great things about their breakfast dishes as well and plan on going back for brunch.
