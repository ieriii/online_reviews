This is the best affordable pizza I have had since moving to Chicago! The slices are generous, and there is always a specialty one for you to try. Plus, the coxinha (pronounced co-chee-na) are wonderful.I had been seriously missing East Coast pizza. No offense to you native or long-time Chicago residents, but when it comes to non-deep dish, non-superthin crust, I have found it next to impossible to find something cheap AND delicious.... and I've tried a lot of places. This pizza is not too greasy, and the flavors really pop out. None of those ridiculous infantile squares either; pie slices all the way!Plus, staff is very nice, helpful, and friendly.
