Pork heaven. A place that worships great beer and the pig was a must try for us. Their beer knowledge and selection was right on. We went with four people and ordered alot to try a good variety. For apps we had, oysters, Pork rinds, serrano ham, the halibut crudo (a-frickin amazing).. Then for dinner we had: Pork belly (oh my god), the farm chicken (the best chicken ever...so good), and the ham chop in hay (woo..crazy good).. and then the all time favorite the frites...those were incredible as well. For desert we had some gelato with a pigs ear, chocolate and ginger bread.. And we got to sit in the pig pen..Such a great experience.
