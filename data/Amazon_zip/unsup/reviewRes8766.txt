Love, love, love it! Excellent Italian style pizza, fresh ingredients, simple and delicious dishes. This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Bear in mind, the white pizzas do not have a sauce. They are olive oil based, but they do not suffer for it! I almost always get a white pizza when I'm there! The tomato based pizzas are also exceptional, as are the appetizers ( I recommend the fennel balls if available! Mmmmm), the desserts (all are delicious, I recommend the zabaglione), and they make a great cappuccino or espresso. The grappa and other various digestifs are great too. And they offer yummy mini canolis on the way out! Does it get any better?
