The food here was amazing! My husband and I took our sons here for one of our sons birthday. They personalized the menu with a Happy Birthday to him. The menu is pricey but is definitely worth it. Make sure you have a reservation (we did) as the place is packed. 3 of us had the Veal stuffed with provolone, basil and tomato. It was amazing. My husband had the lobster stuffed pasta which was also out of this world.The only thing I would change is they could use a few more wines by they glass.
