Rillettes were awesome! Desserts by the previous proprietor of the sorely missed Cocoa Rouge. Long wait but there are a lot of mediocre restaurants along that strip that don't have long waits so you choose. It is worth the wait. Doughnuts were great, Whiskey prices very reasonable. Maple Bourbon bread pudding with pine nut ice cream was unforgettable. Awesome all around. Get there early or they start to run out of the really good stuff.
