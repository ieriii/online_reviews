OMG! The food is good, but..............Can they be any more impatient as you sit at a table? All they want to do is get you seated and get you out. Our server came by 85 times to take our order in the span of two minutes... Our busboy came by 100 times as we still had food on the table asking, Are you done yet?Once we finished our food, they asked us 400 times if we wanted anything else AND to check to see if the bill was paid yet.They should change the name of this place to one of these two:Hurry Up, Eat and Get Out!orCan I take that for you?!!!!!Never go again. They should change the name of this
