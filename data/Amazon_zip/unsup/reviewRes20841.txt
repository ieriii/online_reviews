Wonderful, Wonderful, and then Wonderful Again. There aren't enough superlatives for a meal filled with paradoxical arrangements between earthy and sublime, simple and complex, accessible and yet out of this world. Well done! From the guac and chips through the entree and then the desserts. If I could give it six stars I would. And I should note my wife and I drove 40 miles for this meal and we don't regret it for a minute.
