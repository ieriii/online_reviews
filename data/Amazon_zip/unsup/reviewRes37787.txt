Been a while since I'd done deep-dish, so it had to be done. But just try to get two people to agree which one is best. Settling on Giordano's was as good decision as any. Staff were well-versed in how to handle those visitors new to deep dish. 45 min wait? Yeah, I can imagine why by the time it arrived. Our waiter was really nice and seemed genuinely amiable to be at work. Ordered a quart of Matilda and wife had a beef. What happened to the pint glasses in this town?! They're so small. Anyway, pizza good and filling. Beer, satisfying. Packed up the leftovers. +1 star for putting tip percentages on the bill! -1 star for putting tip percentages AFTER TAX on the bill. Small deep dish and two beers: $32 + tip
