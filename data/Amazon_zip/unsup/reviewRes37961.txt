Went there for dinner before a show at the Neo-Futurists and the beer selection was delicious, although the bartender was not at all friendly. The food had the usual fancy ingredients, common to Andersonville, which I enjoy but the taste was just okay. I had some sauerkraut and sausages which were great with the beer but my friends had some sandwiches which were okay but nothing that would keep me coming back for more. If anything, I guess it's the beer that would make me go back for more and the fact that it's usually always sooo crowded gives it a warm cozy feel, if you're in the mood to be around a lot of people. :)
