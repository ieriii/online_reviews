I don't know what else to add to all the great things that have been said about Hot Dougs. So Instead I'll list some of my favorite encased meats that Doug offers.  -Pork and blue Cheese sausage. The cheese and sauce differ from time to time but I make sure that the sausage includes smoked almonds. The almonds are the key. If they aren't included, I look at the alternatives offered. -Atomic Ribeye sausage. This is my favorite of the bunch. I don't see it that often but when it's on the menu, I get in my car and go go gooooo!  Beefy and spicy! Well worth the $8 sticker price! -Boar sausages. The kind of sausage sometimes differs but the boar taste comes through. It's meaty but diiferent than the beef sausages. Excellent! If you are just looking for a chicago-style hot dog, go someplace else. Not that Hot Dougs doesn't do a great version, because it does but you can get chicago dog without having to wait over an hour anyplace else.  I haven't been back in a couple months because I just can't wait in line the reported 2 hours+ that people seems to be writing about. I'm glad that Doug is getting the praise because it is well deserved. I just wish it didn't interfere with my encased meat consumption.
