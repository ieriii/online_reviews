I love steakhouses. Always a good time to go and this place was excellent. Service is top notch. Warm welcome and very friendly. The served us our steaks and spooned our sides onto our plates. The atmosphere seemed very classy and elegant, so I thought it was going to be an uptight place. But once we sat at the bar before dinner, it was pretty lively. Even in the dining area people seemed to be in a good mood. It wasn't super loud either. You didn't have to talk above others while you're eating.
