Probably the best Italian style pizza in Chicago. I like DOC too, but I think SN is better. My husband is a big fan if thin crust pizza and he is also very picky about it, but we both loved it! We also had a couple of appetizers and they were delicious too! It's definitely worth going back, even if it's out of our way
