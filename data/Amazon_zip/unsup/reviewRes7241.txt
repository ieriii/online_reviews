I don't need my next meal to stalk me. If you give them your mailing address, you will get some coupons from them. They will be cute little mailings at first. Then they start coming for your birthday... and the chef's birthday... and then your half birthday... and days that aren't your birthday but they just want you to pretend it's a birthday so you can eat there. What's up with that?
