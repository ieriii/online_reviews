Piece serves well above average, hand-made pizza. On my most recent visit, we ordered a regular (red sauce) pizza and a barbecue chicken pizza. The red sauce pizza was the first of that kind I've ordered at Piece. I was blown away with how excellent the red is! It's got a really hearty and kind of garlicky (?) flavor to it. The barbecue chicken pizza was very good as well, but as someone who enjoys spice I was really disappointed with the giardinera. They need to use top notch stuff when offering it on pizza in Chicago ;) While the pizza was good overall, its inadequacy in this area just made me wish I was eating a Riot pizza from Haymarket instead. The beers were a lot better than I remember them from the last time I went a year or more ago. The spinach dip is not to be missed as an appetizer, although this time when we ordered it it seriously tasted like the chips were cooler ranch doritos, which they could have been if they weren't the wrong size. Trust me on this. They must have been knock-off ranch doritos. Strange. I always deeply appreciate places that can handle immense crowds well and since I brought my wife and kid with me on this outing I was glad to have been treated so well in a crowded joint to get seated in a reasonable amount of time. They didn't make an exception for me -- they just seem to have really ironed out their hosting and seating system, which is why this place stands out for me above some of the rest of the most popular joints in wicker park.
