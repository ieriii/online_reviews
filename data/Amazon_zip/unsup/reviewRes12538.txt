How can it be that I'm just getting around to reviewing one of my favorite restaurants?!  I've dined at Cafe 28 about 20 times by now, and I think I've tried everything on the menu that doesn't swim (not how I roll, thankyouverymuch). Truly, I've never once been disappointed. Well, there was that one time that they pretty much told my friend and I we had to leave, but to be fair, we were still there an hour after closing and on our third bottle of wine. I think my own husband would be telling me to get out at that point. Menu highlights- Apps: Papas Rellena (they are redonkulously delish), Green Tamales (incredible fresh flavor) Entrees: Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops (these bad boys are Flintstone sized, grilled to perfection, and served with the best sweet potatoes this side of the Mason Dixon line) and Ropa Vieja (tender, juicy, and a good standby) Drinks: fabby mojitos, solid sangria, and a decent wine list I love the atmosphere in the restaurant, and if you're there in the summer months, you have to check out the patio in back.
