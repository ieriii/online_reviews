Hey for me a-ok is a compliment so for all you grade inflators heads up. But enough about me let's get to the review. Went for lunch and no waiting and real nice place. very good servers. food comes out really almost too fast. Pretzel bun is good on pulled pork but quickly becomes not enough bun for the largish amount of meat they give you. Coleslaw was not bad but disappointed me- I was hoping for something either super vinegary or at least just a touch more creaminess-like any- in the slaw. Lots of it though! Sauced suffered same issue: not enough risk taking too bland to please the masses. hey if you are going to have super hip lowercase q you ought to be allowed to zing up the sauces or Cole slaw friends. ok? Here' my take on sauces: Sauce options: Mild BBQ - bland no surprises either way Spicy - not spicy Eastern North Carolina Vinegar - I have had the real deal in NC-this didn't live up and I like vinegar a lot South Carolina Mustard Sauce - ok at least different I'd go back at lunch only and try other stuff it was resaonable for area, quality, etc. will let you know how next trips go. in meantime jack it up q!
