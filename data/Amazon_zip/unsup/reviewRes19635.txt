The best thing by far is the BYOB. The place is decorated like a lounge, and not like a sushi place. It looks nice, its trendy looking inside which is pretty cool.  For an app we got the Hamachi Carpacio. The Hamachi was really really thin and was covered in lime and other sauces. So it was more like ceviche strips. While ceviche is good, I wanted something raw.  The Maki was not that amazing in my opinion. It was covered in so many tempura crumbs you couldn't even taste other textures. Lots of their signature rolls had avocado AND cream cheese together. Thats too much creamy and not enough fishy. The best thing by far was their sunshine roll. It had the perfect amount of mango to complement the rest of the roll. All in all, not the place I expected from all the raving about
