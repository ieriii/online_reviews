The bartenders were sort of incompetent, taking forever and referring to the menu for recipes. Once seated at the table, drinks took a while as well.  Our server was very good - Mexican, fluent in Italian. I think the patio is the most overrated place in Chicago. Its huge, crowded, busy, with lots of people running around. The floor is wood planks and you can feel people passing you (as opposed to if it were on the actual ground). Tables are kind of close to one another. There are tons of trees and really no interesting geography, just rows and rows of tables of mostly unattractive people. The food is good though, and I do compliment the chef on a number of things including offering four types of amaro on the dessert menu (even though they are an absurd $8 a shot).  We shared the burrata w culatello app which was very good but admittedly simple from a preparation standpoint, as well as a beet salad w buffala ricotta which was really great and more creative and impressive.  I had the porchetta which I ordered because I thought it would be impossible for them to do right and I wasn't very hungry so I thought I could take a risk. I was pleasantly surprised with it and I ate more than I had planned to. The skin was really nice and crispy (a suggestion, though: the skin starts crispy and gets kind of mushy/chewy over time so by the time you make it to the third cut its not very good anymore so if you like it you have to eat it all in the beginning I guess) My girlfriend got the truffle ravioli or something - they were really good, with nice full shavings of black truffles all over the top.  Overall -- I think this is sort of the opposite of their reputation -- I thought the food was good but the patio kind of sucks.
