GO FOR THE LUNCH BUFFET! The stations are clean, the food is always fresh and is constantly being replenished. With the buffet lunch they bring sizzling tandoori chicken and crispy yummy naan out to your table. The samosas are small and delicious and the rest of the spread is crazy good. I can't recall the names of the dishes but I do know that I sample every one each time and love them all. They have a potato dish that is deceivingly spicy - watch out if you have kids with you. I have only eaten here for lunch so I can't comment on the rest of their menu. Best lunch buffet in town. Indian, or otherwise.
