Big cheese menu--that's all you need to know. I was sooooo psyched to try this place, since cheese rules my world. We made a reservation, which felt a little silly when we arrived one Friday night and the place was barely half full. But, it just meant we had more time to hang out and savor the cheese.  We ordered real food before getting to the cheese. I had the corn soup, which was good, but needed lots more pepper. I also had the Smoked Bacon Sausage with the quail egg and fried green tomato, and it was amazing. I absolutely loved every bite. I also had a flight of white wines. I can't remember the name of the flight, but it was something like "exotic whites." Overall, some great options and I even bought one of them when I headed out. But, the best part came at the end with the cheese. We started with the Anise & Lavendar from Idaho, the Ocooch Mountain Sheep's milk from Wisconsin, the Bridgewater peppery yumminess from Michigan, the Mont Cabrer goat's milk from Spain, and the Quickes Cheddar from England. They were all good, but the Mont Cabrar blew my mind. Upon talking with the waitress (who said she doesn't eat cheese and then proclaimed to be knowledgeable about their flavors--what?!??!?) , I asked if they had any washed rind cheeses. She didn't seem to know what that meant, but soon returned from the kitchen and suggested I try the Pau's Sant Mateau. It was phenomenal. I was pleasantly happy with my cheeses and sad that I couldn't buy a bunch of them to take home since I had no fridge.
