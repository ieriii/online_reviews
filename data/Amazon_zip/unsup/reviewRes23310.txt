I found myself tagging along with my married couple friends one evening for dinner, and this was their restaurant of choice. I had never been here, but they know I love to eat so the husband immediately insisted that I try the "hot pot." Oh, the hot pot . . . two delicious bubbling liquids waiting for endless amounts of meat, seafood, vegetables and herbs to be thrown in and then eaten with fresh, white rice. Gosh . . . what a brilliantly delicious idea. It costs about $17/person for that hot pot smorgasboard but it is well worth it since they pretty much let you eat to your heart's content, however long that happens to take. Mmm . . . you will be stuffed beyond comfort. Both a good and bad thing. ;)
