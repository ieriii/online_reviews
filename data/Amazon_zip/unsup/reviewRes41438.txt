Butter + Filet ... C'mon! I mean, that combination isn't even fair, it's almost like they are cheating! I realize it's a chain, but I think it is the best steak in Chicago. When that plate comes out sizzling with butter, it means two things... (1) A great steak (2) Another 6 weeks off my life : ) The wait staff is very attentive, they know the menu and are helpful. Reservations can be tough to get at peak times, but they are now on http://OpenTable.com The atmosphere can a be a bit stuffy (Like most steak houses), but I am usually too distracted by the smell of butter to notice.
