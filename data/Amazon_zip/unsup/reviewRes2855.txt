So maybe I am a jaded diner, or this was just a poor start to a 2500$ fine dinning weekend, but I was very disappointed in tru...Over the course of 4 days I went to TRU, Alinea, and a lesser known fine dinning establishment called Ambria(which I have since found out is closed : ( , all in Chicago... with TRU being our Thursday night destination, I wasn't surprised to be the first one there, as I always make the earliest reservation when I know I am going to be multi-coursing it... I must say the service was great, yet a bit mechanical...servers may have been friendly, but I am not sure they were aloud to be...The food great(but not to memorable), the kitchen AWESOME, the cheese cart incredible, and the truffle cart, and candy carts at the end was over the top.... My complaint and reason for 4 stars(which i raised from 3 in the middle of writing this)....None of the food was hot(or cold), food that was supposed to be hot was served on cold dishes(like out of the refrigerator cold). Proper Temperature of food and plates is essential for a great meal... Next time in Chicago, eh I probably wont go back as there are other places that I NEED to try (Moto, where even at 2 months out I couldn't get a reso, Everest wasn't open on Sunday when I wanted to go, and then I would want to return to defiantly alinea and ambria!)
