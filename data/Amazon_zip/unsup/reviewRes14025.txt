So, i went back again for lunch. I always have a nice meal, but this time everything was off. The service was slow, but very nice. The food too 35 minutes to come out - I get it - it's lunch and they were sort of busy. But really, 35 minutes? It is peoples lunch hour, you know? Then the pizza comes out and its burnt on one side and almost raw on the other side. AND SUPER SALTY! Even the sundried tomatoes were too salty. I still like this place and the Derby Day Hot Brown was off the charts good. I think what I'm saying is that this place has been inconsistent over the 10 or 12 times I've visited. ALSO: they need to clean the wall and floor under the hand dryer in the mens room like 3 times a day. I know it's arm hair, but that's not what it looks like. Totally grosses me out EVERY TIME!
