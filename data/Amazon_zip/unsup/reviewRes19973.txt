If you want a romantic candlelight dinner, I assure you this is not the place - unless you believe being deaf to your lovers voice is considered an asset. When we first entered the restaurant at 9 pm, the place was at least 90 decibels. My hearing may never been the same again. The maitre d was kind enough to notice our discomfort with the noise and offered us seating further away from the ruckus which was very kind however it did not help. You know you are not in for a good evening when the best dish you can recommend is the salad. The mixed field green salad with muskat grapes and tomatoes was good. But beyond that, there was little to recommend. The bread arrived warm but with a too hard outer crust and salty. The poutine with elk gravy and cheese curd was too salty and there was not enough crispness to the fries which rendered the dish too soggy to be enjoyed. The potato and semolina dumplings which were like mini polenta gnocchi were too bland and gummy for the sauce. The duck confit and foie gras was alternatively both too salty and bland if you can believe it (yeah... they can make foie gras bland!). I really do believe that the chefs do not taste the outcome of the dishes in the kitchen. This is a place that tries very hard to elevate pub food from its origins however, it needs to focus on making the flavoring of the food edible before it can begin to meet this aspirations.
