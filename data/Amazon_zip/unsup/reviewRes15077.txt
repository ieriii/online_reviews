this place is delicious, had lunch with some friends while i was in town wish this place was in my backyard so i can go back and try other things on the menu. we got the bacon popcorn to start for the table, which was yummy i do wish the bacon was bit crispier but still yummy. i had the smokehouse burger for my entree it was juicy and flavorful. i'd def go back when im in town.
