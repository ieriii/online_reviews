This place was reasonably price, close to transportation and walking to Navy pier, and very clean. It is older and could be updated and we were disappointed that our room didn't have a fridge or microwave because we were there for 4 days and had leftovers each day we couldn't keep. The room was small and basic. The staff was friendly, especially Wallace the concierge. It doesn't have any sort of continental breakfast which is a shame when all you want is just a little bit of cereal and you have to pay 4 bucks for it in the restaurant. The bar/restaurant did have strong cheap drinks though. :) Lots of little restaurants/pubs nearby too. We also reserved a room with a king bed but it was definitely a queen bed. Very clean and quiet overall. Free Wifi which is important.
