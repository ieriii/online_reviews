I definitely see why people rave about this place.....It's really good. My husband had steak and I had shrimp and both entree's were cooked and seasoned right. We sat at the bar to avoid the long wait and got the same great food everyone else waited an hour for.LOL. THe hostess was the absolute sweetest. My husband called for reservations and told the hostess we were going out for date night and she gave us passes to the club next door-Howl at the Moon. That was so nice of her and really made the night perfect.
