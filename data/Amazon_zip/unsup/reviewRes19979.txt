Get to Xoco and you can order yourself a tasty sandwich with a big heaping side of hero-worship. It's obvious that some of the clientele here take Rick's PBS show a little too seriously. Cochinita pibil sandwich was very good, slightly edging out the one they serve at Bombon Cafe. Nice crusty artisan roll, tender, flavorful shredded pork, tasty pickled onions, and the habanero salsa actually had some balls. Rick fans would heartily proclaim it transported them to the Yucatan! Me? I just had crumbs all over my lips and salsa dripping down my face. Xoco Salad was just meh. It was so meh that it barely got touched, then got put in a box, taken home, thrown in the fridge, and then completely forgotten about for a week before the greens were composted and the dressing was used to marinate chicken for enchiladas verdes. In case you were wondering, the enchiladas turned out fine! Ahh.... we forgot to order the famous chocolate and churros. Damn. In the end, Xoco left us wondering if street food, from any culture, should ever really be rendered this antiseptic and approachable. After all, the grit, the grease, the traditions, the awkward cultural convergences... they're all part of the fun, too, right?
