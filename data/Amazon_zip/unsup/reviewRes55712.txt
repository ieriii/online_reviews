Seriously overrated and probably would never go back. Midway thru dinner for the all you can eat crablegs, the waitress informed us that our table was waiting for other customers and that we only have a two hour limit and that we should put our orders in right away if we wanted more crablegs. She also ran out after us into the street to inform us that we did not tip enough. Granted it was an oversight because we were literally rushed out of the place. After retabulating the bill, seems as tho she added an extra 20 bucks on there any way for air maybe and miscalculated it herself. And they should not call their lobster roll a lobster roll when it is not! They should just call it crab salad sandwich if anything. Leads you to believe it's authentic when it is'nt. Calamari was good, but small portions and not worth the price. Corn was overcooked and hideous. Looks like I'm looking for a new seafood place.
