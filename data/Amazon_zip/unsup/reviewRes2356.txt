umm. amazing. i could probably just end the review right there. just two words. but i won't. max and i finally made it to hot dougs a couple of days ago. we went around 2pm on tuesday. there was still a line out the door, but it didn't take too long. we were able to order within about 15 minutes. since it's kind of out of the way and i wasn't sure how often we'd make it there, we ordered a little of everything. i wanted everything on the menu but we limited ourselves to 5 dogs and cheese fries to share. my favorite was the special. it was wild boar with smoked gouda and some sort of chipotle sauce. absolutely great. we also had the marty allen (beef, pork and garlic) and another one i can't remember. we ordered the classic chicago dog and the corn dog too. i had to see how they handled those classics. everything we ate was amazing. the corn dog and chicago dog were both the best of each i have had. but i would recommend getting some of their specials over them just because the specials are so unusual and great. i would absolutely recommend eating here if you haven't already or going back if you have.
