I went to Tru for a work dinner and the food and experience was definitely very creative and exceptional. We got the chance to take a tour of the kitchen, which was really interesting. Apparently, the chef designed the kitchen and used polished granite slabs from the building that preceded Tru as counter tops. The food was very well thought out and created as every dish had several tastes that complemented each other really well. We had Halibut and Smoked Tenderloin. I really loved the Halibut and I'm not really that big on fish. After the dinner and formal dessert, they brought out little candies, including hand made tiny lollipops. At first I thought that wasn't very exciting. But they were so cute, I gave them a try. They were banana and Anise seed and actually changed the taste of the after dinner wine. I thought that was really clever. I really appreciated being taken here, not only because it was a nice experience, but I probably won't be able to spend that much on a dinner myself.
