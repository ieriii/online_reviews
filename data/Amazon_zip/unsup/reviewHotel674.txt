Was here from Thursday - Sunday this past week and the service staff were outstanding. They were very helpful in checking our baggage because we arrived early as well as checking them when we checked out early to travel the town without lugging everything around with us. Wish we could've had a room that wasn't directly across from the elevator, but that's how things go sometimes, definitely not worth taking a star away. The hotel was very clean and what little time we did spend in there, it was very comfortable and relaxing. Great location as well. Would definitely stay there again.
