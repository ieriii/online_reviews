best chinese restaurant in chicago? methinksnot. no.... see.... i had what the waiter suggested... tea duck.... i like tea. i like duck. wow, what could go wrong? except, tea duck, one of the house specialties, is like an entire duck, -barely seasoned, with shake and bake-like breading on it. for $12.95, it could feed two. but it's overwhelming for a wee man of my size. just a pile of duck. and my mother's soup was like a big bowl of sweet and sour sauce, in flavor and texture, so wouldn't recommend the "chicken sizzling rice soup" will come back probably to try "hotpot"
