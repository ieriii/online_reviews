Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. I've been there twice, done the chef's menu each time, and have been absolutely wowed by the food. Bacon and other cured meats play a pretty major role in the cuisine, and as a self-proclaimed bacon expert, this stuff was some of the best I've had. All of the dishes had the perfect marriages of flavor, from more traditional tapa combinations like bacon-wrapped figs to unique combinations like a brussel-sprout/garbanzo bean/citrus fruit dish. Service was attentive, and after expressing a fondness for one of the desserts, one of the chefs even came out with the recipe! Mercat, I hope to see you again soon.
