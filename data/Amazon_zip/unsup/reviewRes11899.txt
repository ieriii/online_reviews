OK.....This review has been a long time coming, since I haven't been there since my birthday 2 years ago. For my first birthday in Chicago I wanted to do something special. what could be more special than live band karaoke and pizza? (I came from a city with no live band karaoke I was excited, I love to sing) My girlfriends and I got make overs at Strange Beauty Show (which is awesome) and went to Piece. it was ridiculous crowded, but that means people like it right? So we waited in the rain and then waited at the bar and finally got a a table for all of us. we were the first people to put our songs in...In fact I was the second person, my friend Sara was first, and I put on my slip that it was my birthday. So the ceiling starts dripping on us, and we get our pizzas. one was ok the other two were really gross. It turns out to be bear down Chicago bears night, so every other song is that...which is OK but gets a little old. so we wait...and one person from our table goes up...hours later another does. But me and Sara are still waiting. I go and tell him it is my birthday, and so do four friends as the night progresses. My friend Amber gets called up, almost last, and yells at the karaoke host telling him that it is my birthday and all i want is to sing one song and I was the second person to put my song in. he just points to his tip jar. It is apparent he had no desire to call me up at any point. She tells him to let me sing instead of her...and a few songs later he reluctantly calls me up. I sing my song. Last but not least...Sara, the first person to put in her song...at least 15 minutes before anyone else...is the last person to sing. a lot of aggravation for crappy pizza, mediocre beer and a leaky ceiling.
