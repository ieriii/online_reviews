It's been a while, but this place is great, skirt steak was awesome, tacos were great (steak & pork) so many complimentary sauces and picco di gallo? salsa was so so, mole sauce kicked ass, tortillas were the best I ever had (and I grew up in da hood) I think the greasy floor let's ya know you're in for some good mexican grub, servers were right on and there must have been 100+ people there on a Monday?? good for them. looking for fancy, trendy food that's plated with love and style, skip, looking for old school mexican purdy cheap and delish? then give it a try.
