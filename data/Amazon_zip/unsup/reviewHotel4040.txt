The boy and I stayed here on a recent mini-vacation to Chicago (for me, to get away from work; for him, to get away from school). We got a great deal on Priceline and stayed for 5 nights. We ended up getting a corner room with a king size bed on the 24th floor in the West Tower - beautiful view, big room, and comfy bed. I really can't complain. The staff were all exceptionally sweet and wonderful, the check-in process was painless, and we didn't have any issues. The young woman checking us in even made sure to give us a room as far from the elevators as she could, since those rooms tend to be a little loud. I liked that it had immediate access to the Pedway (though there's not a whole lot down there unless you know exactly where you're going), and was really close to both Millennium Park and the Mag Mile. Great location! We signed up for the Gold Pass (or whatever it's called) and got our internet for our entire stay free. It showed up on the bill - we were warned it likely would, as they had just switched over their internet system - and it was just taken off before we checked out. I really can't complain about our stay here. Everything was wonderful! We got our room for $70/night because we named our own price on Priceline. I think it's worth checking that out before striking the hotel off the list!
