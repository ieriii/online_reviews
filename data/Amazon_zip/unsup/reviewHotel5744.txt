I consider this hotel to be fairly standard. My week-long stay here was adequate, but nothing out of the ordinary. Everything was satisfactorily clean, but I can't think of any outstanding services provided. I've received the same service at Holiday Inn Expresses before. That's not to be insulting, rather I'd expect more complimentary services for the price I was charged. For example, this could include the free breakfast vouchers my colleagues at the conference received (and I didn't) or maybe unlocking the movie channel a couple of times during my stay. Its location is fantastic (near Greektown, etc.), but I would appreciate a better rate for what I get.
