This is a place I enjoy mainly because of the experience of eating at the bar. The few times I have sat at a table, the wait staff seemed rather inexperienced. The bartenders seem to know more about the food than the waiters... Only once did I feel it was up to par and I was there with a large group, so whenever I go with my wife, we opt for the bar. The bartenders seem to really be into the food there and they are extremely attentive. We have ordered almost everything on the menu. The Elk is fantastic, so is the Caramelized Lobster with quinoa, however I have ordered the Rib-Eye twice and both times it was over-cooked. The Duck Leg confit and the the oyster appetizer are also up there. Awesome selection of spirits. Parking is difficult due to the location. Great view of the Millennium Park fountains and Bean, especially if sitting outside in the summer.
