this is my second time at 90 miles, and I loved the food. I am also born in brasil, raised here, and this food reminded me also of someone's home cooked meal from their kitchen, not some fancy restaurant, or americanized ethnic food. My server, Felipe, was excellent. He made suggestions, and reminded us that it was a BYOB, and next time, to bring in our beverage of choice, that cud be blended into mojitos or their sangria, which I hear is fantastic. I liked having such attentive service. This night, we ordered the churrassco, which was huge, tender, worht every penny. My first time here, was with a big group, and lots of wine. I really must compliment the staff, for also being attentive, with a bunch of customers whose table kept growing and growing. I do wish they would turn the music down a bit though. It is very hard to have a one on one conversation at your table, even with just two people seated. My husband also would like it if you served your coffee in an actual mug or cup rather than the small paper cups with which we were served our cortaditos. that is our only drawbak to this place. We loved the nostalgic newspaper articles glued to the walls. I could have sat reading it all night. Such history: the Cuban missle crisis, the Soviet Bloc, the Kennedy involvement, and all the rich culture of Cuba, which permeates thru the decor. We should all try to learn and/or remember what might have been, should the evenst had changed in 1962. Irene and Roberto
