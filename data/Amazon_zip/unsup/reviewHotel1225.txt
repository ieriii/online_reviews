Stayed here for a conference being held at McCormick Place recently. The people were wonderful, the room was lovely, great view of Lake Michigan, and very convenient for the convention center. Check in was easy, but on the third day I checked my credit card and realized they made a mistake. They were charging me per night even though I had prepaid. I was worried it would be a hassle, but a quick trip to the front desk and they took care of it right away. There is a restaurant on the main level, an Italian carry-out type place and little "coffee shop" called the Daily Grind. The "lounge" advertised is not really all that. It is simply a more bar type extension of the restaurant. I did like that there were seating areas, with mini coffee tables all around the area of the restaurant and coffee shop on the main level. Also, free wi-fi not only in the rooms but throughout the hotel and the convention center. Made things much easier. Gym was awesome with another great lake Michigan view. Overall nice experience.
