A Party in My Mouth, that's what Carnivale is. And any place that has plantains, well, it has my heart. We had the luxury of having a party of 5, hence getting a good sample of Carnivale's dishes. The best of show is the braised short ribs with mash potatoes and peanut and corn salsa ($25) , followed by the wood grilled Berkshire pork chop, bacon-plantain fufu, caramelized onion broth, pepper escabeche ($24). Third in line would be grilled skirt steak, rice and beans, sweet red onion, chimichurri sauce ($19) -- not the most tender of steaks, but the flavor was delicate and balanced. The Mama Mendez -- Sofrito rice, shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, chorizo, peas, chicken, lobster broth round up the night's top dishes. I had the Pernil ($19), rum-glaced pork shoulder with olive rice and beans. Sadly, the pork shoulder was dry and I barely detected the rum glace, which has caramelized to the point of charred. But the pan-fried plantains as usual earned my good graces. We also indulged in the Ropa Vieja appetizer -- five big offerings of braised beef shredded atop sweet plantains in spicy mayo, queso fresco. The best $9 ever spent on small mouthfuls of delight. For another $7, we had the side of mac and four cheeses with herb bread crumbs. Heavenly. Sadly, none of us had any more room left for dessert. However, I shall not despair. Carnivale calls for another visit and another and another ....
