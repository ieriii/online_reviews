We timed this just right. We got to the restaurant a little before 7 on Tuesday night and totally missed the rush. Within minutes of being seated they were lining up outside the door. The menu is gargantuan and I am not exaggerating, pages and pages and pages of options. All of the food we ordered was delivered quickly to our table, piping hot and very tasty. We look forward to going back and sampling the more from the book!
