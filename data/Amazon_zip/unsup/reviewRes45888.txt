While normally not a fan of big chain restaurants, a friend and I ate here one night recently and I have to say that the foods we sampled were quite excellent. The place is big, noisy, and full of the types you'd normally see in a big franchise (think Cheesecake Factory, Carrabbas, Bonefish Grille). There was a short wait with a buzzy LED, and we were not allowed to wander out in the street for notification. We selected a Hummus appetizer and also an Heirloom Tomato with Avocado salad. Hummus was hummus, but the heirloom salad was very good. My entree was a seared ahi paired with pickled onion and pickled cucumber, and came with a little wasabli ailoli and ponzu. I want to say for the record that the Ahi was clean, perfectly done, and of excellent quality, and for this reason I rate the place highly.  We sampled a couple deserts, but honestly, it was overkill. This is a place with large portions. Share, people, share.
