The hotel is beautiful and the people are very nice, but the Internet is very slow and when it snows the cable goes out! Other then that it was a great stay we were located right next to state street with Marshall Fields. We stayed from 12.3 to 12.5 and it was wonderful at night with all of the Christmas light all in all great stay!
