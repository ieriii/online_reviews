One of the best dogs I've ever had. EVER! To come is an experience. They play up to the nostalgia of driving in, findng a parking spot and ordering from your car. A waitress, sadly no longer on roller skates, will come out with your order on a tray and will hang it from your car window. So awesome!!!! Got the Superdawg and it was very good. I never did like ketchup on my dogs and I'm so glad to be in a town where I don't have to repeatedly tell the servers "NO KETCHUP" Whoopskidawg is definitely my new faborite. I know it's a Polish sausage and not really a beef frank but I don't care!!! The sweet BBQ sauce threw me off a bit but not enough to put me off. Just made it a bit more interesting! And it came with the crinkle-iest cut fries! I gained 6 lbs during my trip here to Chicago, I kid you not!!!
