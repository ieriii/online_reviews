Brazzaz is the same concept as fogo de chao. Waiters dressed like Aladdin bring skewers of meat to your table and you can yay or nay. Brazzaz doesn't have as many variety of meat as Fogo and it doesn't taste as good but their salad bar is pretty awesome.  Fogo only has monstrous veggies but Brazzaz has oysters, cured meat, cheese, hot station, sushi{!] etc etc. It's nice to know that you have more to eat than just meat.  That being said, for the price, I would pick Brazzaz over Fogo but it's not a place I would go back for awhile Too pricey. Service, ambiance, and food is all good! I really don't have anything to complain about here besides the obvious (price).
