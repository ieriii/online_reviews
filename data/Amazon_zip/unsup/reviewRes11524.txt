My fat friend took me here during my trip to Chicago. After trying some Chicago style pizza the night before, she wanted to have me try her favorite pizza spot here. It was really crowded when we arrived, even though it was a weeknight. The wait was about 40-45 minutes. They could have done a better job seating as we spotted an open table near the back. We headed to the bar for a beer while waiting for a table. Selection was good and they had a few award winning beers on tap. They make the thin crust New York style pizza. I thought it tasted really good. I was able to get a few slices in before my husky friend scarfed down the rest. Thanks alot, Bella!
