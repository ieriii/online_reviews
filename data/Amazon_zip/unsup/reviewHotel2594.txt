Ok I went here once with a bunch of friend from college. We had a blast. You could tell some of the clientele were snobby but we did not care. I thought it was a nice spot but you could tell it was a renovated factory space. I knew it wasn't an actual hotel. But I liked the hotel theme. Very classy. The back room was where we spent most of the evening. I think some of the couches were reserved but no one came and no one moved us so we chilled there. It's a nice spot to chill but not to dance. If you're looking for a chill lounge check this place out.
