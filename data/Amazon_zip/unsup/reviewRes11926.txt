I had been meaning to try this place for the past 10 months, and I wasn't disappointed. The draft beers are of a great selection. The pizza toppings were ample and the crust was just right. We had a spinach/mushroom pizza with traditional sauce and I was impressed. I would definitely go again. I would recommend that they put pineapple on the menu as a topping option.
