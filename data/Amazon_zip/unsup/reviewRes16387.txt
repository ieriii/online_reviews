So i'm a lil nostalgic about India House as this was the first restaurant I ever tried when I visited Chicago before deciding to move here & on top of that Indian food is my favorite cuisine.... but all biases aside I must say that this place is SERIOUSLY delicious. I've been here once for dinner & then today for the lunch buffet. I would definitely try the buffet, the price is really reasonable (we paid $36 in total for 2 ppl). Let me just warn you though that you should plan on leaving completely stuffed. As in you may need to be wheeled down Grand Av. & won't be needing to eat for the next 24 hrs. Lots of veggie as well as meat options, non stop naan w/ all of the yummy sauces, & an extensive bar & dessert menu.... ughh too much Indian food I'm full just thinking about it!!
