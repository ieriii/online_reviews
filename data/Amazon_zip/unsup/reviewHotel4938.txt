Rockin' Chicago BaseballMirror mirror on the wall who's the greatest team of all??? Cubs!Okay had to get that inGot tixs to the game last month and found a airline/room package on the net. Had never heard of the hotel but figured who fricken cares cuz I'm seeing the CUBS!The Elephant Castle rocked it with great brewskis and awesome fish n chips. Screw the chicago dog (did I really say that?) Check out the fish n chips. Btw the Elephant castle is in the Avenue Hotel. Great place, bought in the package was affordable which equated to more beers at the game. Me and my buddies were upgraded to a 1 bed room suites which were awesome. Lots of room. Free internet which is always a plus and the location couldn't be better. We'll be back for another game and another stay.
