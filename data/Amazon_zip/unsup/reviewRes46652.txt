My boyfriend and I just went there last night and I now LOVE RJ Grunts! We went on a random Tuesday, so it wasn't that crowded. Our waitress asked if it was our first time there and it was, but we really didn't think anything of it. The tower of onion rings is an excellent appetizer and plenty for two people. We both really enjoyed our entrees (the buffalo sauce isn't too spicy, so that was great). My boyfriend accidentally spilled his beer and they were really helpful about cleaning up and offered him a new beer at no cost.  Right before we got the bill, another waiter brought by a free brownie/cookie sundae since it was our first time! We got the bill and they comp'd both the sundae and the spilled beer. It was an excellent dinner and I'd definitely go back.
