Dined twice at the Purple Pig. The last time was an hour wait. Hype is a dangerous thing.. Anyway, this time I came with a friend from college that I hadn't seen in at least 5 years, so I was willing to wait around and talk and catch up. I had the lambrusco while waiting, which wasn't that sweet (I was bummed, because I like sweet wines.. but that's just me). Once finally seated, we ordered the: Roasted bone marrow: fatty & delicious as expected, though I felt that they could have given us more bread to go with it. Roasted beets with goat cheese: I'm on a relatively new beet kick, and these were pretty well done. note, they are served cold Fried sardines: crispy on the outside and good in the way that sardines are supposed to taste.. they have a strong taste though, not quite fishy but briney, so take note Razor clams: this was my first time trying them. they have an interesting cuttlefish like texture, sort of chewy. They came with the shell and were done with a wonderful sauce. yum. Mussels: very good mussels, flavorful. we ordered extra bread to soak up the broth Pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: I thought this tasted like Thanksgiving turkey. It was tender and moist but didn't taste like pork. so, unless you're craving turkey.. Turkey leg: really tender and flavorful, especially the skin. For dessert, we had a fried donut with ricotta and chocolate chips topped with powdered sugar. Rich, but delicious. Recommended for groups, but just remember to come early
