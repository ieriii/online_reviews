Wow what a great experience, including the service, atmosphere and food. Though they might want to not be so afraid of the electric bill and turn the lights up just a touch, just a touch (bit of a joke, realize that adds to the swankiness of the place). The seafood tower was a memorable experience, and a recommendation if you have a party on the larger side. Can't say that I can recall a better bone-in filet, the hot plate and sizzle was a nice touch.
