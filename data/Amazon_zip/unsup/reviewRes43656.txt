My first visit was about 2 years ago. I ordered breakfast to go for me and my mom while she was recovering at the hospital down the street. I got some sort of orange french toast or something. All i remember is that it left a good impression on me. It was also the first time I tried their homemade granola. I started buying their granola at whole foods after that. It's good, good for you, and good to support local businesses when possible. I ate there again last month and it was one of the best brunch dining experiences I've had. It was a beautiful summer morning and they were busy as usual. I waited about 20 min in line (out the door), the staff were polite, the food was delicious, and atmosphere was relaxing. From my experiences so far, i have nothing negative to say about Milk & Honey.
