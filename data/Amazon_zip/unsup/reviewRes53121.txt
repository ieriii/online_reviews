the bistek "special dinner platter" was pretty ok, a flat piece of steak that was super tender and was seasoned deliciously. the lechon sandwich was a bunch of slices of beef or something, it was kinda dry but the carmelized fried plantain helped. its also like $8.50 instead of $6.50 if you order for take out but it comes with like fried...something. not really worth the extra $2 but you get to sit down, i guess. vanilla flan for dessert was thicker, more substance-y than other jelloy flans, but otherwise average.
