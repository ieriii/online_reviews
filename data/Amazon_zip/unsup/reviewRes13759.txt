This place is horrible, don't ever ever go there. ^ That's my attempt at keeping this place low-key and easy to find a table. By far, hands down, I just ate the best seafood dish I can ever remember. It was my first time at Glenn's, sort of stumbled into it by chance, and easily see it becoming a once a week affair. I had the Arctic Char -- super fresh, but with their diablo sauce with shrimp that set it over the top. I asked about it before ordering, and the server said it came with a "vegetable medley." In the midwest, that screams over steamed super bland broccoli, cauliflower, and maybe a carrot for color. Not here. Top to bottom, side to side, and incredible dish. Sure, it was $20, but it was amazing. I've only been there once, only had the seafood, but see this as the place to bring my out of town guests.
