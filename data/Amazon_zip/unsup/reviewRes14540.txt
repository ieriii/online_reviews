RevBrewCo is approaching 600 reviews so all I have to say is this is a great local brewery. I had the IPA and it was very good. I had the Forest Burger and it was nothing short of amazing. Their fries are just OK. Go for the mashed potatoes instead. They also offer bacon fat popcorn. My husband and I didn't try it but the people sitting next to us had some. It looked sinful and delicious. DO IT!
