Overall: Good food, innovative in presentation and design, bit pricey. Menu sometimes undermines what is really served. The Deets: Sprout has a menu that is out of this world. Very creative, has lots of variety and basically makes each patron make a hard choice of what to order. I went for the brunch and had to choose between a great egg-dish vs steak vs cocktails vs veggies.... I wish I could order them all (just I don't have enough moolah).  The atmosphere of Sprout is a mix of nouveau and a rustic French countryside. White walls, sprigs of tree limbs hang around the place, easy lighting, but still appearing modern and fresh. The waiters are a riot (that is a good thing). Very easy-going, not pretentious, tells things as they are about the menu. I appreciate that because my food vocab (especially with hotsy-totsy french terms) is close to nil. The price is a bit over my budget. But for brunch it is affordable for a special day out. With a drink and entree and tip, came to about $25/person. Not too shabby coming from a well-known place. Would I come back? I'd LOVE to.... but I need some more moolah beforehand. ;-)
