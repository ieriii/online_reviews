Wonderful place, though it's always so packed I seldom even bother trying. Much nicer now that the whole "I smoke: You smoke" era has ended. Good food (the cheese plate is worth it) and the beers and ales are unparalleled in this town. What I don't get is the whole "American" side of the beer menu. Given the choice between Belgian and American, what hair-tongued honyak would choose American? My only complaint is that Omar does not permit singing at the bar, which is not usually a problem, but when it is a problem, it is a big problem, if you know what I mean. (Seriously: When one gets to that point where singing at the bar seems necessary, not much will put one off it. And then you have Omar over there scowling like an old nun and telling the bouncer to throw your drunk ass out, but the bouncer is a pacifist so Omar has to take the even more drastic step of refusing to give up more of that beautiful Belgian ale... not a pretty sight. We're sorry, Omar, OK? We're freakin' sorry. Please let us come back.)
