Lock me up here anytime! Friday night, about 8:30 pm - no wait! Fantastic! I love to be in a place where I sort of don't belong and the tattoo's and piercings around this place confirmed the Lockdown vibe, but without being in your face. I've never been to Kuma's, but have heard from others that its worse there, much much worse.  After looking at the menu for about 20 minutes (because #1 we couldn't decide and #2 were happy with our beer selection), we settled upon the Lockdown warden and the Elvis burger. I loved the warden, but be warned, the gooey cheese on the inside squirts all over your hands and I smelled it for about 48 hours afterward. That can be considered a good thing in the afternoon and a bad thing in the morning :) My hubby loved the Elvis, with peanut butter and fried banana's. It surprisingly added an interesting twist of sweet and salty to the burger.  Fries were ok - HUGE mountain of them, I think we finished 1/4 of them. Mac n' Cheese was good, but a little dry. Burgers on pretzel rolls is the main attraction and those did not disappoint.  I need to do something bad soon to go back to Lockdown...
