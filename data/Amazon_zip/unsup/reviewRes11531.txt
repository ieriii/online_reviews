I'm not going to add anything new--however don't listen to the haters. And the people who say it isn't New York pizza... PIECE NEVER CLAIMS TO BE A NEW YORK JOINT, it's in the NEW HAVEN style. Big difference. Oh and the mash-potato pizza is out of this world. If you add bacon, then, well, it's Iowa... or Heaven.
