Came here for my birthday dinner and thought everything was delicious, I had pizza, short ribs, caprese salad, and fried calamari, everything was fantastic. The short ribs took a little while to get out, so the manager came over and gave us a small bottle of balsalmic vinegar that we absolutely loved, now thats management right there, making the situation even better. The people were great and the food was excellent. definitely recommend to anyone who wants good italian food. The outdoor seating area is fantastic and very romantic, if you want to take someone out on a date.
