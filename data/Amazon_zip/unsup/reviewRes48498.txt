The food was pretty good, but more so interesting than delicious. A bit overpriced if you ask me, however. The main distaste I had with publican was the service. For a "quality" establishment I wouldn't have expected the waiter to completely ignore us. He never came by to ask us how our food was and was quite unfriendly. It was not very crowded when we were there, but you would have thought so by the service. Our cups of coffee and water were empty for a very long time. When the waiter's assistant finally came by to refill our coffee he spilled it all over my lap and barely apologized. He said he would go grab some more napkins, but he never returned. I will not be going back here.
