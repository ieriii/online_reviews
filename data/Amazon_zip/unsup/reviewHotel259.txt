Ehhhhh. Extremely noisy, curtains were completely ripped up, weird rust-colored (blood-colored?) stains in the tub, semi-questionable neighborhood, and "valet" parking is a complete joke (don't pay for it, just park in the adjoining lot for half the price). The staff, however, were incredibly friendly and helpful, much more than you would expect given how shitty the hotel looks, hence the 3 stars instead of 2. That, and it's very accessible via both public transit and the interstates. I stayed at this Holiday Inn because they were the only downtown hotel I could find that had a room and parking package that was within my per diem, and that will be the only reason I ever stay here again.
