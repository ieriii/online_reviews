We went into this place partly based on the Yelp reviews partly just a random walk in the area, which is known for good restaurants. We were lucky to get a table (apparently a cancellation) and were seated almost immediately. The waitress was very nice and friendly and professional. We chose that day's special, a ribeye steak, and picked some sides as well (blackened cauliflower, special fries) and got very good information on everything including the beer selection. The meat was unbelievably good and the sides were very good. The beer was even superb!The place was casual yet had its own elegance and a nice atmosphere with a mix of young and somewhat older people. It was a bit too loud with the music (we were right by a loudspeaker) but apart from that, it was really a superb dinner. I would go there a lot if I wasn't just visiting Chicago for a few days.
