Ambience was great. Loved the music. Customer service was awesome. Food was mehh. I ordered the beet salad, bone marrow, and truffle pasta. Tasted as if something essential was missing from each plate. I recommend ordering the bone marrow if you have a party of 3 or more. I went with a friend and we only finished one half of it; it was just toooo unctuous.
