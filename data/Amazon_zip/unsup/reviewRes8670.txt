Like meat? Then you'll love Fogo de Chao, a brazilian steakhouse in the churrascaria style. Waiters dressed as gauchos walk around with various types of meat on skewers, as you pick and choose which you want to sample. While a little pricey, you definitely get your money's worth if you're a meat lover, especially since the cuts of meat are of quality.
