Yeah, so I will just admit up front that I hate Wakamono. Have been on three separate occasions, and the same annoyances existed, so I won't be back. What are they? Happy to share! 1. Waitstaff sucks. You will have several different people attending to you, which might be a Scientific Management approach to maximize resources but really just maximizes the sh!ttiness of your service level. They never refill your drinks (if they remember to bring them in the first place) and often charge for refills. 2. Visa not accepted here. OK, they accept Visa, but only 2 cards per table. We had a group of 8. Who but the Flintstones actually carries cash anymore? They refused to split the bill up at all other than in 2 parts, so 6 of us had to go to the ATM and figure out who owed what afterward. When I'm done with dinner, I want to go lie on the couch and bitch about being full, not hit an ATM and create an excel spreadsheet. 3. Mediocre sushi at high prices. The food here isn't BAD, but it's not worth what they charge for it, either. You can't hide un-fresh fish in a tablespoon of spicy mayo, folks. For all the people who have commented on the 'mushiness' of the ingredients (rice, fish, avocado, etc) I couldn't agree more. I'm not really here to shill for better places (Rollapalooza on Halsted/Roscoe) but there are definitely better alternatives for a good roll (like at Rollapalooza on Halsted/Roscoe) within a couple blocks of Wakamono and they will smile when you arrive, let you pay however you damn well please and the ingredients won't have come off the Mayflower.
