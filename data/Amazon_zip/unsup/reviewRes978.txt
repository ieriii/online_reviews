I went to Hot Dougs 3 years ago and, even after years of hot dog noshing in New York, still love and recommend this place above all other hot dog joints. Sure, the line is crazy long and unless you have a car, it is a pain to get here via the CTA, but it is well worth the trip. The hotdog offerings change up frequently, but the pairings of meat + toppings are always well-conceived. It's also nice to have something other than a Chicago dog in Chicago, and this is the one place that hits the spot spectacularly well. Also, they serve really really good duck fat fries. I will say no more. The thing that puts this place over the top is Doug. He takes every order and is personal and friendly about it. While he prefers that you eat his hotdogs with the condiments he chose for them, he won't police you if you want to add more mustard (though you probably shouldn't). This place is unpretentious and a great deal.
