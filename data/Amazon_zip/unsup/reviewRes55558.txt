We just went here for bunch, and it was amazing! We initially were told the wait to get in would be about 40 minutes (Sunday morning at 10), but they got our group of four in much quicker than that. There were lots of interesting choices on the menu, from the usual omlettes or two eggs and toast type options, to more adventurous choices like the giant tower of chocolate french toast. We will have to go back!
