Sorry folks, the pizza here just isn't that great. I mean, it's not gross, but I've been there a couple times and I just don't see what all the fuss is about. They do have some unique combos, and the ingredients are very fresh, but nothing I've ever had there tastes THAT amazing. I think people are so enthralled with this place because it's owned by an official God of Rock, and if he thinks it's good, then we damn well better think so too. However, If you're a beer connoisseur, they do have a great selection of microbrews, and if you like karaoke, check out their Live Band Karaoke on Saturday nights because it's an effing riot. I am still recovering from hearing some guy give the worst rendition of Come Sail Away that you can possibly imagine, but it was so bad it was good.
