My colleagues and I went here for the lunch buffet. My immediate reaction was that it was a reasonably good buffet that compares well to other middling-high-end restaurants. The foods were all reasonably quite well done, and the fresh tandoori chicken and naan dropped off at the table was a nice touch. All in all, if left for the food, and the good if not remarkable ambiance, this place would have garnered five stars. I removed half a star for having being out of a lot of items for my first go-around. Another quarter star got removed for the rice having no saffron in it. Finally, I'm removing a tiny sliver of a star for their sartorial choices for their wait-staff; making them wear vests with "India House" embroidered on them makes their entire uniform look cheap and unsophisticated. All in all, I highly recommend the India House.
