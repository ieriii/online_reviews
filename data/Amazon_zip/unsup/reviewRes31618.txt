So. I've been going to the Chicago Diner on and off for... 7 years now? It started as a place I'd stop and grab some lunch if I got into the city way too early, and was meeting up with some friends in the area. The food was okay, but it was vegetarian, which was hard for me, as a 16 year old suburban kid, to find at anything besides pizza places or various Asian restaurants. I go back 1-5 times every year, and while the menu is constantly changing, it is CONSTANTLY improving. In addition to their amazing burgers, sandwiches, sides (Buffalo "Chik'n Wings", etc), they have a pretty awesome selection of Vegan Baked Goods (they get extra capitalization for sheer win), and a whole slew of organic sodas and beers, and I'm pretty sure I've even had a few awesome salads, including a raw tomato salad last summer, which completely blew me the heck away. The constantly evolving menu keeps things interesting, and the best new methods for making faux-meats get incorporated pretty quickly. Plus, almost everything on the menu can be made vegan (even the milk shakes!) I'd recommend this place to any vegetarian, vegan, or omnivore who is open to delicious flavors. One of my best friends got a Philly Cheez Steak, and thought it was just as good as the ones made from real stake he's had before, and he's a pretty harsh judge of vegetarian foods. It gets crowded, so get there early, especially on weekends.
