Absolutely beautiful and romantic underground bar/lounge right in the heart of Wicker Park. Perfect for date night- the candle light is very flattering ladies! I loved the enchanting music, seductive atmosphere and the first-rate cocktails (anything with bitters and/or egg whites really hits the spot!) I can't wait to go back and introduce everyone I know to this wonderful little gem of a place!
