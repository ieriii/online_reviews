Some advice: be selective in the meats you choose. The carvers tend to come around with the less desirable cuts more often, so don't be afraid to say no and wait for the next round. And pay attention to their knives. They carve at roughly the level of your head; I highly recommend you avoid getting stabbed in the face, so don't lean in too closely. Some more advice: go with the 50% off coupon. You WILL pay a lot to eat here, so try to minimize the pain as much as possible. And make sure you scrutinize the bill for mistakes, since they will be costly (I was handed the wrong bill and it was over $90 higher than it should have been). Some more advice on top of some more advice: come hungry. Don't eat for a day, if you can, since you'll leave stuffed to the gills with meat. Finally, if you go straight home after your meal, you may not sleep very well due to the sheer load all that meat is putting on your digestive system. Go for a romantic walk or something. It's difficult to say something about the experience at Texas de Brazil that hasn't already been covered by the other reviews. Hopefully this advice will be helpful for whoever reads it.
