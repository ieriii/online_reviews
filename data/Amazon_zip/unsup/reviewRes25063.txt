Delicious. That's about all I can say. Okay...twist my arm...I'll say a little bit more. We decided early on that we were going to do the 12 course premium chef's tasting and man are we glad we did. Plate after plate after plate of some of THE best food I've ever eaten kept arriving at our table. The standouts were the lamb chops - falling off the bone, perfectly seasoned and grilled hunks of juicy meat that just melted in my mouth. The mussels were divine. The beef shortribs and horseradish flatbread was amazing. The risotto, creamy and flavorful. The pinxtos superb - as good, nay better, than what we've had in Barcelona. The chocolate croquets we had for dinner were the cherry topper on an already exquisite meal. The cheese plate, the Iberico ham, the grilled hot peppers, the olives, etc. There was so much food coming at us that I can't quite remember everything we ate...but NOTHING was bad. I even ate some of the lobster tail and I don't like lobster. It was good! (But not god enough for me to eat more than a bite, I just don't like lobster!) It was expensive but how often do we really eat like gluttonous kings? Never. So it was absolutely worth it. We could have done a restaurant week tasting for a LOT cheaper, but we wouldn't have gotten all the great food that we did. I highly recommend this to large groups or romantics. Business meals or tourists. You won't be disappointed.
