This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Being a vegan, they have always been accomodating as far as dietary restrictions. However, today I went to Revolution for brunch, my boy friend ordered a side of homestyle potatoes and the tofu scramble. Apparently the potatoes are cooked with strips of pork which the manager tried to tell us was onion. They were not apologetic and we ended paying 28dollars for my boyfriend to eat pork, when he hasn't eaten meat in 7 years. Thanks Revolution, should've went to 90 miles...
