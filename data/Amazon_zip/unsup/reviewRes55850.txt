I had dinner here, this place is amazing! I had the best and yummiest Indian food and the free appetizer they bring before the dinner (a tomato-based soup and pita bread) was amazing. Great selection in the menu and prices are not too high. The service was good, too. Unfortunately the frozen drink I ordered was not blended very well so I could taste the ice particles in it.
