Glenn's Diner is pretty fantastic with sublime diner food, a cereal bar, and great breakfast options, but where Glenn's really shines is it's AMAZING seafood. Yes, there is an extensive menu including sandwiches, salads, breakfasts, etc. But take my advice and check out the blackboard listing all the various seafood options. You won't regret it. The trout with brown sugar pecan butter is delicious. The pretzel encrusted walleye is ridiculously good. And the catfish...oh, the catfish...served with a corn bread shrimp stuffing...it is drool worthy. The sea scallops are outstanding and come with a bacon, mushroom, cream sherry sauce that is the definition of happiness.  If I could afford to eat Glenn's seafood everyday, then I would. But, sadly, this girl is on a budget, so Glenn's wall of seafood is only a rare treat. Most visits involve the more budget friendly options found in the actual menu. The clam chowder is very tasty, and I can't say no to a grilled cheese sandwich. Then, of course, there is breakfast served all day. Chocolate chip pancakes? Don't mind if I do. Eggs and bacon? Yes, please.  A word to the wise: Glenn's is very popular, largely due to the excellent food and also slightly due to appearances on Check, Please and Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. This means that Glenn's is even busier than ever. This, coupled with a small dining room, means that tables can sometimes be hard to come by. If you are going during peak hours, then it is always smart to make a reservation in advance if you don't want to be either turned away or asked to wait forever. If, however, you don't want a reservation and just want to walk in, then you need to be cool with a late lunch or an early dinner during non peak hours.
