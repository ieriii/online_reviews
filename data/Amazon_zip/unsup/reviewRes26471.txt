New to the area, I was looking to some lunch options. Decided to try Simply it (delivery). Ordered 3 Ban mi's and curry noodles and I was pleasantly surprised. I was a bit upset that they told me (repeatedly) that their soup and spring rolls were vegetarian, when they were not. I am asuming our definitions of vegeterian were different. Sandwiches were good and the curry noodles were unique (good). Will defintely be going back here again.
