This was my first experience at Pequods with the Windy City Pizza Club. We sat upstairs which was semi busy. The atmosphere was nice, easy to hear the people next to you, but the lighting could have been a little better. The menu was not as big as I expected for this being a very well known pizza establishment. The pizza was very good, (I had a thin crust with vegetables) but the service was terrible. We ordered our food and after awhile we asked the waitress how much longer it would be till we were served. She went to go check and then told us that there was a mix-up in the kitchen and that we would have to wait a few more minutes... we were starving at this point so not words we wanted to hear. Overall, I would go back but maybe not at a busy time of the day.
