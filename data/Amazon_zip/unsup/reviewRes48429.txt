My favorite restaurant in Chicago. The style is unique. You're either sitting in one of the pig pen booths or at the communal tables. The setting? Casual. The prices? Reasonable for brunch ($10-15) The food? Fantastic. Bacon--fat chunk of pig-belly like bacon that is carmelized to offer your taste buds a slightly sweet and more so salty juicy piece of bacon. The best bacon I've had Fried french toast--2 slices of 1 inch fat french toast with pear sauce on top, maple syrup and a sausage. The french toast was generous, rightly fried, and went well with the pear sauce. French fries and egg--simple things such as french fries and sea salt were crunchy and nice done. Pork cheek sandwich--soft, juicy, good. Pork rinds--Personally not a fan of pork rinds, but I kept on eating these spicy-powdered pork rinds. They were fun. This was quite an extraordinary establishment to eat at. The food was New American style with a farm-like concept. I highly recommend.
