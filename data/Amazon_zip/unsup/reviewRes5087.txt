I was lucky enough to be treated to an awesome meal at Purple Pig, and I'm digging it. I mean, let's lay down the facts: 1) The tagline for this place is "Cheese, Swine & Wine" 2) It's one of Bon Appetit's best new restaurants of 2010 3) There is a whole section on the menu with the heading "Fried Things" What's not to love?!? Here's just a few that I savored: Salt roasted beets, goat cheese, and pistachios. Fried melrose peppers with sea salt and garlic. Housemade sopressata. Roasted bone marrow with herbs on crostini. Pork blade stake with nduja and honey. Housemade Greek sausage with rapini and grapes. Literally, everything was delicious. I could have ordered anything on the menu (well, except maybe the blood sausage, that still kinda creeps me out.) and been happy. I like the shared small plates concept, and the place had a cool vibe. Disappointed they didn't have the fried deviled eggs, but all else was great. It was pretty loud, over the music and the patrons, and at times it was hard to talk over the table, but overall I was impressed.  Cheese, Swine & Wine. Sign me up.
