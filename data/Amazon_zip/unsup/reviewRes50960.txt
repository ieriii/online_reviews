Just went here this morning for brunch and had a wonderful experience. I ordered the Eggs New Orleans and a bloody mary. The Bloody was sweet and spicey, something I'm not used to and quite enjoyed. The spice did not over take the drink and the sweet must be something from the south cause no other resturant does it. For breakfast I had two poached eggs over crab cakes with a side of potatoes. The cakes were chock full of crab, the eggs were done just right, and the potatoes were crispy and delicious. The service was attentive but not overbearing, the ambiance inviting, comfortable, yet classy. I can't wait to try this place for dinner!
