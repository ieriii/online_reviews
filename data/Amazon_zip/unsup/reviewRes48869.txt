For anyone looking for a great place for brunch without the huge Chicago crowd, I would highly recommend The Publican. Please note that we started our brunch at 10:30, but getting there early was certainly worth it. The atmosphere is nice and open, but the high-back chairs and the enclosed booths really allow you to have an intimate conversation with your party. Even as we were finishing up and the crowd was coming in, I never felt like we were in a packed restaurant. However, when we were done and I was finally able to lift my head from my absolutely amazing Fried French Toast with blueberry compote and sausage, I noticed that everyone around me was thinking the same thing. Well worth it!
