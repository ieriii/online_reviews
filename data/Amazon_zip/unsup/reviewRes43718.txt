Just got back from brunch...my tummy is very happy. We (3 of us + infant) went on a bank holiday Monday to line up with the others awaiting their breakfast feast. The blackboard menus of breakfast, lunch, and coffee drinks are pretty straightforward so we knew what to order right away: French toast, chicken sausage, huevos rancheros, house made granola/yogurt, coffee, and OJ. Drinks are picked up at the counter then you're seated or wait for a table, our wait was only 10 mins. Once seated, I noticed the hustle and bustle of the place so go elsewhere if you're looking for a quiet spot (or there's outdoor seating). French toast: 2 slices but huge and soooo moist w/a hint of orange! yum! Huevos rancheros came in a souffle dish, amazingly filling and Ioved the spicy spread on the side, more than enough to share. Granola was caramelized sweet and also w/a hint of orange and the yogurt had chunks of apple and strawberry in it. I'm not giving 5 stars only because the menu is small (no eggs benedict, hash browns).
