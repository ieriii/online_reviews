Went with 18 friends to celebrate a birthday. We got there around 1 am and the place was definitely not busy. As we entered, the staff was rude and scolded at us about taking off our shoes. We were ordering separately as the table we sat at divided us into two groups. Since it was already late at night, a few of us had already eaten and was not to hungry. So we decided not to order as much. Before we even placed our order the waitress asked us, and I quote "Are any of you Korean?" And when we said none of us were her attitude changed. Almost as if we were not worthy of service. So we ordered two entrees and a few appetizers for 6 of us and bill could've easily been over $60. The waiter heard our order and immediately started complaining. And I quote again "You have so many people and you only order two entrees. We are a business. Out!" At this point we were all confused and wondering what was going on and asked her what was wrong. And she just said "We are not taking your business." Then they proceeded to bring us our check for the drinks we had and had us leave. Is this any way to conduct business? Apparently there is an order minimum there that I must've missed, because this is completely unheard of. They definitely do not like to serve people who are not Korean. So unless you're Korean, I would not recommend going here and expecting decent service of any kind.
