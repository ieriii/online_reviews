If you love the smell of fresh bread and cookies baking, go here. If you love the TASTE of fresh bread and cookies even more, you REALLY need to go here. The smells are wonderful, and the tastes are even better. The people there are super friendly and almost always willing to accomodate your order. And get some cookies while you're there. They're DE-lish!
