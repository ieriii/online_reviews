Totally reminds me of Chickpea in NY, but better. Fast casual joint that serves absolutely delicious falafel sandwiches. They coat the inside of the pita with creamy hummus, then slice the falafel balls up and add cucumber salad and hot sauce (Sriracha no less!). There's absolutely nothing not to like about that. There's also a salad bar, which may be nice for lunch but seems like a pointless waste of space. Run here...or to its other location in Lincoln Park.
