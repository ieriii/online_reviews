I don't know why I thought this was a "small plates" restaurant. In any case, we ordered as though it WERE a small plates restaurant...and could hardly move when we were finished (way too stuffed to even LOOK at the dessert menu). So take heed -- this is fabulous food in ample portions. Be careful how much you order! Is there anything I wouldn't have ordered? Well, maybe the fries. At $7, they seemed expensive and not really worth while. Everything else was top of the line. The brussel sprout side dish with plenty of port belly is a revelation, as were the mussels that we had as a starter, served with crusty warm bread. The Caesar salad with white fish is certainly huge enough to make sharing a must and incredibly rich. My entree was the pasta with pecorino (I wished I didn't even have to share a mouthful but was glad to get to taste the 25 oz. ribeye my partner had ordered). We found metered parking on the street which was a huge plus not to have to valet. The music was a bit loud for real conversation, but all and all, a great dinner and a fun evening out.
