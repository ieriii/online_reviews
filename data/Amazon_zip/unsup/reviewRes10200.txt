Now this is what pizza should be! This was my favorite restaurant we visited on my trip to Chicago. Being a homebrewer and beer conoisseur I've heard of Piece through their World Beer Cup and GABF successes. When I saw that Chicago mag one of their pizzas the 2nd best in the City, I knew we had to go. We went on a Saturday afternoon at around 2-2:30 and the place was packed. The host told us it would be about a 30 minute wait if we wanted to grab a beer in the meantime. The bar was busy, so rather than fight for a beer we decided to just linger and stare at the delicious looking pizza. It wasn't more than 5 minutes when we were given a table. I think we were creeping out their clientele so they moved us up the waiting list. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, she took our beer order quickly -- I had the Pale and my wife the Kolsch. Both of which were fantastic. The next round I had the dunkel which was the best beer of the day. For pizza we tried, as suggested by Chicago mag, the plain with artichoke hearts. Neither of us have had New Haven style pizza and weren't sure what to expect. We're converts now! The crust was dynamite, the perfect ratio of chewiness and crunchiness. The artichoke hearts complimented everything perfectly. The pizza was astonishingly simple, yet everything worked. This place gets five stars, I'd highly recommend it. Skip the deep dish and go to Piece.
