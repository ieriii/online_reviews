Very good. One of my favorite Brazilian Steakhouses. The meat is cooked to perfection, although I found some of the meats to be a little too salty to my liking. If you are going to go here, make sure to come hungry because the service is non-stop (unless you flip the chip over) & for the price - you better get your money's worth. The salad bar was pretty well stocked the times that I've been there, but you don't want to fill up too much as you've gotta think about all the meat you will be eating. The staff have been all polite the times I've gone there & they keep everything nice, clean and organized. I can't wait to eat there again, but most likely for a special occasion as it is a little to pricey for most people.
