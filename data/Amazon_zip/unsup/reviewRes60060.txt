Andre's already written his part so I'll try to stick to what I had. I should point out that I am not big on drinking during the day time but I had a sip of Andre's sazerac and thought he was going to have to carry me home lol it was soooo strong.  I admit I'm not a Southern girl I am Midwestern through and through. However, I did some time in NOLA for grad school and long enough to meet my beau. I miss Saturday afternoons at Mother's and Zapp's potato chips. Big Jones, that's your next mission.  Beignettes were a great starter and free (!) and I had a really nice oolong tea in a cute little pot, and Eggs New Orleans, which was fantastic, the crab cakes were so good. Put poached eggs and hollandaise on top of that and you have a party! Our waitress was really nice to get me grits instead of potatoes since they are one taste I did acquire while I was in NOLA. They were great, creamy, cheesy, just the right amount of seasoning.  One thing I did pick up on in the south s. the big city in the north, is that you can go to a restaurant and be served well, but it's very unharried, and I thought Big Jones nailed that to a t. If you're used to being shuffled out the door while you're chewing your last bit of omelet like a lot of brunch places do, take heart. They did not rush us at all, and the food took a little longer than some places, but I think the quality of the food and unhurried service speak for themselves.
