The impression you might get from looking at Lao Sze Chuan's official web site - http://www.laoszechuan.c - is that they run an upscale and sleek operation - in reality, their main dining room is closer to a modest hole-in-the-wall, like just about every other shop in Chinatown's Archer Av. strip mall. But the food is great! They have a huge menu, I've not yet tried their hot pot dishes, but have enjoyed several lamb and seafood entrees (the mayo shrimp is not to be missed!). It's best to go in groups of 3 - 4 or more so you can sample several dishes. If you feel really adventurous, you can order one of their "Very Chinese" selections, which features dishes made from less-beloved animal parts such as (literally!) blood & guts. The one downside is getting seated, they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 people, and management of parties waiting for seats can be a bit unorganized & chaotic - but you can use your wait time to check out the dishes that are being served, the staff is usually pretty friendly & willing to answer questions & provide suggestions about the food.
