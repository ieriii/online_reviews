I went to Tru with my husband to celebrate New Year's and we absolutely loved the experience. They strive....no...achieve perfection in every way. The waistaff were so attentive; the courses were delish. We ordered the collection with the 6 entrees and we also had cheese and chocolates - lots of chocolates...yummy! Our dinner was a little over 3 hours...so worth it!! We will definitely go back!
