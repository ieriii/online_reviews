The pork rinds were probably the best part of our meal. They were so ridiculously crunchy, everytime i bit into one, my friend next to me would jump in surprise. Now that's crunchy. My second favorite were the chef's selection of oysters. Fresh and tasty. But really, I applaud the oyster, not the restaurant for that. Several of the remaining dishes we shared were just WAY TOO SALTY. We got a citrus salad (salty), octopus w/ dandelion greens (nicely charred but completely overcooked, tiny portion, and way too salty), the country ribs (nice flavor, i liked the pea pods and peanuts), and the dover sole (SALTY!). No pork belly on the menu tonight, in it's place suckling pig. Very tempting, but we had to pass. I'll come back and give it another chance and see if it was just a fluke night, because I still enjoyed the flavors, just not the salt. Perhaps for brunch. I'm not a fan of the communal seating either, but I AM a fan of being locked into a pig stall. C'mon, it's just funny.
