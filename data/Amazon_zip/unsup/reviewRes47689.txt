Went here with a friend from work for some cocktails and food, and was not disappointed. It was a nice summery night, and so after getting up to the rooftop I could see what the buzz was all about with this place. A very funky, cool vibe, and a good amount of people for a Tuesday night. The drinks we ordered were all made well and tasted delicious. As for the food, we ordered the mussels (I had nil), the steak salad, which is put together separately, but very tasty, the chicken samosas, which were fantastic, and very flavorful, and the sliders, also great. I didn't realize they had a law in Chicago that you had to go inside post 11pm, so that was a bummer. I highly recommend going there for post or pre dinner drinks while the weather is still warm! The staff is great, our initial server was pleasant and then the bartender downstairs also very down to earth and made a great vodka gimlet!
