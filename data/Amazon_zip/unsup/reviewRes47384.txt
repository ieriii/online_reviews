come hungry these burgers are humongous...! not always a good thing... burgers are good, and the service is great! 2 people could definitely share 1 burger and fries to leave room for beer... or you're going to be 1 stuff person because you do not want to waste an expensive good burger.. good music, good vibe but kinda small, you may feel a little rush, even though they do not rush you, but you can see the crowd of people building up , and feel a little guilty that you been there for some time enjoying yourself.. overall a nice place...
