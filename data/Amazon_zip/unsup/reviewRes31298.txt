I used to live in Bridgeport, and still like to support its businesses as I see potential. We headed out for lunch and were going to stop at one of our favorites, possibly Happiness chinese... and then we saw Nana. We are all about new places, and this one looked super cute and clean (not always the case with Bridgeport establishments). The prices were pretty high, but the food was delicious and the staff was nice. They didn't have soup that day, but I didn't mind the yummy mac and cheese with perfectly crisped breadcrumbs on top. The fiance says the patty melt with fries was pretty good and the three bean salad was decent, and the mushroom melt sandwich I had with home fries was the YUM! We'll be back as there are a few more veggie options I'd like to try, and I'd like to check out their coffees and such.
