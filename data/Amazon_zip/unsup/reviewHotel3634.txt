High Tea at the Drake is quite an experience. Certainly the most expensive tea and finger sandwiches you'll ever eat, but you pay for the experience. It is sort of like playing pretend.  It is way better during the Christmas season, but I'd make reservations in advance if that is your plan. The hotel is always decorated well and feels festive. This is a nice place for a group of girlfriends and could be a neat yearly tradition to start. You don't need to go more than once a year but I'd try it for fun.
