Wow! Was it expensive? Yes. But it super high quality food, perfectly executed. 10 courses, from PB&J to butter poached lobster, paired with wine. Really, really well done. It is expensive and worth it, not a restaurant you got to every weekend (maybe once a year). The staff were friendly, well informed, and attentive, the perfect combination of attentive without being pushy or constantly at your elbow.
