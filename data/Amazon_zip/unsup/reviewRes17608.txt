Two words- Mango Mojito (pure deliciousness). Carnivale's got it all: great location, swanky decor, awesome cocktails, and incredible food. I went on a Monday night with a few friends, and everybody had a blast. Between the latin music, colorful design and drinks, a visit to Carnivale really makes for a fun night out! It's a bit pricey (my share of the bill was $55...we split 2 appetizers, each had a drink, and an entree), but you totally get what you pay for.
