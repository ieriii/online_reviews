Overrated. Overpriced. too crowded. if you go there, you will have people standing over you while they wait for their table. Very uncomfortable. Very poor service and the prices are so much higher than most vietnamese restaurants nearby. Go to Pho Lily. food is fantastic, people are great. Tank noodle, well I would not recommend this place to anyone. totally overrated.....
