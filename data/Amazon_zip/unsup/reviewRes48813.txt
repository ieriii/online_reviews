This was our second visit. It was wonderful. I will say that my reading the menu there is very little that entices me to order. Nevertheless, once I have crossed that hurdle, and ordered the food is phenomenal. The smoked artic char is divine, the brussel spouts salad wonderful, the ribs terrific...Great concept, wonderful meal- terrific service- front desk eh... needs some coaching
