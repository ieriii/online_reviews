Came here for Saturday brunch on a whim with a friend and was not disappointed. We arrived around 11:30ish and were quoted a 45 min to hour long wait. I didn't know if I could wait that long but we took the beeper and scoped out the bar area. We ended up finding 2 empty seats with a perfect view into the kitchen...woo hoo, SCORE!  We ordered the queso fundido to start off and it was indeed "fundido"! You can't go wrong with anything that has cheese and chorizo! I ordered the Sapitos and he ordered the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena. My dish was 3 corn cakes (think tortillas) swimming in a beautiful and tasty chipotle black bean sauce, with 3 different toppings: scrambled eggs, grilled chicken, and chorizo and plantains. The scrambled eggs were good, the grilled chicken was tasty, and the chorizo and plantains...well, let's just say this girl is a HUGE fan of a sweet and savory, especially when they are put together. My friend offered me a bit of his carne asada steak and it was quite tasty as well. Perfectly seasoned and wonderfully cooked. A little charred on the edges and super juicy in the middle. I didn't quite stuff myself to the point of heavy breathing, so I decided to partake in some dessert. Everything on the dessert menu looked fantastic and I ended up going with a chocolate hazelnut "torta." Oh. My. God. This was hands down one of the BEST desserts I have ever had! It was the perfect balance of chocolate and hazelnut without being too rich. It was enough for 2 people and I did let my friend have a few bites so I wouldn't look like a COMPLETE pig. (C'mon now people, I'm still a lady.) They change their menu every couple months but I'll definitely be back...gonna keep my eye out for that chocolate hazelnut torta!
