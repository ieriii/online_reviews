its aaiitttee ... bin 36 is a decent wine bar, tucked away by the corn cobs. it's a good place to go if you're heading to/from, say, 10pin, and need something tastier than you'll find at a bowling alley. the flights (wine and cheese) are a good option. staff is helpful. i wouldn't make a special trip, though. and it's not what i usually think of when i want a cozy wine bar; a little too big and noisy.
