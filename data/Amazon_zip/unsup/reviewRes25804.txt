I wouldnt call this restaurant an authentic Spanish Tapas restaurant, rather they serve Spanish inspired Tapas with a creative twist--and they do come up with some interesting and delicious twists! Listen to your server when they recommend the tasting menu, it is the best value and you get to try some incredible dishes that you would never try otherwise. They offer tasting menus with or without wine pairings and you cannot go wrong with either. (If you dont care for wine, then try their Sangria.) At first we were bit worried as the table are close together. But soon we struck up a conversation with our neighbors and spent the evening talking about all the great dishes we tried. And when you leave, take a walk through the beautiful lobby of the attached Hotel Blackstone.
