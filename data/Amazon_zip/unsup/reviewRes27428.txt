I returned to Graham Elliot following their menu revamp and I was not disappointed. The server was spectacular, gave us all the time we needed to enjoy our champagne and look over the menu.  The beet salad was very refreshing and not at all what I expected while the duck ravioli was absolutely delicious with the pomegranate seeds. We asked our server to pair wines with our courses because I was too lazy to look at the wine menu and she seemed to know what she was talking about. She did an excellent job! The wine she poured was only $10 a glass and matched the courses perfectly.  My arctic char was surprisingly robust. I was expecting a small fish portion, but the slab of fish took up most of the plate. I am not a scallops fan, but I was told that they were also very good. The best part of the whole experience, we actually got popcorn this time! I concur with the prior reviewers, it is crack corn.
