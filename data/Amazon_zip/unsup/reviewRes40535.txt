Wild boar sloppy Joe, bone marrow, vegetarian butternut squash risotto all incredible! We put our name in on a Saturday night for four people at 6:30pm and THREE hours later we had the best table in the whole place. It was worth the wait! I would recommend going to put your name in and going back home to get ready. They will call you when you are up next as well so another option is to go have some cocktails at The Whistler and wait it out. Four of us ordered what felt like everything on the menu to share and a total of 6 drinks and we left with a $200 bill and very satisfied bellies. This was the best meal I've had in a long time!
