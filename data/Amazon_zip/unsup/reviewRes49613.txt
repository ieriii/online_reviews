The server was extremely helpful and pleasant. This place has the best skirt steak, hands down. Ask for your steak to be done medium. The salsa that is served with the meal smells so rich and taste great with the steak. Dont worry it is not very hot. The empanadas are great too. They are a bit small but taste amazing. This is a nice place to either take someone on a casual date or a group of friends. Oh and you must have the flan. Perfectly made and served warm
