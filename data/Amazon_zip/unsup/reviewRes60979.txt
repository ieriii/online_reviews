I enjoy a night out on the town but I'm more of a sports bar kind of guy so I was very interested in checking out this new upscale sports bar I had heard about.The atmosphere is great, I like the various levels so you can get some variety without having to venture outside and go to a new place. This is going to be a new favorite spot for my friends and I to watch the games.We all tried the hot wings, a favorite or ours and were satisfied with them and the hot towel service when we were finished with them. I think the 40oz of the week, complete with its own brown paper bag - will be a big winner too.
