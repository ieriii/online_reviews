On a nice day, please come to Piccolo. You wouldn't notice it from the outside, but they have a spacious patio with trees and lights, very romantic :) That said, the food was hit or miss. I got one of the specials, raviolis with truffle oil. AMAZING. My friend got something else (can't remember) and it was pretty blah. I started out with a cold soup, which was blah, and dessert which was unmemorable. That said, they have an extensive wine list which does not go unnoticed by this patron. On my next trip to Chicago, would consider coming back!
