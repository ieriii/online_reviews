Finally had an opportunity to go here after hearing so many great reviews. 1st major issue is parking is HORRIFIC. We literally drove around for 20 mins looking for parking and finally found a park about 2 blocks away. I went on a Saturday for lunch. Since it was 75 +, we decided to eat outside. We ordered the traditional Cuban sandwich and the Ropa Vieja sandwich. I must say, the plantains were the best I've had! I think the garlic oil really adds great flavor..just make sure you don't talk to anyone w/o a peppermint. The sandwiches weren't the best. The were just ok. The Ropa Vieja was not seasoned, but the meat was tender. The traditional Cuban sandwich meat was a little tough. Overall, will go, but not in a hurry.
