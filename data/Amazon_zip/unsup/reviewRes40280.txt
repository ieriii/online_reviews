A friend and I went for early Sunday brunch and were seated immediately. Given all the awesome options on the menu, we asked our server for suggestions--and went with the Market Omelet and the Chicken & Waffles. I'm not normally an omelet lover, but it was absolutely delicious and probably the best omelet I've ever had. The Chicken & Waffles were also amazing, better than any that I've tried in the South. And our total bill was $30something--well worth the price. Will definitely be back to try more deliciousness!
