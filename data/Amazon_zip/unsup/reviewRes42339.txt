What do you get when you combine: 1.) a kick-ass, artistic and cavernous ambiance 2.) unreal drinks 3.) ridiculous entrees (um, pot roast better than yo momma ever made...) 4.) & a seriously see + be seen crowd You get the best new spot of 2010. Ah.may.zing. Gilt Bar is worth the hype and worth being my new obsession.
