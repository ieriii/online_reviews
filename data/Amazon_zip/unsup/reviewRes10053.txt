If I had to sum up this restaurant with one word, it would be underwhelming. Which is sad because I've only heard positive remarks about Piccolo Sogno. This was dinner #3 of restaurant week and I was excited to finally come here. It's been on my list for a while and we just kept pushing it off. Sunday night dinner at 6pm was early but the place was still jumping. We got a table for two along the wall. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The chairs were the most uncomfortable I have sat in though. The way the back arched dug into my back. I had to lean forward or slouch throughout the dinner. Which wasn't long. Just over an hour.  I ordered the spinach salad, ravioli "Piccolo Sogno" and the panna cotta for dessert. Husband got the soup of the day, ravioli as well and the hazelnut chocolate cake. The spinach was fresh and the pancetta crispy but it had a tad too much dressing. The hubby finished the soup before I was done with my salad but as soon as the plate was cleared away, the ravioli came. I had no breather between courses which is something I hate. The ravioli was just so-so. The only cheese I could taste was the blue cheese. Supposedly there are four cheeses within those pockets? The sauce had little butter flavoring and the marsala glaze was nondescript. The parmesan shavings were a nice touch. Overall, underwhelming. The dessert was delicious but that shouldn't be the only memorable thing I ate. Service was quick, to the point of rushing. Maybe too efficient and a bit robotic.  I've heard the patio is gorgeous and I may want to come back to check it out. But I won't be in a hurry.
