I'm from DC and the big restaurant trend there right now are gastropubs. Basically a place where you can get food that is beyond typical barfood and a shit ton of Belgian beer.Nothing in Chicago touches Hopleaf. Not even Cooper's.I always get:- mussels and frites for one, which are done perfectly. I used to summer in the south of France every year with my French grandma and parents and these are just as good- whatever confit they have--duck or pork or whatever. Just perfect really- lots of Delerium on tap (I'm cheap!) and Lambics (peche or framboise)Service is hit or miss. When I had a group of 15 here for my 23rd birthday, they were excellent. Sometimes during peak hours they're crazed and a little huffy.
