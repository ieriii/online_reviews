I adore Revolution. The food is spectacular, the servers are friendly, the beers are delicious, and the people-watching can't be beat. It's getting pretty busy there now (expect a two hour wait on Friday or Saturday nights), but it's so good that I don't care! If you want to get in and get your food quickly, try an early dinner or lunch, or go for brunch on the weekends. Must-haves on their menu include: Appetizers - Bacon Fat Popcorn and Soft Pretzel Entrees - Workingman Burger, Farm Burger, and Iron Fist Fish and Chips Brunch - Breakfast From Scratch and Egg In A Hole As far as beers go, I'm partial to the Cross of Gold and the Bottom Up Belgian Wit, and I've only heard good things about their other beers. They have some nice whiskey drinks as well. This place is a must for anyone who wants to see the best of Logan Square!
