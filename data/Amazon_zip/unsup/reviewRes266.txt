I am so late in writing a review for this place. However, my memory of the food and experience has not dwindled one bit! This place is incredible, as most have written. Suggestion: go big or go home. If you are eating here, go for the 24 course. It is well worth the culinary journey! The food is... just go there! Sneak Peak: They have the ability to take the flavor from bubblicious gum and create a shooter, just for you! And that was the C class of the experience! I look forward to my next culinary journey at Alinea!
