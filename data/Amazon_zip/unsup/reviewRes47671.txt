I give the decor 5 stars, that was fantastic. However, the food was only worthy of 3 stars. There were so many meats I couldn't keep up. Our waitress was terrific and very into our table. The roof top was the highlight of the night and the drinks were on point. I would recommend this place for meeting friends for drinks.
