I always win this hotel when bidding online on Hotwire. It's a pleasent walk to Michiganavenue but I don't mind it. Parking is like 35 overnight. I have stayed here with my family and we liked the place. If you're lucky, you can get the BEST view of the city. It's usually my favorite part. I got my hair done at a salon at Merchandise Mart (which is a walk through the hotel building) so that was pretty cool. Then in the morning, you can walk through the building to get breakfast at Dunkin Donuts. But as far as the hotel, I liked my stay. It was comfortable. The bathroom is small, but the beds are nice. TV worked fine. What else can you ask for?
