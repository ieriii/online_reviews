Biggest burritos I have ever seen! They are humongous, less than half of it will definitely satisfy a normal person's hunger, at least it worked for me. I absolutely love the flavor at this place, whether it's the corn chips, the salsa or the chicken. Everything is delicious at affordable prices. Seating can be a hassle on weekend nights so plan accordingly. There is plenty of space to park but again if you go on a busy night chances are you will have to drive around to find parking.
