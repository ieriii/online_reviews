I wanted to like this place more than I did. Everything sounded delicious on the menu and in the reviews but something about it was just off. It was as hip as I expected but in a very Cavalli sort of way. If you like Roberto Cavalli clothes, you will like the atmosphere and people watching of Sunda. The main room was excruciatingly loud. My reservation was at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night and with the size and cavernous nature of the dining room my boyfriend and I could barely hear each other. Definitely put in a reservation, this place was pretty packed for a Tuesday. The service was good. Our waitress was very nice and really down to earth which was a nice change but nothing too memorable. She left us around 10:00 because her shift was over which was fine because we were paying the bill at that point but it was definitely a little awkward seeing her eat at the sushi bar while we were leaving. We ordered a sashimi dish (with tomato and thai basil) which was flavorful but subtle, the devil's basket (deep fried soft shell crab in a cast iron basket of chilies) which was great for me but might be too spicy for some and the beef lollipops. The lollipops had an interesting presentation but were dry and the sauce overpowered the light scent of the lemongrass the beef was rolled on. We also had a few of the hand rolls. They were really small but had a good flavor. The spicy hamachi poke was my favorite. I was really disappointed by the dessert. We ordered the mochi plate and being at a nice restaurant, I expected them to be homemade. They were not. They were definitely taken out of the plastic packaging, cut in half and put on a plate paired with three sauces (which were fine but nothing special, the sauces too could have come from a box). With so many Asian fusion places in Chicago, I just don't know why you'd go to this one. It's interesting but I think you'd be better served at more low-key spots like Spring or Takashi if you're in it for the food.
