Zero stars for attitude, 3 stars for food and service. I like their food, and their prices are somewhat reasonable... But.... They are very unfriendly toward single people. I normally dine here with friends and family, but this night I went alone after work and asked for a booth, and was told that none were available. They then offered me the bar. I looked around the corner and saw 2 empty booths. Not only did they lie to my face, they were completely disinterested in my business. I thanked the lackluster woman behind the desk and told her I'd find another restaurant, whereupon this overweight italian bully, who I'd only imagine as the owners spoiled son, barked at the disinterested woman as I walked out asking her what I had said...as if he were looking for an argument or fight from me. Ignorant all around. It'll be a lifetime before I return to this establishment.
