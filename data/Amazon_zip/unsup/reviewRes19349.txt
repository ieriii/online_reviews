Came here with my Dad while visiting for the weekend. I got a fennel soup (special) and the famous rabbit salad. Both were nice. Dad got a crystalized lemon creme brule for dessert that was extraordinary. it's a good idea to come for dessert alone.  We enjoyed some great service here. I'd come back on the weekend anytime.
