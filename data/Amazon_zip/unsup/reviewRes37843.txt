Giordano's serves up a deep dish pizza that you will definitely not complain about not having enough cheese. There is plenty of the stringy cheesy goodness in each massive slice.  Though I personally feel Malnati's uses better ingredients in terms of the cheese and tomatoes used to top their pizzas, I think Giordano's crust brings this deep dish together right. At first glance the crust does not look very moist, but it actually kind of is and is pretty buttery tasting but not greasy looking or feeling. Consuming just two slices can easily be enough for one person.
