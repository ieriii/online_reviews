This is one of the few new and tasty breakfast/brunch places I have attended in quite some time. There was a line but I had to wait about 15 or 20 minutes outside with a buzzer thing. I was fortunate to be seated in a corner right by the window. The atmosphere was nice although the other patrons were somewhat loud. I had the jalapeno sizzler (potatoes, chorizo, jalapenos, avocado, tomatoes, pepper jack cheese (I omitted the cilantro and onions). It was fairly tasty and it came with a side order of toast- I had the English muffin. There were also house made jams which were good but not terrific. My friend was happy with his spinach and feta scrambler. We both had cokes with our meals. The cokes were those little glass bottles and they do not list the price for sodas on the menu. The waitress was obviously trying to push the drinks as they are all overpriced .   Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Also the bathroom was clean and immaculate which is always a good sign. However I felt the prices were a bit high ($34 for 2 breakfasts with soda including tax and tip). I would give it another star if it was a better value.
