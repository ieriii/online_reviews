The food was great. The Sangria was even better. The only thing that kept me from giving this place 5 stars was the service. We went there on a Friday night and it was not crowded. Our server must have been new because he didn't know the menu at all and couldn't answer any of our questions. It took forever to get the food/drinks, but once we did, it was amazing. The only saving grace re: service was the owner, Branko, who swiftly stepped in and saw we were getting frustrated and refilled our drinks and brought us a some amazing shrimp as a taste.  We will definitely be going back and hopefully it was just an off night service wise.
