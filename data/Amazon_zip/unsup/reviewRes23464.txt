We were looking for a place that delivered and wanted to try something different, so we discovered Irazu through a random search.  We got the ceviche, empanadas, tilapia tacos, chorizo burrito, and the taco ticos.  The ceviche was a small portion, but was tasty.  The empanadas are super crispy and deep fried, but again tasty. The tilapia tacos were very delicious with the beans and rice. The chorizo burrito was super spicy with the hot peppers. And the taco ticos were delicious and they were basically like taquitos- like an eggroll but a taco shell rolled up with meat inside and associated veggie toppings.  We would definitely order from Irazu again.
