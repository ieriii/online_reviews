This is my first review (new to the whole yelp scene) and I just had to start with my favorite bar in the neighborhood.The beer selection is incredible. Anyone who goes to Hopleaf will find something they love...or have a really good time tasting their way down the beer list until they do! It's a Belgian-style joint but there is beer from around the world. They also have some tasty mead choices and wine.Hopleaf has it covered when it comes to comfort food, as well. The mussles are fabulous. There is always a great selection of cheeses and sausages and the toasted nuekse ham sandwich is absolutely delicious! Aside from the wonderful libations, the place has such a great vibe. I have gone a number of times by myself and have always ended up meeting someone friendly. The music doesn't overwhelm you...and when you can hear it, it's always cool...lots of blues...old blues. This is a place where people get togther and get to know each other better...not a place where there are 20 TV's and everyone is over stimulated by the 20 different games flashing on the screens. It has CHARACTER. If there is any over stimulation, it's because the beer list is baffling!My only issues are that they aren't open earlier than 3 and it does tend to get quite crowded. Waiting around is worth it.
