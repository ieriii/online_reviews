BRING CASH!!!! While waiting in line for 2 hours I had this funny feeling, like I was forgetting something or just this nagging feeling that I couldn't put my finger on. Then when I got to just about the door I started thinking about my past experiences of dining in the city and how they only take cash at some places. Surely, I thought with this place being so famous they must take credit/debit cards... or I hoped at this point in line that they did. Now it could be all my fault, perhaps there was a sign? idk... then I take full credit for being a tard. But they didn't even have an ATM machine, really? Which got me to thinking, I cannot be the only person to have done this. I wonder who else had waited in line for hours only to find out they must wait all over again. All that aside, my friends were able to hook me up and I was super excited to try the duck fat fries....wah wah, yeah... limp and soggyish and not really any different than some other fries I've tasted before. I had one of the specials and it was pretty good, but didn't wow me like I had anticipated with all the hype. Overall really disappointed.
