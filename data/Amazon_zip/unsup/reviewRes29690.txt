Every vegetarian foodie in Chicago must have visited Chicago Diner at least once, if they haven't then they should. It is always crowded. The food is good, but some of the dishes are a little too greasy for my taste. There are a lot of options even for vegans. Now that there are so many other vegetarian friendly restaurants in Chicago, I haven't visited this place in quite some time.
