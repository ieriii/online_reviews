I'd like to actually sit down here for dinner. I was here for a work event in which we had the lower room reserved. We had a sampling of all the pizza and a few of the popular brews. Our servers were attentive and I really liked the pizza I tried. I didn't find a house brew I liked, so the waitress brought me a bottled wheat beer to try. It captured my coworkers' interests as it was bottled somewhere in Asia and had a picture of an owl on it.  I drank these all night - kudos to the waitress for her good, yet unique recommendation! Bonus points that she didn't charge me for the special request - but who knows, maybe it was part of the package... Karaoke seems big here and I didn't have to wait too long to see the coworkers embarrass themselves - hilarious!
