Totally a solid thin-crust/coal-fire pizza. 1. Super fast. 2. We ordered the special (artichokes and porcini mushrooms), margherita, and prosciutto and arugula. a. the special was weird. the artichokes were good, but when the   mushrooms were reconstituted, they were too mushy, they lost   all their mushroom consistency and tasted gross. b. margherita. good, but nothing super awesome. c. Prosciutto and arugula...delish. I liked it the best, and no one   else really did...but that was fine more for me! 3. Service was AWESOME. The server asked how we liked our pizza, I was honest with her about the special and told her it was my fault, I just ordered wrong. Plus, we ate about half of it, trying to scrape off the mushrooms and vowing to not waste the entire thing. The server came back with our bill and comped the pizza. Totally unsolicited, I promise I wasn't being rude, and it was just really nice! We tried to leave her with a super awesome tip, and left feeling satisfied and happy. I would probably eat here again, but have some other coalfire places closer to my house that I love just a smidge more...
