Did somebody say Brazilian pizza? Yes, and let me tell you, this place is serious competition to the Italian dough. I have been living near by this place for almost a year and one day after work I decided to order pick up. When I arrived the place was packed, (it is a small pizza place with limited room and just one or two tables) and there were many others waiting as well. The pizza was sooo good. It was nice to see something new and refreshing for once! I ended up getting the three cheese (mozarella, gouda and blue cheese), with bbq chicken, red onions, and basil. To die for! Sooo flavorful, just exceptional! I have gone back several times since. They have a very extensive menu with dozens of different toppings, and I really mean "different" (like sea food toppings). If I ever move out of the area, I will make special trips to get my fix of Fogo's :)
