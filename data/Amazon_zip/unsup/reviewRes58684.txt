( first decor, than food ) The new design was themed with lots of  Sze Chuan Elements  -- red chillies ( for their signature spicy food ) , Panda ( this living national treasure are mostly found in Sze Chuan ) and bamboo ( Panda's food, of course :-P ) The idea is to dine with the sze chuan natives ( again, the pandas). So when people are saying that they lost their old family style .... come on, think again , they are much closer to their home now. Don't just say the decor is nice -- try to understand the meaning behind it , please?As for the food, I love spicy food , and their flavors are nice , but it's very obvious that some of the dishes are using the EXACT same spicy sauce -- only the meat is different , some even using the same kind of meat but named their differently and claim it to be two different dishes. Also, we all know that they are super busy and have a long wait , but the staffs just don't need to be rude and push their customers to finish the meal in a hurry so they can clear the tables. Overall I give them 4 stars for the decor , but -2 for the food and customer service.
