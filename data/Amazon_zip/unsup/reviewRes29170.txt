I will say the food is good, and not too expensive, but the service ruined my experience. We walked in, got some menus and sat down. After looking through the menu our waitress finally came to our table after a good 10-15 minutes. At this point we had already decided what we wanted. She asked for what we wanted to drink and we explained that we were ready to order. So we did. About 10 minutes later I was flipping through the table drink/deals advertisement and stumbled across a letter to the customers thanking us for our patronage. At the end of the letter it read that if our waiter failed to tell us about the daily specials, dessert was on them. Our waitress failed to tell us the specials (which we wanted to know but forgot to ask) so I asked her about the letter. She said "yeah, desserts on me". At this point I was thinking awesome, what great service and a great way to keep the servers on point. A few minutes later she came back to the table and told us that her manager and her decided that since we were ready to order when she came to the table that she didn't have a chance to tell us about the specials. NOW there are quite a few things wrong with this reasoning/situation. 1. Ready to order or not, it is still her job to tell us about the specials. 2. IF she would have come to our table earlier we wouldn't have been so prepared to order. 3. Whether she had a chance or not to tell us about the specials, the letter says what it does, no stipulations. I don't care about the free dessert. This reasoning and attitude is just in bad taste, and reputation is priceless in the restaurant business. Being cheap can be very expensive Pasta Bowl.
