This was a fun place and a place that has a good concept and executes well. Surroundings were fine and seating family style so don't go here if you're looking for an intimate tete a tete. Tapas style allows a lot of sampling and sharing. Good wine list relatively reasonable. A colleague and I went to the purple pig on the recommendation of a friend. It was busy but we were seated immediately at a high stool table for 12 with 10 other folks there already. Our newly found family to the left could care less about us. The folks to the right were voluble and friendly and made some suggestions as to our selections. They departed half way through our stay. Our first course was good but didn't exceed my expectations, a pigs feet and?? sort of fritter. I'd be more turned on to a "huspanina" pigs foot serving. This was followed by chorizo stuffed fried olives, good, some great rillets and marrow bones. PIG??? Who knows. When our new family to the right left a new group of locals moved in. We passed on our tribal knowledge. and they responded by sharing wine with me, thus adding to my belief that Illinois is the friendliest state of the union. I just could not picture this experience happening in NYC, which I do consider a friendly pace... This place is worth revisiting and exploring their interesting and good valued menu.
