like the other restaurants owned by the same group (lao beijing and lao shanghai) this place serves authentic chinese fare at a fair price. The dishes we've tried here are always good so you can't really go wrong with anything here. The squirrel fish ( i think that's what it's called) was crispy and flavored very well. Not a place you go for ambiance but it's definitely clean and simple. There is always a short wait on fri/sat nights so you know it's good when there are so many similar restaurants in chinatown.
