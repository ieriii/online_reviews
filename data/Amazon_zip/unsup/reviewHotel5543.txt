Really affordable option in Chicago. You don't have to pay like $200 for a decent room. It's located in the 'west loop,' just a few blocks from the Sears/Willis tower. And there are a couple 'L' stops located close by which makes transportation easy. The river and both major parks are within walking distance also. As for the hotel itself, it's very nice and clean. The room is big enough for 4 people. The bathroom is pretty big as well and our room even had a partial view of Willis Tower. Nice. The best part is the complementary breakfast. It's quite a spread. They have make-your-own waffle stations, hot foods like eggs and sausage and bacon as well as pastries, cereal, and fruit. They also claimed to have free wifi but it never really worked for us in our room. I did bring my laptop so I was able to connect directly and it worked great. Every worker we came across was very nice and polite as well.
