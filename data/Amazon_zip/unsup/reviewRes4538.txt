I love Sunday night at Green Mill because it's a full experience. Get a group of friends together and hang out; listen to jazz before, during and after the slam; enjoy the heck out of the sweet poetry while chewing on a Guinness. Mmm. The crowd is great; everyone is into what's going on and behaves with due maturity/respect/humor. I also like the dcor preserved from Prohibition days. All around great time.
