Superdawg is no Hot Doug's (my hot dog vendor of choice) but they do a pretty amazing job of delivering a choice Chicago-style hot dog. Each dog is lovingly placed (or lounging) in a box filled with some crispy crinkle-cut fries. What they do really well... - Instead of the traditional red tomato you'll get a pickled green tomato wedge. If you haven't had one before I recommend taking it off the dog and taking a bite of it solo and then throwing it back on so you can see the difference in taste. - They use authentic "Chicago Relish" (http://www.viennabeef.co) which is neon green and the best thing that happened to cucumbers. - The dogs are substantial in size and perfectly cooked. - The malts are good but don't stand out as unique like some of their other menu items. - The best side is the Superveggies which are basically a medley of different vegetables deep fried. My box had mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, carrots and creamed corn. On the negative side their Tamales are kind of bland and the prices are a bit higher than most other hot dog joints. But, if you are going to Superdawg for a hot dog you really shouldn't measure its prices to other places as most other places just don't compare.
