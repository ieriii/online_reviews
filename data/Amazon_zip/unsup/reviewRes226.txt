I agree with all the other posters, this is a unique place and a definite must do. The food is imaginative and well executed. On top of that I loved that the service was so welcoming and repeatedly we were encouraged, "Welcome to Alinea. Have fun!" They pull off the fun and excitement of such interesting food very well. My only complaint is that toward the end of our meal we were asked, "Will you be having coffee or tea?" We both answered coffee and thought nothing of it. When the bill came, there was a $15 addition for coffee. Now I'm not a stingy, penny-pincher, and on a $600 bill $15 is a drop in the bucket, but it has left me with a feeling that Alinea is a little sneaky. Maybe it's nit-picky but it just sort of bummed me out. Luckily, the meal was so good that my memories are still fond. Still a definite must go!
