Been here twice....once in a good mood and once in a bad mood. The bad mood was due to Chicago Pizza Oven and Grinder having a 'two-hour' wait. What bs! Anyways, this place is good for a meal before or after the zoo. Random comment yes, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place is what I mean. Assuming that is the reason there are always so many kids in this place. I wouldn't bring a date here. It's good food and will get the job done if you are looking for a casual meal. Not a hot spot for a night out though.
