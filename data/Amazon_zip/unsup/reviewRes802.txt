Doug is pretty cool. He took our order and sat us down soon after. We had the whole fam bam with us. All 7 of us. The line was really long and stretched around the block. They have a very unique menu and lots of good eats to choose from. It's not your typical hot dog spot, so be ready to explore different meats and new tastes. Bring your adventurous tongues and stomachs! The only thing was that it was wayyyy crowded in the restaurant. Maybe because I'm used to all the space we have in Texas that it felt cramped. Come on the weekend and get duck fat fries. Sooo good!
