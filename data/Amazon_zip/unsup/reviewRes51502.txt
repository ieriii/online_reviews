The margarita about knocked me on my ass (much to my husband's amusement!) Usually, I'm a two-drink-per-dinner type of girl, but this time one was more than sufficient. I actually fell asleep on the couch for a little while after we got home.  The food here is just ok, but it's actually much better than other mexican places i usually frequent. We would definitely come back. The chips and salsa were better than usual. I had one of the combination dinners with an enchilada, two flautas, and a taco, all served with rice and beans. The enchilada was awesome! The flautas too greasy and the guacamole flavorless. The taco was a bit dry. The rice was good, but the beans needed about a handful of salt to make them taste like anything. Next time, just order the enchiladas and skip the rest.
