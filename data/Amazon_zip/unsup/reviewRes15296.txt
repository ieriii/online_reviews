The place was definetly low key... It was a Tuesday night and busy to the point that we were unable to get our own chairs. We ended up sitting at the bar which was quite entertaining but we were looking forward to the cool chairs. The drinks were very presentable and the Juliet n Romeo was delicious! We also had appetizers which the cod and the onion dip was a 8 out of 10 if say.. Overall pleasant experience!
