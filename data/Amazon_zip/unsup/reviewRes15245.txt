Truely an amazing resturant. The steak was unbelievably tender and the seafood was obviously fresh. Excellent place for birthdays, special occasions or a hankering for yummy food without the heavy pricetag. You get a LOT of food with your dinner. The warm bread is awesome and I reccommend the garlic dressing with your salad. It's obviously homemade.
