I feel awful for writing a 3-star review among all the glowing 4 and 5-star ones, but I really did think that it was just ok. Tuesday night is 1/2 price burger night - the place was packed, but we got a table right away. We were seated inside, where tables are close to each other and the music is LOUD. It was quite difficult to carry a conversation without screaming. Our waitress was pretty cool. She seemed genuinely concerned when she delivered the bad news that the Warden is not included in Tuesday's special. That's alright, I thought. I came here for that particular burger and who knows if/when I'll be back. It took forever to get our food. Thankfully, Lockdown has a full service bar for those looking to speed up time. When the burgers arrived, they looked great, although we had to ask for our sides, which never came with the burgers. You can smell the truffle oil from a mile away. The fried shallots, though, were a bit confusing and unnecessary. I have to say that they got the pretzel bun right- see, the pretzel bun can be either very bad or very good, there isn't anything in between. Lockdown's was very good. The entire burger, though, seemed to be missing something and I couldn't help dipping it in ketchup. I guess everything that needed to be there got stuffed inside the burger- the patty was at least an inch thick. The Warden was not what I envisioned and was a bit salty. I dunno, maybe I'll be back and try the Green Mile, but it will be a while before I finish completely digesting the Warden. I would definitely request a table outside. I was irritated by the loudness and confusion of the place by the time I was done with my meal.
