I went here for my birthday brunch. They accommodated a party of 10 and sat us even though the whole party hadn't arrived. They were patient with our party considering I had lots of stragglers coming in late past the time of the reservation. While I thought my french toast was just ok I really liked the appetizers we ordered- crawfish fritters and cheddar biscuits. I also tried a lot of my friends food and they were really tasty (corn cakes, eggs benedict). I probably just ordered the wrong thing, I would definitely come back and try something else on the menu. Our server was also very helpful in answering our questions about the menu and was tentative to our table.
