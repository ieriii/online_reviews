If u wanna have a horrible nite tonite, head out to Sunda. They won't seat u even with a reservation. If u arrive 10min early, they make sure u wait that 10min before they break the news to u. Bcaz they r so thoughtful, u'll b offered a coat check during this process. A great spot to see discrimination against ppl with kids n disability. Thinking abt calling ahead? Don't worry, u'll b so misinformed it's beyond belief. The waitress/host are carefully selected to get the top bi*ches in Chicagoland area. Overall, a great place to try if u got extra time to waste. And this entire experience is offered to you at no cost, absolutely free!!
