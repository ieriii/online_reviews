This place is fast and cheap, food is decent. I've only gotten falafel due to a slight fear of meat cylinders, but it's always ok. The falafel is a little dry, a little bland, and usually cold. I wish it was fresher, crisper, hotter... I am always reminded of the great falafel I had growing up in NY when it was fried right then and cost $3.
