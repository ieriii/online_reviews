We had the chef's tasting menu, which was a good choice considering the chef, Jose Garces, was actually in-restaurant that night. It's not often an Iron Chef cooks you dinner, so it's best to jump on an opportunity like this when you can. The fact that we had no idea he'd be there this night is neither here nor there. Anyway, we had the deluxe tasting menu which included such gems as bacon-wrapped dates, bacon-wrapped lamb, serrano-wrapped yellowfin tuna, and braised rabbit agnolotti. It's a lot of work eating all 12 plates, and you'll be exhausted and ready to burst at the end, but it's a great dining experience. Also, don't miss out on the sangria. It's high-end stuff with unique flavor combinations, and you'll catch a nice buzz. What's not to like?
