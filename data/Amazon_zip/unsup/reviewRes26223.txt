I would have to say that we went to Simply It before going out so the case of beer dranken at dinner probably ruined our palates! But the food was just what the name implies, simple. The dishes, although tasty, where not anything to write home about. I would have to say though that the ingredients where super fresh which is always a plus and something I look for!  The three reasons I would give it a positive rating... One, the obvious, its B.Y.O.B. and that is my type of establishment. The second reason, Vietnamese Coffee! This was some of the best coffee I have ever tried and I am a huge coffee fan! They make it with condensed milk so it has a creamy texture to it and a unique flavor. Head up though, they bring you sugar but DO NOT USE IT! The coffee is already sweet enough and I made the mistake of adding more, which was regrettable! The third, it is cheap! We ordered there apps and three entrees and the bill was like 50 bucks!
