I'm on the fence with Nana... on the one hand, I love it for bringing fresh, organic food in an adorable setting to Bridgeport. Nana is a bit out of place here, but I so appreciate it and Bridgeport needs it. But....on the other hand, prices are also a bit out of place for Bridgeport. $7 for a glass of OJ...really?! Do people seriously pay this much for a glass of OJ - organic or not? I certainly don't... Some highlights: They serve Metropolis coffee - the best coffee in the world. Major plus. The food is pretty good - the chicken sandwich was kicked up a notch with guac, an amazing bun, and fun side dishes - cheddar japelano grits or green bean salad - both looked great. Plus, the (I think) homemade pickle chips were amazing. But with coffee, tax and tip (and no OJ) - lunch is about $25 (and I finished all of it, portion size I would say is just right)...pretty expensive for this hood. I'll be back for sure, but it's a very occasional workplace lunch destination - not an everyday (like Zaytune!).
