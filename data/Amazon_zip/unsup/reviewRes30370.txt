Yum! I've been here twice now - only for lunch - and both times it's just delish! I've had the rock shrimp tempura which is really just amazing. I would be happy ordering 3 of these for my meal and that's it. I'm never a huge fan of fried shrimp but these are just too good to pass up. I also highly recommend the crispy rice pan fried sushi - I've tried both the spicy tuna and kobe beef. The spicy tuna was very good but the kobe beef - ridiculously amazing. It's a rare occasion when I prefer beef over any type of seafood but Sunda has found a way to make it happen. I've also tried a few of the sushi rolls - rainbow roll, mushroom lover, tail of two tunas, spicy tuna, and firecracker. All good, expect the mushroom lover was pretty disappointing. Being a mushroom lover myself, I figured this roll was meant for me. It was pretty flavorless and disappointing. I definitely wouldn't order it again. In addition to the great food, they have such a cool, trendy atmosphere and the service has always been great. The servers have recommended some great options and helped us figure out how much food to order for a group. The prices are little high but it's river north and about what you can expect for any trendy places in that area. I seriously can't wait to go back here. Please, you need to go and make sure you get the rock shrimp tempura and crispy pan fried sushi with kobe beef!!!
