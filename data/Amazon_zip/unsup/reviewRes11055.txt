This was the first place my pals took me when I came to Chicago. It's now the first place I take my pals when they visit Chicago. I can wait at the bar and have delicious beers until I get a spot at the bar or a big table. Sports and music keep me entertained here. I'm anti-karaoke from top to bottom, but at least the rock band makes it somewhat bearable. And, Piece usually has a good ratio of talented singers to "are you kidding me they're singing meatloaf or grease" groups of girls. With almost all other pizza, I'm a pepperoni and jalapeo guy. But at Piece, nothing beats a white pizza with spinach and roasted red pepper. Seriously. Try it. If you don't like it, bring me your left-overs. There's one girl behind the bar who never looks happy, and no matter how hard I try, I can't get her to smile. They get the star when I get the smile!
