Wonderful food, Wonderful staff. Whenever I am in Chicago with my friends we ALWAYS eat breakfast at 3rd Coast. We always have great food and great coffee, esp. the Irish coffee. The 3rd Coast is a must especially for breakfast. The staff are all wonderful people and they almost seem like they are all family, which makes the atmosphere extremely pleasant. I have tried many things on they menu and I have not had anything i did not like. When in Chicago The 3rd Coast is a must.
