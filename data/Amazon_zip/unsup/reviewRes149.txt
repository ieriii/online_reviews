There are enough reviews here to demonstrate just how spectacular this place is... I won't waste your time with raving and keep it simple and short. Very innovative food concepts. Highly memorable dishes with flavors that will haunt you for life. Customer service and the experience itself is ridiculously professional and top notch. A few parting thoughts: Hot Potato, Cold Potato Black Truffle Explosion Golden Trout Roe These three dishes have left me ruined for life... I'm not sure I can eat anything else that will measure up to just how wonderful they were... have you ever eaten something so good, that it made you want to smile... and then break out into an uncontrolled laugh? That's what these few dishes did for me.... Yes it's pricey, but let's be honest... we go out and enjoy food, and pay probably $35 a meal. So if you can resist going out not even 10 times, you will have the opportunity to experience one of the greatest meals of your life. I have. And I will not forget it soon...
