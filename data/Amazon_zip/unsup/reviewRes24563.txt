I have been going to Artopolis for years now, and finally have decided that I need to yelp about it! They have great specials, well priced, and in greek town (easy parking)! I had the Hawaiian pizza this time with a half of Cesar salad it was perfect size and the pizza was delicious just the perfect amount of toppings with crust that was great! Love the service everyone is friendly and reminds you of a cafe in Europe. Now onto the desserts, they are all amazing, great to bring to client meetings as well as parties. Love this place and the area!
