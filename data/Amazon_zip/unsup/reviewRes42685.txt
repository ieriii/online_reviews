Let me say Ive had thee best lunch at work Ive had in a loooong time today. It helped me coast through the rest of my shift..though all I wanted to do was take a nap afterwards. I thought the breakfast pizza was tops but that bar just got raised. I can honestly say Fogo is my favorite non-deep dish pizza.  This goes against all my notions of chicken on pizza. Just the thought of it is just unappetizing. Chicken is just dried...fiber. BUT, fogo clearly knows their way around such a devilish concoction.  BBQ chicken : cilantro, red onions, gouda, bbq sauce. Buffalo chicken : buffalo sauce, celery, carrot, aright...what was that i just bit into? I thought it was just cheese..whats that white sauce? Is that..ranch? Something else too...and blue cheese? Genius..no, glorious!
