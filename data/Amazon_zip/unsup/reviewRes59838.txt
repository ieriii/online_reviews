Went here with the wife for our anniversary dinner. It wasn't bad, but not spectacular. Our waiter was great, he gets 5 stars! However, the food was ehh. Or at least the side dishes were, my wife had the house specialty potatoes and we cant remember the name of them, they were not good. The steak was good and so was my crabcake. I think I can find better steak house than this one.
