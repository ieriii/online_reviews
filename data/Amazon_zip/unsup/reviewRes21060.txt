I love this cozy little Mexican joint and apparently everyone else does on Tuesdays and Thursdays when margaritas are half off. But even with the crowds, Mayan Palace is my go-to Mexican. Their food is delicious, the service is prompt and the drinks are sufficiently strong. My only gripe is they're missing a Vegetarian Burrito. There's one on the menu but it's not the standard kind you'd find at a hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant attached-to-a-motel in other parts of the Midwest. The Veggie Enchiladas aren't too shabby and quite a great compromise. This is one of my favorite place to bring friends, especially those who haven't found their "Mexican place" yet.
