I could not believe I had never been here! Such great food, fun atmosphere, awesome service. I went on a Friday with a large-ish group. We brought a bottle of rum and they gave us some mojito mix and let us sit at a table while we waited for our real table (a pretty short wait considering our group size and how busy they were). The wait staff was totally sweet and gave good recommendations. Everyone was happy with what they got - I got the steak cuban sandwich that is served between plantains rather than bread- YUM. I would also recommend the plantain-shrimp cup things that come as an appetizer.  I cannot wait to go to this authentic, lively, quality restaurant again!
