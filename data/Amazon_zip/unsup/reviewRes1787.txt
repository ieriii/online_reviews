I went again on a Friday afternoon. After standing in line for an hour, I ordered the foie gras sausage and duck fat fries. I can't tell the difference between regular fries and duck fat fries, but they were awesome regardless. And this is from someone who normally doesn't like fries. The foie gras sausage was really, really tasty. Expensive at $9 for a "hot dog" but definitely worth trying. I wish I could have tried more, but I was planning on eating out for dinner so I had to hold back. This place is an experience and I love how different the menu offerings are. I mean, where else can you sample foie gras, elk, ostrich, etc, but still be in the middle of a hole in the wall while wearing flip flops and a tank top?
