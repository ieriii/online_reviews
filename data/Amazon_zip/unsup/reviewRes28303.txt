I stopped by Graham Elliot lat night after the Yelp Winterscape party to get a drink at the bar with my partner in crime, Caroline E. I had a better experience than my first time I went when I got the tasting menu (see previous review). This time it was all about the drinks and the truffle popcorn, and I was a happy girl. We even got to see Graham, which was pretty cool. It was a good vibe, and made me want to try the restaurant on a whole again. To be continued...
