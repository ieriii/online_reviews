Been here twice and this place is packed. They have open seating and you have to make sure you keep your eyes open for a seat since everyone is fighting for it here. I've tried their Korean fried chicken (Seoul Sassy) and it's sooo good! The pieces are big, so ordering the smallest size will fill you up. I've also tried their bowls, which is also very good. They give you a lot of food for the price. Worth checking out!
