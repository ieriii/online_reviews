I used to go to this restaurant fairly often a number of years ago and my favorite dish was zuppa di pesce (seafood stew). I hadn't gone for about three years (no real reason why) and I just went again a few weeks ago. Things have changed, unfortunately. They are now packing in the tables so you are almost sitting in your neighbors' lap. Give up any hope for privacy. Service was still pretty good although we had to keep asking for water-I guess the salty food was making us drink like fish. I again ordered my favorite fish stew but, alas, it was no longer the stellar dish I remembered. You used to get this huge bowl of seafood with a salmon fillet in the middle. The broth used to be flaverful enough to have on its own. Now, it's about half the size, had only a paltry serving of salmon, and very little broth. It was more like a seafood linguine and they expected me to put the side of linguine into the stew. If I wanted to do that, I could have ordered the linguine frutta di mare and saved myself some money! I took some home and they packed it with the linguine mixed into the stew - just proves the point that this was not a true soup. Too bad, it used to be one of the best seafood stews in the city. No more.  The other dishes that my dining partners got were good but not great. They are on the high end of pricing and you can do better with other Italian restaurants - try Agostino's Ristorante on Harlem.
