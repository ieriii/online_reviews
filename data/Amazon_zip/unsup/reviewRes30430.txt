I went to dinner here with my best friend after work. The staff who made our reservation earlier that week was more than helpful and professional on the phone. This level of professionalism and outstanding service carried over to our entire dining experience. We sat at the bar to try one of Sunda's speciality cocktails. The bar tender was attentive, asked us questions and was a good listener to our likes and dislikes. Over all the experience with our drinks was fantastic, and the specials really helped those who are maybe watching their budget for dinner. We were promptly seated centrally in the restaurant, which really added to the dining experience. The art work and overall feel of the space is wonderful. It was intimate, yet really made you feed off the energy and people in the room. While ordering the wait staff was one of the best experiences I have encountered in Chicago. Our waiter was knowledgable, nice and respected our timing throughout dinner. The menu had more than enough choices. We got the beef lolipops and potstickers to start with. They were perfectly paired and tasted great. I HIGHLY recommend the FireCracker Roll. It was delishious and we both commented we could have ordered it for our dinner. We also ordered the chicken Pad Thai, which is enough of a portion size for 3-4 people. I will be back very soon, and time again to this fantastic restaurant!!
