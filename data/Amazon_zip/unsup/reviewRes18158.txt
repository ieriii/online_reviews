My friend suggested this place for a quick bite midway into some day drinking. I really didn't think it was gonna be my kinda thing, I was hoping for some tacos...but there were no tacos on the menu. I was at a loss as to what to get. I wasn't super hungry, but I definitely wanted something. I ordered the chipotle chicken torta. For some reason, I was expecting something totally different than what it actually is...I haven't actually had tortas before. Maybe you'll think I'm crazy....but the bread mixed with the tomato sauce (that sauce really made it for me) brought an Italian vibe to my torta, but the chicken and avocado plus the beans spoke more to the Mexican aspect. My friend and I sat outside to eat, and as I was sitting there stuffing my face two guys walked by, pointed at me/my torta and said that looks good. They then turned right into Xoco. Clearly, it looked as good as it tastes! My friend also ordered a churro, which I had a piece of. Pretty good, wish I had it right when we ordered it so maybe it would have been warm. Then it probably would have been amazing.
