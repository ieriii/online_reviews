I am a huge fan of Rick Bayless. I love his approach to Mexican food and is passion always comes through in his interviews and TV shows. Having said that, maybe Mr. Bayless should spend a little more time in his restaurants and less time in Merida, Oaxaca, Mexico City ect. We Planned a trip to Chicago from the suburbs around the night at Frontera grill. We were very dissapointed in the level of service and the quality of the food. It hurts me to write this because I wanted so bad to love it. I wanted to see some things that I had not before, I wanted to have some eye opening experience. The whole "I never thought of that , or wow! thats how they do it!" Did not happen. Sad to say I can do better in my own home and I have not spent time learning from Elderly Mexican ladies who have learned from thier grandmothers and thier grandmothers and so on. In my opinion Frontera grill is dishonoring the very same Mexican cooks who taught Mr. Bayless all those cool tricks about Mexican food. I know he can do it. But I would like to see him hire a Kitchen Manager who can uphold the standard. A better meal could be had at Senor Behena's restaurant Real Tenochitlan. I Love you Rick but you need to Clean house In your restaurant.
