i went there for lunch with co-workers...i'd never been to fogo but one of my lunch buddies heard brazazz was just as good and was cheaper so we decided to go. i was a little disappointed...i was expecting this AMAZING meal...it was good, don't get me wrong, but maybe i had my expectations a little too high. some of the cuts of meat were delicious...while others were either ok and even a little dry. i wanted to try everything and i did...nothing blew my mind...except the pineapple. i think i finished off the meal with like 6 of those. i know what brazilian bbq is supposed to be like...i spent a few weeks in portugal and the places we went to there were freakin amazing... maybe brazzaz is better for dinner? in either case, i'll hit fogo before i come back here so at least i can compare the two.
