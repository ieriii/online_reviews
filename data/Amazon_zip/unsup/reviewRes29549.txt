It's high time I reviewed The Chicago Diner. The food here is delicious. Is it the most HEALTHY for you in terms of calories and fat? Probably not, as it is a diner. However, when I am craving a good burger or decadent wrap, wings, nachos, etc. this is the go-to place for me with their creative and delicious vegan/vegetarian menu. I even tried the cheesecake, "cheeze cake" as they called it, which tasted exactly like regular cheescake. I am blessed to have The Chicago Diner in my city, other places are definitely missing out!
