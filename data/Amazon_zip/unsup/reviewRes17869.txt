I'm a vegetarian. I love burgers. I am addicted to Kuma's. I am also old and have a job and so would like to have a place to get a Kuma's quality burger on a Friday or Saturday without having to wait for four hours. So I had great hopes for The Bad Apple, especially when we walked in at 7 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Sadly, I was disappointed on all but two counts. First--the cheese curds are great, light and flavorful. Second, the beer list really does overwhelm, in such a good way. I had a bizarre mustard beer and the great new cider by the Goose Island guy (it's tough to get!). But the burgers and fries were not great, by a longshot. My partner got the Edmund Fitzgerald and it was fine, he said, but not exceptional. I got the Strange Famous veggie burger, and it was okay. But the toppings were so, so boring and the whole concoction was dry. I was almost crying for a Kuma's ABSU half way through. The fries were okay, but still--kind of dry, like it was impossible to use enough ketchup to give them some flavor. There were no big, bold flavors here. I should also add that while this place seems much more vegetarian friendly than Kuma's, I don't think it actually is, if you want a burger. Yes, there's a lentil wrap, a pb&j, some salads, and a portabello mushroom on the menu in addition to the Strange Famous. But there's only one burger. If I'm going out to dinner, I don't want a pb&j. And a lentil wrap? I am at an ashram in 1987? To top it all off, the service was seriously slow. We were seated for a solid hour before our appetizers even arrived. And I have officially talked myself from three stars to two!
