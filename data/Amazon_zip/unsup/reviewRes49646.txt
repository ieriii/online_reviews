This is by far my ALL TIME FAVORITE restaurant. My husband took me where when we first started dating... back when I did NOT enjoy trying different foods and usually ate the same 'ol thing. Now, I have to say that Colombian food is my second favorite food to eat (after my mom's home cooking).  Our typical order starts with the empanadas, than we share the Picada Colombian which is a huge dinner enough for 2 - 3 people and comes with steak, chicken, ribs, sausage, arepa (corn bread), plantains, and potatoes. Than we usually end our dinner with the to-die-for flan. Best of all we always have food left over to take home and eat the next day. Oh and I can't forget to mention that its BYOB. BEWARE: This place gets packed and noisey on the weekends so make sure to arrive early.
