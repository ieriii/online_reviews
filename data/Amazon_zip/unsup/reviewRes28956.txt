After an awful experience with another Thai restaurant in our hood we ventured to Lincoln Square. We had to attend a Christmas party nearby and wanted something to eat beforehand. I saw Opart once we got off the L and we went in. This place was jumping on a Friday night! This is a BYOB establishment and there is a liquor store next door if you forget your swill. Started off with the pot stickers. Those babies were HUGE and filled with pork and ginger, so good! My guy had curry fried rice with chicken. It was good but I'm not a big fan of curry. I had the chicken pad see eiw. It did have bok choy which I love. I am still in love with Aroy Thai's pad see eiw but Opart's is still tasty. The service was decent considering how busy they were. The interior is very nice. Love the exposed brick and the decor. I can't wait to go back and bring a six pack or a few bottles of vino. This place is a great Thai restaurant and the staff is sweet too!
