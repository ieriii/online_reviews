My experience at publican was amazing! from the awesome beer list to the fresh seafood I really have no complaints. Our server was amazing and attentive and we even got a complimentary dessert :) it was chocolate... they own my heart.. The booths with the little private gates were a cute touch.. I felt like I was alone in my own seafood filled private paradise.... We had beers (Duh) chef's selection of oysters Mussels and possibly the best scallops ever.... swoon!!! I can't wait to go back for the seafood tower ;)
