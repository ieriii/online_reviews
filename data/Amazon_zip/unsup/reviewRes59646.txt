La Pasadita is. The. Shit. If you enjoy steak in a tortilla, there is no other in Chicago like this. Steak and cliantro. What else do you need in a burrito? Sure you could spice it up with rice, beans, veggies, and other good items. But, if you really just want a steak burrito, these guys have it down. I live across the street and the grill smoke wafts into my window and smells delicious constantly. It's kinda funny that there are three locations. all right next to each other. One is a sit down Mexican food place with a mid sized menu of your normal menu. The other two serve beef in a couple forms and that is it.Enjoy.
