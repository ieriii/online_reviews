I almost hate to give Doug's such a good review, for fear that it will become too over crowded... but fear not - Doug, himself, keeps it running smooth and just an over all AWESOM place! My favorite is the spicy pork jerk... mmmm! Really, it's all good!   Go and enjoy my favorite dog place in the city! :)
