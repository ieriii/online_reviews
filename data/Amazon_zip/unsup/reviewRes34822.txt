Best falafel I've ever had. They put hummus and tabulli on their falafel sandwiches, instead of just lettuce and tomato like other falafel places. Their salad bar is wonderful- the grilled brussells sprouts are the best. They also have excellent lentil soup. And it's all very affordable! The only problem is not enough seating for the lunch crowd. The customers often sit around talking and don't get up when they see that someone else needs a seat. I find this very rude, but not really a problem with the place itself.
