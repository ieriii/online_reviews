Went there with a Living Social coupon. It smelled amazing just walking by on the street.Evironment: Nice and clean. It seemed like it wanted to be nicer, but wasn't quite there. Very good live music.Service: Generally good, it was not busy, and a lot of the staff helped.Price: Very Expensive for the quality and amount. Pro's: Extremely good ethnic food.Con: They left an envelope with the bill suggesting a $5 - $10 tip for the musicians, PER guest. Wha?!?Con: The server asked us a strange question when we asked for the bill. She asked, Would it be alright if I add Tip & Tax to the bill before I subtract the coupon? For some reason, we agreed immediately. I assumed that she just wanted to Authorize the total amount before subtracting the coupon, and allow us (the patron) to add gratuity. I'm sure servers get stiffed on tips because the total is less after a coupon. Anyway, she added 20% tip to the bill before even running the card. It was weird. We left it as is, but it left us with an uncomfortable feeling. A table near us made her take the tip off completely.It was a good dining experience, but I don't need to go back.
