Mia Francesca is absolutely my favorite Italian place in Chicago. I love the changing menu, and have never been disappointed by a meal. The pasta is perfectly cooked, the sauces are fresh, and the portions allow me enough for lunch the next day.  The main room is crowded and noisy, which gives it a nice neighborhood feel, but if you're interested in a more intimate and quiet dining experience, ask to sit upstairs or in the carriage house.
