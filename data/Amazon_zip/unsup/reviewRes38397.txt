Take note that all of the bad reviews complain that it takes 45 minutes to make deep dish and there can be a wait to be seated at times. So it's Giordano's fault that they do good business and make their pizzas the correct way? Riiiiiiiightttt... Great stuff. The calamari was also very good but that's almost an afterthought. Minus one star because the pizza was slightly undercooked this time, but I've never had that problem here before.
