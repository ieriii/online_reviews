Yes, I know, it's a chain, they're related to The Cheesecake Factory, and it's a big tourist trap. So what. They have a huge menu selection with lots of variety, and the food is good! The portions are huge so you'd better plan on taking some leftovers home, otherwise, you're going to look and feel like a pig. I wish this chain would come out to the Bay Area.
