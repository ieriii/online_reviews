After months of anticipation, we finally came to this restaurant, which smelt wonderful outside. We ordered melanzane - yummy eggplants! fritti del giorno - really good fried fennel diavola - salty salsiccia - very good biano nero - very good I really enjoyed their pizza due to fresh ingredients and the lightness of the dough. I will come back!
