The food was good but for the money you spend perhaps it isn't that good. I loved the Tuscan kale and the beet salad. The flavor of the country ribs was good but the meat was a little on the tough side. The chocolate budino was so-so. The porketta was maybe a little too fatty as well. The ham tasting was delicious though. Overall, the food is good but not great and you feel the amount of salt in the food. My feet swelled up big time. The beer selection was unmatched. I know they know their beer when they have Le Trappe Quadrupel. Service was a little on the pretentious side. I felt our waiter was second guessing us and he made it seem like we had to know what everything on the menu was. He was suggesting poached salmon and I can't stand poached fish. I hate that when they second guess you. Some of the other waiters seemed more down to earth. Ambiance was great but very masculine(?). Good for dudes. The communal tables are an interesting concept but might seem odd in a few years. Some of the patrons sitting next to us were a little too loud and I don't mind that too much but might have been a little less noticeable if we had a separate table.  I would give it a 3.5 star but since it got pretty pricey, I will give it three.
