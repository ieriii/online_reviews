I went here since it was highly recommended by my cousin and sister. It definitely lived up to the expectations. The scallop dish I had was delish. My boyfriend had a salmon dish which was also very good. Service was excellent. Because of how much we loved this restaurant, we are so excited. Francesca's on chestnut opened downtown. We plan on definitely trying it soon.
