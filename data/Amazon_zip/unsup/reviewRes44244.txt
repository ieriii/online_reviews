Great coffee. Awesomely tasty and moist cupcakes. And the Pumpkin macarons. They were melt in your mouth delicous, so delicous that I wanted to try more flavors. That's where Alliance loses a star. Stale macarons are probably the worst things you could possibly eat. When they're good, they're amazing. But when they're bad, they're basically inedible. And it's luck of the draw unfortunately. Buuuut I will be back.
