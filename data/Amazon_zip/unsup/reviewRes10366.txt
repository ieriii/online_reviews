I like most people have had pizza more than any other meal in my life. Having said that I like to say I know a thing or two about a thing or two when it comes to a good pie. I love thin crust, Chicago style and even a good New York slice hits the spot. So basically I love pizza and know great pizza pretty well. Piece has great pizza, go there. Order any pizza on the menu it all awesome. Also please note the beer is really great they brew a ton in house.
