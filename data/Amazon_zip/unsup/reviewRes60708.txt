The Appetizers were awesome. Flat Bread and an unusual Mushroom dish. The main course that I tried was a vegetarian dish - Ravioli stuffed with some kind of sweet (Pumpkin?) paste. Was wholesome and tasty, may be a bit too sweet for my taste.Overall I felt very good about eating here.. will definitely go back and will bring out of towners whenever!!Wish they had more vegetarian options!
