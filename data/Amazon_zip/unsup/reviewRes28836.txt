I was craving Italian food, but my bf and I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. Why are all the Italian places so expensive?? And I was NOT about the go to a diner for pasta. Luckily I remembered this place exsisted...and that I had never been. YAY! We showed up and the place was hoppin. We sat at the bar, which was really fun to see the cooks doing there thing. I got some sort of caprese angle hair dish and added meatballs (still less than $10) and the man got chicken fettechini Alfredo (around 7 bucks). His was better, but mine was still great. The only thing that's not so good is the bread that comes with, but you can order garlic bread, or garlic cheese bread...which I'm gonna get next time! Bottom line, cheap good Italian food at a really cute restaurant!
