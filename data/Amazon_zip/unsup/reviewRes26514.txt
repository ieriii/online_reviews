My sweetheart brought me to Mercat a la Planxa for Valentine's Day over the weekend and it was a memorable evening. In the beautiful Blackstone Hotel, the restaurant glows with romantic dim light with warm tones throughout. The atmosphere was internationally swanky. A lot of times, tapas places try too hard to achieve that Spanish feel and this was no exception - still, though - swank. We were a little put off by where we were seated (table for 4 right by the bar), but it was a busy night so we forgave them. The Coles De Bruselas (brussels sprouts) - divine. Super tasty. The bacon wrapped dates were to die for. It was an explosion of flavor. The "Mixto" selection of 3 cured meats was served with tiny peppers and grain mustard. A little different for tapas, but very good. We ordered the goat cheese with the pear coriander jam and we weren't too sure about the cheese. Our server noticed right away and was not only willing to offer us a different cheese at no charge, but he comp'd us the dish and brought us a surprise plate of delicious grilled octopus. It was so wonderful to have someone so astute and courteous serve us on such a romantic and wonderful evening. It really made our night. To end our meal, we had the Chocolate Croquettes - omg. Yum. It's like a warm melty cocopuff surrounded in a gooey marshmallow cream. Unreal. I will not hesitate to come here again. We lucked out. Great experience, great service and delicious food. Bravo to Mercat a la Planxa. Thanks.
