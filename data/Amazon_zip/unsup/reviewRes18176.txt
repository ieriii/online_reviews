I think that "Meh. I've experienced better" is a great way to describe The Bad Apple. I get it- it's cool and lots of great beer and boasts amazing burgers. But "Meh" is how I felt when I left. My bf and I went as it was on our list of places to try in the city. We were, ok, I was, super excited! I had heard mixed reviews but had friends who raved so I was definitely psyched. Yes, the beer list is impressive; we studied it for about 10 minutes before deciding. Both my bf and I were pleased with our beer choices. Then it was on to apps. We ordered the cheese curds- they were ok. A little on the bland side but the dipping sauce was really good. My bf ordered the Slow Burn burger which was pretty awesome, I gave it a taste. I ordered the slider special- one "Elvis' Last Meal" (burger with bacon and peanut butter....weird but pretty tasty), one Porchetta (something like pork belly- nice flavors) and one Wagyu slider. I saved this for last because I thought it was going to be the best! Meh. Ok, I get it...it's super quality meat and it's not supposed to be "ruined" by being overcooked. But what about cooked at all?! I understand fine dining, etc. but there was definitely an unedible, raw appearance to this burger that is just not my style. Furthermore, when the waitress came over, we had figured that it was done "medium rare" because of the quality of the meat but wanted to make sure- the waitress said yes and she explained that a lot of people ask for it more well done but they advise against it. That's all well and good but I would have rather that be explained to me at the beginning of the ordering process so that I didn't get the raw end of the deal (pun intended) and miss out on a slider! So I might be back....to sample some more beers and to take a crack at another burger, this time (gasp!) medium well!
