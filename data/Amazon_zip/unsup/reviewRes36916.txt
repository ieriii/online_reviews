I'm always looking for new brunch places and found Meli Cafe while trying to find a place to eat near the United Center for a Blackhawks game. We didn't have time to go before the game, but decided to drive out there one Sunday. We arrived around 9:30am for breakfast and were seated right away. However, we noticed the line building as we were eating out meal. It's a cute place and we had a seat right near the windows. As for the food, the menu is HUGE. My friend ordered the apple waffle, which he thought was overly spiced - too much nutmeg or allspice??? I had the blackberry banana french toast special. The french toast was very good. They use brioche and it was nice and airy. But I thought they would do something more with the berries and bananas. It was actually just plain sliced bananas and berries thrown on top. The place is ok and I'd come back, but ONLY if I'm in the neighborhood.
