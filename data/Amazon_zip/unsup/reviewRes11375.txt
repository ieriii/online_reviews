The first time I went to Bongo Room I was going to give it a rating of 4 stars. I showed up at 11am on a Sunday and deserved what happened. I waited forever only to sit at the bar and have people bump into me. That said, the food was a five star meal and the experience was 3.  However, I have since wised up and I arrive earlier than 10. While I cannot have an adult beverage at that hour on a Sunday, I still enjoy the food immensely. My only complaint is that the phenomenal sauce on the pancakes can be a little overwhelming.  Here is what I would order: Feeling savory? Get the Red Pepper, Feta, and spinach eggs benedict. Legitimately the best benedict I have ever had. Feeling a little sweet? Snag the sweet potato breakfast burrito. Stuffed with sweet potatoes, black beans, and eggs, this is a meal that you cannot go wrong with. Feeling really sweet? Check out the zucchini pancakes. I personally did not enjoy the pretzel pancakes like I did the zucchini ones. It's a little bit like desert for breakfast but what is wrong with that? To summarize, go early and go often. The food is great.
