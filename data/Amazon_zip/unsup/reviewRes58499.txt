My brother recently came to Chicago from Houston for a quick visit. We were both craving Vietnamese food on a Sunday night. I've been here once or twice before with a couple friends and remembered it being delicious, so I wanted to introduce him to this place as well!When we got here, the owner was very hospitable and offered to seat us himself by the windows. The atmosphere is calm and warm, which helped us since it was pretty cold on Sunday night!Our waitress was really helpful in selecting dishes that would satisfy our cravings at the time. We ended up ordering the summer rolls and avocado wontons for appetizers. The summer rolls, albeit their name, were perfect. Very crisp and refreshing with the perfect accompanying sauce. The avocado wontons were a bit heavier, but were definitely a guilty pleasure due to the cream cheese and the avocado fusion.For entrees, my brother got the beef short ribs while I got the sate shrimp. According to him, the beef short ribs were decadently marinated to satisfy the taste buds. Whatever that means (ugh, those literature majors!). The sate shrimp was just how I requested it--spicy! The portion was a bit big, especially after the appetizers, so I took it home for leftovers. Regardless, it still tasted delicious the next afternoon for lunch at work.My brother left with a good impression of this place. Hah, too bad he lives in Houston! I'll be back more often without him. ;)
