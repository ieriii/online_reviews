My boyfriend and I went here over the fourth of July weekend with our friends who were in town from California. We had so much fun! The chef's were hilarious and as over the top as ever, which I love. The food was absolutely outstanding. I'm not going to go into all the courses, but everything was different that what I have had in the past. The soup course, which was a pea soup was excellent. The pork was fatty melt in your mouth goodness. I also really enjoyed the chicken liver with beer foam, and the sushi with homemade root beer (sounds strange but sooo good). What was nice is they even paired some of the courses with wine they had. They gave us beer to pair with a course as well. This is my favorite restaurant and dining experience in Chicago. We also got a Friday night 8:30 seating, and I only called the day before, which was great!
