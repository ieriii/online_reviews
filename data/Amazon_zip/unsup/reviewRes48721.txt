What a shame,,, such well prepared food was overshadowed by mediocre service & an unbearable noise level.I recommend asking for a table outside, weather permitting. It won't necessarily improve the service, but at least you'll be able to hear your voice & that of your table guests without straining your hearing or your vocal cords... something we weren't able to experience.
