Oh Brazzaz I wanted to like you so much more. Maybe because we have been to Fogo De Chao my expectations were too high? I just don't know. Our server sat us down and asked if we have been there before. Aaron stated no but we have been to a Churrascaria before and she remarked, rather sarcastically "Oh so you have been to our competition?" Um nice impression lady. Then Aaron mentioned we choose them this time because they have shrimp. Oh no that's only on the dinner menu. Ok then...indicate that somewhere on your online menu or actually pick up your phones, so that kind of awkwardness can be avoided? So first up the salad bar. The cerviche was darn tasty. The rissto and tortelini in alfredo sauce was excellent too. Other than that? It was pretty forgettable. I almost actually gave them an extra star for the risotto but no, i thought better of that because I do not think of risotto when I think of Churrascarias... The main offerings? Fillet with bacon, excellent. The top and bottom sirloins? Also excellent. The top was really salty in that good way. Leg of lamb, also flavorful. The house specialty? Not so much. Very bland to me. The chicken legs? Also bland. Also the variety of offerings was lacking. Thirteen meats? I don't think so. Where is the red meat? There was more pork than anything else. The pineapple going around was a nice touch but he came around way too many times. I was also not a fan of their sides, like so much that I am even wondering why I am wasting the word space to say so. Too the service left something to be desired. The server came and asked how everything was just once. Not once were we asked if we were waiting for anything specific. Also they move very slooooowwwllly with their meat swords. It all just felt very half-assed. Ah well.
