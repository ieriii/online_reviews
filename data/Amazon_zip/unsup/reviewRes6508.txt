Well I certainly will not be able to add anything that hasnt been said. Couple of recommendations... Bread w/ ricotta and honey, polenta w/ pork, and pasta with sea urchin and crab.  I also recommend that you do NOT order everything at one time. We ordered 5 or so plates and they all started to come within a few minutes of each other.  Also take a look at the drink list. I was drinking peroni, then I saw them serve a Leffe at the end of my dinner. Damn.  I spent 90 bucks for two people with drinks and we left uncomfortably stuffed, well worth it.
