Damn...this restaurant is that hot FIRE! And by that I mean, it's really, reallllly good! My friend had her birthday dinner here in a private room off of the main dining area that they call the "Star Gaze Room" or something. She had just called the morning of, and they were able to set up this nice room for her, and print up menus with the food of her choosing. For an appetizer, the spinach and artichoke dip was TO DIE for! The margherita pizza was good too, very fresh. The caesar salad was great, and I didn't try the chopped salad but everyone else said it was very good. The main courses....WOW. We had the lemon herb chicken and the beef tenderloin tips. Both were amazing! Very tender and seasoned perfectly. The twice baked potatoes were perfection. I didn't even think that I could eat dessert after all that, but I had to try the birthday "cake" which was like a brownie w/ ice cream thing. It was very rich, and I could only take 2 bites, but it was worth it. Even better than that was the cinnamon apple dessert....OHHHH. My. God. Orgasm in the mouth. It was appley, cinnamony perfection. With ice cream. I forgot to mention the drinks, which are an essential part of any dining experience. I had to order a pomegranite martini, because they are my favorite. I was not at all disappointed. It was not too strong, but not too sweet either. And I felt kinda tipsy after only two! Wildfire hit it on the head. I can't wait to go back here! It is a bit pricey for me, but worth every penny.
