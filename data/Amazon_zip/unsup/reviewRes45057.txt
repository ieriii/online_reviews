There $29 3-course just can't be beat. It's a bit noisy - not the spot for a romantic date - but the service is fantastic and the food (at least what we sampled) is delicious. Our party of four tried: Appetizers: pork terrine, calamari, octopus, mushrooms in parchment. All super tasty with my dabs being the pork and the spicy calamari. Pasta: spaghetti with tuna, ravioli, and pasta with pesto. Fav was the ravioli (hovering between sweet/savory). Pesto wasn't cooked and was taken off our bill. Entree: quail, pork ham, and whitefish. Fab was pork ham...whatever that is. Dessert: chocolate tart, rhubarb crumble, walnut cake. Walnut was the best. Memorable meal and worth a return visit. l
