Ever since terragusto closed, I've been in search for an italian restaurant that makes their own pasta. We finally decided to try this place and it blew my socks off!  They have daily specials which all sounded very good. There were so many dishes I wanted to try, but I opted for the pappardelle con porcini. It was absolutely amazing, the pasta was al dente with the sauce that melts in your mouth goodness. My husby had the vitello vesuvio and he was pleased with his dish as well.  The interior of the restaurant was very romantic, great place to bring a date. And it's BYOB with no corkage fee. Buon appetito!
