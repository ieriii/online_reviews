This is one of my favorite restaurants. I pretty much love everything about this place. The meat just melts in your mouth and the sides are delicious especially the little bread. Not a big fan of the sausage or chicken but other cuts are sooooo worth it. If you want to try it without paying top dollar, go during lunch.
