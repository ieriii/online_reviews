I almost gave this place two stars, but didn't because it was super cute and I heard the guy behind me say "I've been to this place too many times to know that this is a fluke" when he sent his fish back. I had sent my venison back five minutes before him because it tasted funny. The chef must still have been on xmas vacation because the food was NOT good. Squid was so salty it was practically inedible. i'm serious. it made my gums burn. so were the beans with the salmon.  I would return to give it a second chance if someone insisted.
