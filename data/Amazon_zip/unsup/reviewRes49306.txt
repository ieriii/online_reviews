This review pertains to group events - I'm not from the area and had to remotely plan a group dinner as part of my best friend's bachelorette party. I must say, I am so glad that I found Bin 36. We booked a room above the main dining room where we had a fixed price meal and a bar package. The service was great, the communication between the staff and I was impeccable, and the food was good (I say good because I drank enough to numb my palate and was much more concerned with gabbing with my girlfriends!) Needless to say, I 100% recommend Bin 36 for private events.
