Ok for this is my boyfriends favorite place in chicago so far!!! The selection of beer is phenomenal. His favorite beer so far is a Duvel and Quack. He also has to gets "The Mussels with white wine sauce for One" He has tried the mussels with beer but prefers the ones with the white wine sauce.They ask for your ID at the entrance, so no kids allowed which we love because you can enjoy your dinner without a winning child in the background. The outside patio in the back is also very nice. The bar in the front can get quite noisy and the bartenders aren't the friendliest people. We usually go to the bar upstairs while we wait, which is cash only. It's very small, just a tiny corner but the guys upstairs is nicer than the people downstairs, the waitstaff is very nice people always friendly and willing to help. I'm sure we will be back soon. He keeps us going back. We would recommend it.
