Finally was able to make it to Frontera. The first time it was just too long of a wait for lunch, the second it was Monday and they were closed. So this time decided to go around 12:30... there were seats open at the bar but the restaurant was full. Ended up ordering the fish tacos $15 and chips / salsa $2.75. It seemed like it took awhile for the meal to come out, when it came out I was kinda disappointed at the amount. I was able to get about three tacos out of the fish. Sure the fish was great, tasted good and felt nice and light. But for $15 I kinda thought there would be more. I personally like the tacos at De Cero and I think they are a better deal. Over rated and hyped is the best way to describe Frontera. I could see myself just getting the chips and salsa from the store and eating those. I don't think I'll be going back for the tacos anytime soon.
