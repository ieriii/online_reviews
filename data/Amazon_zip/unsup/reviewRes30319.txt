Great scene, great food and great service (as long as you have a reservation). The food component of the bill is always very reasonable considering the quality. On my last visit, they started us off with amuse-bouche of a small serving of an excellent hot wasabi based soup. (spicy!). Bang bang salad was great. The wagyu lobster roll was great. Braised short rib was great. Chilean sea bass was great. What is there not to like? I look forward to my next visit.
