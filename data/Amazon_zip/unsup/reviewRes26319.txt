The green pepper & onion deep dish from Peaquod's is my favorite deep dish pizza ever. And I hate veggie pizzas. Anywhere else I'd be eating plain cheese, or loading it up with meets. But for some reason, the carmelized crust compliments green peppers and onions perfectly. Also, their logo is a whale with a panty on its head.
