Best drink lounge ever!!! The owner is a genius! I don't want to say too much about it so you can have the "alice in wonderland" experience when you first walk in, just go there and you'll see what I'm talking about! :] What I DO want to say is that every drink is custom made from scratch [and by scratch I mean even the mixers are hand made on the spot!] At first I was afraid of some of the drinks but if you're anything like me and don't want the bitter taste of booze, fear no more, these drinks will drop your jaw real fast! Oh and did I mention all mixed drinks and cocktails are just $12? And if that wasn't awesome enough, they didn't forget that you might get hungry, so go ahead, try an item from their "sustenance" menu, you won't be disappointed.  Dates here are highly recommended, it will definitely seal the deal, but just a heads up, this place likes to keep it classy so please use your better judgement! :] Just a heads as well, when it's busy service takes a little longer, it's not necessarily a bad thing but if you're bringing someone here make sure you can hold a conversation. ;] PS Im officially on a mission to awe as many people with this place as possible! Will you help me?
