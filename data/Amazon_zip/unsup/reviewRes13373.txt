This is the second time I have dined at Revolution for lunch. The beer and the food were great both times. The first time I had the Anti-hero IPA and the Anti-hero chicken sandwich. The beer was delicious, the sandwich was really messy but also delicious. Today I had the Weegene beer and the Farm burger. The Farm burger has to be the most interesting gourmet burger I've ever ordered. It's a strange combination of flavors (roasted beets, horseradish, greens, topped with a fried egg) but it really works. The hand-cut fries are good but get soggy pretty quickly. Great beer, great food, great service. I will definitely be back.
