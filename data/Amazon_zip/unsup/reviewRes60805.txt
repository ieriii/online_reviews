I have been to most of all the top rated burger spots around Chicago and after reading a few recent reviews I finally made it to Lockdown. I really wish I had visited this place earlier and wasted less time in line at Kuma's. The service was fantastic and the burgers were outstanding and my GF loved her salad and devoured my side of Mac & Cheese.  I had the The Federales and was hands down the best burger of my life and can't wait to try more.Beer list was as good or better than most bars and we enjoyed watching the Hawks game while listening to some metal. Patio is opening soon and we will be back
