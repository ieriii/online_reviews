Good cocktails in Chicago. Also should I mention that this was the only place in Chicago to make the "Speakeasy Cocktails: Learn from the Modern Mixologists" iPad app, for their world map of selected cocktail establishments? One small thing that I noticed that I was less appreciative of was that much of the clientele appeared to be more of the Carrie Bradshaw wanna-be set, as opposed to actually coming for the quality drinks. I could be wrong, but based upon the line outside, this appeared to be the case.
