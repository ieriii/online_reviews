We had an amazing time at Shaw's on Friday night. We were celebrating our recent engagement and mentioned this when we made reservations. The hostess, matrade , and server all came to congratulate us upon arrival.. its the little things! :) Our server, Chris was an amazing professional, kind and knowledgeable at every turn. He was very attentive but we never felt rushed or pressured. He recommended some drinks and food that were all amazing. Alaskan GOLDEN King just got go delivered to the spot.. then to our plates, it was delectable! The busboy guy was also really good, always filling our waters and even our drawn butter! We also got the sashimi tuna and guac, which i recommend, some of the best tuna Ive had in the city. This place is not cheap but you pay for what you get and even on a budget, you can dine like a king. For instance, a cheap bottle of Pinot Grigio was 29$.. so you can still have a bottle and not break the bank. If your on a serious budget, they also have 3.50$ PBR's! Shaws gets 5 stars every time, keep up the good work!!!
