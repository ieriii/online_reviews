Stop #4 on my "Eating my way through Chicago/St. Louis and possibly doing other things on this trip Summer Tour 2011" found me finally at some deep dish pizza. Another recommendation from my friend. It is all about the crust at Pequod's. Yum freakin' yum. Another place you will wait in line for. The friend that I was staying with hadn't heard of Pequod's. I was hoping we were in for a treat. The beauty of Pequod's is that they will take your pizza order while you wait to be seated. Deep dish usually takes a while to cook, so ordering it while you have yet to sit is a really nice thing for them to do. Once seated, we started out with the Appetizer Combo which was a bunch of fried things like mozzarella sticks, zucchini, poppers and mushrooms. It was ok. Fried is fried. You can't really do a terrible job at frying things. I was ready for the pizza. We had the pan pizza with onions and pepperoni. The pizza is baked in cast iron pans blackened by decades of seasoning and the overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust. If that doesn't sound good to you, what does? This is not a pizza for the faint of heart. Deep dish is heavy and we didn't see anyone leaving the restaurant without a to go bag. We ended up taking a good portion home and I had a slice 2 days later. Still tasted really good. There are a ton of pizza shops in Chicago. Everyone has a favorite. If I lived here I can see Pequod's being a favorite for years and years.
