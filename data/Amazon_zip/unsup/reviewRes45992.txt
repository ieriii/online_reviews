I'm not sure why I keep going. It always underwhelms me.  The portions are huge (split one if you're not that hungry) but the flavor is hit or miss. For entrees, try the Jamaican pork or pasta fresca. Skip the Indochine chicken and shrimp - flavors were a flat version of a Thai curry without the subtle spice. Like it's inspiration, the Cheesecake Factory, the desserts here are the highlight nd don't disappoint.
