Of course I wanted to try deep dish pizza. I was afterall in Chicago. But my best friend told my friends and I that this place was well known. The wait on Friday at 8:30P for a table for 4 was 45minutes long. The restaurant was packed. The bar was also full. We decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood and wait for our table. We chose a large pizza to share. 1/2 red, 1/2 white. The red side had sausage, red onions, and mushrooms. The white side had chicken and artichokes. The pizza was served in a large baking sheet. The thin cornmeal crust was baked to absolute perfection. The 1/2 with the sausage stole our hearts. I didn't even care if I didn't get to try Chicago's deep dish pizzas after this experience. I can't forget to mention their beers. Many of them have won several awards. Mmmm. The Top Heavy Hefe was cool and crisp. One of the better Hefes I've tried. I had to try the Dysfunctionale afterwards. It was sooo refreshing and tasty. I would have had another, but I was too full from the meal. In my opinion, totally worth the wait.
