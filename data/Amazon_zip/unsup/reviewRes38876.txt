this place is awesome! how can you complain about it being crowded? it's crowded because everyone loves it. i make sure to either go at times when it's not very busy, so i don't have to wait a long time to eat. or, i go and just enjoy some of the great beer selection while i'm waiting. either way, not bad. i love the beer selection here. a lot of it is very affordable, and there are just so many great beers to try. the food is also excellent. i love the belgian and french style mussels. i'm not a big fan of the thai mussels. the cb&j is ridiculously yummy. it is the drunk food i didn't know i wanted. and the fries are great to snack on as you drink more beer. yes, the place is crazy crowded and loud, but i like that. i think it adds to the atmosphere. i like that there are a lot of other people there just like me, who go because they love it and it's worth it. you're around a lot of other people who really enjoy beer, the food, and are generally having a good time. this is a great place to go hang out with a group in the winter. and, the outdoor patio wasn't bad in the summer. but, i really love the atmosphere inside. i've always found the staff to be really friendly and helpful.
