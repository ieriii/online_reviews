Went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised to find abundant parking, zero wait, and delicious food. Yes, there doesn't really seem to be anything else around the neighborhood (hence both the parking and wait time situation described above), but it was amazingly relaxing to laze by the window with my truffle omelette and plentiful coffee and chat on an overcast day. I'll be back.
