Love it. Better at lunch than dinner, but only go if you are a carnivore. If you have people in your group that do not like red meat, pork, or lamb you are wasting your money and time. It gets packed during Restaurant Week, but their lunch is ok if you are on a budget. It is downtown, so you know how parking is. There are a few parking decks nearby. Good service every time I go to both location in/near Chicago. I go often with family and friends.
