BBQ Heaven! Do family style so that you can try a little bit of everything. Here's what you need to have: BBQ ribs - St. Louis Style, Kobe sliced brisket, and pulled chicken. Skip the corn bread and get the baked beans! We were even too full to eat dessert, and we were with the man who always gets desserts. They were also very gracious about giving us a tour of their smoker where the magic happens! One side note - if you make a reservation, it doesn't actually mean that your table is ready on time. What it means is that you move to the top of the wait list and will be seated at the next available table. We also had some issues with the host being able to tell us approximately how long we would have to wait - or anything at all. But we didn't let that get in the way!
