The Publican has become one of my favorite brunch places, especially when meeting friends. Seating arrangements here are pretty unique: you either sit at the communal tables, or sit at the booth with 'barn' doors. From the huge hog paintings on the wall, it is pretty obvious that their main specialty is pork. Some of the brunch items that I have really enjoyed include the boudin noir and the smoked pork chop. Make sure to ask for Sriracha hot sauce on the side! The pork rinds and thick cut bacon are also great sides to have. In terms of dinner, I have only tried their Sunday prix fixe dinner. Though it says $45 per person, a group of us ordered just 2 sets, and got some additional items off the menu. Overall, the food was good (though they had to change out one of the items at the last minute because 'they ran out of ingredients'), but I felt it was a bit overpriced. I will probably stick to brunch.
