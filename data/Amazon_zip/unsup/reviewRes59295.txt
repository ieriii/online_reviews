I went here the other night because our originally planned destination Broadway Cellars was closed for a private event. Ridiculous trendy decor aside the food here was pretty "meh". I had the red curry (which I admit is a boring choice) which was like soupy water. Neither of my two friends were very impressed either.But the service was the real reason I am writing this review. I have never been so rushed at a restaurant in my life. We were asked constantly if we were done, even when it was clear we all had just begun to eat our food! Maybe next time it will be take out.
