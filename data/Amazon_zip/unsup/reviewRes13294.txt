When I think of the word "diner" and "American food" I have memories of Silverman's (Plymouth, MI) and Denny's. And when I think of a meal there, I imagine it being around $8 all in. This is not that kind of diner. Glenn's is more like a seafood shack with seafood restaurant prices. And many boxes of cereal. And Hoosier Mama pies. And Pepperidge Farm crackers by the basket on the table. In other words, fancie. Color me slightly surprised. At the table were seafood bisque fettuccini, seafood pot pie (mine) and New Orleans-style BBQ shrimp all of which were rather amazing. I was a little disconcerted when my pot pie felt nuked, but I knew better. We did finish with a Mama pie each: baked fruit, apple, pecan (the best of the three). So, the bill came to $120 for three and no booze. Surprisingly expensive. That and the flatness of the fettucini made for a somewhat lackluster dinner experience on the whole, though the experience was very tasty. I'd do a 2.5 if I could, but this tips over to 3 just barely.
