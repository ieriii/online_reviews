I'm a fan of this place--the people who work there are really nice, and the food is pretty delicious. The fried chicken is quite good, and I really like the small Buddha Bowl with beef--lots of veggies, you can get brown rice, and the beef is well-seasoned (small was a LOT of food, too). Beware, though: a friend got the plain Buddha Bowl and didn't expect all the veggies to be cold (which they also were in the Buddha Bowl with beef, but the beef was hot, so I didn't really notice the cold veggies).
