WOW! Geja's has become my all-time favorite restaurant in Chicago! ButI think it's obvious that Chicago Restaurant Week must have unleashed the amateur diners. I've read Geja's reviews prior to restaurant week and noticed very few are negative. Then restaurant week comes around and so does the negativity. I have one thing to say about my fave place- IT'S BEEN IN BUSINESS SINCE 1965! Why? Because it sucks? I think not! Too bad TGI Fridays or Olive Garden didn't participate in restaurant week. Perhaps some of you would then have something positive to say about your dining experience.
