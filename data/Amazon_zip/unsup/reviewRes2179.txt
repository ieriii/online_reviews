I don't like bicyclists. Sure, people who randomly own bikes are fine. And I believe in environmentalism. I drive a car that gets over 30 mpg.  I refer specifically to the obnoxious, self-righteous, critical-mass, not-equipped-with-brakes, traffic-borking, "one less car" herding mouthbreathers. I've overheard the most ridiculous conversations between These People while standing in the (very long) line at Doug's. E.g.: "Like, I was riding my fixie through Roscoe Village the other night when a goddamn PEDESTRIAN HIT ME!!! How dare she! She acted like her arm was broken and demanded my drivers license, and I was, like, I don't haaavvee a drivers license." Listen, grease-Trixie: Pedestrians don't hit you. You hit pedestrians. In fact, if you added a tiny little LIGHT or maybe even some rudimentary BRAKES to your uber-chic stripped-down safety hazard you would probably have avoided this accident altogether. Anyway, if you're like me and don't like snotty bicyclists, avoid this place, especially in the summer. It's almost as bad as Handlebar. Other than that, the wild boar sausage is to die for.
