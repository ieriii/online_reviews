I like this better than Gino's and Lou Malnati's. The crust is thick, but not too dense or too dry. They slather it in sauce, cheese, and whatever toppings you order. We get mushrooms and sausage, and there is no slice that is lacking large chunks of sausage. I am giving it 4 stars because the wait for a table is loooooong, then you have to wait 45min for the pizza to cook. If they had more seating I would definitely give it 5 stars. Don't bother with the thin crust pizza, that's not why you eat pizza in Chicago...
