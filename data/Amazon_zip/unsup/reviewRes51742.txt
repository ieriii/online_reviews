My first experience was 2 stars and I'll give it one more for my recent visit. Yesterday my husband and I walked and placed a take out order. Service was quick and we waited less then 10 mins for our order. My husband choose his favorite steak burrito. I do admit that although I didn't like it on my first visit my husband really seemed to enjoy it. The burrito is very big and the price is just right. I had the mole chicken enchilada dinner. I've been craving mole for a while and I usually never order mole at restaurants. I liked it, it wasn't too greasy like other places. The portion was good and so was the price.
