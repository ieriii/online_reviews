sun wah is one of those places to which i want to bring everyone who visits me. every time i've gone we've pre-ordered peking duck and have never been disappointed. seriously -- nothing beats the peking duck at sun wah bbq. one duck is plenty of food for 5 people, as it comes with soup, noodles or rice, and buns. we tend to order a veggie dish as well--the broccoli is awesome. in fact, when my parents and future in laws were in at thanksgiving, we ate at sun wah instead of slaving in our own kitchen over a traditional spread. our relatives, visiting from vegas and south louisiana, were thoroughly impressed. we had 10 people, 2 ducks, and 1 small roast pig... and TONS of leftovers. the leftover pig/pig bones eventually made 3 pots of soup. one complaint: cold pork from our roast pig. no one expected it, and while it still tasted delicious, the coldness was seriously meh. also, the owning family is super friendly, sweet, and welcoming. tip: make reservations!
