Okay Shaw's is notoriously delicious but super pricey in the dining room. You get the same top notch quality food if you sit in the less expensive Oyster Bar which I recommend because its a more relaxed fun atmosphere and gives you an inside look at the kitchen and the food as its being prepared. The waiters are incredibly professional and the service is great. Also, this place has the BEST sushi in town. Its purely crazy fantastic one-of-a-kind rolls. I am in love with Shaw's because everything always tastes good (try their lobster bisque!!!) and their seafood is always the freshest! 5 stars, what what! Update: I recently went here with my family for Sunday brunch and it was UN-BE-LIEV-ABLE! I'm big on buffets so I have a lot of experience with this kind of thing and let me just tell you that Shaw's is top notch. They have a make-your-own Mimosa and Bloody Mary section which is totally awesome, especially if you're hungover. The buffet is extensive in both selection and flavors. If you dont get the bacon you are insane. Another fan favorite is the brie and lobster pasta. I dont even know of any adjectives to accurately describe how f-ing great this is. There are no words. It's like heaven exploded in your mouth. Be sure to eat til you sweat. You won't regret it!
