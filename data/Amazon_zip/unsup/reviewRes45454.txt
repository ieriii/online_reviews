I went to Wilde with some friends for a random weeknight dinner. The atmosphere was, as someone stated, slightly Bennigans-y, though without as much neon lighting. However, I appreciated the darkly lit space as we all crowded into a booth for a cozy dinner.  I had the pork chop which was a bit dry, but definitely not bad. A friend of mine had the chicken curry which, had he not been hungry, would have been finished by the rest of us at the table.  Overall a nicer place to get some good grub with attentive and friendly staff. I'd definitely go back again, as long as I had the money to spend.
