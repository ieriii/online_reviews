I used to love this place, however, I went there on Thursday and it left a lot to be desired. To drink I had the Divine Lychee martini and my husband had a glass of merlot. The amuse bouche was something with crab and noodles and was actually pretty good. I had the Thai fried chicken which was ok, but came with some random throw away type garnishments. My husband had the BBQ pork which was completely terrible, eeks! Over half of it was fat and it was really shocking that they would serve it at this type of restaurant. My husband and I haven't been here for awhile and we forgot that the entrees didn't come with sides so we had proteins and that was it except for a small amount of white rice. The food and the service at this restaurant have both really gone downhill. For dessert we had the ridiculous, which was fried ice cream and carrot cake. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either, for what this restaurant portrays itself to be I would have expected a lot more. This used to be in my top 3 favorite restaurants, but that is definitely no longer the case. This place used to be soooo much better!
