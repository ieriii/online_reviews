THIS PLACE IS BYOB. A fascinating addition to any restaurant for any Californian. Their Vegetarian plate came fully loaded with all the right things for only 6-something bucks! I'm slightly impartial to falafel balls just because they're so filling, BUT luckily my friends are impalers of falafel and helped with that. The tzatziki is free! And the hot sauce they have is a MUST TRY!
