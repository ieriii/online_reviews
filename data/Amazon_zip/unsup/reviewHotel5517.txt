My parents stayed here while they were visiting, and it was nice small hotel. It's in a great location near lots of restaurants and shops - a little more character than being in a hotel downtown. One negative is that you have to pay extra to part in the parking garage next door (it's not affiliated with Best Western but you get a discount).
