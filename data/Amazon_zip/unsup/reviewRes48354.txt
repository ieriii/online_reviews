We stopped by here for pre-dinner drinks prior to going to Girl and the Goat (http://www.yelp.com/biz/). It's an awesome place with an awesome name, but the prices make you blink your eyes a couple times. They have a stout beer menu, pretty much going all over the world on a quest for beer. Think Beerfest, only without the chugging, name-calling, and Das Boot. Rushed by the waiter, I stumbled trying to order a "brouwerij moortgat" something. The waiter brings it back. It was a Duvel. Oh. That word somehow got lost in the fancy type and overwhelming attributes. There are beers on the menu that will set you back a Jackson; I went with a Lincoln. The food menu looks solid, although we only went with a cheese plate and some frites. There's availability within the restaurant to stand and snack, but most of the place is for seating. It's very reminiscient of an aperitivo in Italy. Waitstaff was solid, and our friends, who made it there before us, actually were given a complimentary drink that the bartender was trying out.
