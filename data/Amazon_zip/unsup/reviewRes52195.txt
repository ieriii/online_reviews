I LOVE to take my foreign (or even domestic) visitors here for Chicago deep-dish pizza. I find that it's worth the wait. It's great to go with 3-4 people so that you don't feel way too full after sharing a pizza. The fried ravioli is delicious too. My favorite is the sausage pizza. It looks gross if you remove the cheese to check out the sausage. But it tastes ridiculously good so I just don't look at it. If you only go once in awhile, Gino's is a REAL treat! Next time, I MUST remember to bring markers so we can write on the wall!!!
