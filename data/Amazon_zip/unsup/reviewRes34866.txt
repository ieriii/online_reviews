I hate to write this, but it has to be done. Over my three years living in Chicago i've probably eaten at Sultans thirty times. It was my go to 'god i'm broke but want falafel' spot since my first visit. In all those times, i always took my chow to-go. My one star and subsequent disgusted review comes from the most recent visit when i took two out of town friends and we ate in house. Just as we were finishing our meal (which was good), my friend across the booth noticed a bug crawling down the wood behind my back. OK one thinks, whatever, just a bug i'll just brush it off and finish my meal. As i get up to do away with the bug, i notice our booth is LITERALLY ALIVE with probably 10 to 20 small roaches, They were the small nymph roaches that scamper around on the ceilings and across the table because they haven't learned to be afraid of daylight like their grown up siblings. Disgusted and creeped out, we packed up to leave and I quietly and discreetly approached the manager, who was working the register. I said "just so you know, we just had about 20 roached sharing our lunch, you might want to do something about that." In response...a bitchy, condescending "okay". Mister, roaches just helped me eat my lunch and you're going to give me f****** sass. I'll never be back. And all you yelpers should heed my warning. If you can't give it up, just NEVER actually sit in the restaurant.
