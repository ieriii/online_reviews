I've been twice now. Love the food, it is so good. Service however sucks. I had heard bad things about our waiter, and when we ended up with him I tried very hard not to piss him off, which is not easy. He was rude, slow and seemed like he hated us from the first minute he laid eyes on us. Will not go back, even though the food is awesome. Lots of other great Italian places, with happy waiters.
