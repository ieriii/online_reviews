I really like the atmosphere in the place (it's gorgeous), but my grad student budget will not allow me to come back. The beers are really expensive and the food is on the higher end too. I didn't know this before coming here. That said, the macaroni and cheese was really excellent. I just don't want to pay $12 for mac'n'cheese again any time soon.
