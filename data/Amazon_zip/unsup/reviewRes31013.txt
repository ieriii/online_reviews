We went here on a Saturday night and it was pretty crowded. The place itself is rather cramped and loud, but there are a ton of places I can think of like that. The problem is that taking the rents to a place like this isn't always a good idea.  They have bottomless grean tea which is super refreshing and I probably took down a solid five of them. The avocado toastadas were also great but the portion size wasn't up to my massive hunger that night.  I think I would still prefer Blind Faith, but this is a nice change of pace.
