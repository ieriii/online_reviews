The first time I ever heard of the name "Rick Bayless" was in an article in Yoga Journal! Rick mentioned practicing yoga helps him be able to focus on creating new dishes. All I have to say is.... Rick Bayless-- never stop taking yoga! We came to Frontera Grill once for lunch and had no idea about the hype...just thought it was owned by this guy who likes to do yoga. Well, the food was just outstanding, and seemed very original. It has since turned into one of our favorite restaurants in Chicago. We actually saw Rick Bayless that day in the restaurant, so it's nice to know that he is still overseeing the restaurant!
