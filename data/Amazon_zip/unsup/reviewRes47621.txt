We went here for a work event on a Tuesday. It was one of the last great nights of summer/fall. We sat on the rooftop patio and had several different appetizers and drinks. I loved the muscles and fondue. The whit sangria was good, but a little sweet to have more than one glass. I switched to wine after one glass. I found the service to be great. Since most of us were from out of town, the hostess offered to take us on a tour of the restaurant. She was so sweet and let us try the "world's best cheese" off of the cheese table. It is a really neat concept and I can't wait to go back and try it for dinner.
