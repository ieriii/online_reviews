Came here after a movie in the area with two of my friends based on the good reviews i'd seen. All of our food was awesome! Good salsa, great margaritas (which were half off when we went on a Tuesday), and exquisite food. I was craving a quesadilla - which was different than i'd ever had - in a very good way! The salsa and guacamole were inside of the quesadilla - i'm a huge fan of that now! The waiter also reccomended the steak quesadilla - so i tried it - (i'm usually a chicken fan) but i'm happy I went for it because now i'll be craving it often. My two friends got carne asada and enchiladas with potatoes and chorizo, both spoke very highly of their meals as well. The service was a little slow at times - but overall we left stuffed and happy!
