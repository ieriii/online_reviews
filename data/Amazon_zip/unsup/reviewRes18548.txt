Dear Bad Apple, Your delicious Pat la Frieda beef and extensive beer list have drawn me back time and time again. I love that I have the choice of eating pork belly on a hamburger. Being from Wisconsin I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of cheese curds, and your beer-battered variety have taken a place on my cheese curd podium.  Your service is average and can be a bit slow, but I am generally enjoying time with friends when I visit you so I am not terribly turned off by that.  Some day I am going to come in and play Ms. Pacman or one of the several board games I grew up with as a child that adorn the shelves of your second room. When I discovered you had a shuffleboard table I could hardly contain my excitement. This excitement, however, was quickly dampened when my game was cut off due to a time limit.  I know there are other burger joints around that might have longer lines and more notoriety, but I like you just the way you are.  Best, B
