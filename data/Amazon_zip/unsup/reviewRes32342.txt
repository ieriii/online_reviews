I went with a group for a Birthday party on Saturday night. There was much eye candy within the restaurant. The staff was very welcoming! Uncle Paul especially made you feel like part of the family making excellent recommendations.  Drinks: the strawberry delight was a dessert in itself. the divine lychee also deserves a nod.  Miso soup with oxtail-surprisingly the oxtail was a perfect addition to the tofu oxtail potstickers- very tasty, the white wasabi cream brought it to another level. Rock Shrimp Tempura-i find it hard to mess up anything fried, it is good for all palates at the table Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad---too die for, a MUST order, a burst of flavor in your mouth Stuffed Avocado- filled with tuna, i probably would prefer just sashimi tuna but an average dish Longevity garlic noodles with blue crab style-somewhat dry, i'd skip this next time Adobo Braised Pork Belly----THE BEST DISH ON THE TABLE. the pork belly melted in my mouth, was the perfect amount of crisp on the outside.  Great over rice.  Crispy Cauliflower-the garlic, miso, and chilis made this a great dish even if you don't like cauliflower Green beans-crispy and flavorful Yellowtail jalapeno - very light and fresh I definitely recommend Sunda for both the people watching and pork belly alone.
