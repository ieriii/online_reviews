This is my favorite Pho restaurant in Chicago! And I LOOOOOVE Pho! Tank is always super busy on the weekends so try to come during the week. Oh and be ready to share a table and eat with strangers if you have a small party. What I love the most about Tank is it's no fuss and FAST. I always get the #39 bowl of Pho, a marinated pork sandwich, and either the fresh shrimp spring rolls or fried shrimp egg rolls. This place is consistent and the broth always tastes the same. (I hate when other Pho restaurants taste differently depending on what time you get there). Tank isn't the cleanest of all restaurants, and sometimes you'll even get a thumb in your soup, but we all joke that that's where the flavor comes from. =) Bring your own beer and wear something casual because you will smell afterwards, but enjoy!*Note - I think Tank is closed until January 6th (double check before you go!)
