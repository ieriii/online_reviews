I've lived in the Andersonville neighborhood 3 years and recently found this gem.  I don't know how I have missed it!  I only ordered take out pizza and wings but was suprised at how great it was.  Thin crust and & crispy pizza.  Delicious!  I'll definitely be coming back to try their full italian menu in the future.
