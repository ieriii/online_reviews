So cheap and yet so good! I personally am not a big fan of falafels, but I have to admit Sultan has excellent ones. And for around 3-4 bucks? you can't beat that. Somehow I am always lured by their food and order much more than I can eat, but oh well, I always manage to finish everything in the end. I usually go for a Lamb Shawerma. I love rice so I always get the meal and then make my own sandwich at the table with humus, bread, rice, vegie and the lamb! So yummy - thinking of it make me drool! The lentil soup is good as well, but I must say not very fulfilling. Come here, you won't regret it.
