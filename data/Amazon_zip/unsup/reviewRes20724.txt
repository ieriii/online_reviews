Wow.. definitely impressed ! We ended getting there at 8pm on a Wednesday night... line was relatively short.. say 20 minutes.. It gave us a chance to really decide what we wanted... p.s. the staff was pretty friendly... 1. agua de frescas - mango/orange delicious 2. chips and guac - fresh.. very tasty with sun-dried tomatoes 3. caldo - chicken pozole - decent - thought it had too much mexican oregano.. overpowered the whole soup (i forgot - we got a side salad - really refreshing) 4. wed. special - pork belly torta - amazing in every way!! sweet spicy glaze.. its perfect 5. ahodaga torta - med. spicy.. i really liked it.. thought the arbol de chili sauce was a bit too hot for me.. lost some of the flavor in all that heat. 6. churros and hot chocolate - fresh and tasty churros, almendrado and the barcelona... both equally good.. needed more sugar to suit my taste.. but just personal preference... I can't wait to go back !!! We will probably get all the same items... except try a different soup and a less spicy broth on the ahodaga torta..
