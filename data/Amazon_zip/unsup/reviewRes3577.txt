Yesterday I did a 'bi bim bop' bar day for the crew. I got several trays of veggies, white & brown sticky rice, and a tray of marinated chicken, marinated beef, and tofu. I have some of the pickiest eaters in the world on my set, and I got 2 of them to say 'I love Korean food'! Not an easy task, by any means.
