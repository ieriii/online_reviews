If you are in need of a sauna, then go here. These cheap bastards will make sure that they do not ruin your experience by turning on the a/c and will keep it at a balmy 90 at all times. Don't worry they have a line for you to wait in as well, despite the place being empty. If you wish to cool off with a beverage, please be prepared as the servers really will serve you about once every 2 hours if you stand at the bar. An added perk is that you will be able to walk in on people going to the bathroom as the doors on the single bathrooms definitely do not lock well making for a rather awkward experience.  The only advice I have is pretend you have already been in the place if there is a line and just walk in.
