Arrived around 7pm, restaurant was pretty empty, sat down quickly and our server was super extremely friendly. Service was great until the restaurant filled up and it seemed that our server had too many tables. The food was great and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, just don't go when it's busy. :( It took about 20 minutes to get the bill after we were done with dinner.
