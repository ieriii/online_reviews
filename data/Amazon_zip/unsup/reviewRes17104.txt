dear first-timer at the violet hour, some advice: 1)if it's a date, get a table, and prepare to feel an urge to make out. if it's not a date, or you do not want to make out with your date, sit at the bar.  2) do not complain about the price of the drinks. just don't.  they are worth it. 3) watch the barkeeps work...it is entertaining and you just might learn something! 4) order the green beans. trust me. and maybe the dessert trio with the curried rice krispies. 5) pay attention to your ice cube(s). you'll thank me. 6) you may call me a snob for loving this place, it doesn't bother me one bit. 7)take your time at this place. enjoy your drink---they put a lot of effort into these things, they aren't meant to be guzzled. i hope you enjoy yourself, leah a.  ps: i am absolutely of the opinion that a) the sazerac is the most delicious drink that has ever touched my lips and b) the violet hour is a gem.
