Careful with street parking! My friends and I went for dinner tonight and the side window of the car was punched in. Thieves made off with the GPS. Their valet parking is only $5, so I'd recommend that. Great, colorful decor and excellent service. Our entrees were a little slow to come out, so they brought us a complimentary guac. The pork shoulder is very good, also the beet salad. My friend loved the bread pudding. Overall, solid. Not the greatest, but it was nice. Also noticed some babies there, so it's good if you want to have a nice dinner but still feel comfortable bringing the little one.
