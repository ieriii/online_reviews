I think the cook's in the back get a kick out of seeing people crawl out of Crisp due to sheer gluttony. These guys serve up super portions. They also have some killer bi bim bops. I normally dont like them but these bowls are simply awesome. I got the baby-est little buddha they have there and was impressed with the flavor and the amount of content in it. I must say that their wings are huge. I don't know where in the world they find these chickens. I think I caught myself muttering 'for the love of god' as I got my food. They were crispy as the name would suggest and the sauce was not overwhelming as most tend to be. I feel obligated to mention this atomic sauce that looks much like spicy mayo with other drugs added in. Thats the ONLY explanation for the 'atomic' flavor orgy that happened in my mouth on December 18th, 2011. I desperately wanted to steal it but restrained myself from such a shameful deed - others needed to sample this heaven-in-a-bottle.
