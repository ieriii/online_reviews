I've been here at least 5 or 6 times now. Pizza here is incredible! Traditional Neapolitan style. The pizza is enough for one person (maybe two can share, but you better have an appetizer). The ingredients are always fresh. Fresh mozzarella di buffula, regular old mozzarella, veggies, etc... incredible. My favorite on the menu is the Diabola. That has fresh mozz, pepperoni and a little kick to it.  The best part about it though, are the daily specials. There are always 2 or 3 daily special pizzas that are unique and look delicious. We've tried the Burrata and that was also good. They have some appetizers, most of which I've had. They servings range in size. The meat and cheese platter is pretty good, as is the fried zucchini. I didn't care for their presentation of their mozzarella and prosciutto dish. It was a giant ball of fresh mozz with pieces of prosciutto hanging out. It was good, it just looked... odd. Wish there was more prosciutto as well. The restaurant itself is always clean. The staff is friendly and the owner/chef is always around. Last time I was there he was passing out cannolis as we left. Overall, I would give this place 5-stars with the exception that they are NOT BYOB. They have wine there that represents the south of Italy and their prices are OK, but I'm a BYOB person, so that "turned me off." Regardless, I'll be back again and again and again!
