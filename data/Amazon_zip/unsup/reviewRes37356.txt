This review is broken down into two sections. One on the food at the cafe and the other on the grocery shopping experience. First off the food in the Cafe - I thought the prices were a little high for a cafe or deli. Yes, I realize where I am the entire grocery store is based on higher priced items, so I knew what I was getting myself into. I had hoped to see some slightly more exotic menu options or some exciting combinations. It was a typical deli/cafe menu. Nothing out of the ordinary. I had the spinach salad which was good, but there again, nothing amazing. It took forever for our food to be delivered to the table and that I found slightly annoying. The experience was average nothing that I'd go out of my way for, but not something that I'd never try again. The Grocery experience - I was a bit disappointed with the selection of a few items. Starting with the cheeses. My father-in-law had requested three various cheeses, none of which the Fromagerie had. I was expecting him to give some other suggestions, but he didn't. We ended up with an aged Parmigiano Reggiano, which was very good, but something we had all experienced before. At $29 a pound and no other solid recommendations it's often a good idea to go with what you know. Too, I thought the fresh produce section lacked a lot. I guess I had just hoped for more. I will give them praise on the seafood selection. I would recommend coming here for one or two key ingredients, but not a place I'd complete my entire grocery list.
