I'm still not thrilled. Took mom here for lunch when we were downtown and ordered a few bites and some vino. The wine list is always amazing...so no complaints there. However, we ordered some cheese, and it came out cold. Like, really cold. We DID order some other items so I thought it would come out last while they let it temper, but no. It wasn't as great as it could have been. Service was lovely, once we got someones attention. I'll keep coming back for the wine list, though!
