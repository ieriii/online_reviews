Okay, so its not very often that you go to dinner with 6 other people and EVERYTHING is outstanding, but it did happen at Piccolo Sogno. We went to celebrate a birthday and were greeted by a very warm hostess staff. We were seated promptly in the dining room. Our waiter, Mark, was VERY good. Not only was he very informed about the food, he was a very sweet and warm. It felt like you knew him forever! The very friendly chef came by and said hello and sent us over a starter...some crispy flatbread pizza with arugula on top. It was yummmmmyyyyy!!! I ordered the risotto that was on the special and OMG, was it great. We all sampled each others plates and every single thing was delicious! We even made a reservation before we left for another birthday celebration, The only negative thing I could say about this place is that the decor is kinda boring. The food was so good tho, I am willing to overlook it. Its the best italian food I have had in Chicago. GO THERE!!!!!
