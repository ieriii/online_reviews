I love Bonsoiree! I signed up to receive their weekly emails some time ago, and while the menus always sound delicious, it took me a while to make a reservation! I am SO GLAD I finally had the chance to eat here!  This is a tiny little place--probably about 12 tables. Exposed brick, very cozy. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating.  On Sundays you can only do prix fixe dinners. On the website it says they only do 5 course ($40) and 7 course ($55). However, they are more than willing to customize the dinner to be as small as 3 courses, or as large as 10! Since it was my birthday dinner, we decided to go for the 7 course, which was incredibly delicious! The food is gourmet, and while there was nothing outlandish or wacky on the menu, everything was so thoughtfully prepared, and the flavors all complemented each other so beautifully. The ingredients were all very fresh, with very high-quality meat and seafood. A great dining experience.  James, our server, was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout our dinner. Shin Thompson, one of the chef/owners, stepped out for a moment to chat with us, and he was very nice and soft-spoken. He was also very cute, yay half-Asians! It's very evident that both Shin and his co-owner take great pains to give each customer the best experience possible. These guys are passionate about what they do, and their blood, sweat and tears go into everything they do here!  I will definitely be back at Bonsoiree very soon. For the quality food you get here, you really can't beat the price! Also a great place to bring the parents for an impressive meal that won't leave you eating ramen for the rest of the month!
