Duck is awesome. That's all that needs to be said. Our friends took us here for dinner since it's close to their house. I had read good things about it on Eater and had wanted to try. Glad we got to! Everything we had was delicious. BYOB? Yes. This made things even better. For the 8 of us there it was pretty reasonably priced (we were expecting a lot more expensive). We'll be back. My wife talks about it regularly.
