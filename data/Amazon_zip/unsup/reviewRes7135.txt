I always end up going back to Sapori. It's easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is delicious (love the fresh pasta), the atmosphere is perfectly cozy and the service is always above and beyond. I always study the menu as if I'm going to order something new, but the Lobster Ravioli keeps calling me back. I just love the sauce. I also highly recommend the grilled calamari appetizer. I've been here with friends, parents, and dates, and have found that it's really the perfect spot for any occassion. People are never disappointed. My only complaint is that the prices seem to have creeped up a bit over the years. But the food is still worth it. If you love a good deal (like I do), go on Monday night. You will be rewarded for your $20/person with one of the best dinner specials in all of Chicago. Delicious food and a lot of it - plus it's not limited...you can choose from anything on the menu. Dining Tip: Sign up for the mailing list...you should never go to Sapori without a coupon. They send a bunch of $13 coupons throughout the year. Plus, for your birthday they'll send you $15 off and free dessert. Parking Tip: If you go into the restaurant, they'll give you a pass to park in a lot down the street for free.
