Thought this place was really good. My favorites were the barely cooked/seasoned veggies at the salad bar, cheese puffs and of course...the meat. Thought the different cuts of beef were very tasty. Comparable to the good churrasco we had in Rio but more expensive... Didn't get any desserts here, since they weren't included in the all you can gorge, but mainly because we were full and they weren't very distinctive (molten choco cake, cheesecake, etc.)
