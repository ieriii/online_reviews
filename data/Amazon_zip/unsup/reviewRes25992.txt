I may be biased toward Gejas because I recently proposed to my fiance there during dinner. However, there is a reason why I chose Gejas to do that and it is because the food and service are both top notch. The restaurant is set below the street and is very quaint. We get the premier dinner when we go, which includes cheese fondue to start, then your choice of meat and vegetables, and it finishes with a chocolate fondue for dessert. It is a bit pricey, about $30 each for the premier meal. But it is a nice place to eat once in a while when you're looking to have a good time with friends or family.
