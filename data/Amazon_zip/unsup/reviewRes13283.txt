Went with 2 other friends on Saturday at 7 and loved the food and beer! For some reason I didn't think there would be a long wait on a Saturday night, so didn't make reservations- definitely would make reservations moving forward. First it was an hr wait, then 1hr 45min wait. We were lucky to grab a seat at the bar to get some food. If we weren't able to snag a seat, probably would have liked my experience a lot less. They let you sample beers, which is cool. Everything I tried was good, but I stuck with the IPA. I got a cocktail with the IPA and blood orange puree and that was great. We shared the arugula pizza, lettuce wraps and pretzel. The mustard with the pretzel was really good and the cheese sauce that went with it. Lettuce wraps were really flavorful- nice to have something light when you're drinking heavy beer. Pizza was good too- a lot of pizzas on the menu looked good. Id go back and try others. Overall, fun place, friendly service (but make sure to make a reservation!!) and good food.
