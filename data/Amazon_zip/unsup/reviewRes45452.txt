The indoor ambiance is very interesting. I love the room with the leather chairs and faux bookshelf. I'm thinking about bringing a pipe with me next time and a silk maroon robe. The mac and cheese is dangerous. Three bites and I'm full, but I somehow manage to eat the entire serving. Best Irish menu I've seen in Chicago and pretty decent beers on tap too.
