I would go back here. It's a cute restaurant with a combo of booths and tables, around an open kitchen where you can see them cooking your food. I didn't see the games but apparently there is an arcade of sorts. It's fun to sit in the window table. Looks like they had a good takeout business too. We had the goat cheese appetizer, which you can never go wrong with. I ordered spaghetti al frutti di mare which was very good- loaded up with shrimp and mini scallops. I was only able to eat half of it. Everything here is a great deal ($8-10 for entrees), and they have Blue Moon pitchers for $10 some nights. dEaLz. They played Katy Perry's Firework a lot which I enjoyed.
