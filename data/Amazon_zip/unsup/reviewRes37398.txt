This place is packed for a reason. Why is everyone always so quick to blame everything on "yuppies" ? Are they really invading your life that much? I'm not going to go on a tangent about this, as it is a review for the Hop Leaf, but I think everyone needs to chill. So, the beer selection is absolutely incredible. There is something for everyone and the staff is really knowledgeable. I always get the mussels because I have cravings for them on a regular basis. The ham and cheese sandwich is to die for and it's a sin not to get the fries with garlic mayo (which come with both dishes!) So I think everyone should just drop their pent up hatred for each other at the door and learn to mingle with an eclectic crowd who obviously all share the same interest: A really good time :)
