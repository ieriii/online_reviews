This place is great when you tired of the usual Mexican or same old neighborhood fare. Venture out a little bit and try this Cuban cafecito. The Ropa Vieja sandwiches are probably the most popular, and the appetizers are great. I love the tostones and the chorizo bruscetta. I love the special iced teas and they will provide you with Mojito and Sangria mixes, just add your own hard liquor. The place is BYOB, so pick up a bottle of gin, wine, beer, or whatever you like. In the winter, they wrap up one of their outdoor seating areas, so you will be comfortable in Chicago's frigid weather. Bring your friends and family, and enjoy some good comforting Cuban food.
