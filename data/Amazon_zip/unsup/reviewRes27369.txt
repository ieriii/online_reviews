I loved the food, but even so I found the place a bit too expensive. Maybe it's being used to CA, but guacamole shouldn't be $9.50. I mean, it was good, but not exceptional or anything. But other than the price, I only had minor quibbles with the food and really enjoyed our lunch (and that there was no wait compared to the 45 min wait at xoco). I found a lot of the food to be sweeter than I wanted. Some of this was probably the particular dishes that we chose, but it did seem to be a theme. For example, the coctel de atun tropical - tuna, avocado/tomatillo guacamole, "tangy" mango grapefruit salsa. Sounds like it could be tart and tasty, right? Well it was quite good, but... sweet. I loved the tamal de chile poblano, which made me only want to order things that use their wonderful masa in the future, although the squash blossom crema went a bit overboard. I couldn't resist the duck carnitas so I got enchiladas de pato. Again, far too sweet for me, but that one was pretty clearly sweet from the menu; otherwise I liked it (the chile toreados were a nice touch). I was surprised that I didn't like the mexican rice - it's very paprika/pimenton-y and not as tomato-y as I like, so I guess it's just a different style. My favorite dish was the tinga poblano cazuela. We were warned that it was an appetizer, but it came with a lot of tortillas and seemed to be an excellent lunch size to me! I also liked the spiciness in the items that were spicy. The habanero salsa was really hot but still flavorful, and you could appreciate the heat without feeling like your tongue is being assaulted. Service and drinks were excellent. We enjoyed sitting outside despite the location on a fairly busy street.
