I like this place a lot. I go here with my girlfriends on Saturday nights to have drinks and gab for hours. It's got a very cozy atmosphere (especially upstairs), and it's never so obnoxiously loud that you can barely hear the person next to you. I've never gone during the day, but at night it gets very crowded. The wait can be pretty long, and it's smart to call ahead of time (although, I'm not sure if they take reservations). The staff is nice, and the only time I had a problem with one server, I saw her crying later and felt bad for her. I'm thinking she had a really rough day which is why she was cold to us. Not an excuse, but I am a sympathetic person. The only reason I give is 3 stars (the 'it's decent' rating) is because the food is... eh, okay. It's not terrible, by any means, but it's also not fabulous. The food here will never make a name for itself. I do, though, recommend the briammi kefte. I hope I spelled that right. The desserts are very good, but nothing extraordinary than typical classy bakery cakes and pastries.
