If you've read my reviews, you'll know I'm far from a foodie. My visit to the Purple Pig was my first step on a road to becoming an aficionado of food and drink. I went during the lunch hour, and I highly recommend checking it out. Since I don't like to round up, I gave it 4 stars...but this is a 4.5 star establishment. What I liked most (aside from the food) was the price tag. For a spot that's tucked away on Michigan Ave, I came away very impressed with what I paid for 2 people (under $75, and we shared 4 plates worth of food.) This price includes beer by the way; and I didn't leave hungry at all. Now for the food - Everything that I had was small plate style. I tried the braised pork shoulder (legit), the jamon (legit - just a regular plate of ham), the pig's ear (fyi - this looked real interesting b/c it has capers, egg, and these small fried pieces of pig's ear mixed together...but give it a shot), and the turkey leg confit (I probably wouldn't get this again; it had this vinegar-based sauce that didn't agree with me.) Other pros - the waiter was very polite and attentive (which is helpful when 50% of the items on the menu don't make sense) and the ambiance of the outdoors area was money. Cons - This place is pretty small. If I say anything else here I'd be reaching...I'm a fan.
