People think this place is the bomb and I think those people need to get out more. The food is decent but not nearly as mind blowing as how some describe. I feel that Al-Khyam across the street is a lot better and slightly cheaper plus BYOB. They put something in their food that activates my food allergy that is associated when I eat walnuts. I do like their Shirin Polo and I can't get that at Al-Khyam.
