3rd Coast is a haven in the Gold Coast in that it is a refreshingly different place to dine in the neigborhood (not ridiculously overpriced or commercialized). It's a great place to get any meal and also makes for a cool nighttime hangout spot. They have some great microbrews and often have chill live music on the weekend. I also like grabbing brunch here, as even the oatmeal is good. If you are inclined to stay and study, or laze away the day reading a book, you'd be welcome to do so here.
