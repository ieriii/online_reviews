Worth the wait.... I live around the block from Meli Cafe, and as much as a miss the late nite/cheap eats diner, Zorba's, that used to be there, I'm more than happy with its replacement. Despite the long lines (heads up: Sunday's post church crowd flocks there, so GO EARLY!!!), I love this breakfast and lunch spot! The smoothies are super fresh and delicious (but $5 is a little pricey though, in my opinion). Food-wise, I usually go with one of their Eggs Benedict varieties for breakfast, they have about 8 on the menu~ VARIETY IS NOT LACKING! Side note- the french fries ARE TO DIE FOR.... they were super crisp and perfectly splashed with spices.... salt pepper i don't know exactly, but they were soooo good. I've seen reviews on bad service, I haven't had a bad experience there so I can't comment on that topic, but seeing how busy it gets I can see how one may misconstrue rudeness for being overstressed. And a lot of the wait staff has thick accents (foreign girls)-- maybe lost in translation issues?! They do abide by the "complete party rule"- can't be seated until your whole party gets there.... if you know that ahead of time, no need to be shocked by it! OVERALL, 4 stars, always room for improvement (no one's perfect!), but I love this place, good breakfast, good lunch, good times!
