We were here late-ish on a Friday night. We were able to get a table right away, and thankfully we did not experience the fog machine or lasers that others have mentioned here. The space is pretty swank, despite the prison theme. Our waitress - I wish I had caught her name so I could give her a shout-out (younger looking, super cute with blonde pigtails) was really sweet and efficient. At one point the sound went out on the TVs - we actually didn't care because we were talking anyway - but to make up for it the owner/manager(?) came around not only offering a shot of our choice, but refilling everyone's glasses with Kilo Kai, which I happen to adore! Pretty awesome, I say!  We each had a burger, me with mac&cheese and my friend with the fries. The mac&cheese was delicious - whatever the breadcrumbs are flavored with really made the dish. The burger (on a pretzel bun, natch) was cooked just like I wanted it to be. It really didn't hold a candle to "that other metal burger place", IMO, but had a nice tangy BBQ sauce on it and was tasty. I definitely want to try out some of the other sandwiches on my next visit(s). And put more mac&cheese in my face - nom nom!
