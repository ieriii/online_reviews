Ok, I wouldn't be a true Chicago girl if I wasn't into Hot Dougs. This place is the shit and everyone should go here at least once. It runs like clock work and they serve some premium dogs here (and there is always a spicy one on the menu for those who like it hot) Here are my only gripes: 1) You can get there early or late on a rainy day or on a cold day, doesn't matter --- you are GOING to wait. You are going to wait for at least 30min to an 1hr. It doesn't matter if in your head you say "but no one will go today!" no they will. there's a line forming right now, as we speak. 2) They need to post a menu outside because once inside I always have trouble deciding and then it's too late.
