I went for a bridal brunch on a Saturday morning and all I have to say is AMAZING!!! There was something for everyone! The salad bar was GREAT! So many fresh and flavorful ways to do vegetables. I was super full by time the meat started coming around, but I had to have a couple nibbles of the beef and the salmon which were SOOOO good. Come with an appetite and pace yourself. But keep in mind that this is a classy spot. (leave the bib at home)..... there is also a beautiful roof top for drinks and light eating. Go Now! Stop reading and check it out.
