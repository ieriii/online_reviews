We really like this place. The best time to go is before 10 on the weekends and when there is nice weather. The outdoor seating fills up quick and it is great to grab a spot and people watch. Don't be too scared of the line - it usually goes fast. Everyone that works here is nice and things run very smoothly. Both breakfast and lunch are good and I find the prices very accurate to the amount and quality of food and the atmosphere.Kid Friendly - Definitely. Although small inside, there are always children. In the warmer months you can see strollers lined up outside and in the winter, surprisingly, strollers will fit inside! They have an abundant amount of high chairs and the staff are friendly with assisting. The background noise is at or above my sons - so it works out perfectly.
