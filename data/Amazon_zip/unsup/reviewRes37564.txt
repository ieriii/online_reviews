My last two trips to the cafe involved long waits for my food. Very long. Tipping the servers not permitted any more at the cafe.  That would be good if they made up for it by paying the employees more, but I doubt that is what they are doing. Too bad that there is no real competition , other than a Dominick's, in Streeterville or downtown. ( Oh yes..Treasure Island is a few blocks north). Supposedly a Roundy's will open up at Columbus & Randolph pretty soon - we'll see how that works out.  I think that the opening of the French Market (which will have a City Market !) at Ogilvie will force F&O to become more competitive, or close.
