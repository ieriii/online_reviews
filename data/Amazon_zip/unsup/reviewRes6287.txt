Just great. What a concept. Italian tapas. Really. We ordered a bunch of small dishes and a few appetizers and everything was great.  Another great idea is that the wine list is actually affordable. It's really a wine shoppe on one end and no corkage fee for restaurant patrons. Ok let's start from the beginning. Parking is not terrible in the area. Great Taylor street location. Restaurant is beautiful. Nice seating. Not too loud. Service was prompt and made us feel very comfortable. No drinks tonight so I can't comment but the wine list looked great. No dessert either but the table next to us raved about theirs. I think we're gonna be regulars here.
