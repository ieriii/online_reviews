I accompanied a friend with press connections to the opening of Zed451 on Friday night. I was curious, as I'd found a training manual for a busser that read more like an etiquette pamphlet for a coat check boy at a sex club. This place completely defied my expectations - I expected the food to be unbelievable and the staff and atmosphere to be unbearably pretentious. I could not have been more wrong! The food was the pinnacle of mediocrity. Some of the flavour combinations were just plain odd, the pastries (while beautifully presented) had as much sugar as a Hostess cupcake and only slightly more flavour. The vegetables were bland even when drenched in the "creative" sauces they were served with. The meats ranged from okay to disappointing. I do not eat red meat, but I partook of the pork ribs (rough and chewy, with a bland barbecue sauce I can only describe as "clotty"), the salmon (so rare I couldn't eat it most of it, even though I'm a fan of rare fish), the chicken (dry, but spiced nicely), the sausage (by far the highlight - spicy and juicy), and the parmesan-encrusted pork (I kid you not - it tasted like day-old chicken breaded in White Cheddar Cheese-Its - which is not to say it wasn't tasty, just seemed like an item more suited for the menu of Harold's). The two stars are for the myriad of sexually attractive employees who were surprisingly friendly and attentive. In conclusion: I'm reluctant to return (even despite the $50 gift card provided to each guest as they left), but I may come back to flirt with a particular bartender I failed at giving my phone number to.
