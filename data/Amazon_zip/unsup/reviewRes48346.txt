What the hell is a pub without a bar? Thats the Publican. This place is trying so hard to build a rep, that this place is loaded with rules. First, reservations only - for a flippin beer?! All I wanted was a beer! Second, if I got beer, then I couldnt order frites, because thats for tables only. Okay, I had enough. You will never, ever get a dime, recommendation, or another visit from me ever again. I'll stick with a place where you can actually walk in and get a decent Belgian, like Hopleaf. Screw you, Publican. You definitely deserve to be in a fly-over city and stuffed with suburbanites.
