Can the gringo out mexican the mexicans? We enjoyed our brunch at Frontera, but it wasn't the second coming. I made reservations for nine people. It was decided by popular vote that I ordered the best entree: three little corn cakes, topped with egg, shredded chicken, or chorizo and plantains in a bowl of smoky black bean puree drizzled with crema. I've made black bean soup, from canned and dried beans many, many times but Frontera did something special to make this humble dish a standout (homemade broth? hours of boiling with a ham hock?) The agua del dia was delicious: cucumber, pineapple, and parsley. The misses: the red pozole was bland, the broth watery. And the special, a wet tamale, was way too salty, which drowned out the delicate spices Annoying: the waiter trying to upsell with the bottled water (after we'd already been served tap water, which tasted fine) and pushing the appetizer plate ($7.50 per person, for guacamole, ceviche, quesadilla, and taquitos. no offense, they're probably pretty good, but we could get a knockoff version at taco bell) Instead, we ordered the more interesting capitale quesadilla, which are deep fried, cheese filled empanadas, the guac and the ceviche (too sweet) Bright, festive decor.
