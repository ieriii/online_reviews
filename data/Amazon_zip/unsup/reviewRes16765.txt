Most of the reviews go into great detail about the place already but I'll just add my two cents: Great drinks ( a bit pricier than regular bars) Great atmosphere (think exact opposite of Tavern) Great decor (everything is relaxing) Best part, no people standing and talking on their phones drinking Miller Lites. Added tip: the line is a bit unusual for this place. It may seem disorganized but it's somewhat organized. Usually by the time you're inside the entrance the bouncer comes out and asks how many people are in the parties. Sometimes they're looking for a table of 4 so if you're a table of 2, find another party of 2 and split it. That way you don't have to wait and you get to meet some new people. There's always people that cut in front. Most of them walk back out in a few minutes after finding out that there really is a line. Some of them know someone on the inside and get in right away. So don't get mad because they have hook ups. You know you would use them if you had them too. It gets real packed on Fri, Sat around 10-midnight. Later on around 1 am is a lot less congested and easy to get into.
