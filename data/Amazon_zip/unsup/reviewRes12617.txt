So I wrote a lot, but to sum it up these places are just a novelty and although I ate my fair share, I still felt like it wasn't worth what they charge. I love all you can eat. But this was just lacking something. The salad bar was rather impressive, the lobster bisque that several other yelpers have talked about was sub par in my opinion (disclaimer: spent summers in Maine), but I think it came from a can or a bag, it was certainly not made in house. The meats were fine, some were excellent- the braised pot roast, the prime rib, and the lamb (not the lamb chops), but the other half were really overcooked and under seasoned- or in the case of the flank steak waaaaay too salty. My service was attentive, but I generally had to repeat myself a few times because the music is way too loud. The desserts were weird too. I don't like chocolate or citrus so there wasn't much for me to choose from, and then my waiter suggested strawberries and ice cream. Tell me if anyone also thinks this is odd: Me: "is it just strawberries and ice cream? or is there a sauce?" Waiter: "No they are blended together." Me: "Oh like a smoothie or a milkshake?" Waiter: "Kinda, but not really" Me: "Ok, I'll try it." My waiter appeared to have been raised in American and was a native English speaker. To my amazement, this 'dessert' comes out in a tall milkshake glass with a spoon, no straw. I tasted it and it was yummy. But it was literally ice cream and strawberries in a blender, not too thin, but not thick enough for a spoon either. A straw would have been better. Me: "So how isn't this a milkshake?" Waiter: "Um, is that a bad thing?" Me: "No, I'm just wondering why you don't call this a milkshake. That's what this is." Waiter: "Oh, ok." Odd.
