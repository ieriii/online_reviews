Ha, I've been eating lunch here at least twice a week for two years and never reviewed it til now. I always get the same exact thing - the lemon chicken soup and a half caesar salad. There's free bread!  It's a nice place to sit with my iPod and catch up on podcasts during lunch hour. The salad is fine and the soup is dandy. Did I mention free bread?
