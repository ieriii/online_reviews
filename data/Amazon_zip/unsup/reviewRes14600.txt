This place is super cute. It's tiny inside but very "cozy". The guy & girl that helped us were awesome and knew the menu really well. We had the guajirito (SP?) which was a bread-less sandwich make with plantains as the bread instead, tofu, and some pepper. It wasn't AS flavorful as I would have liked (probably because it was made with tofu that didn't seem marinated) but some hot sauce helped. I will be back to enjoy the food and outdoor seating again! Looking forward to a milkshake the next time. :)
