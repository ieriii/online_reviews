One of my favorite Chicago spots. The drink list has breadth and depth. Local vendors and growers are used and promoted. The menu is diverse and changes with the season. If it's listed, I recommend the pumpkin ravioli- yummm. The atmosphere is great- relaxed during the week and bustling on the weekend. The cozy, warm feel (as well as the sweet potato fries) make for one the best meal experiences in Chicago. A word to the wise, be prepared to spend at least $15, not including an alcoholic drink, which could be as much as $12. However, if you've got a little extra change in your pocket, this place is highly recommended!
