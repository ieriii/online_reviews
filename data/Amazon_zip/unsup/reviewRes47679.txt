This all you can eat restaurant with very modern decor serves up some of the most delectable meats in the city.  Lamb, beef, ahi tuna, chicken, ribs, salmon...all very well prepared and delivered from the skewer to your plate.  A few things I learned from my "experienced" dining friends before I went: - Try to stay away from the rolls and the pasta on the salad bar, you'll fill too quickly. - Make sure you start out slow because some of the best meats are served at the end.  - If you like something, request them to come back for another round. - Wonder what makes it so good? Ask them for the recipe... I did and they gave it to me!  Zed451 was very accomodating for our group of 10 people and if I'm ever in the mood for a Thanksgiving style feast, I'll be back!
