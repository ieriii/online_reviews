Came here with a few co-workers and oh man, the best chicken I've ever had, seriously. It was smooth like butter, and seasoned just right. The wait was a little long for getting our food, but it was well worth it. Had the creme brule for dessert, it was a little bland, but the jam served on the side made up for it. The wait staff was a little weird. Apparently they won't sit you at your table until your entire party is present, and everyone on the table wants a drink but me (or at least that's how I took it when I wasn't even asked if I wanted one). But then again....the chicken!
