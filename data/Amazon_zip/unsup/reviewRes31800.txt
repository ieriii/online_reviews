Just not my place. Ive been here a few times because I have a lot of friends that are vegetarian or vegan. This place is meat free and I live on a steady diet of meat . So this place and i just don't see eye to eye. Ive had a few things and for me it's just bad, sorry guys you will not win this meat lover over with your fake meat and fake dairy food. If i have to go back I'll just stick to the water.
