GLC got rave reviews from my entire family during our recent trip to Chicago. With the main entrance hidden just west of Michigan Ave, my wife stumbled across this place as we were looking for brunch.  The waiting area downstairs was pretty packed though it looked like we just missed a big crowd of people who ended up standing outside as we were getting seated. Like the other reviews, the first thing we said to each other after we got seated was how much the place looked like the Cheesecake Factory.  The gal helping us left a lot to be desired in terms of her service, but the food was a hit. So much so, that we returned for a late lunch/early dinner the day after. This after I read the reviews on Bandera just across the street but once we saw how limited their menu was, we ended back at the GLC. Our server this time was much more on top of things so combined with our food, we were completely satisfied. And to top it off, there was a near food fight between my father-in-law and my stepson over the molten chocolate cake which is made fresh to order. My stepson has already said he wants to have his bday dinner here. Having been to Cheesecake Factory several times, I'd have to rate GLC higher in terms of food quality. Best way to describe it, it is what CF used to be around 10 yrs or so ago when it didn't have such a "cookie cutter" feel. Last note, their fries are the absolute best fries I've ever had!!!
