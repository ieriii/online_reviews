The first floor is filled with tables to accommodate most parties under 6 people. When you have a bigger party like we did, you get ushered upstairs. Upstairs was decorated with mini palm trees, wood floors and walls, and lots of vegetation giving it a feel as if you were eating outdoors on a deck. We had a party of 25, and had to be separated into 3 separate tables which was a bit awkward. We were seated right next to a community waiting area and bar, which made privacy and noise a bit of an issue. We ordered a set menu: Cha Gio- Vietnamese spring rolls with shrimp, pork and mushrooms (A must have starter) Chao Tom-Grilled Shrinp wrapped around sugar cane with angel hair noodles (Great quality, wrapped shrimp is a bit small) Suon Nuong-Charcoal baby back ribs with lemongrass (Fell right off the bone) Banh Cuon-Steamed Vietnamese ravioli with chicken and mushrooms (Ok. A little too much rice wrapping) Ca Hap-Steamed filet of sea bass with cellophane noodles, mushrooms, scallions, and ginger Ga Nuong xa-Oven roasted chicken with lemongrass and lime dipping sauce Cari Tom-Sauteed jumbo shrimp with eggplant in a curried cocunut sauce (Shrimp was overcooked and lost its firmness) Bo Sate-Sauteed filet mignon with sate spice, yams and string beans Ca Tim Nuong-Grilled eggplant in a spicy basil lime sauce Dessert- Mango and coconut sorbet (coconut sorbet is AMAZING) I'm not particularly verse w/ Vietnamese food, but this was some of the best I've ever had. The staff was easy to look at, accommodating and attentive. Coat checks available downstairs and upstairs, but parking could be an issue. Make reservations ahead of time.
