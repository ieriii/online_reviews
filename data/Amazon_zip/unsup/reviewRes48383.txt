Despite the communal table-induced screaming-across-the-table fest throughout the meal, we had a pretty awesome time here last night. We arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday night sans a reservation and were quite surprised to find that all of the tables were reserved on a Wednesday night. A happening spot, we thought. We began with an assortment of fresh oysters. Our favorite was the kushi from British Columbia. Very clean, bright, and smooth. Then we feasted on some more seafood. The mussels were pretty great. But I must disagree with our waiter and refute the "best-in-Chicago" claim. The baguette served alongside the dish, however, was perhaps one of the best I've had thus far.  Then we moved onto the pig's head. Unlike the name, it was pleasant (i.e. not morbid) in presentation that resembled a crab cake. It was buttery and flavorful. A bit on the heavy side, but that's why you share these plates. ;-) The wine was flowing, and the staff had no problem with us trying several different ones before choosing a few. Very friendly and attentive. Jolly times. I shall definitely return for some short ribs and other yummy offerings on the menu. And... brunch!
