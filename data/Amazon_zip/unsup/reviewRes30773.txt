Kind of a composite review for four people, 2 veggies and 2 nots. Went early, not crowded so take this with a grain of salt, service was great and food came out way fast. I (veggie) had the "Country Fried Steak" and that was up there in the best entree I've ever had (veggie or not) from a restaurant category. Co-veggie had Avocado Tostadas and said they were good. Non-veggie #1 had Titanic burger and liked everything but the actual burger patty. Forget what non-veggie #2 had but same just regular good. Warning to guys, 300 horsepower (I measured with my portable dynometer) automatic hand dryer is right above sink in restroom, pretty damn easy to get blowback of sink water and soap all over if it kicks on while washing hands, potentially embarassing if on a date.
