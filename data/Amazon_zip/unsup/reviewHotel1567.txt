4 stars for the location.. In the heart of downtown, right by the River and Trump Tower, near Michigan Ave and the Bean at Millennium Park! Too bad didn't get around, was on a business trip.. The room was clean, although the bath tub wouldn't drain. I'm not the complaining type so I just left a note to housekeeping and they had it fixed the next day. Room service was very good. Had an awesome Chicken Salad sandwich with a side of fresh fruit salad. In the morning, the good ol' egg white omelet with side of fresh berries oatmeal. The room was also quiet (maybe because I was on 28th floor!) but there is plenty of action if you have time to check out the city.
