Food was 5 stars, the service was 1. We arrived 45 minutes prior to our reservation and they insisted we be sat... We went early to enjoy a pre-dinner drink in the bar. Wasn't an option, we would have forfeited our reservation... Then the waiter literally took 25 minutes to get that first drink. He said the bar was extremely busy... Unacceptable - especially at $18 for a martini. Started with a wedge, it was average.. Soaked in the vinagrette dressing. Moved onto the bone in NY. Unbelievable. 28 day wet aged. Delicious. Finished with the creme' brulee. It was unique, had more substance. Also was delicious.
