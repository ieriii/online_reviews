I wish I could rewind to last Wednesday and do it all over again because I had such a great dinner here. It'd been a while since my first visit, and I'm not quite sure why! There was a short wait when we arrived, so we enjoyed a couple of Mojitos at the bar and listened to the fantastic salsa band. Our table was on the second floor, overlooking the first floor dining area, and it was a neat spot to sit, looking over the entire restaurant. The service was fantastic all night. We had chips and guac and ceviche to start and enjoyed every last bite of both. For dinner, we had the skirt steak (perfection) and ahi tuna (also perfection). We skipped dessert and instead enjoyed a few more drinks at the bar. I'm definitely keeping Carnivale on my short list for celebrations and live music, or really any time I feel I deserve a reward (and I pretty much feel I deserve a reward for making my bed) - it's a vibrant, fun and flavorful experience on every level.
