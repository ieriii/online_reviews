I've been to Sabatino's a couple times and just made another reservation for family coming into town. This place is really cool and well priced. Frankly, if you're looking for the ol' neighborhood Chicago Italian eating head over right away. My friends & I have been serenaded by their musicians for New Years while dining on a huge 6 course meal. I love the pizza bread that comes by the table at every meal. I hate that I'm expected to share it. The chicken parm there is lights out! Friends loved the seafood too! Word to the wise: *eat a small lunch you'll want to make it to desert for a canoli. *valet is available but so is street parking too Will I go back? Nothing else in the area comes close, of course!
