This is a really unique place. Came here last night with some high school friends and didn't think of having to wait at all on a Wednesday night, but there was an hour long list ahead of us. We stayed and it was worth it. Although I'm not a vegetarian/vegan the choices of awesome things to order were plenty. The Reuben was amazing and I orderded both sides of the spicy black beans and kale salad. The spicy black beans were definitely tasty. My friends ordered the avocado tostada and black bean burger which they both were happy about but I think mine tasted the best. We ended up going through facebook on our iphones about old high school people, reminiscing on the good and the bad for awhile and there was no rush to move us out of the table. Good times!
