i went to L&E without hearing much about it so i was totally unbiased and open. i'm going with 3 stars because 2 doesn't seem like enough but... first of all, I thought the menu was a little pretentious for the pseudo hipster/whiskey bar image they're putting out. i got the burger since i was not willing to be too adventurous at the time...and only ate about a fourth of it. a) i ordered it medium-well and it was very very pink. i thought maybe the waitress misheard me, so i didn't complain. b) while it was very juicy and good quality, the fancy bun they served it on was not thick enough to handle it and was soggy and soaked through by the time it even got it. next time i'll have to bring my own pretzel roll. Meanwhile, my husband got the pork cheek small plate. i actually wish i would have ordered that because it was delicious! however, my husband felt the meat portions too dramatically outweighed the vegetables and was left underwhelmed. i offered him half my burger but by then the bun was so soggy he couldn't bare to eat it. bottom line- we both left still hungry. the drinks were good, but possibly weak because after 3 drinks (about $24 worth) and barely any food i wasn't even buzzed. Basically, if you're looking for a place to go to try some adventurous appetizers (i hear the bone marrow is quite good) and maybe a drink with a co-worker...this is a great place. i guess i was just looking for something a little more substantial and for $85 (including a 20% tip, the server was sweet) i was just a little dissapointed.
