I've now been to the Chicago Diner twice, and I want to love the place. I'm a foodie and a longtime vegetarian, so this should be a natural for me-- and I do like it. Definitely. But... See, I moved here from LA, where, despite the city's many faults, there is no shortage of veggie cuisine. Real Food Daily (RFD) basically changed the way I felt about food in general. Here, though, I was really looking forward to veggified diner food-- you know, of the smothered-in-gravy-and-really-bad-for-you-but-ohhhh-so-comforting variety. And yes, the menu has (mediocre) meatless chicken-fried steak. But mostly, you get things like the sweet potato quesadilla. To be fair, it was awesome. We also ordered some kind of nacho appetizer, which was delicious, but the waitress forgot to put the jalapenos on the side as requested, so I lived in constant fear of fire erupting in my mouth. My girlfriend had an enormous salad, with well-seasoned tofu and a garlicky dressing. I like the heated tent out back for those waiting for tables. I like the tables-smushed-together feel of the place. And the food was decent, if somewhat overpriced (one shared appetizer, no beverages, one large salad, and one actual entree= $40). But a diner, if you ask me, shouldn't feel like an experimental cafe.
