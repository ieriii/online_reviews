I booked this trip on Priceline and snagged a great deal for the location. I called to ask for two doubles and a non-smoking room and they did give me a fair warning that since I booked through a 3rd party, that they would try their best. Did end up getting the 2 beds in a handicap accessible room. The rooms were not as renovated as you'd expect from seeing the lobby but the amenities of a nice view, pool/gym, restaurant and bar make up for that. Pros: Cool factor of a 15th floor lobby above the Chicago Sun Times building Fantastic views of the city from the bar and restaurant Open atrium lobby In hotel upscale bar and restaurant with room service options Friendly check in staff Flat screen TVs Rooms with "span the width of the room" windows with nice city views Pool and gym Lounge like lobby area for work, reading, or chatting Walkway from Merchandise Mart CTA station is priceless. You can walk straight off the CTA station through the mart and take the elevators onto the hotel lobby on the 15th floor. Cons: Really outdated rooms with sparse furniture Beds that need replacing Overpriced drinks Location is far from any dining options within walking distance except for close to River North (expensive)
