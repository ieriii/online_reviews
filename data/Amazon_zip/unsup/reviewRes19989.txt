Wanting to try something new, I went over to XOCO for a churro and some hot chocolate but when I got there, there was already a line forming at 1PM. If you just want to buy some hot drinks or pastries, just breeze through the line and go straight to the register to place your order. The line is only for dine-in customers and the wait averages to about 1 - 2 hours. I thought the Almendrado hot chocolate was too sweet for my taste and definitely decadent. So if you're in the mood to try some mexican goodies, come to XOCO.
