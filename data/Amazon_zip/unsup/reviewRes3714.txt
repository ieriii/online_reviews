I had been heard about the Korean-style BBQ wings and decided to come here on an absolutely miserable Sunday afternoon. The wings were the perfect tonic for my crummy day. The BBQ style wings came five in an order (that's 5 entire wings, not 5 pieces) and were plump and juicy. They were coated with a thin but deliciously sticky and messy sauce that was sweet and spicy, and they were sprinkled with a few sesame seeds. There are other flavors and other dishes, but the wings did it for me. The breaded mushrooms I ordered were a bit too much for me, and I considered them to be interrupting my enjoyment of the wings. Most of the seating in Crisp has no backs so this is not the place to linger, but the wings are so good that you'll be licking your fingers.
