We enjoyed our stay at Millenium Knickerbocker. Staff was cordial and the place was clean. Very pretty hotel in a great location off of the Magnificent Mile with shops and eateries close by. Room was small but, very nice design. Nice shower in the bathroom. Room was very cold at night but, changed thermostat in the morning with no problem. This hotel does put a $75 hold on credit card which I found strange. Have not had a hotel do that before. We did not get anything from the bar so the amount was never credited to my account but, it was annoying knowing it was a pending charge for 4 days till it was officially taken off.
