The food was unbelievable! The guacamole was absolutely delicious, fresh and authentic! The salsa was fantastic and laced with fresh cilantro - I suppose some people might find it a little hot but it was perfect for me.  My brother ordered the enchiladas. He thought it had a nice sauce and lots of flavor (and he normally doesn't order enchiladas - so he was a bit nervous). We raved to our waiter Alejandro. He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about our choices. In fact, everyone there was extremely enthusiastic. And for anyone that is a vegetarian: the chips are deep fried in vegetable oil!
