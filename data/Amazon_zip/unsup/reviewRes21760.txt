NICEST PEOPLE EVER HERE! We go to Mayan Palace fairly frequently (2 times a month on average) primarily because of how nice everyone is. Their margaritas are delicious although overpriced. I highly recommend the chicken quesadilla to start, it tastes very fresh and is far better than the chicken quesadillas that have become staples of chicago pubs. We typically spit the steak and chicken fajitas. Steak is delicious, chicken can be slightly dry but good. The side beans and rice taste authentic. Good place, reasonably priced.
