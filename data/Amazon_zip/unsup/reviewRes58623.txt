OK, so after reading reviews here and checking out the website we went to Geja's for a romantic date night. It was a total disaster. From the waiter who was ignoring and just trying to get this over with, to the super narrow space where tables are squeezed into one another...it was a real disappointment. We were seated next to a table of four, and we were so close that literally we could hear every word, even if they were to whisper... No romantic atmosphere whatsoever...The only nice impression I got was from the live guitar music being played and the bus boy, who was really attentive. The waiter took about 25 minutes to show up to check on us after getting the food and finally ask me if I want another glass of wine!!! I am sorry, but if you are paying $120 + for a dinner for two, you do expect some kind of proper service...We left shortly after finishing our meal, drenched in this smell of food..poor ventilation. The food itself tasted good, however there's tons of other places in Chicago with the same kind of good food and waaaay better atmosphere and service. Coming back here? No, thank you.
