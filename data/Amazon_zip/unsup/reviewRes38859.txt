Great atmosphere but I was a little disappointed. I looked on their website for a beer list and was pretty excited with the choices available. But when I got there I had to order 5 different beers because they were out of the first 4 for one reason or another. Not what I expected at 6pm on Saturday. Anyway the food is very average some things a little better some a little worse. I'm told the muscles are great but I didn't try them. The steak was tough and overcooked and I wouldn't recommend it. It's unlikely I will return. I will say our waitress way very attentive and provided great advice about several of our beer selections.
