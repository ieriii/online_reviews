Good breakfast seems hard to come by in the city so when we came across this place today, I was more than pleased. I had the Traditional Buttermilk Pancakes, delicious! They give you three made from scratch for $7.75. It doesn't come with a side so I ordered bacon (3 strips for $3.95) and coffee ($2.35). My boyfriend ordered the Salmon Omelet (egg white substitute at no additional charge). For $15.95, it came with a side of baby red potatoes and choice of toast. Unfortunately, they don't give you choice of toast or pancakes. Nonetheless, I'm so happy I had the chance to sample this dish. It was so amazing to my taste buds! Coffee = STRONG. I had to drink my water just to dilute it from my belly. By the end of breakfast, I was talking so fast I was having a hard time understanding myself. I can't wait to go back and try their Corned Beef Hash with Eggs or Skillet or Omelet. The Honey Smoked Salmon Benedict sounds good too! The food is so fresh, it gives off a heathy vibe; but, there isn't any portion control menu for kids so I'd have give some thought before bringing my niece and nephew here.
