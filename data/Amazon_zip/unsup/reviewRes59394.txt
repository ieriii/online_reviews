I work near Fox & Obel, so I frequent it on occasion. Its caf is decent but nothing to rave about. I heard from a colleague that they serve a great tuna melt sandwich, but I have yet to try it for myself. As for the grocery side of things, it's way overpriced. But the store's warm lighting makes it inviting to browse, especially on a cold autumn day. I mainly go there for my occasional guilty (expensive!) pleasure: plucking up Bquet caramels--you must try the Celtic sea salt ones. Mmm!
