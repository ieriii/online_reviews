We have been living in Chicago a long time, and remember when the Diner was a 3-star, at best. They've turned it around, big-time. The food now is delicious, and I don't remember the last time I DIDN'T want to go eat here. Their Dagwood is probably one of their best sandwiches, next to the Ruben, and with a side of Sweet Potato Fries and Creole Mustard, you can't go wrong. Desserts? Lately, they have been impeccable. Again, as I said before, it was pretty hit or miss. They must have a new baker, because I could eat their desserts all day and always be satisfied. Thanks guys!
