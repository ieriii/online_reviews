Price, Quantity and Quality. We all understand inflation but if the idea is to have your customers return over and over why would you attack all three. The price is what it is but the quantity should remain and if the quantity lessens the quality should remain. In my view point being a customer for many years it is getting harder to return with all of these changes.
