A perfect meal.  I decided on Graham Elliot as a new spot to try when my father was in town for Dad's day last weekend...I am pretty certain it was a good choice based on the fact that my father shook Graham's hand after dinner was over and told him it was, "one of the best meals he [has] ever had." Yep. that good. First off, the drinks were creative and refreshing. As a fan of ginger beer, I was excited to see it featured in a refreshing cocktail. Second thru last, the food. Holy Moly. Where do I start?  Appetizers Kobe beef tartar with smoke ice cream. Cesar salad with brioche twinkies - giant crutons -o- love filled with parmesan cream cheese. Truffle gnocchi. My favorite. Rich and perfect combination of pan seared gnocchi with truffle oil, asparagus and a fried egg.  Main Strognoff. My boyfriend enjoyed this one. Mahi Mahi. Forbidden rice is black rice. It is true, once you go black you never go back. Wow. Skate. Best by far. Capers and fruit work. Who'd a thunk it? Just smelling the brown butter on this one will leave you drooling.  Everyone cleaned their plates. No regrets. Plus. We got to thank Graham. It is always refreshing when someone with such an amazing talent is also extremely humble.  Graham - even if the career as a guitarist didn't work out, you are still a rockstar in Chicago.
