Had a fantastic dining experience here. Atmosphere was very hip/loft-like, good low volume background music.  Service was great, not too overbearing.  Cocktails were perfectly balanced. The food was great, eccentric yet not too much so. Everything we had was delicious. Well put together, large enough portions. You'll taste things in ways you haven't before.  I would definitely go back.
