What's not to love? You can get a spinach pie, meat pie, tabboule salad (not my favorite), zatter bread (my favorite!) and baba ghanooj and falafel sandwich for $20!!! I love this place. And even though I'm not crazy about everything (not close to the best lentil soup I've ever had (Cafe Orchid's is so, so much better, I think), I still love it. It's charming. Just remember to bring cash...no credit cards taken!
