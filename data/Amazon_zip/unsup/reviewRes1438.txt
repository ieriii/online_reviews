1) CLOSED ON SUNDAYS 2) DUCK FAT FRIES ONLY SERVED FRI & SAT. Why? Why wasn't this the first thing EVERY yelper said?! Would've saved us so much heartbreak. That said- delicious, get two dogs, prepare to wait outside in the cold at LEAST 30 minutes, Doug is real friendly, sausages come out pretty quick. I HIGHLY recommend the Mushroom and Swiss Cheese; a regular told us to get the elk sausage, the saucisson was delicious but pretty mild. Happy visiting!
