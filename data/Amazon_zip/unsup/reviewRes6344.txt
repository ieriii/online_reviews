Wildfire is a solid steakhouse. I love the blue cheese crusted filet and the peppercorn crusted filet. The salads and everything else are always very good. The best part of wildfire is they don't insult you like most other steakhouses by charging you a ridiculous amount for a side like a potato. Give me a break! Wildfire is by far the best value for a steakhouse.
