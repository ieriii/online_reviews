I will admit I was tentative to try deep dish pizza. Having had mediocre reproductions throughout my life I thought it couldn't get any better. Well I can admit I was wrong. The best thing about deep dish pizza is the enormous amount of toppings that can go inside! The meat lovers was a perfect end to the day, paired with a few beers, doesn't get much better than that. The cornmeal/biscuit type crust is interesting, and a welcome break from the thin crust pizza. I still prefer thin crust pizza, but that is just me....... The restrooms are upstairs and a mess. Even on a slow night they were not great, not a good sign. 2 Flushes
