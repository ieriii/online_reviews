I have been coming here since I was a little girl with my family and oddly enough not much has changed. The little salad bar still looks EXACTLY the same (which is charming, to me). I have good memories of this place, and the last time I was there I took a date who lived in the area so it really was a no brainer to come here. We had purchased a few appetizers to split between us. I remember the Red Snapper being pretty good when I was a kid, and it still tastes the same as an adult. Not too shabby La Villa, not too shabby at all :)
