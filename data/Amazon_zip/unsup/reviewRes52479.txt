Brazilian steakhouses are awesome as a treat if you're a poor college student. You can eat a days worth of food in a couple of hours. This place was very palatable.  The service was quite good, attentive, quick, and always bringing out new, hot food. Kudos to the staff, very professional, friendly, ethnic. The salad bar was quite good, usually a good salad bar is a good indicator for things to come. The starches served were very varied, and tasted great. This gave everyone a taste of rice, beans, bread, all wonderful. The meat was fantastic. I tried everything. The pineapple was the best offering. So juicy, warm, perfect. I know it sounds silly but it was the best. I would come back here. For sure.
