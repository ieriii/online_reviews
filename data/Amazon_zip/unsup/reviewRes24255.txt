First, I have to say thank you to the executive chef! I LOVE foie gras and while they had two dishes with SOME foie gras, we wanted the foie to be the main component in the dish, so Chef Cory Morris made us our own special dish that was AMAZING!!  All other dishes were also amazing, especially the pork belly, octopus and chorizo. Agree with other reviews that it is definitely a pricy meal, but we'll be back! Wine menu was okay - some good selections but also on the pricier end. Service was also great and they did a good job at coursing out the meal so we weren't overwhelmed at any point with too many or not enough dishes.  Such a great restaurant. Just wish Chef Garces was there - would love to meet him!
