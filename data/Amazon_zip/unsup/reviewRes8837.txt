Best Persian food in Chicago hands down. Since I am Persian I can tell you that this is the place to go if you want really good Persian food. I always get the Kabab Barg and its great every time. Served with white or dill rice and two tomatoes on the side. The meat is cooked just right every time and tastes great! Its a bit pricey but its all worth it. Also the moosir appetizer is great to eat with the warm pita bread!! Go here for great Persian food!
