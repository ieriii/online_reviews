We dined at Mastro's the other evening. All I have to say is that it was one of the single most amazing dining experiences ever. The place looks incredible and the food is ridiculous.This place is going to to be amazing and they are going to really kill it thtere.For those of you who still eat in the viagra triangle (and FTR -- i actually don't know anybody under the age of 60 who actually still dines there) - please stay there - so you don't ruin our experience dining at Mastro'sKudos to the team at Mastros. Can't wait to go back many times
