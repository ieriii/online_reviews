I can only speak for the beer, as I've gone to korean bbq nearby after each time I've been here. With that being said, incredible beer selection. I love fine belgian ale's, after just a couple a solid buzz ensues. I love belgian whit, and also delirium. Anyplace that has delirium on tap is special. The upstairs with the wall- side bar is great too. A good atmosphere to chill and have conversation, a fun spot. I'll be back soon.
