The pizza is good, the caramelized cheese makes it great. It's not your typical Chicago deep dish pizza -the crust isn't dry and boring like at most of the Chicago pizza places.  The lunch special is a steal. $5 for a personal pizza with 1 topping and 1 drink (includes beer on tap). I liked the old dining area before the renovations but there is more seating now, so I guess it's a push. They used to show a music station on the flat tube that basically only showed videos or concert/live performance footage. It wasn't on today. It's really easy for a dinner and movie date since the movie theater at Webster place is right across the street. 5 stars for the pizza and I'd give it an extra star for Pequod's mascot - a whale wearing what appears to be a thong on its face. If someone can explain that to me, it would be greatly appreciated.
