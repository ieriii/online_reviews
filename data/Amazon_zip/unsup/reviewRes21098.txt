Came for brunch on Saturday - had high expectations as I love Rick Bayless!! Was expecting a bigger breakfast menu, and was disappointed that their lunch menu wasn't available until after 11:00am. There were less than 10 breakfast items to choose from, and they had already run out of one - (and no tacos!). The place is also tiny, but we only waited about 10 minutes or so to snatch a table for 4. The chorizo and egg torta was delicious!!! Will definitely come back to try the lunch/dinner menu - the special lunch tortas and caldos looked amazing, and the salsas were pretty tasty. 3 stars for now until I can try other things...
