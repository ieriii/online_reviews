I do love Big Jones. You can make reservations for Sunday brunch, which in my book is always a HUGE bonus. Add those tasty beignet treats and it's a winner. I love that they add seasonal menu items and list the farms they purchase their produce from. Highly recommend the peach and goat cheese omelet (sounds strange, but it's oh so tasty). Only complaint is that it can get very busy and crowded. As you're waiting for your table there's not really anywhere to stand so come early and be prepared.
