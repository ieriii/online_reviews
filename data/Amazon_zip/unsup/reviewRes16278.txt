From the outside, I thought this place was a run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. I was so wrong. This place is a metroplex of Latin awesomeness. We sat at the bar waiting for friends, and the bartender was ridiculously swamped. That didn't stop her from being friendly, being quick, and making some great drinks. The impressed look on my face did not go away when I received my food. I must note that the server was a little scattered and forgetful, but no so much that I would downgrade Carnivale. The ceviche was some of the best I've had outside of Costa Rica. This place is not to be missed!
