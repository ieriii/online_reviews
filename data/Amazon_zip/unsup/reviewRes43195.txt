So, I have'nt Eaten/Stolen any of the Christmas Chocolate that I bought for my Friends- But yesterday I had to have Spaghetti and Meatballs From the Art of Pizza, A Perfect Choice! This Place has been voted #1 Deep Dish Pizza by the Chicago Tribune for a Reason, they have Great Pizza! The Regular Varieties are all here, thin, Pan and Stuffed- I had always thought the Stuffed Sausage was Phenominal until yesterday when I tried the Deep Dish which was Delicious! Perfect Golden Crust, Toppings and Flavor, Just Perfect! They have daily Specials and yesterdays was Spaghetti with Meatballs, A nice Portion of Pasta, Sauce and 2 Big Meatballs, Included with your meal is Soup and Salad,and a nice piece of French Bread- Their prices are Totally Reasonable for what you are getting, in the last few years the menu prices have only raised slightly- They have 2 specials each day, On Wednesday Chicken Parmigiana and a Great Italian Beef/Sausage Combo Sandwich. Hard to make a choice there, they are both that good! The Art of Pizza is located in a small strip mall at Ashland/Wellington here in the City, when you walk in there is a Counter where you order and a Seating Area on the Side, No Wait Staff, but just very Casual, Comfortable Dining, Is the Art of Pizza worth a Notice? If you have never been there It's absolutely worth a visit/Delivery Call- The Menu Selection, Prices, and Food Quality definitely get a Positive Nod from me! So, if the Cold Weather ismaking you hungry for some really good food, try the Art of Pizza- Well worth it!
