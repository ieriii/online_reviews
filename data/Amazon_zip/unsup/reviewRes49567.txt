Bin 36 does a great job of providing customers with a wine-bar experience that combines a swanky atmosphere with quality wine and cheese offerings. As others mentioned, I liked the fact that there were numerous flights available and thought this made it a fun and different destination. It definitely has its niche, though--don't take your grandmother because it can get quite loud--and I wouldn' t choose it as a dinner destination either. Best to leave it as a wine bar and choose somewhere else for cuisine. On a sidenote, we found our waiter to be quite odd; she looked so tired and downtrodden that it made it awkward for us to order and she at several different points pulled up a chair and sat down at our table.
