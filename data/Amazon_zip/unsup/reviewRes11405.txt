Delicious pancakes, hands down. Red velvet, banana bacon, brioche..... everything is so rich and delicious. Its almost hard to eat one by yourself. I recommend sharing with buddies. Breakfast burrito is tasty. Coffee is ok (though Ive had grounds in it... twice... kind of gross). I love this place and love introducing new people to it. Beware, after 9am its packed and you will likely have to wait. I have also heard this venue better than the one in the South Loop.
