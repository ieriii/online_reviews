We are an order out family. And, La Villa and Calo Restaurant on Clark Street were growing up, our favorite Italian Restaurants and, still are our choice for Italian in Chicago.For an excellent romantic evening, usually, it's La Villa. However, last Sunday night, the place was jam packed.Apparently Channel 11, mentioned them on "Check Please," and it seemed as if everyone in Chicago saw the review.La Villa is awesome when it comes to food. It's unbelievable, when you find out how much you ate, yet, it didn't seem like a lot to our waiters.These, are huge portions! You won't ever go away from La Villa hungry. The waiter said to me, "What did you eat? I don't see how you can have a whole steak left and be full?" Trust me. I ate as much as I could and then, I had to stop. It was too delicious and I went home with at least three meals.I never ordered for delivery from La Villa because our family loves Calo on Clark which is also a surreal dream of Italian delight. It's sort of like a night club, with friendly owners watching to see if you are being served properly. However, not on the menu, which we ask for personally, when we call in, is the Baked Mostaccioli with meat sauce and extra Mozzarella cheese baked in, it's amore!Calo delivery tops it for me on delivery, because once you hang up the phone, a few minutes later, the delivery man is right at your door, with your piping hot dinner.Try to make reservations at both of them. Or, on a busy night, you might stand in line a while.
