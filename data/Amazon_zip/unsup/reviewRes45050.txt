For hubby's graduation dinner, we decided on coming to Anteprima. We perused the menu during Midsommerfest and liked what we read. The reservation was made originally for 7:30 but I was able to change it to 6pm since the reception for his program seemed to end sooner than expected. When we arrived, there were a few tables already but it got packed as we had our meal. Since we nibbled a bit at the party we only ordered entrees. I went with the stuffed rainbow trout with spinach and artichoke. It was delicious. The food was well done and well presented. Everyone enjoyed their dish. Service was lovely but the dining room was a tad noisy. It was hard to have a conversation with someone on the other side of the table.  I was pleased with Anteprima and would come here again for dinner. A walk around Andersonville is definitely in order after your meal!
