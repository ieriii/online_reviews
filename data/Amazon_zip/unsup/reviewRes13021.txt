Cafe 28 has become my favorite restaurant! I was introduced to Cafe 28 through a GroupOn deal. The food and the service provided by Rick, one of the co-owners, was spectacular! I have been back 3xs and now have met Rick's mom Berta. I love this restaurant for dinner because the atmosphere is cozy, candle-lit with tasty food, great wine (always willing to give samples before I decide which wine to go with) and it's family-owned. Eating at Cafe 28 feels good. I am treated well, always enjoy a good meal and enjoy the adventure of being introduced to new Cuban flavours. I highly recommend trying out dinner at Cafe 28. I have heard the weekend brunch is amazing too. I am going to try that next!
