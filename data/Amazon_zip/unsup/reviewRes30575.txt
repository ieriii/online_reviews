The service is absolutely horrible. Seriously the worst service I've had at a place with these prices. This is sad because the food is great. However, I won't go back because there are so many more amazing options in the city where they want to bring you a drink. The service wasn't rude but there is nothing efficient about this place. We ordered dessert and coffee, never got the coffee, and got the dessert 40 minutes later. When the bill came the coffee was on it, 6 bucks for two cups of drip coffee that we never received.
