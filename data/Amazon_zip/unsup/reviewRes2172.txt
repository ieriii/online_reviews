Great food but it's hard to love as much as when back in the day when it was located by Roscoe and Western where you would never have to wait. For years while I was at Lane Tech I went there and now it's been ruined with the ridiculous wait. Just like Kuma's, amazing food, but the wait can just get so irritating.
