Yellow Rose is a favorite of mine. I'd go there every day if I could. Sad that I can't have me some Yellow Rose on Sundays, that's the only downside. The food is fantastic - I recommend their tuna salad sandwich, and the soup is always fresh and tasty. Breakfast specials are a great value and a ton of yummy dishes.  The staff is warm and friendly - don't be surprised if you get a home made cookie or slice of cake with your check.  The Yellow Rose - a hidden gem. I recommend it if you are anywhere near Jefferson Park.
