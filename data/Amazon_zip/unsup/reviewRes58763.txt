Is there anything worse than someone trying so hard to be hip? I have read all the glowing reviews but must say my experience was truly bad. The hipper than thou attitude at the front desk was annoying; the seated at the bar as we are full when for the hour I was there there were several empty tables was just plain dumb management; the Caesar salad was good; the whitefish was edible; the salmon for my wife was not edible; we could not wait to get out of this overpriced, bad food, ridiculous attitude place. Our best experience of the night was the car valet who parked our car right in front but insisted on backing it up to the entry. Will never return; will always wonder why some people love it. chicago enjoys such wonderful neighborhood restaurants, why would anyone choose to be exploited by this ego maniac?
