Over the past 7 years, this is one of the restaurants in the Chicago I keep going back to. I take visiting friends there. I took my parents there for my graduation. The ambiance is great for friends, family or a date. It can get a little loud and a little crowded at peak times. The outdoor seating is great in the summer. The wine list fulfills the needs of any wine lover and has reasonable options for students that want a decent bottle that's not too expensive. The food is just phenomenal. The trouble is deciding which dish to pick when I go there. The pumpkin ravioli has a sweet smoky flavor. The lobster ravioli is succulent. The lasagna is delicious. The lamb... yumm. The best part. The portions are large enough that they can reasonably be split or you can take the rest home and it becomes 2 meals! I'm a huge fan!
