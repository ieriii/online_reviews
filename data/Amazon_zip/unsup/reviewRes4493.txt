Ever wonder what the area high school music teachers do during the summer? They come to Green Mill and turn out some awesome jazz music. I generally fore go jazz music, much like Jerry McGuire, but you can't help like this place. The staff is cool. They let my buddy and I hit the diner on the corner and then slip back in the side door, even though there was a line out in front. They mix a mean drink too, so watch your butt.
