Had to get my deep dish fix during a recent visit to Chicago. Sure I can get deep dish other places but people don't really seem to understand how to make a buttery crust quite like they do in Chicago. In terms of the pizza, the cheese is way too gooey and rubbery, the sauce is good, but could be balanced against the cheese better and the quality of the toppings are nothing to rave about. But the crust, oh man, they get it right. A small pizza was more than big enough to take down two of us, but the most of the pieces were sans crust by the time we finished. Best pizza in the world? Heck no, but I'll say I've never been at any other pizza place where I've ended up with a pile of left-over slices without crust.
