Two words: Oatmeal Shake. I'd come here just for that item alone. After visiting this place for the third time today, I've finally come around to writing up a little review. Granted, you don't come here for the ambience (although the various pictures and stuff along the walls look cool; kind of reminds you about the country in itself), you come here just for the food. The first time I came here was almost eight months ago; it was a dinner with five other people. We ended up getting a gigantic family style meal: Chifirjo (black beans w/pork and veggies), Chicken cascado, steak cascado, veggie platters, rice & beans, plantains, guacamole w/chips and cabbage salad. YUM! Every single dish was delicious. For dessert, we had the almighty oatmeal shake; first time I tried it it was totally not what I expected it to taste like. To me, it was like a large oatmeal cookie--in liquid form. Be sure to order the large size shake; you'll be glad you did. On subsequent visits, I've pretty much ordered single dishes of food that I had at the earlier meal: a plate of chicken cascado; an side of plantains, etc. The empanadas weren't bad either. The service here is excellent as well. Staff here is pretty friendly, also the food here comes fast and cheap. Be sure to bring cash though; the place doesn't take credit cards. All in all, an excellent place to come back again.
