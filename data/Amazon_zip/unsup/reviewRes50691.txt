I needed a change-up from Charlie's Ale House, and Big Jones proved to have an equally lovely menu selection all its own.  I had the salad with 2 BIG crab cakes on top and my bf had the burger. Everything was tasty (yes, I tasted both meals), they brought out a little appetizer of corn bread crackers and cream cheese spread while we waited, and feeling like a splurge I ordered the cranberry almond bread pudding to go. The bread pudding didn't get added to the bill, so (like idiots) we brought the waiter's attention to it - then . . . the magic words were uttered: "Oh - no- it's free dessert night." Magic!! The bread pudding was delicious in addition to being free: it was more almondy- not the usual gooey and caramely, which suited me just fine. I can't wait to go back on a Tuesday for Fried Chicken night!
