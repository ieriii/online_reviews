Technically I was born and raised in the South. But I never had fantastic Southern food until I came to the Midwest, and specifically to Wishbone. Funny, no?  Wishbone immediately won me over with its quirky decor: whimsical murals and huge chandeliers that look like sunny side up eggs. Our server was funny and on-point. And oh boy, the food! Never has my plate been heaped with such lovely comfort food. I ordered the black bean cakes, with sides of asparagus and mac n cheese. The bean cakes were bean-y and pleasant, with the mango salsa adding a unique zing. The asparagus was fat, buttery, and perfectly steamed. The mac and cheese was pretty good, although I was iffy on the dry, crusted cheese dollop on its surface. The coleslaw was another winner. Instead of the creamy mayo variety, this one featured an addictive vinaigrette dressing. But don't forget to leave room for dessert! The pumpkin pie was drool-inspiring. I think it had some kind of cream cheese witchery in it, because it reminded me a bit of cheesecake.  I left this place in such a blissful food coma. Which means that Wishbone's brand of Southern comfort gets two thumbs up from me.
