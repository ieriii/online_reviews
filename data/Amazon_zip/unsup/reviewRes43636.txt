My boo threw me a surprise birthday dinner at Kinzie Chop House and I had a great time. The service was impeccable. The staff expertly handled the surprise element of my dinner, and our waiter was able to handle our rowdy table with grace and aplomb. I tried their Kansas City steak which was as good as any steak I've had in the city. The sides were great, and they even brought me out a little piece of cake with a candle for my birthday. All in all a great meal. I wish I could remember more of it but I washed my dinner down with two or twelve drinks, but I do remember having a great time. With so many steak houses in Chicago it's difficult to tell most of them apart. What sets Kinzie apart from places like Morton's or Gibson's--aside from price--is the ambiance. Those places offer a louder, some might even say cheesy, environment. Meanwhile Kinzie has a softer, more intimate setting, much better for a romantic dinner, or an intimate gathering of friends. If you're planning a special occasion Kinzie Chop House is a great choice.
