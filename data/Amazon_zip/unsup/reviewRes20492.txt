I have now been here several times, and I finally figured out a way to use this place.  Since $13 sandwiches are a bit hard to justify at lunch, I recently mentally shifted this place to a mid-range dinner place and voila its now a good deal!! My last visit I had the ahogada which is the best of several sandwiches I've tried there. Generally I prefer the sandwiches to the soups. I also tried the ancho chile brownie bits which are good enough to make a non-dessert person go back. They do a lot of things right and deserve to do well here. Is this going to be a chain across the country? I think so.
