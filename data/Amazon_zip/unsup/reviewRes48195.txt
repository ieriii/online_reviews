As hyped as it was, it just didn't deliver food-wise. Perhaps I would've been really satisfied if I simply stuck to its pork/oyster/beer selections but I didn't. Pork belly was good. Pork rillettes were fine although the currant:meat ratio could've been bigger. Spicy pork rinds were light and fluffy, tasty with a powdering of cheese. Scallops were a big fail. It was soft and mushy as if previously frozen or something. Asparagus was not grilled soft enough and was a big disappointment considering how they're in season right now and should taste amazing regardless! But...the waffle was great. Just don't smear the honey butter all over it before you try a bite (like my dining companions did). And sour cherries? Yum. It's loud, it's crowded, the space is cool, the bathroom even cooler but most of the food is aiite.
