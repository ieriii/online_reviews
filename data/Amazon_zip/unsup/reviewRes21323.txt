I love Mayan Palace. Especially on Thursdays. For those of you who have been living under a rock, Thursday is half price margarita night at Mayan Palace. Any house margarita. On the rocks, straight up, frozen, flavored, you name it. $4! Now, Mayan Palace does not skimp on the tequila just because the margs are half price. Nope, these are some pretty strong puppies. The food is good too, I am a fan of the chicken enchiladas, and their complimentary chips and salsa leave me with no complaints. All in all, super well priced for Lincoln Park, and I love me those margs!
