This hotel was great for the location - our room had a partial view of Grant Park and Lake Michigan. However, the hotel and the rooms were in dire need of a remodel when we stayed here in November 2011. it looked like there were some renovations going on in the lobby, but our room was pretty dated. Luckily we booked this place through Priceline and got a good deal, but if I were paying the regular rate for this hotel I think I would have been pretty disappointed. The hallways were kind of dimly lit here, so overall it just wasn't a very inviting hotel. One thing that I did like was that the room actually had two bathrooms, which was something I hadn't seen before. The beds were only double beds though, so I would probably rather have had bigger beds than a second bathroom. I don't think I would purposely book this place on my own, but if I got a good deal on Priceline I wouldn't object to staying here again.
