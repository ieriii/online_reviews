I don't think it gets more authentic than this!Clean restaurant with quick, friendly service. Food comes out steaming hot and fresh. The Tiger's Cry is awesome as are the soups and peanut satay! I crave their food just thinking about it!!!Don't fear its location under a train track...you can hardly hear a thing!
