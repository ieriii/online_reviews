I went for the lunch buffet, and it was worth every penny! The food is delicious (not a big fan of the saag, but everything else was great.) What really stood out, though, was the service. I have never eaten at a buffet with such an attentive waitstaff. My coffee and water glasses were never empty. Used plates were cleared from the table very quickly. Even though the restaurant was very busy, and the table next to us was only about five inches away, I know that I will now be a regular diner at India House!
