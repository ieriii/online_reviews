The ceiling was leaking into a bin on the dining room floor. Gross.  Just because you call the food Cuban doesn't mean it is. My jalapeo pork chops didn't have a hint of jalapeo. My husbands steak was passable. The "taste of Cuba" app was decent but I'm not really sure what the various food items were- other than deep fried. Service was poor- we had 3 separate waiters that couldn't keep track of what we ordered or deliver what was ordered. We got charged for an extra mojito that we never got. Skip- expensive and totally not worth it.
