Ordered catering from Yolk for a client meeting and hot damn was it good. If you want to stand out from the traditional bagels, yogurt THIS is the place to order from Sante Fe frittata - holy delicious. Love the avocado and jalapeno. So good for a catered pan of frittata Nutella crepes - Um....if you serve nutella crepes to anyone they will fall instantly in love with you Mixed Fruit - you can tell it was fresh. Non of that pre-cut been sitting for a while crap Mixed pastries - yummy mix of bagels/muffins cut in halfs/quarters which made it super easy to share. I will definitely be ordering catering here from now on! It's a little far for me to visit the actual storefront, but I have been to the actual location a few years back and need to visit again!
