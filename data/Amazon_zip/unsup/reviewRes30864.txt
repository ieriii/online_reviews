Went there for a saturday brunch with a gang of about 9 people which included 4 kids. I had a tough time deciding between a 3 and 4 star as you will see from my review. What was good - 1. Surprisingly good, cosy and clean interiors 2. Fresh and organic ingredients which made for great tasting food 3. Nice twist on every day items (freshly squeezed apple juices, sauces on skillet dishes etc) 4. Street metered parking was pretty easy to find What was not - 1. Service was very spotty. Restaurant was at 60% capacity when we were there. But everything was still really slow coming out, even though some other people came in later and had their good arrive sooner 2. Orders were mixed up and atleast a couple of them had to be changed. But all in all, if you go there for good tasting fresh food, you will not be disappointed. Just watch out for a confused order delivery, otherwise the place has tremendous potential. I might try it again sometime.
