If I could I would give this another .5 of a star. Pros: BYOB and while we were waiting for a table, people in the waiting area were all sharing...cool Cons: A long wait for a table. Pros: Really cool place. Great vibe. Everyone is having a good time. Everyone is dressed to impress. Cons: Food was ok but not great. I ordered the Sashimi plate and the quality was ok. The rolls were very good. All in all - the atmosphere outshines the food, but I'll definitely go back.
