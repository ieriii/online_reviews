Checked into this hotel after staying at Hotel Indigo for a few days.. I enjoyed my stay! Started off a little rough, I checked in at noon and of course no rooms were available and they just told me to "check back later". I left my bags, had lunch, and toured the city. Came back at 5 pm only to be told that a room was still not ready... After looking at the lady w/ a crazy "You can't be serious" face... she says "But... we can upgrade you". That turned my frown upside down :)  I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite w/ King bed. I walked in and thought "All this for me? " LOVED the room. Bed was comfy, plenty of space. I was on the 25th floor so I didnt hear the ambulance sirens that i read about in other reviews. The furniture/decor isn't great but everything was clean. Granite in the bathroom. Aveda products. The location was absolutely perfect! Right in the heart of the mile. I was able to walk everywhere. I was also able to walk a block over to Michigan/Erie (or) Huron/Fairbanks and catch buses to South Michigan Ave, Navy Pier, and beyond.. As a female walking alone, i felt completely safe walking the area at night/early morning. I also enjoyed visiting the Starbucks down the street. Its located inside the hospital and its 24 hours! Several food choices on Erie/Ontario/Superior. Grocery store on Fairbanks. Garrett's popcorn on Ontario... all of these places are walking distance. The service was also spectacular! Everyone I encountered went above and beyond to assist me. Sunday morning, I went up to the rooftop pool to watch the sunrise over Lake Michigan...it was awesome! My only suggestion...I know its on the 50th floor but... those windows could use some scrubbing.. I didnt use w-fi, gym, or the pool.. I was too busy sightseeing. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
