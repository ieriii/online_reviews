So after hearing great things about the food at this place I thought I would make it the next place to go for girls night. I don't even know where to began.... They messed up my food twice and my waitress was the worst!!!! She was racist, rude and had no problem showing it! smh well after speaking to a manager he sent another waiter over to bring us dessert and he was Great! Don't think I would come back :-/
