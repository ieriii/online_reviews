"Southern cooking" makes me think of fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, and peach cobbler. But, the focus of Big Jones seems to be New Orleans, rather than the broader region, so tonight's menu featured several crawfish dishes, gumbo, and Big Jones' famed shrimp and grits. Overall, food was quite satisfying and distinct from other Chicago options. The crawfish bisque was creamy and indulgent. The house-made andouille sausage was small but satisfying. Entrees were also tasty but less impressive. I enjoyed the gumbo because of the spicy kick and chunks of meat and pile of rice--it was just what I needed for the draft that was coming in. The famed shrimp and grits were of course delicious, but as I mentioned in passing earlier today, "who doesn't like cheese?" Considering the emphasis on local sourcing, I expected a little more. But, it was definitely something enjoyable and off-the-beaten-path palate-wise. Service was friendly. Our server regularly checked on us to see if we needed anything, but there were other helpers/servers as well, so there were points at which we were getting a series of check-in's. I appreciate the attentiveness--it's certainly better than not getting attention--but there's opportunity for greater smoothness with regularly spaced check-in's. Price: $30-45/person (Entrees $12-$25)
