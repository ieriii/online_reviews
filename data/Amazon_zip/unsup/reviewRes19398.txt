OVERRATED!! While the food was fresh and good, I really have no need to return here. Why wouldn't I return? Because there are many other restaurants in Chicago with food just as good, or better, that have better service, better atmosphere and friendlier staff. First of all, the times that I have been here, the lines were really long - I'm impatient - I live here, I have things to do, so when I want to get a good meal, I also want it to be efficient. I could see if I were vacationing here and had some time, but I'm not, so it's not worth my time. Its a popular place, and there is barely enough seating. As I said, the food was fresh and good, but for what you are getting, its a bit overpriced. I do have to say, their Churros and Hot Chocolate were awesome, but honestly, I find it really hard to screw up a churro. As for the staff - they seemed a bit disorganized. They weren't very helpful in directing us to the correct line and explaining how the restaurant worked. If you are dining in, you stand in a separate line for ordering out - and after we ordered, we had a hard time finding someone to take us to our seats, as the hostess was running around like a chicken without a head. The busboys rarely came over to take our dirty plates, so by the time they brought our dessert out, our appetizer and entree plates were still crowding our table (which we were sharing with strangers - not my preference). It also was hard to catch their attention when we did want them to fire our dessert. I seriously felt like this restaurant was more interested in their food and less interested in making sure there customer had a pleasant experience. You are a good chef Rick Bayless, but this restaurant has failed at the other half of the restaurant experience.  If I were to go back, I would just take it to go...
