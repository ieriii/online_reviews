Wow, wow, wow. I went with some friends to Glenn's for dinner on Sunday night. I had heard great things about the place and I can say all of them are true The place is cool and quirky showcasing a wall filled up with 40 some different cereal boxes and a blackboard listing tons of fresh fish. I've never seen anything like it. The service was unbelievably attentive.  We were seated promptly, greeted immediately and had a delicious dinner...when does that ever happen. Our waiter Bill had spot on dinner recommendations. As someone who doesn't like fish I was told I must try the Cowboy Ribeye and man oh man it was out of this world! Delicious and cooked to perfection. In fact when I told our waiter I wanted my steak cooked medium-well he informed me the steak would come out with just a little bit of pink through the center and was that what I was looking for. I'm glad he asked because I like my steak nice and pink, no blood but not over done. He suggested that we cook the steak to medium and it came out EXACTLY the way I wanted it cooked. I started off with an enormous Caesar salad. I told our waiter I was starving and he told me I should add spicy shrimp to the salad and I was glad I did. We were all so happy with our meals we each had to have dessert. The pecan pie was delicious but my friend wasn't very happy with the apple pie. Our waiter must have overheard him say something because when he dropped off the check he apologized to my friend and told him " Glenn doesn't like his guests paying for their food if they haven't enjoyed it and that the apple pie was on them tonight." We were all blown away and we will be back for cereal!!!!
