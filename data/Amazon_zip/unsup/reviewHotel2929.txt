Located just steps from the river and the major attractions, This hotel is in the perfect spot for Chicago newbies and lovers alike. Prices are reasonable, of course the valet will kill you, but who needs a car in Chicago. The L is right around the corner and trains of cabs are readily available. Book early to keep the rates reasonable, Play on the Microsoft table in the lobby if you get a chance. The Burger bar on the first floor is a neat place to grab a great burger and watch the river traffic if the weather is nice. The coffee bar also has some great cocktails and small bites. Salud!
