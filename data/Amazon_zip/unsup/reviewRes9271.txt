The closest you'll get to a home cooked Iranian meal in Chicago. Everything I've had there is excellent. Service, has generally been pretty decent. However, on our most recent visit, our server (an older Iranian woman) was rude and abrupt. It was my friend's first time at an Iranian restaurant, and she needed some time to browse the menu, or at least have me walk her through it. Our server came to our table within about thirty seconds of being seated, and asked us what we wanted. I ordered a coke, and she stood there, glaring at us, and said, "and to eat?" in a bit of a condescending tone. I told her we needed a few more minutes. She was back at our table, with coke, in about a minute, and stood there looking at us. We had literally been seated for about two minutes, so I said we still needed some more time. She stormed off, and gave friendly and gracious service to Iranian - Persian speaking - patrons. We were ready to order about five minutes later, but she continued chatting away with her other tables and completely ignored us. Fifteen minutes passed, and she walked by twice, avoiding eye contact with us. When a manager came by to see how everything was, we told him we were ready to order. He went to our server to tell us we were ready, and she began to angrily argue with him! I couldn't believe it. I guess she refused to serve our table, because the manager had another server come by and pick up our table. The food was great at always, but the treatment we received from the one server was completely uncalled for. I've always promoted this restaurant to people looking for great Iranian food, but now I'll think twice. Our image in the media is already bad enough... we certainly don't need people like her making it any worse.
