the "family meal" is the way to go here. you get a cup of hot clam chowder, a huge plate piled with both alaskan king & dungeness crab legs, sides of potatoes, creamed spinach, & cole slaw, AND dessert. all for $40/pp (not including tax/tip/drinks). the clam chowder is ok, the dungeness crab is ok (served cold, not what i prefer), but the alaskan king crab is WOW. served warm, perfectly steamed, easily cracked, and deliciously tender - mmm. they give you a little pot of clarified butter atop a candle to keep it warm, but the crab is great on its own. the sides are all ok, with the exception of the cole slaw which i enjoyed a lot because it wasn't coated in mayonnaise and was quite sweet and refreshing. because they had run out of the key lime pie that was supposed to come with our meal, we got to choose desserts off the menu instead. the raspberry pie was very good - not too tart, not too sweet, with a flaky & buttery crust. the lemon sorbet was also really good - it actually had bits of zest in it. the other desserts - creme brulee & chocolate cake - were ok, but not great. service could be improved as we had trouble finding our waiter and it took him forever to get our orders/desserts/check. however, it was a very busy night so we forgave him.
