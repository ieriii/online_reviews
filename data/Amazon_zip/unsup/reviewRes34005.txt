Sultan's has great falafels, but their best quality is how quickly they get the food to you. If there is a such thing as fast-food filafel, this is it. I ordered the falafel, hummus and the lamb shawerma and they were all really good! The salad bar looked good, but I only came for the great pitas. They had plenty of seating, plus an outdoor area. Definitely going to go back again.
