Nice place for after-work drinks, but really, lunch time is what it's all about. $7 Blue Plate Lunch specials are delicious and just as much as you'd pay at a Panera or Corner Bakery type place, but now you have the option to order a glass of wine if you happen to be having a bad day. Or a good day. Or just a day.
