The sushi is absolute perfection. I have been a few times, always consistent, always fresh, and always delicious. The service is not great; slow, unenthusiastic and cold. This is my absolute favorite spot for Sushi in Chicago, therefore I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the bad service; therefore I will minus a star for that. Coast is BYOB which is convenient and fun for a date or group. Reservations highly recommended!
