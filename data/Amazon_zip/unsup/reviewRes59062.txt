Date: OCT 19 08 @ 11:30 am. # of People: 2 touristEstimated waiting time (told by the host) 35 min for a table. Actual wait 40 min for 2 seats at the bar.Need more chairs in the waiting area!!! SERVICE: was seated at the end of the bar where servers and bus boys run around.  Surprisingly, the waiter we got at the bar was excellent... Very VERY attentive!!! every 10 min he'll walk over just to see if we needed anything. maybe that''s not a bad thing to be seated at the bar. I did look around at other people sitting at tables, and sems like their servers are not as attentive as ours...FOOD: super delicious, it hit the spot for sunday brunch. Not too greasy!!! Side red potatoes has a good kick!What we ordered: 1 egg flourintine sub fruits with strawberries, big breakie, 2 glass of juice and 2 cup of coffee.Cost with tax $30.69 USD.Tips/advice: If you want great and fast service I would pick a seat at the bar.
