No long lines for a Friday 4 PM lunch (almost dinner?) The churro was AMAZING! Crispy with sugary cinnamon rolled all over the place with a warm, soft center. It was like they found the best sugar on earth and sprinkled it on top. YUM! The authentic and Aztec hot chocolate were surprisingly similar in tastes except for the slight heat/tingle in the back of the throat with the Aztec. Customers should know that Mexican hot chocolate is definitely not as sweet as your traditional hot chocolate and this was a disappointment for my girlfriends.  The torta was yummmmy! I brought home the pepito and even though it wasn't warm a few hours later, the fiance devoured it. I can't imagine what he would've thought if he had it fresh from the oven. He wants me to take him there immediately.  BONUS: Rick Bayless was there!!!!!!!
