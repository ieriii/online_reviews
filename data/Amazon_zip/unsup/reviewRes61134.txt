I love Garcia's. I grew up around Lincoln Square so it became one of my absolute favourite places to eat. I'm not really a fan of Mexican food in general, which is funny considering I'm part Mexican, but Garcia's is just too delicious. I, unfortunately, moved out to the suburbs with my family a few years back, but whenever I go to Chicago and am craving some good Mexican food, I head on over to Garcia's. My favourite food to order is their chicken flautas with sour cream and shredded cheese. Oh, and their chips and salsa are really good, too. Ay, now I'm hungry!Oh, and the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of room; my social anxiety flares up when I'm wedged between loud groups of people. Aside from that, I have no complaints. The food itself gets 5 stars.
