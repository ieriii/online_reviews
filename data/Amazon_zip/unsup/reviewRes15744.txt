The Focaccia Bread is the best thing about Calo............the other yelpers did not lie. The wait on a Friday night (Valentine's week) was about 20min, but it was quite crowded in the waiting area. A waiter suggested we make a reservation for weekends to avoid the wait. Other things I loved about Calo was the date ambiance without pretentious prices, attentive busboys who kept my water glass full, and the descriptive dessert menu (although I was too full to order any). Not so good things about Calo, the fact that carry-out prices are less than dine-in, my pizza crust was oddly "chewy/tough"- very weird. Again, the focaccia bread was damn good. If you are in Andersonville check the place out; some focaccia, a salad, and a bottle of wine would make a great date night meal.
