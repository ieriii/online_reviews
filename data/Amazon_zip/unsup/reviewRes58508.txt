On a recent trip to Chicago, we decided to have lunch here. We had eaten here a couple years ago for lunch, and we loved it. This time was not so good. We did not have a problem getting a table as other reviewers have experienced. We decided to try a couple of the small plates to share. We ordered the Throw back trio, an order of the chard, and an order of the fried plantains. We were completely dissatisfied with all of our choices. The throw back trio was $18 and was barely enough for an appetizer for one person. The smoked chicken taquitos were not edible. They were so smokey, it tasted like a piece of charcoal. I had to chew gum the rest of the day in order to get the taste out of my mouth. The plantains were just that - plain. They had no taste.The service was very slow for lunch. I can't imagine how someone would be able to eat there on limited lunch time. Also, $51 for a lunch with no alcohol was too expensive! We left there with a bad taste in our mouth (literally) and very disappointed. The place has become too touristy, and we will never go back!!
