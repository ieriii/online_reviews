I have not been here in a long time but remember how yummy it always was..and by the looks of the reviews, it is still delicious! Definetly a must try! I do have to say the coffee at the randolf location and the bacon were not as I remembered at the milwaukee location. Unfortunetly I am Gluten intolerant and do not get to try the yummy stuff.... I highly recommend you try this place!
