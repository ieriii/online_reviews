Love this place!  Though the outside remodel had me thinking it was going to be a new Greek restaurant, Q had me pleasantly surprised. Interior feels fresh and cozy - like home, and the atmosphere is bustling with positive energy. Food was yummy! BBQ ribs and Ribeye steak were done perfectly and the sides (cornbread, greens, mac n' cheese, and mashed potatoes) were delish! One downside? If you are looking for a quieter dining experience, be sure to tell them you want to eat in the dinning area - not the bar. We will be visiting Q again very soon!
