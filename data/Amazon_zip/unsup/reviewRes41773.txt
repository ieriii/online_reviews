Bar Staff: slow and poor service in handling of bar patrons Wait Staff: slow but friendly Food: The bone marrow was amazing but our two pasta dishes (orecchette & bolognese pappardelle) were extremely salty. Enough that it made use lose our appetite. Overall we were there for more than 90 minutes, not including wait time for our table. If they had quicker service they could easily turn over tables much faster to accommodate the growing number of stand-by patrons. While we had made reservations over a month in advance we still had to wait 15 minutes only to be ignored by the bar tenders (what's with the pretentious attitudes?). Unfortunately Gilt Bar was the only spot that won't earn our repeat visit whenever we're in Chicago... as much as I loved their bone marrow, it's just not worth the time or effort.
