I went there with big hopes.Unfortunately,I was disappointed.The soup (I had lamb soup) came not hot enough,so I skipped it.The crepes,their piece of resistance,are so-so.If you're hungry,you should consider having two orders.That's what I did,and the second soup I had (it was pumpkin soup) was mediocre.The only good thing about this place is this:Icosium Kafe is BYOB
