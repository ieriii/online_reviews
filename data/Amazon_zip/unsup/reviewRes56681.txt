Italian cuisine, although delicious, normally strikes me as somewhat routine in comparison to the other great offerings in Chicago (i.e. Vietnamese, Thai, Lebanese, Swedish, etc.) BUT Sapori is marvelous. Not only is the food excellent, but the staff is attentive, helpful, and courteous. Anthony, the owner is lovely and warm, the epitome of the gracious host. Last night was my first (though definitely not my last) visit to Sapori and we opted for the family style servings. You can select 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 3 pastas/entrees, and 1 dessert from this menu. I loved everything I tried. The Risotto al Funghi was buttery and flavorful with delicious mushrooms. We also tried a Squash/Pumpkin dish that was seasoned perfectly. The Caprese salad - always a winner, and Brushetta for starters. Tiramisu for dessert - these three are pretty standard Italian fare and not really my cup of tea in a place other than Sapori. Bottom line: awesome dinner! Plus we have leftovers that will be enjoyed today for lunch and dinner.
