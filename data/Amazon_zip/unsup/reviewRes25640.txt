Mercat is a special place. If you have the money to spare, go for the Jamon Iberico - made from pigs fed on acorns that makes the meat sweet and nutty. The rabbit agnolotti is probably one of the best dishes I've had in Chicago. It just melts in your mouth. It's a more upscale tapas place than your Cafe Iberico or Babareeba, but the quality of the dishes sets it apart.
