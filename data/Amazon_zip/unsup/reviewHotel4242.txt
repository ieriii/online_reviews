Poor service and attitude, excellent location. I just stayed in this hotel for 5 nights for a convention. Housekeeping was terrible -- every day they overlooked replenishing basic items like coffee and toilet tissue. Room service dirty dishes remained in the hall for over 24 hours. We were charged for item from the mini-bar even though we didn't consume any. They base usage on weight changes so if you merely pick an item up and put it back they charge you. The concierge was unaware of the bike rental facility directly across the street. The room was stylish, but the functionality was terrible. Lighting is poorly designed. Very little storage. This hotel is not cheap and they don't even have the basics down, nor do they seem to care when it is brought to their attention.
