I have no real problems with this place, but I found that it was nothing to write home about given the ridiculously expensive price point. The place is not very inviting inside and instead on nice table stoves I've seen at several other places, this place relies on make-shift hibachis with such intense heat that it can b hard to cook the meat effectively. Also, as much as I understand that banchan (side dishes) are a novel part of the experience, I really do think that korean restuarants need to make it optional. It adds $5 to an entree price unnecessarily, and overwhelms the eating experience. A person who doesn't necessarily want all of those bells and whistles will get scared away by a $20 price point for meat (which is just ridiculous for the quality of the food and the ambiance). I miss the old "Korean Restaurant" on Lawrence that used to be open 24/7...
