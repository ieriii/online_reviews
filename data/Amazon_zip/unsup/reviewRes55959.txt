Wow, this place is an absolute gem. My BF and I went here for our anniversary and it was perfect. The service was excellent,the waiter was helpful and attentive without being the least bit intrusive or pushy. The vibe in the place was great- it was laid back and dimly lit, but had a mixture of people dressed up and in jeans.The food was incredible. I got the spinach gnocchi and I can't get it out of my mind! Though the entrees are a little pricey, they make up for it by being BYOB. We will be back...many many more times!
