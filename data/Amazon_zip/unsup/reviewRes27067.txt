Polar bear reporting back on Nuevo Leon... This place still slays.  I went back for dinner last Friday night. Here are some updates. You can bring your own booze. They seat you right away even though the line is intensely long.  This time, instead of chicken soup, they started us off w/ a pork and fava bean on a plate thingie with a warm tortilla on top. It was awes. Then, we ordered the "Queso con chorizo" which is basically tortilla chips with 2 types of melted cheese on it (i think a mix of chihuaua and ro-tel?) and chorizo. These were life changing. Seriously.  Definitely the highlight of the meal. After that religious experience I ordered Carne Asada. Again - very very very very good.  Nuevo Leon, you can do no wrong!
