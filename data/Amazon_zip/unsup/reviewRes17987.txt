This is my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. The food is fantastic (Bruschetta you dream of) huge portions and BYOB, it's everything you could ever ask for. Did I mention NO corking fee??? BYOB and good food alone is enough to get me to a place but when there is zero corking fee and amazing food, SOLD forever. Be warned for first timers, when you walk up to it...it's in a little odd shopping center and at first glance you might go errr a strip mall restaurant..really??Trust me go inside.
