we went as a party of 3 on a tuesday night. waited 40 minutes to get seated and waited another 15 to get a server to say hello and get menus. Another 15 to get the server to take our drink orders. dont think it was that busy. i was a bit annoyed. the drinks were very pretty good. very unique with interesting ingrediants.  the bartenders really know what they were doing. but i dont know if i would go do it again ..
