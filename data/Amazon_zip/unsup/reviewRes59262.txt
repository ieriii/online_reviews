The best duck I've ever had. Great food for your buck. You can fill up on a $5 plate. I regret not trying the fried rice. The servers were bringing them out in these huge plates and they looked so good. Their service could use some improvement. Staff all looked stressed and over worked. Which is inderstanble considering how packed the place was even an hour before closing. All in all, I will definitely go back. You can't beat $30 for 3 people.
