Dear Nuevo Leon, You are a tasty, tasty place that I wish I lived closer to. If so, I would eat at you all the time. The random appetizer is always something fun and tasty, and you make a pretty badass steak milanesa. Also, you make a good horchata. Every time I bring people to meet you, they leave happy. I wish I was with you right now. Hugs, Kurt
