another boring steakhouse. The meat didnt look all that special and the service was laughable. If I were dragged here by someone footing the bill, I'd get the calamari appetizer and a drink and that's about it. The st. louis style ribs were ok too, but none of the entrees seemed worth a visit. In fact, dont go here. dont waste your time. If you live here, there are a million other restaurants that at least sound more interesting and most try harder than wildfire to have a unique personality.
