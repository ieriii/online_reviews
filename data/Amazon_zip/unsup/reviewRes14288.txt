This places is freaking sweet and I owe it to my fellow Yelpers to letting me know about it. It took my cousin and I nearly 2 1/2 hours to get from the suburbs to there, and then down to Midway. But it was worth it... We had Cubano Sandwiches (ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickles, mustard) which just melted in your mouth, Tostones (Green Plantains), an Empanada (Guava + Cheese), Pineapple Soda etc. It was very cozy in there too while the rain was pounding Chicago. It was all awesome. As they say, "experience the forbidden".
