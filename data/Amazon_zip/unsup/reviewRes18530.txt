Is it possible for service to be too good or too nice? Had a really great experience and loved the novel idea of waiting in line to order and be seated, really. We had a beer while we chatted and decided what to order. Once we were seated, the food came very quickly and the busers (they aren't technically "servers") where very attentive. Ordered the Cubano which was AMAZING and another pork sandwich that came with incredibly spicy sauce. Will definitely go back. I'm eager to try their breakfast!
