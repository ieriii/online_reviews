The noise level at The Gage is extremely loud. But do not let this deter you. It's a gastropub after all. The thing that impressed me about The Gage is that the menu goes beyond a gastropub. They have food items that are unique enough that I don't see them very much at other restaurants in Chicago. My fiance and I are foodies and are delighted with their menu. The fried chicken livers were crisp and lovely. One order comes in about 4-5 pieces and it's great as a starter. We had elk tartare (I didn't see it on their menu the last time we were there so I assume they change up their menu from time to time) was amazing. I can't say no to steak tartare and I couldn't stay away from trying this. We also tried their bone marrow which was interesting. There wasn't alot of "meat" or "juice" in it and most of it were the bones but it was interesting nevertheless. I'm all for the entire experience of dining. I've also tried their seared tuna which was very tender and lovely-- lightly seared on the outside and rare in the inside. Each time we were there, we've had great service from our servers. I've said before that although this place is a gastropub, it goes beyond a gastropub. Each time, our servers were very knowledgeable and passionate about the food produced from the kitchen. They described to us the specials of the day and answered our questions about the food in a knowledgeable way that you would expect only from fancy restaurants and not at a gastropub. Plus points for that. Also, the last time we were there, my fiance asked our server some questions about the wine menu and we were extremely impressed at the wine knowledge that our server knew. Usually servers would just send over their in-house sommelier to the table to answer any wine questions. We will definitely return, whether for food and table service or just to sit at the bar for a beer.
