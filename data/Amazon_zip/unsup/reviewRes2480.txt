Yeah, this is the best hot dog...er, "encased meat" place in the city. You can read the other 700+ reviews to get a sense of that. You can see the line that goes down the block from open to close to see that everyone and their brother knows this, too. Five stars, nuff said. But I do think this place suffers a bit from "Blair Witch" syndrome. You know, a great horror flick, but it had SO much hype preceding, it was really hard to live up to it in the end, no matter how good it really was. Coming here (and waiting..and waiting) for the first time, you're expecting some kind of religious experience and may actually be disappointed. Even though it's great and still the best place of its kind in the city. I don't know who Doug's PR guy is, but as if the lines weren't long enough, Anthony Bourdain recently put this on his short list of "places to eat before you die", up there with Le Bernadin and French Laundry! This kind of great PR means the lines around Doug's have slowly gotten longer and longer. Doug *really* needs to expand. I mean it's great he takes everyone's order personally and the banter he has with the customers is part of the experience, but at some point the +hour long wait starts to become a major deterrent to coming here as a regular. Is it even practical to be a regular here? The duck fat fries are awesome, but over-hyped. They're great, but not so much greater than regular old fries. The foie gras duck sausage was just OK (though I loved how Doug fought the city's inane ban on foie gras and continued to serve it). The Thuringer and Italian sausage are just awesome. One day I'll have to actually order a regular hot dog, but it's hard to wait for an hour and just get a regular dog. And that's the problem now. You could never just "pop in" at this place, but with all the extra hype of the last couple years you actually have to plan a whole afternoon just to come to grab a bite.
