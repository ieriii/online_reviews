This place is fantastic. I've been coming here for years with both family and friends. It's a lively environment with great food. Their Zuppe di Pesce is my favorite in the city. All of their food and wine is fantastic. The service is also great. The owner, Anthony, is so grateful and friendly. Finally, there are people in their 20's and in their 70's dining here. It's one thing when a place is popular among a certain demographic, but this place is so good that everyone and their mother love it. Literally.
