And another place crossed off my list. We ditched work and came here for lunch. We got right in our server was awesome answered all of our questions. I'm not much of a beer drinker but my co-workers seemed to be impressed.  I will say the food, was very good. I had the BBQ sandwich with the garlic cheese mashed potatoes and thought it was very good. And of course we had the bacon fat popcorn. I think its a nice addition to Logan Sq and very close to the Blue Line!! No complaints on our end and by the way..nice selection of music playing.
