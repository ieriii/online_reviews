Came here after work to enjoy a glass of wine on their rooftop patio. I must say it was a good experience. My friend and I shared a Vasi: Ricotta with honey.... It was delicious and surprisingly filling. The staff was very attentive and courteous. Did I mention they have a great patio?! We are making this our lunch destination this summer. Go!
