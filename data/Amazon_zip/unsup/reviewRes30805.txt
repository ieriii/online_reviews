My favorite restaurant in the city. The reuben is what they are know for and it is excellent, but the California reuben is the best! They only have it on the spring/summer menu, and I'm so glad it is back now. The best thing they have is the peanut butter cookie dough milkshake. When all of my non veg friends come to town, that is what they always want to get! The wait can be long almost any night, but afternoons are usually ok (except for weekend brunch). I usually do carryout anyway.
