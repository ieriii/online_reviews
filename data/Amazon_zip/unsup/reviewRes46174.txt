Food was excellent! I got the Miso Glazed Salmon which came with stir fried veggies and rice. The presentation was nice. The salmon was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside..just perfect. The veggies were also really good. I also got the Calypso Mojito. It was really good...but not sure if it was worth it for $9. For dessert, we got the New Orleans Beignets. Delicious! It came with 3 dipping sauces; a white creamy one, chocolate and raspberry. I would definitely come here again! The Salmon, drink and dessert (split between 4 people) ended up being $40 with tip included.
