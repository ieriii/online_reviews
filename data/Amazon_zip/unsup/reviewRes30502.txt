Came here with a couple friends the other night for my first time and really enjoyed it. It was a saturday night and we had to wait about 40 minutes to get seated. The place was small and there happened to be a party of 13 so thats why it took long to get seated. I had the Gryos which was pita bread with sliced seitan, chopped onions, tomatoes & lettuce, with vegan tzatziki sauce. It was great! I got it with a side of sweet potato fries which were crunchy and sweet. Also, loved the sauce. They had sriracha sauce on the table which is always a plus in my book. The staff was really friendly. The atmosphere was nice and liked all the colors in the place. The two ducks that the founder's of Chicago Diner rescued were really cute! I definitely want to come again to try more of their sandwiches/dishes.
