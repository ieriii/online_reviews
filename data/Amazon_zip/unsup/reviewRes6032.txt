Maybe I'm a stupid guy who doesn't know how to appreciate a good steak. I've eaten at all of the great Chicago chop houses, Gibson's, Morton's, etc. None of them have floated my boat like the pepper encrusted filet I got at Wildfire. Sure, it's a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. It's a franchise. I'm sure the steak in one Wildfire tastes just like the steak in another. But I'll be danged if that wasn't a tasty mo fuggin' steak. I'm far more likely to hop out to Wilmette for a dinner at Wildfire than I am pretending to be fancy and important at Gibson's. I'm a big flavor guy. I like things with lots of flavor, and these steaks are infused with it. The portions are large, but I still cried over my empty plate and started scanning the table for scraps. The atmosphere is a little overwhelming. It's a very crowded restaurant, and noisy to boot. But the food is a great distraction from the ambience. It's a mistake to be writing this review on a Monday morning at 10pm with lunch looming. I work at Chicago Public Radio, which is on Navy Pier. There is no delicious steak in my immediate future, and my glands are dripping for one.
