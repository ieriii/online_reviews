I cannot figure out why they make people wait outside for at least a half hour when it's 30 degrees outside. Does it really take that much time to make a list? But that's the kind of establishment this is, overly pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious. No rhyme or reason to any of it. They ignore empty drinks, the waitstaff and bartenders get angry if you waste their time by asking about the drinks, and it is just generally unwelcoming. When we left, the bouncer/host was standing at his booth, seemingly doing nothing. I exited to see the long long line of people waiting to get their name on a list. Seriously, why do they make people wait outside just to make a list? Maybe it's funny to have a long line of people standing at a blank wall on Damen, only to turn them away.Yes, the drinks are excellent, the lighting is great, the privacy is nice, but they treat customers (both inside and those waiting outside) like they don't need them, or care if they are there.
