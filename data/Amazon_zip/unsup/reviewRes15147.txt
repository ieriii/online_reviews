This is one of the first places I would go for celebrations when I first moved to Chicago. I still enjoy it! Sabatino's is versatile. It has both a family and date vibe... and because of this I have brought many boyfriends and my brother there to dine (over the years, not together of course!). It's never done me wrong.
