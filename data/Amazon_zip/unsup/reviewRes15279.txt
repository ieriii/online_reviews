I was super excited to visit RevBrew after I had heard lots of hype from friends and family. We decided to go there for Father's Day, and it was a good choice.  I had looked at the menu online prior to going, and was a bit skeptical. It seemed like they were trying too hard to cater to the hipster foodies out there. But after eating there, I've decided they know what they are doing. :) We all ordered something different, and everything was good.  We started with the bacon popcorn, as my brother was raving about it. It was good, but if you're watching calories, I'd save them for another beer or something else.  We then ordered the Workingman's Burger, the Pulled Pork Sandwich, the Mustard Chicken Sandwich, and the Margherita Pizza.  It all was delicious, especially the pizza.  I'm always nervous about ordering pizza at the bar, but this was really good. It was light, crispy, and flavorful.  And then....the beer. I sampled 3 different kinds, although I can't remember the names (something golden ale, begian, and iron fist maybe?), but they were all good.  All in all, I'll definitely be back.
