Ordering a steak is like buying a bottle of wine - the cuts, sizes, and cooking styles leave me feeling overwhelmed and indecisive. Thus one of the many reasons I avoid ordering it. Now, while I can't say I overcame my steak skittishness at Kinzie Chop House the other night (I opted for the salmon - and it was excellent, btw) I can say that this place knows their way around a cow. They even have a demonstration (which includes props, mind you) of the various ways you can order your meat cooked and served. According to my dad (who I consider a steak connoisseur, if there is such thing) the delmonico was succulently delicious. As for the rest of our meal: The mushroom and gargonzola cheese tart was a tangy treat. The jumbo mushrooms were awesome (I know, when you think mushrooms, you don't necessarily think awesome, but there you have it) The bacon/scallion mash was eh The creme brulee was decent, but the butter rum cheesecake was a savory combo of cream and caramel. My only gripe was that the tables were WAY too close together - my dad's chair was repeatedly knocked into by passing patrons - an irritant by the end of the evening, to say the least. Impressively, the manager came over and apologized for it, and even gave us a free dessert for our trouble. Clearly, the staff at Kinzie is focused on customer service (our waiter was also excellent) - and their effort certainly didn't go unnoticed by my family. A restaurant to return to, for sure.
