I'd give this place 4.5 stars. The atmosphere is excellent -- love the ambiance, the clientele were all ages and all walks of life, we got a table really quickly and were able to move closer to the stage within only a few minutes, and our waitress was really sweet. However, I'm not sure how I feel about the no-talking rule during the music. I was in a group of 5 early-20s students, and it's a little hard for us to keep quiet when we're drinking, listening to amazing jazz and having a good time. We did try our best though. And later on into the evening, people got more talkative and they stopped enforcing the rule so strictly. Other than that, everything was great. Really delicious amaretto-crans. Lively graffiti discussions in the women's restroom. Bring cash.
