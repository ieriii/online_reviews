I really liked this place. We had 4 adults two babies. All of the food was good, the only real critique I have is that the croque madame came on a french toast -like bread & it just didn't seem quite right. Everyone else had fritattas and they were accommodating for one of our friends with a gluten and dairy allergy. Would like to go back sometime and try the cinnamon roll french toast. Good service, good coffee & big windows so it is well lit.
