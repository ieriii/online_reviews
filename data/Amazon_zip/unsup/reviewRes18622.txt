Our very hungry party of 6 tried the Bad Apple on a Saturday night without a reservation...and we were pleasantly surprised! The bar had great tables that seemed similar to the dining room, making us feel equally cool. The food ranges from okay-good. Our group got burgers, and most were happy. The size is big enough for two hungry people, and the fries are really good. Some of the food could've been a tad warmer, but overall the flavor was enticing. I suggest the Black and Blue burger, but I'd pass on the fondue appetizer. They have a great selection of brews, too! Our server was pretty knowledgeable and attentive. Definitely give this place a try for a great non-bar atmosphere, with amazing bar brews!
