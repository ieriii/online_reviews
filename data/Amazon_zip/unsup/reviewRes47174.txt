Came here with a couple of people to see what the hype is all about. Ordered The Bootleg burger with mac and cheese. The burger was $13 and topped with bacon, kimchi, and a fried egg. I am not a fan of fried egg (especially on a burger), but I wanted to try the kimchi on the burger so I went ahead and ordered it. The burger was pretty delicious, and I thought the kimchi was spot-on. The mac and cheese was amazing - the bacon, green onion and the cheese just meshed together really well. The mac and cheese side, however, was $2 more. Add beer and it's even more expensive! Definitely didn't think the meal with worth what it was, but it's nice to support a local spot. Also ... I'm sorry, but it's hard not to compare this place to Kuma's, and while Lockdown offers solid options, I think the flavors are better at Kuma's. Lastly, the service was super duper slow, and it wasn't super crazy busy. Burgers took around 30-40 minutes to come out of the kitchen. Everyone was really nice, though, so that was a plus. The design of the place is pretty fun, and I appreciated the menu and food offerings. I might come back and try a different burger on a Tuesday when burgers are 1/2 off, or maybe I'll just skip the burger and get some mac and cheese!
