Bottom line: I was a die-hard deep-dish-only girl until I tried Spacca Napoli. Menu: Go out on a limb and order something you haven't eaten before - you won't be disappointed! The proscuitto w/arugula and the wild mushroom w/sausage are 2 that are always on the menu and a fave of mine, but I can't stress enough - try the specials! 9 times out of 10, they're great. Fun fact: The owner is such a great guy and really remembers his regulars. Get to know him and you won't be disappointed. Tip: If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait a while. It gets crowded and stays that ways - but it's worth the wait AND they bring around samples.
