XOCO is the real deal. It's the most authentic Mexican street food that you will find anywhere in the midwest. I've been several times and each time I am blown away. I usually stick with the tortas and they have never failed me yet. From the Woodland Mushroom that has the most flavorful garlic mushrooms I've ever had to the Cubana topped with a fried egg (a MUST-HAVE) everything is delicious. For your friends who like to walk on the safer side tell them to go for the Milanesa or the Chicken tinga both very delicious but probably more easily appreciated for the less adventurous. Make sure to add chips and guacamole or if you are one of the crazy people who don't like avocados try any of the salsas. As a final warning DO NOT LEAVE without getting some of the authentic Mexican hot chocolate. My personal favorite are the Mexico city thick and the Aztec but I'm sure they are all delicious. Also if you feel that you especially deserve a treat then go for a churro cause they are great. happy eating!
