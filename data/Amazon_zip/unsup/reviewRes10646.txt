Meh. I've been two times, and granted, the first time was worthy of a second trip. Kinda like that second date--you found something intriguing and perhaps even the possibility of something for the long haul, but still uncertain. The first time, my friend and I had egg deliciousness--omelets, to be precise. I had an egg white, artichoke heart, feta, spinach-amazing special; she had the tomatillo scramble. Both very tasty. Service was fantastically fast and we were seated right away, granted in very close quarters to our fellow diners. Very loud, could almost hear the chewing of the guests to the right of us. Anyway. Forward to time #2. Terrible service and a meh-quality chopped salad. My husband had an omelet and it was....an omelet. Just that, something we could have made equally good or better at home, nothing incredible. But worst of all was the SERVICE, or lack thereof. We waited about 15 minutes just to have our drink order taken, by which point we had already made food decisions. We never saw our server again until we were waiting.... and waiting.... and waiting.... for our check and finally had to ask for it. If I were a person of less moral character I totally would've dined and dashed. Just sayin'.  Will not be back.
