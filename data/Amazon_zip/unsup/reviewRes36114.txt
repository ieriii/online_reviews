With the huge crowd lingering outside, I was ready for a wait of 1hr+. But the hostess told us only 15-20mins. And I was further surprised after the waiting thing started buzzing in less than 5 mins. This time around, I got Meli's Omelet (pork pancetta, shallots, parsley, chives and Herbed Boursin cheese). Definitely did not forget to order the potatoes extra crispy this time around. The pancetta with the Boursin with some Chalula hot sauce was just toooo good! Bring a friend to split this with because I ate the whole thing and was stuck in a food coma for the rest of the day. Meli's Omelet = WIN!
