As of this review, I've only been to Hot Doug's once. It took me almost a year to try this place out after I moved to Chicago, and at that point, the hype was out of this world. Imagine a year of hype building up, and then waiting in line for an hour in the cold, and then finally getting inside, and waiting in line for another 20 minutes because that's how long the lines are, but now you are inside and smelling all the hot dogs and fries and whatnot. Also, at this point you are really hungry because even though you were well aware of the notorious nature of the lines due to their laughably short hours of operation, you came just a little hungry to begin with. But now the pain is intolerable. Anyway, all that being said, I'll just reiterate what a thousand people have already said before me: It's worth the wait, it lives up to the hype, the special dogs are very creative and will constantly challenge your preconceived notions of what you can pile on (or in) a hot dog.
