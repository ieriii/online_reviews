Recently my friend and I ordered Giordano's. My friend made a big fuss about it so I was expecting the best. Giordano's lived up to the hype. Delicious stuff crust pizza without a doubt the best stuffed crust I have had in the city. It took awhile for the pizza to arrive, but it was worth the wait. Also we had enough leftovers to eat for the rest of the day. I must for anyone looking for good pizza in the city of Chicago.
