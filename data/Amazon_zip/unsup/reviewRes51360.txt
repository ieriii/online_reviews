Garcia's is great for neighborhood taqueria food (i.e. I eat here even when I'm not completely hammered). The place looks like a dive, because it kind of is. The food is cheap and tasty as all hell. I definitely recommend ordering the cheese quesadillas, simple, but loaded with gooey, melty chihuahua cheese. Oh, and don't forget the margaritas... they're cheap, strong, and deeeelicious. Btw, if its a choice between the garcia's on lawrence and the garcia's on western, go for this one, hands down. Last time I ate at the one on western, the guac tasted like egg salad and wreaked montezuma's revenge on my stomach.
