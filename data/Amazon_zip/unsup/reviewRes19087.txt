This place apparently prides itself on both its huge sandwiches and huge beer selection. I got the Smokey & the Brisket along with some sweet fries and it was awesome. For beer choices, they're right up there alongside HopLeaf. Their menu does a great job of describing what's distinctive about each IPA, belgian, lager, etc. that they carry, which is helpful because there were a bunch on the list I'd never heard of. Very decent prices, and satisfying portions. I recommend Bad Apple to anyone with a big appetite and a good taste for microbrews.
