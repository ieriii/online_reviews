There is nothing special about this place! The roast duck here pretty much taste like every other Roast duck you can find in argyle, on top of that they have pretty shitty service. why? i went here a month ago and it was 9 pm they put us down to a table and let me dry in vein. 30 minutes later a waiter came up to us to take our order, he said there are only certain dishes left to order because the kitchen closed. WTF!!! anyways we ordered our noodle because that was the only thing left that we can order. The noodle taste bad, bad bad bad eveyrthign is bad... horrible service , they didnt give me my change......=\
