Yes, the buffet prices are double what you would find on Devon, however, if you can't make the trek all the way up north, this is a good option. The buffet selection is great. They change the selection frequently and it's always good. They usually have at least one fish curry, for those that like seafood. Everyone here is pleasant, my water glass doesn't ever get below 1/2 full, and they clear plates quickly (this is helpful and saves you from looking completely gluttonous when you have multiple empty plates on your table) :)
