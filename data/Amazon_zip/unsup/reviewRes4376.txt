Step 1: Take a disco nap. Step 2: Go to Green Mill and Stay there ALL night. This place is great. As my first jazz experience in Chicago, I was really impressed. I loved the variety of people who were there, the music was great, and the drinks were not crazy expensive. It is a little rough around the edges, which is just my style.
