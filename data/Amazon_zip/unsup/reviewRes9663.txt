Had dinner here with my Fiance and our friends last Thursday. We sat on the crowded balcony, six of us squeezed into a space better suited to a four person party. I was told prior to going, that this place was great and was really looking forward to the experience as I myself don't hit Rush St. very often. I would compare this place to Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton... probably famous for being famous? Our server disappeared for some 10-15 minutes before taking our orders, it was really odd... the bus staff work much harder than the waite staff did. This should be a review of the food, which actually was good, the serving staff or at a minimum our server needed a motivational boost. just disappointed in the service really.
