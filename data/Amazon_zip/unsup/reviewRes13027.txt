I first went to Cafe 28 when it first opened and I LOVED it! Unfortunately, I can't say the same today. I just went a couple of months ago and was a bit disappointed. I felt the food was just ok and the prices were significantly higher. This place went from an awesome affordable place to more of an upscale type of establishment. Upscale is fine as long as I LOVE the food...and I couldn't say that I LOVED it. I probably won't go back unless I am with a group of friends who really want to go.
