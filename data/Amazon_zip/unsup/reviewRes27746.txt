Grabbed lunch here to-go the other week. The place was hopping when I went in, staff running all over the place and people coming in and out. My boss and I ordered food and then sat at the counter and waited. They gave us some salsa to munch on while we waited and a small appetizer, which was really sweet. I went pretty standard with my order some tacos and a tostada. They were good but not amazing. They might not of been as good since we did take the order back to the office and ate it there. Might not of travelled well. I think I need to go back and and try it again, this time eating there.
