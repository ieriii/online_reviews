Fantastic meal. First, the lay out of the restaurant and atmosphere are very unique. When you walk in you go immediately upstairs on a small winding staircase which opens up into an expansive restaurant with a 25-30 foot ceiling. The restaurant is one giant room with an open kitchen but somehow its still feels intimate and close. I was there with five people and we choose to get the chef's tasting menu which allows you to try many dishes from all the different categories on the menu. The majority of the courses were excellent, only a few I did not love. I highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates, lamb chops, and rabbit ravioli. Also, the sangria was delicious. I see other people were complaining about the service but I did not find this to be much of an issue, although I was there on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away, waiter was attentive and very knowledgeable. The only complaints i would have about the service was that the food was slow to come out of the kitchen and the waiter was a little too much of a salesman. Overall, highly recommended.
