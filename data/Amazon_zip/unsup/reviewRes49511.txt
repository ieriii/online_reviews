To be honest, I might not have had the best first experience here. I came for a work lunch which meant no wine. And I think that's probably the best part of coming to Bin 36. So I will have to come here again and drink. I found the lunch menu quite limited and, for someone who doesn't eat meat, it was tough to find an entree I liked. I ended up with the asparagus soup to start and the nicoise salad. I had never had asparagus soup before, but everyone else at the table said it was great so I joined in. I thought it was okay...nothing too exciting. Maybe I am missing something with asparagus soup. But the salad was excellent (I love nicoise salads and ahi tuna so this was a no-brainer).  Oh, I saw something about grabbing a cookie on your way out after lunch, but did not see said cookies anywhere. Boo.
