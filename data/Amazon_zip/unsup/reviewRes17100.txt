Our great friend and food connoisseur Jenise told us about this place. Tony and I have been here twice and we fall in love with Carnivale even more each time around. Recently, we had reservation for two for 5pm on a Sunday. Went there and we were seated within 15 minutes. Our server was great, informative and had a wonderful sense of humor. The food was and always is delicious and perfect. The place itself is so beautiful with vibrant colors and a wonderful ambience. Appetizers: Empanada De Puerco (pork empanada) Ceviche Camarones (Shrimp ceviche with chiles mixed with avocado and a hint of beer for flavor) Tacos de Pescados (fish tacos with a beautiful lemony orange tartar sauce) Main: Bistek Palomilla (ribeye steak) Mama Mendez Arroz Con Mariscos (Sofrito rice with chicken, chorizo, and a variety of seafood) Drinks: Estrella Damm (spain beer) Goose Island Pere Jacques Dessert Coffee mocha ice cream with black pepper chocolate cake First off, the appetizers were awesome. The ceviche was perfect. It was spicy but not overpowering. You can taste every layer of flavor. Tony loved his ribeye steak. It was huge! The server suggested Estrella Damm as a compliment to the bountiful flavor in the steak. He was definitely on point, because Tony couldn't stop complimenting how great his food and drink was. I had their Mama Mendez Arroz Con Mariscos. It was the best paella I have ever had in Chicago. The lobster, shrimp, mussels etc were all fresh, the chicken was well seasoned and moist, and the chorizo was moist and delicious! I couldn't even manage to maintain a conversation with Tony because I was so busy enjoying eating! For dessert we had their Coffee mocha ice cream with a slice of black pepper chocolate cake. The cake alone is a bit overwhelming but when you combine it with the ice cream it's out of this world. A bit weird but good. All in all, wonderful food and service.
