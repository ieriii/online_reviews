dinner for two. drinks with absinthe YUM YUM YUM crab cakes and fried green tomatoes were very good. not sure why the tomatoes had shrimp with them; and though i like shrimp, i would have been very content with just the tomatoes. a small detail. we both had the carolina bass - cooked to perfection. the coffee was good, the cake was good. service was pleasant but not ingratiating; but if our server had come around at just the right time, i would have asked for some chiles. not that he was inattentive. the food was tasty, but just a little bland. southern food should bite back.
