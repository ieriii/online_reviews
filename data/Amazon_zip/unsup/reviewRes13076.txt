Excellent food. The jalapeno pork chops were amazing (consider sharing, each of the two are the size of your head.) We had several appetizers, all of which were delicious. Had no room for dessert, so I can't comment on that. Our waitress was super friendly, and very helpful. Alas, the drinks - which sounded creative and tasty - were over-priced and very watery, so don't be tempted: stick to wine/beer.
