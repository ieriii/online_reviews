Got here at 445 and had no problems finding a table.  Had no idea what a gnuddi was so we got it anyways. It was cheesy goodness. For entrees we got the wild boar sloppy joe and the cauliflower. Both were great and very 'midwestern' tasting. The jalpeo flakes in the sloppy joe gave it a nice kick. The banana and toffee pudding was awesome and probably our favorite part of the meal. The panna cotta was SO good we even thought that was the pudding! Left around 7 and there was an hour wait.
