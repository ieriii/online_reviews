I love this place. I highly recommend the pho soup, fried rice, Bo Sate and the duck. The staff is well trained, pleasant and wonderfully attentive. I enjoy coming here with my girlfriend and have been coming here for a few years. Excellent restaurant if you are visiting Chicago, new to Chicago, or a native.
