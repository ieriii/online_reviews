There are a few things I know for certain about this hotel, one is that I work here and another is that we are a very small hotel with limited staff and a huge clientele. Personally, I know that we go all out for our guests. If you want a view and a bigger room stay at the W Lake Shore. W City Center is exclusively meant for business trips and short stays. The hotel can get pricey up to $400 a night. If you want to stay at a hotel that will go the extra mile, stay here. Talk to the conierge to find out awesome places to go. We add a lot of bonuses here including a courtesy car, guest gifts and an awesome line of bath products! Try the steak panini on the roomservice menu for a tasty sandwich.
