3.5 stars... We walked in on a busy Sat night at 8pm and got seated right away. Our server was very friendly and helpful in choosing beers for me (seriously the drink menu is larger than the food menu).  The goat cheese fondue was quite yummy. The menu isn't very diverse. I think it was mostly sandwiches and burgers, with some apps and salads. If you know that going in, it's all good! I got the "black n blue" burger - blackened with bleu cheese. Loved it! The hand cut fries were ok, though they could have been a little warmer. All in all, we had a great time and were all happy with our food/ drink choices :)
