This is a great business travel hotel. The location is ideal, on Dearborn half a block from the river and within walking distance to all of downtown Chicago. The staff are helpful and courteous. The rooms are comfortable (in the typical Starwood style). Rooms have wireless internet that actually works. The Executive Center is comfortable and well-stocked with coffee/tea, breakfast, and daily newspapers.  The hotel also has other above-and-beyond touches like complimentary evening cocktails and umbrellas on a rainy day.  I would gladly stay here again.
