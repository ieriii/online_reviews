Dear Artpolis, I am going to get fat because of you. Also, I am going to begin believing that the whole world is a nice, happy, friendly place with nice, happy, friendly people. And then I will break into song and dance.  Then I will go out into the real world and will be blindsided by its harsh truth. Are you trying to smother me with your kindness and delicious spinach and feta artopitas? Are you trying to smother me with a lovely European atmosphere? Or drown me in bottomless cups of perfect coffee?  I don't know what to do. I can't live without you. I just got back from lunch and I am already wondering if it's too weird to go back for dinner. What have you done to me!!!!! Love you, Forever, Kari
