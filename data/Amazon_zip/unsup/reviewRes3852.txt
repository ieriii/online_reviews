After reading the other reviews out here, I must have gotten them on a bad day. The guy taking the orders seemed annoyed and was not sociable at all. That alone was bad, but the chicken was worse.  The sauces had a ton of flavor, but it couldn't cover up that the chicken I got was terrible. The pieces were so small I couldn't even tell you if it was really chicken or not. The chicken was so crisp it tasted like it was burnt.  I have never been this disappointed in a meal in my life. They will not be getting any moer business from me or my family again.
