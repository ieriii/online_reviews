Speaking as the gringoiest of all gringos: if you are brave enough to go inside, sit down and order, you wont be dissapointed. Had a urge for tamales (which is what brought there in the first place)..they were awesome....and then I had the goat soup (a first for me). I'd recommend either, but stay away from the complimentary dessert
