This is the third or fourth time I visit this place. The food as usual was very good. My big complaint tonight was the poor synchronization of the drinks with the food. I ordered a martini and the two ladies with me asked for wine. My drink arrived over 5 minutes before theirs, with the food. I expected better than this. This was a Friday night so I guess we excuse more failings on amateur nights.
