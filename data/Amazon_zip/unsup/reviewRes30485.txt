Nana is a cool little eclectic Mexican comfort food joint in Bridgeport. Great for breakfast/brunch. My wife and I ordered the huevos rancheros and the nanadick. Both were kind I'd similar so my bad ordering that way. Have to say that they were just ok. Feel like I need to come back and try more. They definitely go out to make you feel like you're not in the typical Italian or Mexican place in the area. It's def diff and upscale but cool. Menu options are inventive and seem unique so worth another trip. Do love the fact that they off tofu/soy options.
