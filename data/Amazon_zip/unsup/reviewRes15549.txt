Well, recently moving to Andersonville, this is my new favorite and a staple in my dining recommendations! First, you can sit in either the bar area or the dining room (preference one is casual and one is a bit nicer). I prefer the dining room truth be told and the service is better! For starters, try their amazing seafood salad - seriously so delish!!!! Shrimp, octopus, squid and lots of veggies in an oil/vin dressing. Next, I had their chicken canneloni - Oh, my this literally melted in my mouth and I wanted more...Dessert was a bit underwhelming as they gave me a FROZEN TIRAMISU - devastating! Yet, I still love you Calo!
