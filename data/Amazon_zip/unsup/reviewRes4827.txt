They don't take reservations, and they are always packed! Come early and expect a wait. I came alone so it was pretty easy for me to snag a seat at the counter. I had the milk braised pork with mashed potatoes, the mussels, and the cheese plate.  I also ordered the banana, marshmallow, and nutella dessert sandwich.... OMG, so delicious! I don't particularly care for desserts, but this was really good stuff! Yum! Everything was so delicious, I really want to go back! Since I was sitting at the counter I got to watch all the chefs at work and it was very interesting to see how they prepared everything. It runs a little bit saltier than i'd like, but overall very good. Service was good and atmosphere was nice too. It's crowded and a bit loud, but it's a good vibe.
