My sole visit to Crisp comprised a dinner of a Buddha bowl with chicken. This version of bi bim bop was okay - nothing tremendously good or bad stands out about the meal. Unfortunately, for a restaurant that is not a resounding endorsement. Part of my rationale for giving such a tepid review is that I have never been to a Korean restaurant before where I ordered a Korean dish and didn't receive any kimchi as part of the meal. I recognize that Crisp offers kimchi as a side, but I find it odd that it doesn't just come with a main course. Many of you may find that to be an poor reason to fault a restaurant, but I strongly associate kimchi with the Korean food experience. Perhaps I ordered poorly. I mean the restaurant's name refers to fried chicken, and that being the case you would expect it to be good. Given that Crisp has gotten so many good reviews I am compelled to go and try their namesake dish. Hopefully my second visit will be more memorable, and for good reasons.
