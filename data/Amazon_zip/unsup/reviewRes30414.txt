This place was fine. Not bad, not amazing. Just good. I'd give it a solid B. I went for brunch and had some kind of mexican egg dish that was good and a scone which was stale and hard (even though it had been warmed up). Would I go back? Eh, maybe, if I was in the area. I feel like my order was kind of reflective of the restaurant. As for ambiance there was a random array of people. Can't figure this place out. I guess that's just it, it's solid enough that you aren't going to have to wait for brunch but it will still be crowded because the food is edible and not especially expensive.
