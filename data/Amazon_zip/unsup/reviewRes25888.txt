Gejas is by a landslide my favorite indulgence. They say this place is one of the most romantic restaurants in Chicago. I believe it. Every time I go I swear someone gets engaged. There is sooooo much food. You should definitely fast before going. Every course is amazing. The portions are gigantic and there are so many courses so sometimes my husband and I will split a plate. The cheese is amazing. I would give them 10 stars if I could!
