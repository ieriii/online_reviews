So really I would give this place 3.5 stars. I really wanted to like this place. The staff is so friendly and accommodating and I've read so much about the owner. The pho was okay, I've had better. The broth is sweet and there wasn't enough noodles. Both the beef and pork ribs were extremely fatty and greasy. Would I get it another shot? Sure. But wasn't that impressed first time around.
