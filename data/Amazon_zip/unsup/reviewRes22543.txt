I love this place! Irazu is always full of flavor. The empanadas are always crispy and full of flavor. I ordered the shrimp and veggie plate recently and it was great. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the veggies were yummy. I also never go without some of the black bean soup. I'm a citrus lover, so I have to add a bit of lime to it, but that's just my own personal taste. I thoroughly recommend this place if you're looking for something other than the typical Mexican burrito/taco joint.
