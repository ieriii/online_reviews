Very good brewery and pizzeria. The pizza is definitely not Chicago-style, but that is OK. They're doing something outside the mainstream. I had a plain white pizza with basil. Simple and delicious. The medium was too much food for two big guys. Also had a flight of their in-house beers, the klsch and stout stood out as excellent, but there were also some very adventurous selections on the list.
