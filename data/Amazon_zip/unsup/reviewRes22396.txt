Finally decided to hit this place up after seeing a special from Food Network (yes, i'm not from chicago) and needless to say, dawgs are outstanding, fries and excellent. I loved the whole retro back in the day drive-in look. But it was just little too expensive, i know you are paying for quality and i'm not complaining, I'm just cheap like that. But i would definitely go back to this place (on payday) so i can grab one of them delicious superdawgs! quite surprised when i bit into the pickled tomatoes.. it was so good.
