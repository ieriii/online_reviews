Last night was about my 10th time @ grand lux Ive had dinner and drinks with everyone from friends to my mother.... I always order the same two things when i go there so I can say that they are consistantly good... well really good i suggest the buffalo chicken rolls and the beet and goat cheese salad (but not with the dressing they recommend go with the house italian) I highly suggest the Strawberry Martini on the menu it is purrrfect! and quite strong i might add, this one creeps up on you) The only complaint i have (the reason for giving 3 stars)is that last night myself and my friends bill was around 80 dollars we put down 120 assuming no one in their right mind would think they were receiving a 40 dollar tip, but before we could ask for change the ticket and cash were picked up and never returned, we sat there waiting for 20 minutes and not even a thank you! Lucky we were feeling generous and didnt feel like arguing (must have been that 3rd strawberry martini) ;) Other than last night i have always had a pleasant time here, I just wouldnt recommend it for the weekend unless you plan on waiting for upwards of an hour... I think its a bit of a touristy place due to its location.
