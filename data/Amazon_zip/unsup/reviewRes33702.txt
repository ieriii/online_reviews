I work and live close by, so I generally eat here once every two weeks if not more. You just can't beat the quality of food. The wait can be a pain at times, but if you get there early enough (8-9, it's breakfast time anyway!) you can be seated within 15 minutes usually. I have loved everything I've had here, but the Texas Fajita Omelette is my favorite. Quality ingredients, and some of the best quac I've ever had. Go and enjoy!
