by far the best chinese food I have ever had...no contest. I hear it's the most authentic as well, although i can't verify that. I recommend bringing someone who has already been before. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this sole dish that we had. The garlic eggplant was really good as well. Of course the dry chili chicken.
