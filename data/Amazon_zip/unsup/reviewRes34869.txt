Bust out those magnifying glasses, Sushi X is hard to locate considering there isn't a large sign in front of the restaurant. And forget the menus that are usually posted on the front windows, because there are no windows in front of this establishment. I wasn't sure what I was walking into had it not been for a couple of friends who were regulars at the place.  Upon entering, you find yourself in a very, VERY dark room. It is finally after about three meters that you find yourself in the restaurant with a projection screen showcasing Anime as your only light source. We were lucky to find seating, and I say lucky because there only seemed to be seriously less than ten tables.  Because of lack of light, I found it very hard to focus on the menu. I was too frustrated to read descriptions on the menu items, that I resorted to only my regular sushi rolls, Dragon and Shrimp Tempura, after failed attempts to read the menu with my phone (I'm telling you, it's THAT dark). The music was a tad bit loud as well, you would think with the dim lighting that it would be an intimate place, but I could hardly hear anything! On the plus side, it is a BYOB establishment, the food arrived in a timely manner and wasn't half-bad. Although, if you normally order spicy-tuna, I say refrain from theirs, it was over-the-top spicy, even for me, the spice lover!
