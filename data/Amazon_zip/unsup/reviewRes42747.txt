Affordable and tasty! I read Pat S's review about the special and decided to check it out. $5.98 for 2 BIG slices and a drink? Props! One slice is big enough to fill you up, but you'll probably be reaching for the other one by the end of the day. They also offered a chicken meal with side and drink for $5.10.  This place one ups some of the other pizza-by-the-slice places with their ingredients. Yesterday they offered provolone & mozzarella, supreme with red onions, peas, pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives, and hawaiian with huge chunks of ham and pineapple.
