I love the modern take on this hotel. The little things like the vintage luggage "art work" in the lobby was cool, and bed style with pictures not hung but layed on top of the head board was unique. Location is definitly a plus. Being in the River North area, not far from many phenominal eating and entertainment spots, along with the Red Line a very few short blocks away. I thought the elevator was very shotty. That was the only thing that really showed the age of the building. I might as well of been walking on concrete in the room, because there was no padding at all, but hey, those are just litte things. Overall, The James is a great stay. The price was fair, but I believe it was a stay 2 nights and get one free special at the time. Truthfully, I wouldn't stay there if there wasn't a special though. J Bar is also a plus if you want to finish off the night with a couple cocktails right in your hotel.
