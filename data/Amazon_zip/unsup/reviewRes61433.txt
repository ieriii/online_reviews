Simply stated, they are way overpriced, I paid almost $20 for a medium pizza that was barely enough to feed two people. The delivery guy simply takes a tip from you when the person on the phone doesn't say anything about it. The pizza was good, but after paying too much for it I a will definitely not return. Dominos will give you twice the amount of food for the same cost. I am a pizza snob too, but I'd slum it with Dominos over this place any day. For that amount I can eat for a couple days on Dominos.
