Food is fabulous at this pricey, high end, trendy River North favorite. No wonder it is a celebrity haunt. Shared a chicken salad, sushi, and dumplings for starters. The filet entree was excellent as was the chicken breast. The latter could have done without the gingered scallions. Service is efficient but a bit frenetic at times. Take home is also delicious the next day.
