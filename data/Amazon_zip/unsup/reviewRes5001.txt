When I first heard Purple Pig was opening by my office I blew it off. Frankly the name (and my dislike for pork) scared me away.... Luckily I saw past the name and gave it a shot. The awesome reviews helped change my mind... One of the best meals I've had in the city. There is truly something for everyone here. 5 small plates is perfect for 2 pretty hungry diners.  Everything we ordered was outstanding: Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes 3 cheeses with toasted bread. Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (Heard it was glorious) Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli And the pinot noir (Tortoise Creek) our waiter recommended was fantastic. The meal was pricey but worth the extra $. My new go to special occasion restaurant. I wish I could afford to eat here everyday....but I'd be paying for the calories.
