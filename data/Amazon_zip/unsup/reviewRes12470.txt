Decent enough place, but nothing special. Pizza was same flimsy, greasy pizza you'd get at any county fair. No such thing as bad pizza, though. Not a huge beer connoisseur, but mine was good and the people I was with really enjoyed their's. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you live nearby, it could serve well as your go-to beer & pizza place.
