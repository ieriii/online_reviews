Hopleaf let us down for dinner, too full, but not before my parents had to be carded when we entered. Let's just say my folks don't look under 21. Whatever. So we walked down the street to find someplace else. My mom reminded me that we had been to Anteprima a few years back, but I don't really recall, so we gave it a shot. I'm really glad we did. The service was very friendly and the food was fantastic. I had the mussel appetizer, which was fantastic, and tried out some of the goat cheese ravioli my dad had. Also pretty tasty. I had the duck breast, which was unbelievably flavorful, and also tried some of my moms crispy baby chicken. I would go back just for both. Plus, they're very generous with the wine. Always a plus!
