I have not been to Vietnam but I went to Le Colonial with a young woman who had been and she said that it was legit French Vietnamese food. Now, there was no second date but I think that is more about the two of us than a reflection on the restaurant. I wonder if one could get considerably better Vietnamese food for a sliver of the price on Argyle Street. I also could never imagine anyone of Vietnamese heritage ever eating at Le Colonial.   So yes, despite my under selling of Le Colonial, I did enjoy my experience. It is worth noting that it is rather fancy, expensive and romantic. It is a very enjoyable classy restaurant. Good date place or impress out of town family that wants a city experience at a cool restaurant.  You know, that member of your family that hates living in the burbs, eating at TGI Friday's and had a "girls' night out" to see Sex in the City and Sex in the City 2. It is a place where you can sit for several hours and enjoy a good meal. The food led to Vietnamese coffee (which was very good) followed by a wonderful port. I have never been to a French colonial plantation but it sure felt like what I would imagine one should feel like. Or in retrospect, the tourist, high end Disney / Rush Street safe version, not the Apocalyspe Now version. And certainly not the version in Uncle Ho's Vietnam, pre reopening to the West.   So, if you want real Vietnamese food, probably better to go to Argyle Street. If you want the safer version, Le Colonial is for you.  And, a final note about the lounge / bar area upstairs. Nice hidden place but I hesitate because it is Rush Street after all. I haven't had a drink there so can't verify if it is a douche free zone or not but at first blush seemed worth a try.
