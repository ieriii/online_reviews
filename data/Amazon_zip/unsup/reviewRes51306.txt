Blah! This place is horrible. I recently moved to the neighborhood and stopped in here 2 nights ago because I had no food at home. I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but hey; I wanted something quick. The atmosphere is out-dated and the bar tender was not friendly. Ok, so I ordered 2 tacos to go. Waited about 5 minutes then went home with my meal. I started ripping in to the food and ate the whole thing (because I was STARVING) looking for flavor... there was none. The worst part is that in the ground beef, there were big weird chunks of some mystery filler (it was NOT fat; tofu, perhaps?). I can't stop thinking about it. Yuck! Too bad this super close restaurant has crappy food.
