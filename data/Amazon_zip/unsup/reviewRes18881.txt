This place is just perfect. The shrimp sandwich was awesome. The fish and chips were worth a "wow!!" We also ordered a mixed green salad and it was super yum yum. Maybe it was because of the sunny shiny weather on that Saturday morning. Everything just looked so delicious. The service was great. We were originally sitting directly under the sun. And then we asked to switch seats to this table in shade that just became available. And it was all taken care of within the next 5 minutes. And oh, this place serves Bloody Mary at brunch. Isn't it crazy awesome?
