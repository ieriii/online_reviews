Ahhh, Gino's East. With this and Giordano's, it made me laugh at the chain of Pizzeria Uno's around the world. Giordano's converted me into a fan of Chicago-style pizza; Gino's East solidified it. I went with several friends. A vocal, talkative group of friends. When the pizzas arrived, silence ensued, with the exception of chewing and background noise. Always a sign of delicious food. I'll admit that eating pizza with a fork and knife is counter-intuitive. But I'm a fan of it now. A huge fan.
