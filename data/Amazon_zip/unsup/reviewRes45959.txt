Although the food may be a little pricier than some, once you see how big their servings are you'll realize that you're getting a lot for your money. My favorite is the lunch serving of the salmon piccata. It's delicious! I've taken clients there to eat and no one has ever been disappointed with their meals. There is a pretty long wait depending on when you go, even on lunch on the weekdays. I usually experience a pretty long wait to get my food after I order, which can be tough if I'm just going there during my lunch break.  The best thing about the place is their desserts. The beignets are AWESOME, the strawberry shortcake is so big it can feed a third world country, and their baked to order cookies are yummy! This is definitely a place to try out at least once - you'll want to go back again and again.
