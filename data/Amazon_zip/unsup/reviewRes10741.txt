Our oldest daughter has graduated from the Second City Conservatory Program. Her ensemble is performing at Second City on stage. So the family swings by my office and we head out for dinner before the show. We decided to head out for Piece pizza. We have been wanting to stop here for some time. I know we tried for my birthday earlier this year but the place was packed and the wait was too long. That's when we went to Pizza DOC instead. Well we are seated and we decide on ordering two pizzas. We order one large red and one medium white. On the red we get sausage and on the white we get sausage and bacon (I love bacon!). The red pizzas have tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. The white pizzas have a garlic sauce, mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. When the pizzas show up we are surprised how big they are. They say the large should feed 5 to 6 people and the medium should feed 3 to 4 people. Well these pizzas are huge! We think they will feed more than that. The large pizza cost us roughly $19 dollars and the medium pizza cost us roughly $18 dollars. Overall we thought the pizzas were just OK. They were nothing really special. I don't know if I was expecting way too much from Piece. Or that Chicago is known for some great pizza places, such as Home Run Inn. The white pizza had way too much garlic on it. So much in fact that we left half the pizza at Piece and did not ask for it to be boxed. Our waitress was really nice as she was apologizing for the pizza. Both pizzas were actually burnt in differing spots on the bottom crust. We did ask for the quarter of the red pizza that was left to be boxed. The kids wanted it for the next day. So again we thought Piece and their pizzas were just OK. We don't think we will really head back to Piece with all the great Chicago pizza places to go to (again such as Home Run Inn). Sorry Piece, it was nice to actually try your pizzas without the huge wait but we won't be heading back.
