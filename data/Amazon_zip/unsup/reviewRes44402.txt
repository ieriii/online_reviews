I am not a sushi person in the least but I must say, Wakamono is really extrodinary. I used to live a block away and would make reservations there for nearly every occasion I could imagine. They decor is very New York gorgeous. I could do without the blairing techno music but for the most part this place is perfect. Good for dates or girls night out. BYOB.
