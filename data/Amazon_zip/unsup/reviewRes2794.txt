My Fiance surprised me with dinner at Tru on the night he proposed. It was very fitting, a very special occasion type of place. if you dont appreciate the culinary arts, and are a steak and potato kind of a person, Tru is not the place for you. It was very inventive and creative and is a once in a lifetime kind of a spot (well unless you can afford $500.00 dinners on the reg) Will I be back to Tru. Probably not. But I would recommend this place to anyone to try once for the level of service and experience we received. It was awesome!
