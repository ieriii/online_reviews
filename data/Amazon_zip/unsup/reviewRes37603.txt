We ate in the little restaurant. This review is for the restaurant portion only, and does not include the actual market area. The menu was quite good for a small cafe in a high-end grocery grocery store. The people that worked there were friendly. (A good thing!)  The line to order/pay moved well. Getting our order took a very long time. We waited approximately 15 minutes.  For a semi-selfserve cafe in a grocery store, I found this a long wait. I ordered Salmon on Sucatash. Taste wise, it was good. The Salmon was ever so slightly overcooked, but acceptable. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich, which he was happy with.  We also ordered the Truffled Frites. The french fry portion of this arrived luke warm, and the truffled dip portion was cold. Not too appetizing. This would have been *much* better if the fries were hot, and the dip heated every so slightly to room temperature.  The dip was very rich.  All the plain french fries also arrived barely luke warm - disappointing and took away from the over all meal. All told, for Salmon and Sucatash, a Chicken Sandwich with Fries, a Chicken Caesar salad, Truffled Fries and a side order of Fries, it was $44.00. Not worth it - we will not return to the cafe. (Note - we may return to the market - the deli looked like it was worth investigating for a picnic at Navy Pier....albiet an expensive one!)
