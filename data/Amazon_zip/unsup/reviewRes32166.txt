i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could. a staple in my social life, the diner has good vegan/veg food for fair prices. it's organic and local, which is also a plus. the back patio is really charming and comfortable. staff is usually friendly and attentive. order the daily specials with care. they aren't always that good. but their menu items are fairly consistent and tasty. the reason for no 5th star: on busy friday and saturday nights expect a long wait with nowhere to sit or stand. also, their food can suffer during the rush. you might not get as much as usual, it might just be microwaved and slightly mushy...but hey, they'll make it up to you next time if you go in for lunch or a little earlier in the evening. it'll be fresh and yummy for sure. my favorites include: the dagwood, philly 'cheese steak', sausage & biscuits, mushroom stroganoff (special only), monte cristo (new item!)and the peanut butter cookie dough shake. free parking in the alley after 6pm and on weekends is helpful. children are often seen dining there and welcome.
