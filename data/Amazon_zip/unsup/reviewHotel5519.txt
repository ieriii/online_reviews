It's a bit more challenging to rate a place when you have no involvement for paying. So take this review with discretion, as I had no bias of price. Overall I found this hotel to be more than sufficient for my needs during my stay in Chicago. It was a short walk from the rail from O'Hare, it was an extra short walk to the office building I needed, and also a lot of food options in the area. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting crazy in Chitown and was here only for a few days for work. The breakfast bar was adequate, the bed was fairly comfortable, and just in general my room was clean and had everything I needed. The decor tried to be a bit more modern and perhaps more "boutique-ish" instead of your run of the mill La Quinta. The staff seemed nice enough and willing to help, so I would definitely recommend this hotel! I'm sure this area of the city isn't cheap to begin with, but definitely don't let the La Quinta name scare you off. No worries, there was not a connected Denny's like you would normally see!
