Just tried to place a to-go order and was told I was just outside of their delivery range (1 block west). Eh, fine... I'll come pick it up. OR NOT. The guy that answered the phone says "sorry, dude. We can't help you" and hangs up on me before I could tell him I would just come pick it up. When I call back to speak to the manager, he isn't any help. I tell him what happened and his response is, "I'm sure he didn't intend to do that." Didn't intend to? The first guy didn't even give me a chance to respond. He just hung up on me! Even after I explained that, all the manager could say was, "so do you want to place a pick-up order or...?" WOW. Congrats Crisp. You just lost a customer for life. We will have to find another place to take guests every time we have company.
