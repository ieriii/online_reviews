I scored some major brownie points by taking my Dad here for Father's day. This place is great. The restaurant is stylish, the service is great and they don't use paper napkins. Such a nice change from your typical BBQ place. To start, the BBQ chips they bring out are amazing. My Dad and I were fighting over those and ate the entire bowl. We had the BBQ flight to start, brisket, pulled chicken and pulled pork. To my surprise (and joy) in came with a huge helping of corn bread. They were served with 4 sauces and I tried them all. I decided to have the pulled pork sandwich for lunch and when it came on a pretzel roll I jumped with joy. My dad had the Q2. Ribs and brisket. He told me I could try a rib but I could tell he didn't really mean it. He wanted to eat them all. The service was great. The server even managed to sneak me the bill, even when my dad made a big/ loud scene about it. One complaint: Diet Coke. Why it is served in those little glass bottles? I get that they are cute but they are such an unnecessary expense.
