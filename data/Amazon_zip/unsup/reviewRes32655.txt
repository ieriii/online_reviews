I went here a few months back for lunch and was pretty disappointed. The service was extremely slow - it seemed like there was one server for the whole restaurant! The food was not something I'd recommend either, we ordered the steamed chicken dumplings and the meat was RAW! Even worse, we waited five minutes to see if the server would come and check on us, but instead, we had to flag down a bus boy. The server ended up bringing us new dumplings, but a manager never stopped by and we didn't see any compensation on the check. Ultimately, don't bother, there are other great places to eat in the neighborhood.
