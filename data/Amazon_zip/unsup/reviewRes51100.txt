Great down home cooking. They have lots of fish dishes with wonderful side dishes, such as corn or mashed potatoes. The food isn't super heavy and tends to be relatively healthy. They have a few vegetarian options, but not too many. They huge windows along two of the walls that are lined with booths. The decor is bright and lively. There are murals on the outside walls along with patio seating.
