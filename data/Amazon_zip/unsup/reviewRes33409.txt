Grade: A+ With the exception of a lengthy wait for a table, I loved everything about my experience at Yolk. Interesting ambiance, good service, relatively inexpensive... and the food! Oh, the food! My "West Coast Crepes" were absolutely fantastic. Eggs, fresh avocado (in the middle of winter no less), mushrooms, and two kinds of cheese, all within very tasty and light crepes. The fresh fruit was at peek ripeness, despite the time of year, and the pancakes were better than most. This meal, with orange juice, cost only $15 or so including tax and tip. http://www.yolk-online.c
