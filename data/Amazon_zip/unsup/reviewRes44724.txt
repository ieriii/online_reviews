Lunch here felt functional. Like a filling station, only less efficient. Spinach pizza was premade and came right out. Speed good. Taste bad. Not fresh. Low flavor impact. Not nearly as good as some of my Bay Area favorites, which was especially disappointing. I'm wondering if Giordano's is still effectively "famous" or if at this point it's merely "widely available." There's a difference.
