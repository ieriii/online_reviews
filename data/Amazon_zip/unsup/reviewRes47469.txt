Awesome burgers. It was so good I went two days in a row. The first time I went I had the punk bitch burger (cheese and prosciutto), the second time I went I had the bootlegger (Egg, Bacon and kimchi) I was totally blown away by this one. The beer selection is only second to the price.  I fully recommend it. Now they just need to start showing UFC fights!!
