I'd have to admit that while Frontera isn't the place to go if you want real mexican food this is a great place to have some gourmet mexican food a la Rick Bayless style. I've always enjoyed the drinks prepared by the bartenders and have to admit that my favorite apps are still the sopes rancheros. Out of this world yummy. Entree wise you can't seem to go wrong. Pick any entree and chances are you'll love it. The desserts are crazy good and if you don't get one it'll be a great loss. Decor is pretty fun and colorful and the staff is very nice except the hostess. Not sure what the issue is there? I took a star away for that alone. She was rude and quick to dismiss my questions on wait time. Prices...well expect to pay a lot of money. Its not cheap to eat here.
