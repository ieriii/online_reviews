First, the food here is pretty good. The service, however, is absolutely terrible! They have no idea how to treat their customers. Given the number of excellent Chicago area Korean restaurants, this place really should work on fixing this problem. We have been loyal customers of this restaurant for many years, but we will not go here ever again. If you are unhappy with anything, they will basically disregard you and ignore you for the rest of the evening. Not good. There are many great choices in Chicago for excellent food and this restaurant and all others that do not appreciate their customers should not be rewarded for their bad behavior.
