"Amuse" -- focaccia with freshest salsa. "Small plates" -- Bacon wrapped dates. Serrano ham and fig salad. Scallops. Braised short rib flatbread with bacon marmalade. Sizzling skillet of mushrooms, garlic, shallots and potato. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. "Dessert" -- Horchata bon bons. One bite each.  Perfect! Galpal says she has tickets for a play in the south loop and would I please find a restaurant where we only have to park once. Had heard good things about MALP from several friends.  Turned out - it was next door to the theater.  Couldn't have been easier. Reservations on the early side on a Saturday night as we wanted to have enough time to enjoy dinner before our 7:30 play.  I have to say -- from start to finish -- everything was wonderful.  We were seated immediately at a table by a window. Great looking room.  Totally fantastic vibe - music. Terrific server (Naomi) -- she had great recommendations and we clicked with her. Our only "complaint" if you want to call it that -- is the tables are really close together. We understand squeezing as many guests as possible into the space so - that's our biggest gripe. And maybe a tad salty because I was very thirsty all evening.  Half a star off for that. The Food ..... Delicious flavors.  Great combinations.  Beautiful presentations.  Especially the ham and fig salad.  There was a "WOW" factor to everything we tried. I liked that they split the jumbo scallops down the middle. I like mine cooked and not jiggly.  They were grilled to perfection. Other diners had equally great looking plates and we wished we had a bigger group and therefore would have tried more.   Looking forward to getting back to this unique location and terrific food.
