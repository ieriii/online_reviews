Out-of-towners, we were looking for a later Friday night dinner a little after 10pm. Very happy with the eventual find. There was still plenty going on at this eatery just north of the Loop, and the duck I could recommend. Not any new or exotic ground in the flavors department, but a nice presentation of the dishes and recommendable, though small, selection of unique beers. The decor was neat and made for a cool atmosphere. Friendly wait staff, too. And cute hosts, also a plus.
