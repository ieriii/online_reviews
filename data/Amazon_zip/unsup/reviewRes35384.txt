I'm happy to make Shaw's my 300th review! When entering Shaw's, it's kinda like stepping into a 1980's East Coast Nantucket fish house! The decor is more old-school, coupled with trendy business folks, locals, and the occasional tourist all there for one purpose: to eat great seafood! The menu is thorough! Many different fishes to choose from (although, I will say I think there is more fresh fish variety at McCormick and Schmick's....oh snap(per)!).  Our party had the fresh crab (it's nice, you can order a 1/2 order if you don't want to attempt the entire 1 and 1/4 pound. We also ordered the filet mignon, which was fantastic for a seafood restaurant. The crab cakes were pretty standard, and the coconut shrimp appetizer was delicious. Like any healthy group, we had to balance out our order with variety of vegetable sides....the creamed spinach, green beans, and asparagus were all tops.  The best surprise? On the drink menu is a watermelon margarita. Now, doesn't a watermelon margarita go with a fish house like oil goes with water? Actually it was fantastic! If you ever sit at the bar and just want to drink, try the watermelon margarita!!! You'll love it, or I'll give you a money-back guarantee!!
