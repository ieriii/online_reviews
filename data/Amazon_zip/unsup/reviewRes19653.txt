Currently rivaling Sushi Wabi for my all-time favorite sushi place in the city. This place is BYOB, so stock up on the white wine before you head over. I can honestly say everything I've ever had at this place has been excellent - tuna nigiri, salmon nigiri, and the ever-popular Rainbow and Dragon Maki. Love the essence of this place. Very trendy, but in a way that it can get away with. The service is great but it's usually packed on the weekends, so keep that in mind.
