I wanted to update my review after we had our wedding 'reception' there last weekend. As regulars at the Greek Islands, it was really only fitting that we chose there to have our dinner. Everyone was exceptionally nice and extremely accommodating. We worked with Thomas, the banquet manager to make everything nice. He was very helpful and easy to talk to. There was no pressure to design a menu by a certain date, so we were able to choose what we wanted a few days beforehand. They normally only allow any sort of banquet to go until 5pm, but as our wedding was at 2, they let us use the room from 4-6. It was exceptionally nice of them. They definitely went out of their way to help us. They allowed us to bring our cake and put it in their fridge after it was delivered and they even allowed us to bring sparkling grape juice for toasting as we couldn't afford to do alcohol toasting. We did have a cash bar which worked out nicely for our guests. Kristoff was the worker helping us the most the day of. He was so nice and incredibly helpful with explaining things, orders, etc. We really appreciated having him on our team. Now the food: The food was absolutely delicious. We got lots of compliments on our choices, and I never felt like they were faked like they often are when it comes to reception food. We only did one appetizer, saganacki, and that was definitely the right choice. Everyone loved it, and the kiddies got a big kick out of the "OPA!" We offered some chicken, gyros, and vegetarian moussaka for dinner, and they all went over well with our guests. Valet is free, which was a bonus for our guests who drove. All in all, we're very happy we were able to have our wedding dinner there. It was a fantastic choice. Can't wait to go there again on a date with my new husband :)
