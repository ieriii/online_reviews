My friends and I came here on a Sunday night over the winter. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the food wasn't anything great plus this isn't the Vietnamese food that I was used to when I visited Saigon. If I want Viet food then I'd much rather go to Argyle! But anyways, service is top-notch and food came out fairly quickly. We shared 4 entrees and they weren't very large but it was a good size. Parking was easy to find since it was a Sunday night otherwise they have valet service. The interior is pretty nice and very comfortable. I don't I would ever go back but if you want fancy french/vietnamese food, come here.
