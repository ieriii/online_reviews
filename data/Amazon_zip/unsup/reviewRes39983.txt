I've been here three times. The food is always amazing. Some say expensive, but they use quality ingredients and put care into everything they serve. You get a free bite of something with each meal. Once for dinner it was meatballs (my favorite! I mean... crpe suzette!) and once for breakfast it was banana bread (maybe banana, yummy nonetheless) with butter.  Small portions = room for dessert! 4 desserts on menu + 4 friends = hit, hit, pass. Perfect. It does get REALLY crowded. I hate crowded places, but I would crawl through a sea of sick hippies and incontinent Lady Gaga fans if a steaming pile of Longman and Eagle awaited me at the end. Favorite drink for brunch is the Seelbach: champagne, bourbon and bitters. Why water champagne down with OJ when you can add more alcohol!? It tastes effin fabulous and gets you effin effed up!
