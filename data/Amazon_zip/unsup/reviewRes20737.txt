I had a very nice experience the waiter (Steve) was very knowledge and had some relevant recommendation per our interests. The scottish Egg was something tasty and fun to try thanks to his expert communication skills. Service was top notch from the host to others just making sure everything was fine. We had the regular burger and it was solid
