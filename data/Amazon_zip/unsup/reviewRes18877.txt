Sadly I think Bad Apple has taken somewhat of a turn for the worse. Recently they updated their menu, and it's just not as good as before. The burgers are a bit less interesting and the fries need some serious help. I've also recently had some not so great customer service experiences and still have no idea why they had no air condition on a 95 degree day. Beer list remains extraordinary (unless they tell you they haven't tapped something on their list yet...).
