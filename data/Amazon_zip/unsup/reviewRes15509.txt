The Presbyterian is one of the best cocktails I've ever had. It had that ginger whisky bite I love. Spectacular. And Violet Hour has large ice cubes shaped to match the glasses, which means there's very little melting and watering down of drinks over time. Very classy. So the cocktails were fantastic, but the service left something to be desired. It was a Monday night; we were seated and ordered quickly, but then our drinks took at least 20 minutes to come out. After we'd ordered a second round, we asked for the check and waited 30 minutes for it. Finally we just left cash on the table. Our server was very nice, but she either had too many tables or forgot about us. So I do not recommend Violet Hour if you're in a hurry, but I would definitely recommend it if you love a fancy mixed drink. The bar itself, in speakeasy fashion, does not have a sign outside the door. Just look for the red wall across the street from Big Star.
