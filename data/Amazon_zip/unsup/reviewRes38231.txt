I actually like deep-dish pizzas, when I feel like eating an elephant (kidding!) or when in Chicago. What a disappointment this place turned out to be. I don't deduct any stars for the long wait for table or long cooking time since that IS a part of the deep-dish pizza experience. Kinda like "you get what you ask for". But we didn't ask for the rest: -- lukewarm pizza, cold in the middle. -- crust was doughy AND flavourless, the double whammy of pizza crust sins. We suspected the pizza was undercooked because the outside of the crust was ghostly white not a hint of golden brown, and the middle was still translucent in several spots. After pointing this out to our server, she assured us that's how it suppose to look like because the water in spinach drips down and makes the dough look white. OK, but what about the ham and pineapple pizza which had the same-looking dough? -- Brave souls we were (or empty stomachs we had), we actually tried to eat the pizza. The crust was completely inedible so we had to scooped out, pull out, or scrap out the rest of the pizza. Spinach leaves were cold, cheese tasted ok but you can barely pull them (too cold!). After one piece, we've had more than enough. Left more than 3/4 of the pie behind. We are sorry to have wasted the food. The server said she was sorry that we didn't like the food BUT that's how a Giordano pizza is. The server said she was sorry
