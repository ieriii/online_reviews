THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! especially " coxinhas" . First, I am Brazilian, and coxinhas are one of the trade marks of Brazilian cuisines. These balls makes any Brazilian happy when they see them! Even better, when they are well made like the one at Fogo 2 go! Great, so happy to have a place like that close to my house! The pizzas, delicious!! everyone should go check it out!
