We ordered for delivery again and everything was perfect. My guy ordered the usual, pho with extra cilantro and even though it was an hour past lunch time, I asked if it would be okay to order a sandwich and they said OF COURSE! i ordered the porkchop sandwich with soup, eggroll, salad and ice tea. All that food for 8.95. The sandwich was colorful, ingredients tasted fresh, sweet and sour sauce was good and pork grilled to perfection. I'm going to order sandwiches from here again. I love this place. I wish we would have found it sooner!
