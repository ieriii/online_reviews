This is my favorite restaurant in the City. I initially went with one friend, but over the course of the last year and a half since i found this place, I have brought dozens of people to this place. It is the best Chinese food hands down in the City and one of the two best I have had in the country, along with a place in San Francisco. The following dishes are unbelievable and you cant go wrong with: tonys chili chicken, mongolian beef, mayonaise shrimp (don't let the name deter you), orange beef, twice cooked pork, the house special fried noodles and pan fried combination noodles are must sides for your main meal. I have never been disappointed and I make it a point to go at least once a month. And the best part is I live in River West and they deliver to me
