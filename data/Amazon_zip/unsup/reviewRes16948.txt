This is a truly fantastic restaurant. In fact, it's one of the biggest things that I miss about Chicago next to my family and the amazing concerts. It's got an overwhelmingly beautiful decor and the food is pretty yummy. I ordered the Arrachera (cooked medium) and it was juicy and flavorful, but a little overcooked so I'd suggest ordering it one side lighter than you normally would. Fish tacos were OK, not the best i've had. We also had an appetizer (forgot what it's called) with shredded beef on top of a sweet plantain. Best thing I ate that night. Dessert wasn't impressive. We had a banana creme pie that looked gray & tasted a little bland but the ice cream with chopped walnuts on top was stellar. Definitely give Carnivale a shot, just make sure to get a reservation as it gets pretty crowded.
