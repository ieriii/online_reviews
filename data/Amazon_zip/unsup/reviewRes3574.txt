hands down - 5 stars for the soeul sassy flavored wings! I'm a wing fan and could almost base my friendships on a mutual love of wings. I mean it when i say these are the biggest and best wings I've had in the city. The smell makes you crazy before you even get to the sweet, spicy taste. As for the rest of the menu I've tried the Baby Buddhu, the Big Buddha bowl and the steak bowl. While these items alone maybe warrant 3 or 4 stars, they are just decent in my opinion. Probably much healther as the buddha bowls are loaded with veggies and have an interesting flavor. I'd skip these though in favor of leaving more room for the wings. The service has been nice, and for first time deliveries they discount 10%.
