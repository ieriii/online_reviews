Great service. Good food. Cheese plate is more than sampling and it is really good. Perfect environment to talk, catch up with friends... Cozy and perfect for this coming cold weather. Just be careful you may order too much and definitely will leave smelling like food so if you are off to another place it may not be your best option :)
