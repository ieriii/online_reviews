A lot of time has passed since my last review, which was solely about the drinks and the atmosphere. I had heard about how good the food was here, so naturally, I had to suck it up and come back to see if the rumors were true. I came here for brunch with some friends. It was a gorgeous, sunny afternoon around noon and there was no wait at all, inside and outside. We sat inside and happily perused the menus. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The meal was absolutely amazing, but the gravy was a bit underwhelming and the presentation was a little gross (looked like I had a plate of beige vomit?) .... but the biscuits were stellar and the flavors were there. I guess there might not be a pretty way to present b&g, but at least the biscuits didn't have to come out smothered in a chunky beige mass. Now that I've made you want to stop reading this review, the food came out hot and the coffee I had was strong and much needed. I forgot what my friends ordered, but they were both very pleased. The service was okay here (I still feel like I get some attitude), and I left full. I definitely want to try their dinner menu, so whenever there isn't a 3 hour wait, I'll be here!
