I was a little underwhelmed by this place. I had high expectations for authentic Mexican food since it is located in Pilsen, but it was for the most part very average. We were seated right away and brought water right away, but did not have a waitress for a good 10 minutes. We did appreciate the chips and two types of salsa as well as the complimentary small tacos while we waited for her. When the waitress did finally come by she was very short and to the point, which I understand given the busy lunch rush, but a little more politeness would have been nice. The Queso con Chorizo was aaaamazing though! This appetizer definitely earned an extra star for this review. I have never had so much delicious queso and perfectly season chorizo with warm tortillas...yum! The steak and chicken tacos were average, nothing exciting. They were served with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cilantro on the side, but there was not very much cilantro. My friend had the veggie burrito and it was not very impressive either. The waitress continued to disapear for long periods of time throughout our meal and forgot to bring the drink one of my friends ordered. And our water's were never refilled. And the bathrooms are disgusting re: dirty with toilet paper roll on the floor. Definitely, a good cheap, place to get some local flavor, but I don't know if I'll be back.
