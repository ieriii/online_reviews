I like the concept of a diverse and comfortable breafasty place. We went about a month ago on a weekend and waited about 20 minutes for a table. Place was hoppin. The food was quite good and the overall experience good enough to have me return. I just wish there was a place like YOLK closer to my Near North Condo. GOOD NEWS! They are adding a new location at Wells and Chicago. Hope to see it open later this summer!
