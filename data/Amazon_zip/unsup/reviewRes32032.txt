Of the five of us, only Bryan and I have tried Ethiopian before and we are by no means experts so we took the easy way out and went Family Style all the way and let the chef pick out some chicken, beef, lamb, seafood and vegetarian dishes for us. It was delicious and thankfully no one was freaked out by all of the sharing. Of the three places we've tried in Chicago (Ethiopian Diamond II, Ras Dashen and now Demera), I have to say Demera was by far my favorite in ambiance. It was bright and clean with lots of windows and minimal decor. The other two were much darker and more intimate but for a Sunday afternoon, this was perfect. The food at all three were fabulous, I have to say this might be my favorite of the three though. The vegetarian among us loved everything he tried too. Surprisingly, I think all of the meat eaters loved the veggie dishes the best anyways. All of us loved the beets, shockingly. They were kind of sweet and cinnamon-y. The shrimp dish was my favorite and the sambussas we got as appetizers were TO DIE FOR. Get the tuna ones, you will not regret it. Unless you are allergic to tuna then you will probably swell up and die and then DEFINTIELY regret it. Service, well.... I'll choose to believe they didn't want to interrupt and want you to relax and enjoy yourself and socialize. That doesn't explain why it took them 20 minutes to greet us and another 15 minutes to grab some beers. Nothing really does. But they smiled a lot.
