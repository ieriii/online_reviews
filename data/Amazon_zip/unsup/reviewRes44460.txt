If you want to buy and devour a $6 pastry in front of a hipster that looks like their vegan self could benefit from the aforementioned glucose,and if you have fantasies about a film worthy library outburst, this is the place to do it. However, if you ARE a hipster, steer clear. You're skinny jeans won't fit after the pastry is consumed,and the library vibe will only remind you that you studied five years for a degree in the Norfuk language with a minor in the history of alchemy.
