With 80+ reviews already there isn't much I can say about Pequod's that hasn't already been said.... So here is my two cents on the 'Quod's experience: Pequods has the most amazing deep dish pizza EVER!!! Yes, better than Uno's, Due's, Gino's, Malnatti's and your Momma's pie combined. They are known famously for their "burnt crust" which is cheesy, crunchy, caramelized and pretty much one of the best things I've ever tasted - I usually work my way around the outside of the pizza and snack on it alone. Good sauce to cheese/ingredients ratio and the sauce itself is also tangy, chunky and delish. Just one side note... if you don't dig the deep dish so much and prefer a thin-crust DO NOT GO HERE. I've had to learn several times through trial and (really bad) error that Pequod's can't do thin crust. The dough is really not thin and tastes like Play-Doh - no really, I used to eat it as a kid so I know... I'm not sure how they can do one thing so good and the other so bad, but, my Daddy always says... it's better to be really great at one thing than mediocre at a bunch of things, so stick to whatcha know. Well said!
