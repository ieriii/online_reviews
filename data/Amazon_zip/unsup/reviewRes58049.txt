This is one of my favorite places in Chinatown. The food and service are above average for sure, and they recently got some new, more modern decor! I always order the Fish fillet with chili bean sauce, and Mongolian Beef, which is always a good combination with rice! But, when I ate there recently, I noticed that the food did not taste the same as the last time and it was missing a certain zing. Perhaps it's just of their chefs cooking it, but I could still taste a difference. Comfortable place to just relax and look out the window (not much of a view) and chat with whoever you're with! Also, I just remembered, that I ordered a smoothie from there once but I wouldn't recommend it. I felt a few ice chunks and had a hard time sucking it through the straw because the smoothie wasn't smooth enough. I can't even remember what I ordered because all I tasted was ice and a bit of sourness but it was either mango or pineapple. I'd just get it from Joy Yee's or somewhere better if I had a choice.
