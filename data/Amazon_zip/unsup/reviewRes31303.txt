I'll be honest. As a meat love, vegan food scares me. So when my friend, with whom I was planning lunch, announced that she had gone vegan, my response was along the lines of, ".........er........um.......ok? Fortunately, when it comes to food, I am adventurous. So, I threw caution..., and meat, to the wind. Chicago Diner was the decided upon establishment and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I had the karma burger which was a curried tofu patty with avocado, cheeze, and some sort of mango based relish sauce. The whole thing was pretty yummy especially with a side of sweet potato fries. My friend seemed to enjoy her "meat" ball sub as well.  As a non-vegetarian, I suppose I am not really allowed to comment, but I suppose I would have liked to see more dishes incorporating beans and un-disguised tofu as opposed to faux meats. The abundance of "meat" just reinforces the idea that vegan and vegetarian food is only a weak imitation of the good stuff. Even as a meat lover, I know that that doesn't have to be the case.
