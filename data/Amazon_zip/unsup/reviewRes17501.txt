There's nothing I LOVE more then having my food available immediately upon arrival, especially when I am extremely hungry. India house does a beautiful lunch buffet with a variety of meats and vegetarian options. Although you are able to still order from the dinner menu, there's a good chance you'll find what you want at the buffet. I love chicken makhani, but today they had chicken masala, which is similar but more on the spicy side. I am a huge fan! Our server was always there when we needed him and was willing to answer any questions and offered suggestions. I can't wait to come back!
