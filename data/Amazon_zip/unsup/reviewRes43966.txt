Although Milk & Honey certainly doesn't need my props, I have to give them anyway...it's just THAT tasty. But I think my favorite part about frequenting M&H is that regardless of how crazy it gets (it's always a full house during brunch), the staff maintains the most kind and collective disposition; nothing seems to frazzle them. They handle the masses effortlessly. So even though the wait is never less than 45 minutes on a Sunday afternoon and I'm crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with people on either side of me, I'll take it. And did I mention that the Huevos Rancheros & Breakfast Sandwich are DELICIOUS?
