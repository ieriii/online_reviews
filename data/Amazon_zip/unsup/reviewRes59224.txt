WHAT THE DUCK????? That headline says it all. I have never been here before and heard great things about this place. If you have too DON'T BELIEVE IT! This was bar nun my worst dining experience since moving here to Chicago over 6 years ago. The worst service ever! After being seated it took over an hour to get our 1st dish (BTW- we waited 20 - 30 minutes for a table and tables were open and not being used). The other dishes arrived here and there over the next 45 minutes. The duck was decent but would pay double or triple elsewhere because of the nonexistent service. My first time here and definitely my last. My 11 year old could run this place better than the people working here.
