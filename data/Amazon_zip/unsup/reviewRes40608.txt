I live about twenty feet from this place. But I don't come here too much. Its seems to be more of a destination bar/restaurant than a neighborhood eat-here-every-day kind of place. Its a bit too pricey for that. But it is good. The burger is good, but the cheese used is a bit strong. The pork belly is a outrageously good and sweet, very comparable to the excellend seasonal pork belly of Azucar next door. I'm a bit of a pork belly afficianado (although its really hard to mess up pork belly). The duck egg-hash brown-whatever, is my very favorite. Its very fancy pantsy, but delicious, which is the only thing that counts in my book. I'm not too much of a drink snob, but I do like a good glass of wine, and they have an excellent, excellent wine list. Nice place if you want to upgrade your meal a little, the owner and wait staff seem very nice. This place is busy (its killing the local parking), so its kind of crowded, and its very dark for some reason, but they do a good job managing the space, food comes out fairly rapidly. I feel sort of too working class when I look around the crowd. It skews towards bucktown-wicker/lincoln parkers and wealthier hipsters/yupsters, but I then again I'm may be getting crotchety in my old age. I'm sort of nostalgic for awful emptiness of the Wind's (the previous bar in this space) sometimes, but hey the product is good here, and given that, I can live with the crowd.
