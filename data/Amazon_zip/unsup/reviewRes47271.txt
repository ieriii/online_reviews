On the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, we were finally able to check out this place on their infamous half-off burger Tuesdays. To note, their Warden, Buffalo Bill and flight of burgers are not included in this deal.  No worries, there are plenty of other burger options. I had the Possession of Shrooms which was a nice amount of mushrooms, and lightly smothered goat cheese on the burger. I like how they didn't over abundantly fill the burger with mushrooms, making for a messy meal. Burger was nicely seasoned, fries had nice crunchy exterior with soft interior. They didn't have a honey mustard option but the replacement for it was so much better. Ask for the maple vinaigrette and you will be happy that your fries have such a great alternative!!!!! Dinner mate ordered the Buffalo Bill. Said it was decent, like a burger should be with bacon and an egg. But he was blown away by the Make it Yourself Mac and Cheese which his creation included bacon, carnitas, carmelized onions, chorizo, and a happily earned heart attack on the side. The bacon retained it's crunchiness, while rest of the ingredients merried well together for an epitome of mac and cheeses To go, I took the Conjugal Visit home to the bf. (wow, that's a perfect description)  To put it MODESTLY, it's a holiday turkey dinner all wrapped up in a bun. Be prepared for some good snoozing after devouring into this (from the burger, not the s*x) Linda was our server, and she was very sweet and PROMPT, even with both the dining area and outside area packed. That's a sign of professional under pressure! FYI- Thursdays are half off mac and cheese creations!!!
