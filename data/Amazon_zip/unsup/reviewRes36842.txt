I went to Meli Cafe for breakfast this morning with a couple of friends who were in from out of town. We were seated right away, but it was still pretty busy for being before 9am on a Sunday morning. When we got our food, I could see why! The menu had so many breakfast options...it was unbelievable. Each of our omelets were delicious and the food came out really quickly. However, the reason I'm not giving Meli 5 stars is because of the service. Our waitress was the biggest snob! At one point, she actually rolled her eyes at my friend because he couldn't hear what she was saying. Other reviewers seem to have had good service, so perhaps it's just this one waitress, but she needs a serious attitude adjustment. Other than that, the experience was great!
