I am a graduate student at DePaul University that rather has any time to unwind. I really let my hair down at the Apple on Saturday. They have the most amazing and diverse characters employed here. The staff was very attentive and I felt like I know them forever. I had 3 amazing drinks; I tried pumkin and sour cherry beer. The bar is classical decorated. It reminds me of the Sugar Shack in New York. There was a great vibe and aura. But the best thing by far was the music. It was a mixture of hip hop and alternative rock.This place is bad ass!
