What an awesome brewery. I've tried three beers ("cross of gold" mild ale, IPA, and a seasonal house porter) at the brewery itself, and sampled an excellent Belgian pale ale on special at Hopleaf. All have been phenomenal; the mild ale is refreshing with a perfect amount of malt, the IPA has subtle floral/citrus notes and is hoppy without remotely tasting of bong water, and the rich smokiness of the porter warmed me up on a cold winter night. This definitely gives Piece a run for its money for the best house-brewed beer at a Chicago restaurant (and probably surpasses it). I've personally never eaten here, so I can't judge the food. The hipster vibe is omnipresent (flannel and unwashed beards abound), which I personally find amusing, but be forewarned if you're put off by questionably washed beards. Stay away if you must - more beer for me!
