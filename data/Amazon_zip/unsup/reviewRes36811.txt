We often get take out from here and do a mix of rolls and Thai. My favorites - the crazy basil fried rice and the smoked chilli combo (chicken and shrimp), especially the second, which we discovered by accident. The flavors are really good and the serving size is pretty generous too. For the sushi - the blue crab roll, the santana, shrimp tempura and the spicy tuna are pretty good. I gave this place four stars over three because we keep going back for more. I would have given it three stars for eating in though as it is a bit too packed for my liking.
