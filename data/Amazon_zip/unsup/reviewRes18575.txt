The choriqueso gets all the attention as one of Chicago's best sandwiches, but it's the ahogada that I enjoyed the most. It's a sandwich in a bowl, which means you're guaranteed some dipping action. The sandwiches aren't very large, so if you have an appetite, you'll want to get chips with their amazing guacamole. Xoco is a really small restaurant, and you'll probably have to wait a little while to get your food. The line strings along in front of the openly exposed kitchen prep area, allowing you to watch the cooks in action while you mull over your chalkboard of menu options.  I was pleasantly surprised by the local beer options they had lined up too, nearly all coming from either Illinois or Wisconsin breweries. Note that some of the meals (like the aforementioned Ahogada) are only available if you eat at the restaurant, not take-out. The food is creative and distinctively delicious, making it well worth the wait.
