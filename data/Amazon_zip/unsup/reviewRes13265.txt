Poorly executed Fish with Pretzel "crust" the pretzel was not crunch at all, more like damp is the only way I can describe it. I never send food back, but this time I just couldn't see paying $20 for bland fish. The apps were decent, the cornbread bacony sressing type thing we had was really good. Mussels were oily, broth was ok. No need for me to go again.
