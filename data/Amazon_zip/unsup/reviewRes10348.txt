A few tips when coming to Piece: 1. Bring your hearing aid. Noise level is extremely energetic! 2. Don't expect a lot of table space. Pizza comes out on those large, rectangular baking pans! :op 3. If you're driving, plan on circling around looking for parking for a while. 4. Consider dessert at Hot Chocolate a few blocks away! :oD 5. Feel compelled to order an appetizer? Try the guacamole.  6. Get your stomach ready for some trippin' thin crust pizza. It outsells the deep dish stuff 3 to 1, after all.
