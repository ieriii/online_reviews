Probably..no wait...for sure the best Italian food with the best deal your going to find in Chicago. My dad has been going here since he was very young, and got me hooked on it too. Everything about this place is amazing....what other restaurant gives soup/salad/cheesy bread/bruchetta/AND a fresh fruit plate with your entree??? I think NONE! But please mistake me if i'm wrong! Come on weds for half price lobster night ....mhhhh and don't forget to order baked Alaska 45 min before....amazing!!!!
