Came here on a Friday morning at 11am, about 15min wait. A few minutes later, the line was already at the end of the block. Awesome buffalo sausage, foie gras sausage and rabbit. Always go for the specials, a tip I heard from a regular. French fries fried in duck fat was great too but not too distinct. Leftover was still great after 5 hrs. You'll encounter idiots smoking in line, friends letting friends cut in front of them and just the daily annoying stuff. Also you cannot save your table until after you order, so if you have a big party, you can forget sitting inside or together. Do not go here if you have to be somewhere in 2hrs. Staff are very friendly and accommodating...patience, patience, patience. You come for the experience..
