The food is not bad, just very very pricey...$3.50 for ONE pancake???? Definately not a place to take my three kids for breakfast. However, I do make it in maybe once every month or so to get their baked chiliquiles, which are awesome and unlike anything I've ever before. Portions are kind of small, considering its a $12 breakfast. Pretty restaurant.
