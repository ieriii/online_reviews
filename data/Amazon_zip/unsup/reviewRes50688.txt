I've been to Wishbone lots of times for breakfast and I'm always really excited to have their cheese grits and eggs benedict. I had never been for lunch until yesterday. We were sat instantly which is good, but ended up in the back all by ourselves. I don't know, It just felt kinda weird sitting back there alone like we were banished from the rest of the crowd. I had a soup and salad combo. The soup was seafood chowder. It was ok, but had a lot of large chunks of regular fish and not seafood. It was a little weird, but I didn't realize I didn't like it until my boyfriend asked if I did and after telling him what I didn't like about it.... I realized there wasn't much I did like about it. If that makes any sense. Yarg. Anyhow, I also had a side of mac n cheese which was kinda bland and dry. Not so good. The service was alright, not overly friendly, but average. He refilled drinks quickly, but left the check right after he brought out the food. He said, "no rush, but..." and we took that to mean he was done waiting on us. So I'll stick with breakfast on this one. I wouldn't recommend lunch though.
