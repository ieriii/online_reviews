We went here with my family for dinner and I can't say I had the best time. Maybe it is because my mother and boyfriend always HAVE to eat meat at every meal even though my sister, husband and I are vegetarian. It is just sad to go to a restaurant that serves things family style and not order things other people can share with you. The food we did get was in my opinion just ok. I ordered a hot pot which I would have appreciated some help from the waiter in deciding what to order along with it and the best way to eat it. Also we ordered the cold vegetarian chicken appetizer which came about ten minutes after we finished our entrees. It was very good but we were too full to even eat it. So we had our leftovers packaged to go and realized the next morning they did not even give us our extra rice.  Maybe I will try again just my husband and I (because their menu is completely huge and very yummy looking). I really wanted to try the spicy eggplant.  On the "vegetarian" menu though items with shrimp and pork were included. Watch out.
