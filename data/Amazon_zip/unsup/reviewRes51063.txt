My husband and I were dropping off some clothes at Brown Elephant and decided to stop and grab brunch in Andersonville. We figured we'd try out Big Jones. The decor was right up my alley. I loved the green wallpaper and the cute tables. Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. We started with the fried green tomatoes and the crawfish fritters. Both of these appetizers were totally delicious. Perhaps the level of the starters set the bar too high for the entrees. I had the grilled andouille and eggs. The andouille sausage was very hearty and slightly spicy. The eggs were cooked perfectly too but the hominy was not my thing. I guess I've never really had hominy before but it was very bland and just kind of meh. I would have rather had some cheesy grits. My husband had the butchers breakfast which came with eggs, grits, some greens and chaudin (pork liver sausage). It was decent but nothing too outstanding. Also, our bill for brunch came to 55. Kind of pricey for brunch, granted we did get some appetizers. The appetizers were delicious though!!
