Went here last night with my wife, got a last minute reservation 1/2 hour before we wanted to eat. Busy, happening, good pulse but not crowed. Very classy and well appointed inside.We're vegetarians and we found some good eats! Beers on tap were fantastic I got a dark rich porter (so good I got 2) wife got an amber and that tasted great too. The we got a pickle and olive starter (great), grilled beat starter (fresh) salad and a risotto entree. It was an outstanding evening.Next time I'm downtown, I'll try again.
