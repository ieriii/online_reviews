THE BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN CHICAGO. Yes, there will probably be a line. Yes, the pizza takes about 45 minutes - 1 hour to cook. But it's sooooo worth it. The cornmeal crust is killer. I drool over crumbled sausage. Thankfully they now have the capability to deliver NATIONALLY (which works well for me since I've moved to LA). http://www.featuredfoods - you can also get food from Edwardo's and Ed Debebic's. My Chicago peeps were so happy when I got my Gino's shipment. It was a joyous day.
