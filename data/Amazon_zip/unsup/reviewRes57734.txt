My husband and I were staying down the street at Hotel Indigo and asked for a recommendation for something close by for a late lunch. It was great! I had the curried chicken salad sandwich and my husband had the Cobb salad. Both were fresh and tasty, and best of all - served quickly! The staff was super friendly. The space is bright and inviting. It has that neighborhood place kind of feeling. We liked it so much we went back for breakfast the next morning. Great applewood smoked bacon. Terrific lox and bagel plate. I wish it was next to home - I would go all of the time!
