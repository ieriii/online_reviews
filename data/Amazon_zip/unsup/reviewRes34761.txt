First things first. If you love middle-eastern food that is unbelievable, inexpensive, and um, well, better than most of the food I had when I was in the middle-east, look no further. Everyone knows this place rules. Now you do too. The only downside is the unfriendly staff who barely even look at or acknowledge customers. Good thing you just order and pay at the counter. Regardless, this is one of my favorite restaurants and can be cheaper than eating at home. I highly recommend the falafel sandwich, egg + cheese pie, and the marinated brussel sprouts located at the salad bar (believe me on this one). Best middle-eastern food in Chicago, some of the best in the world..
