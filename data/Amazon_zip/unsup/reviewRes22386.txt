A few opening goodies about this place: it's BYOB and has oatmeal milkshakes. The first is awesome no matter what. The second sounds odd but is delicious. Now for other things. I went here as part of a Grubwithus, so I'm not sure if what we had is typically on the menu. I just remember the veggie paella above all else. Very peppery, which I loved, and outstanding. Everything about my experience there was great, from the presentation to the food to the great looking waiter who served us. Hey, I believe in the all-encompassing review :)
