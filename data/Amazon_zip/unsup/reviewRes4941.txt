Chicago is truly the city for the epicure enthusiasts . And The Purple Pig did NOT disappoint. The menu is ideal for the adventurous. No really, if foie gras makes your face pinch up, than its best you go some where else. WIth that being said, for you brave foodies, try the Bone Marrow, Milk Braised Pork shoulder, and Bacon Fat Pork Belly. Pass on the Pig's Ear ( tasted identical to fried onions crisp in a can) and the bread pudding ( Nia's is WAY better. Probably THE BEST in the world). To sum it up, If The Pig and The Goat had a fight. My bet is on the PIG!
