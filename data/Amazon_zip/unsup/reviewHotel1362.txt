I had a lovely three night stay here. Location is right by Michigan with all the designer shops. Service was top notch and efficient. We had the one bedroom suite which came with a living room. The bathrooms have this jet tub thing plus a rain shower. Plus I love the turndown service where they come in and turn down the sheets and leave chocolates on your bedside table. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and always greeted us. My only complaint would be it was a little hard to control the temperature setting in our room (it was either a bit too cold or too warm). I would definitely stay here again.
