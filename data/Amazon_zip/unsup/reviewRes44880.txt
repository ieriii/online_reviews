There is nothing like it! G's pizza is a must. After living in Chicago, I became hooked. The crust is amazing, sauce is robust, and glorious cheese is the stuff that italians dream about at night. Though we live in TX now, we've discovered that G's delivers with their ready bake version. Be prepared to drop $30 or more, but it's worth every penny. Come hungry!
