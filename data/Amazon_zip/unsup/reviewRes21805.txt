This is my neighborhood standby whenever I can't think of where to go for dinner. The food is delicious and the ingredients seem to be a bit higher quality than many comparable Mexican restaurants. While everything I've had is tasty, I highly recommend the Mar y Tierra - a surf n' turf with incredibly seasoned skirt steak and tequila lime shrimp. If given a choice, I usually prefer the corn tortillas over the flour ones. As other reviewers have mentioned, the service at Mayan Palace is great and the staff are extremely friendly. There is not a lot of space in the restaurant, and the tables can feel a bit cramped. It can get especially crowded on Tuesdays and Thursdays for half-price house margaritas. In the summer they open the back patio which provides a ton more seating, even if it feels like you're eating in someone's backyard. This is definitely a place to go for the food and friendliness, not necessarily ambiance.
