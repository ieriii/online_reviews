I would brave the cold for Doug. And I have. Because the line is always out the door when I get there. And this is Chicago so we all know what the winters are like. After you get in through the 2 sets of doors though, the always friendly Doug takes your order, chats for a bit and then you're good to go. The waitstaff are friendly and attentive - helping people get tables as soon as they pop up. I've been there enough times and they take the time to learn names so they no longer have to call out to find me when my order's ready too. So people = good.  The decor is eclectic and fun. And appropriate! Hot dog imagery abounds in a kitschy way. The names of the hot dogs on the menu make me laugh. The music is played at a good level and is always of good taste or at least to my liking (usually rock/rockabilly/punk/seasonal). Ambience = good. So that's my review. Oh, wait? I guess I forgot the food. Riiigggggghhhhhht. Doug is a culinary genius of encased meats. One February I asked him what he had on Valentines day and he said he made his girlfriend some lobster. It wasn't until I got home that it even occurred to me that he didn't say lobster sausage. That was how I pictured it when he said it. I don't normally get the regular menu items (besides tator tots that I don't believe are actually on the menu as their own thing). I always go for a specialty dog (that I look up on their website beforehand). They are awesome.  Be adventurous! Various types of meat, decadent toppings, menu changes every week so you can always try something new. Sometimes I think there are too many toppings for the sausage (i.e. surely there is no way he is THAT generous), but everything always tastes well-balanced. I like the creamy sauces for the most part, anything labelled "atomic" hits you slowly. My favorite encased meats are the crayfish-pork mix or the teuben. My only complaint is actually about newbies... don't loiter when you're done eating. Those seats are prime real estate.
