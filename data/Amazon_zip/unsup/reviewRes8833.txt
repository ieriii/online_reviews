The only reason Noon O Kabab gets four stars and not five is because there is better in LA and Vancouver, but for Chicago this place rocks.  I had the Sultani, but I thing the Barg and Joojeh Kabob were the standouts. The Kashk e Bademjan was awesome, but the Koobideh was just ok and is the only thing I think is better at Reza's. This place is also kind of a schlep but well worth it.  If I was living in Chicago and people asked where to go for Persian this is def where I would direct them. I can't wait to get back for some more!
