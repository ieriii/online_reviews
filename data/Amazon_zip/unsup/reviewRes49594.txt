We were here last night, after a failed attempt to get into the House of Blues (okay, that was my fault, I'd forgotten my id, but it's not like we're pointing fingers here or anything). All I can say is, the evening was eventful. Mostly because of things that had nothing to do with the place itself. I mean, the South American wine flight was wonderful, and the cheese plate wasn't bad either. Our waiter was either having a bad day or was just blessed with a naturally vitriolic tongue (okay, again, I admit here that I may have been egging him on a little), but the highlights were when my friend soaked the front of my tan skirt with red wine, smashing the glass simultaneously. Oh, and when we finally went outside to discover that our car had been towed. Good times at their finest.
