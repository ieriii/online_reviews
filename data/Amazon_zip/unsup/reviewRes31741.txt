Client dinner and wow what a treat. Food was absolutely fantastic. Shu Mai, Dynamite Roll, Salmon Sashimi, Chilean Sea Bass and the random treat that Kevin the assistant manager brought over just to be nice were all fantastic. Wait staff were all extremely attentive but never overly so. Food tasted fresh and not heavy, just...delicious. Will definitely recommend and return.
