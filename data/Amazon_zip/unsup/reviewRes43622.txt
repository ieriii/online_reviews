Awesome. Went with 5 friends and we had a great time. Steaks were perfectly done, as were the meals of folks who got non-steak items. Ask for George to be your server - he was incredibly helpful, and gave us GREAT tips on what to do in Chicago (we were first time tourists, new to the city). Paul, who was bartending at the time, was also great and helped make our meal really enjoyable. Don't go to Morton's or any other chain for a Chicago steak - definitely go to Kinzie's
