We made a reservation for this place over the weekend and showed up on a very busy time. They gave a great table right away which was surprising given how busy they were. We have been several times and you have to understand that The Gage will always be a louder boisterous kind of place so be prepared for that. However the food and service are great.  Our waiters have consistently been great making excellent recommendations and providing quick service. The Gage has great food like the Mussels and the Fish and Chips. We are fast becoming regulars here.
