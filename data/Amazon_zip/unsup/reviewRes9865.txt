We visited Piccolo Sogno my sister's law graduation and it was a great choice for a celebratory dinner! Space - I know this is redundant from other reviews, but the outdoor patio is absolutely great! I couldn't write a review without mentioning it, and I can't think of any in Chicago that compare. It is spacious but busy and perfect for the summer time.  Food - Call me crazy, but I don't really LOVE old school Italian that is big on heavy tomato or creamy sauces so Piccolo Sogno is perfect for me. Our table started with antipasto, pizza and salads, all which everyone liked. For my entree, I ordered the salmon, which I enjoyed very much. I don't love broccolini and they let me sub it for another veggie. Bonus points for easy substitution! The roasted fingerling potatoes were perfect -- not too greasy but still tasty. They inspired me to make my own potatoes at home! Service - Service was on par! I have no complaints. They were helpful and attentive. I will definitely be returning to Piccolo Sogno for a girl's night this summer!
