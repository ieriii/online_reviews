We went there tonight (Tues) for fried chicken night. I got the fried chicken and it was quite good and juicy and the skin was to die for. The mashed taters were kinda plain though and couldn't eat the super-spicy greens. The hubby got the skirt steak and it was really a SMALL portion and cost $23. Outrageous. He got a couple fried hearts of palm with it and super-spicy green beans. My chicken cost $21... again, outrageous. We did get very yummy cornbread before the meal though and ordered overpriced fried cheese croquets. The bill was insane but I really wanted to try the chicken cuz I read about it in Bon Appetit as one of the top places to get fried chicken in the U.S. The service was wonderful and we got a great window seat. Doubt we'll go back though.
