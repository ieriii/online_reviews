A great late night BBQ place. It's also a great post drinking/clubbing/barhopping snack place. Comes with a TON of side dishes. Do not expect great service but do expect a fun group experience (especially if you opt to grill on the table). This place is not for the picky eater or someone not used to oriental tastes/cuisine.
