One of my for sure best in Chicago, I'm surprised that I haven't written a review about this place yet, but I did for all the other restaurants I've visited! Ok, so my favorite that I suggest to everyone is the Chocolate Morsel pancakes. I rave about them to all my friends who plan on visiting Chicago and it's never a miss. I highly highly recommend them to anyone. If you're reading this, try it! As for the non-sweets, try any of the omelets, you really can't lose. My most recent experiment was the salmon omelet, and it's a win. The decor is great! girls call it cute. It's a very homey type feel to it. Love this place!
