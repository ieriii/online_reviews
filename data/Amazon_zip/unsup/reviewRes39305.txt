My husband and I went on a Saturday morning so expect to wait for this delicious food. They don't take reservations unless you are staying at their inn. We were told it was an hour wait for a table but had nothing to attend to so decided we'd wait. We were seated within 20 - 30 minutes. Very happy about this, considering the popularity of this locale. You are able to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink while you wait. Food: Limited menu but for good reason. They pack such wonderful dishes and put much thought into each one. Five stars for the chef. I had the burger with egg on top. Literally, the best burger I've had in Chicago. My husband had the crab benedict with potatoes. He fully enjoyed it as well.  Service: Bartenders and staff are friendly. The restaurant is small for the number of patrons they handle. I wouldn't change a thing about this though, it makes the place unique. Because this place is so busy you need to make it clear the two or three times you have your waitress exactly what you want to order. He/she is constantly busy and may forget something if you don't communicate what you want at the beginning of your order. Not sure how this can be fixed but I guess it's expected from a place that serves great food at a reasonable price.
