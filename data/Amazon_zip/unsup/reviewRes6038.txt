Waitstaff on the two occasions I have been here were excellent. Both times I had the Char Crusted Rib Eye (29$) medium rare, and both times the steak was delicious, juicy and flavorful. My friends had the filet mignon (26$) and they found it to be wonderful as well. We also had a small spinach salad, which we split among the three of us (salad is served family style). We tried the lemon merengue pie and the fruit (blackberry, strawberry, etc. dish with condensed milk and a crumbled cookie, and I thought it was the latter was delicious. The decor is great as it is designed to be a 1940's dinner club. Open kitchen (more or less) and a center area for group dining. The dress "can" be casual, as opposed to some of the more upscale/pricer steak houses in the river north/loop area. I'd come back again.
