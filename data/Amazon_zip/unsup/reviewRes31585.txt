this place is dark and sexy - perfect for a romantic date. however, the food wasn't as great as the ambiance and service. went for bf's bday - seated immediately, although we arrived 10 min early. his martini shaker literally has 2-3 drinks in it. shrimp cocktail with the most enormous shrimp i had ever seen, and delicious with the cocktail sauce. wedge salad still excellent. however, his steak was medium rare and seasoned well although not perfectly. i tried crab cake and gnocci as my main - gnocci were absolutely fantastic, but the crabcakes had some kind of herb that made that inedible. the gorgonzola mac and cheese was a little dry and not as rich as i had hoped either. mashed potatoes pretty good. by the end of dinner we were too stuffed to even try dessert. our server was extremely attentive the entire night, and gave us our first round of drinks for free. one other thing - they have this gimmick with "400 degree" plates - be careful you don't lean towards them when they serve the sides, or you may get splattered with sizzling oil food was pretty good overall, but not sure if it was worth the price (~$300 including tip). still the best ambiance of any place in the city.
