I should really stop trying to eat Middle Eastern food in Chicago. I'm either hopelessly spoiled by Pita Inn, or hopelessly biased towards Pita Inn; regardless of the etiology, I end up comparing what I'm eating to Pita Inn, and it ends up losing by a mile. Though I had expectations to the contrary, my experience at Sultan's Market was comparable. I went with the hummus and chicken shwarma entree. It was not terrible, though it had flaws; the hummus was far too loosely held together, and not the most flavorful. The shwarma was significantly better, though it could have been a little more moist. Pita bread was fresh though bagged. I sprung for an extra falafel, which was probably the highlight; fried to a delicious crisp but not remotely greasy, and thoroughly seasoned on the inside. I'll probably get falafel the next time I come here. Service is friendly, and pricing is low (all that above food was under $10). All in all, this is a serviceable option for Middle Eastern food in Chicago, but by no means is it anything to write home about. Guess I'll have to follow my Jewish heritage and make the most of the (Pita Inn) diaspora...
