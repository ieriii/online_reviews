Great food, HUUUUUUGE servings. Boyfriend and I always split an entree and I still end up with leftovers. Very reasonable prices as well considering you get about 3 meals from each entree. They easily accommodated a group of 10 of us on a Friday night as well and put up with our shenanigans. This is totally a place I come back to again and again.
