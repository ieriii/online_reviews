From chips and salsa to churro and chocolate sauce xoco was a delight. The ambiance was just hip enough to say, " hey I don't wear a suit to work" yet the price was high enough to say, "I have a job." i went by myself but it's probably best to go with 2-4 people order different things and trade. More of a lunch spot which passes my "poquito mas" test (order at a register, food brought to your table and then bussed; maximum service, minimum tip). I Reccommend xoco to chi town residents and visitors alike.
