I love heavy metal and hard rock. I love beer. I lover burgers. I love the concept of Lockdown. I dig that they didn't open just another sports bar. But Jesus Christ, turn the f'ing volume DOWN. I play in a band that likes to play really loud, but what I experienced in Lockdown one night last week was ridiculous. They were showing a live Whitesnake concert and every time Dave Coverdale hit one of his high notes, it felt like someone was taking a drill to my ear drum. I was really looking forward to trying one of their self proclaimed "best burgers in Chicago" but we ended up slamming our beers and heading over to the Beetle so we could actually carry on a conversation. I felt bad for the staff as well - no one had ear plugs. At the volume last night, they'll all develop tinnitus, hearing problems, etc in very short order. Our waitress was very nice - I asked her about the volume - she agreed it was ridiculous. We all had a hard time hearing even when screaming at each other.From the other reviews, it doesn't appear to be this loud all the time. But be forewarned that it could be uncomfortably loud. If you go, bring earplugs (seriously) and be prepared not to be able to talk/socialize unless you know sign language or can read lips. All the cool things at the bar were negated by the volume. This is a place I really want to like...maybe I'll go again and if so I'll be sure to post a follow up.
