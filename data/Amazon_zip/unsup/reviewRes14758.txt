This place is a great spot for beer and food. I have had pizzas, salads, the cheddar ale soup, and the bacon popcorn. ALL amazing. The mashed potatoes are also delicious. Creamy and fantastic. Definitely get there early, if you can, because there will be a wait in the evenings. I've gotten there at 5:30 on a Friday and was seated right away, but it didn't take long for the table to fill up. This is a great place to eat, drink, and people watch!
