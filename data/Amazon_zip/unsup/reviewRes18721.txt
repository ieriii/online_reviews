Ok, so I had visited this place a while back and cant understand why I forgot to review it , given it was awesome. Well, I was back in town and visited Caro Mio again on a Friday with a group of friends and once again it rocked! The service was impressive and the food was delicious. We ordered the appetizer special of bruchetta with fresh mozzarella, which was very fresh and tasty. I ordered the asiago gnocchi special in a tomato cream sauce which was out of this world! I think I dreamt about my leftovers that night. Friends ordered the tortellini fra diavalo with shrimp and another the chicken parm, which were both pretty amazing. One friend did order a seafood pasta dish with garlic, wine and olive oil which was just okay, lacked some flavor. Dessert options were limited but proved to be a nice a chocolate fix, ordering the tartuffo and chocolate souffle. Overall, I had an excellent experience and have added Caro Mio onto my list of favorites! You should definitely check them out, excellent food, quality service, healthy portions and of course given this recession, definitely affordable. Plus, its BYOB!
