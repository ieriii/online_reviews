I went here for the first time on Wednesday night. I'd have to say, I'll definitely be back. Showed up around 10pm and scored a nice booth with a perfect view of the stage. We saw ALFONSO PONTICELLI and SWING GITAN, which I have to add was incredible. They are there usually every Wednesday. Definitely a must see! All in all, it made for a great date night and I'm definitely going to make this a once a month kind of relationship. Next time I'm going to go on Sunday for the poetry slam!
