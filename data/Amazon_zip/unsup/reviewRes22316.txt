Superdawg is a special place. The Hot Dogs are extremely beefy. Superdawg is one of the few places in Chicago that is able to serve an extremely high quality dog while at the same circumventing Vienna Beef. They make their own dogs here and they are glorious. Despite the hype, this is a must stop for tube steak lovers.
