Well I really cant write much of a review since I never got in. I walked in with my family and asked the gentleman how long was the wait he answered me with an attitude WHAT. I asked him again how long was the wait he responded me back same attitude one hour and twenty minutes. So to wrap things up its just not worth it. It seems that the popularity got to their head or at least his head. You lost me as a potential customer.
