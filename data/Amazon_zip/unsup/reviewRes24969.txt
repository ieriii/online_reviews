I could not ask for anything more. If you don't want a huge meal like the other surround Greek Town restaurants offer, this adorable cafe is perfect. The interior is of homey wood and brick with front windows that open up wide of the sidewalk. Everyone was purchasing a cold coffee drink, so I'm guessing their coffee specialties are great. The rest of the menu had a mix of Italian, French and, go figure, Greek items. I loved my Tequila Pollo sandwich, the avocado with spread was delicious. The sandwich came with a tasty side of pasta salad or potato salad (I can't tell you which one was better because they both were good). I had to give in to trying their homemade pastries. My mouth was watering after biting into the Espresso Tart!  Strange addition: They have the BEST SMELLING bathrooms in the city!
