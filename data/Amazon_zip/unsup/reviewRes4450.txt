I love this place, especially on Sunday nights (Kimberly Gordon trio- holla!). So completely Chicago. $5 sparkling wine splits, awesome vintage jukebox. People complaining that the owners "shush" the crowd should go elsewhere. They only do that during live jazz performances out of respect to both the performers & the people who are actually there to appreciate the music. It's a small, intimate space, so if people carry on loud conversations, it carries throughout the place. They take breaks in between sets, & of course you can yap all you want to once the performer is all done. It gets way too crowded on Saturdays. Stick to weeknights & Sundays if you'd like to be comfortable.
