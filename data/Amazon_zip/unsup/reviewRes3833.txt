We really-really-really need more Korean food outside of Koreatown. I personally am not one to correlate supposed "authenticity" with pleasurability of food. I would guess that, like many other ethnic restaurants in Lakeview, there is a good deal of fusion going on here--but whatever Crisp is making, it is damned good. This is one of those places where the first thing you get ends up sticking with you and so every time you go back you can't help but get it again and again, even though other things sound similarly tantalizing. This is me and the Buddha Bowl (ie bibimbap) with bulgogi (marinated beef). I especially love that they'll give me extra gochujang (hot sauce), as I am an utter addict. At some point I will have to try the chicken, as per other reviews here. Other perks: a huge selection of beverage options, from the mundane (canned sodas) to the less so (some of the weirder flavors of Vitamin Water) to the outright extraterrestrial (Asian drinks with non-English labels.) Very nice counter staff. Fast fricking service and it's clearly made to order. One star off because there have been a couple of times that I've ordered only to find that their credit card system was down and they were going cash only--one of these times, after I had placed my order. I'm not a person to carry cash, in general, so I had to awkwardly run across the street and get cashback at CVS. They were cool about it, though.
