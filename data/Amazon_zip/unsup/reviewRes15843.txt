Last night was my second time back to Carnivale. First time was rather unmemorable.. if I don't Yelp it, then it was kind of blah. Last nights experience was really unexpected and great! We had a table of 8, started with a bunch of appetizers. The Ropa Vieja was succulent and amazing! Best dish of the night and I would go back solely for these. We also had the guac and tacos, both tasty. We split a few meals for the table which I would suggest. The Arrachera was spot on but the other main dishes were under-staged by the appetizers. Carnivale is a fun Spanish atmosphere, great for big groups and a perfect way to start out the night.
