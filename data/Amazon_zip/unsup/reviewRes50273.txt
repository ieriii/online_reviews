Beautiful space filled with light and truly delicious, interesting food. You're not going to find things like Ponchartrain blue crab cakes with poached eggs, popovers, and barnaise sauce at most spots in the city. Or a platter of pan-fried sweetbreads layered on top of biscuits. If you go for the more adventurous things on the menu (see above), you'll be rewarded not only by your tastebuds but also by an admiring (I think genuine) smile from your server (at least that's what happened to us, along with verbal affirmation of our "good taste"). But if that's too much for you in the morning, you have a whole menu of unique dishes like Colonial Peelcorn Oat Flour Scones, or Awendaw, Sweet Potato Pone, or even gussied up standbys like Sally Lunn French Toast. Overall great experience and I'd definitely go back.
