Selling Asian food to Americans is such an easy out. 4 stars for the wings. They're very average as far as Korean wings go, but its really hard to go wrong there. Crispy, saucy, strong flavors. Yum. If you're looking for good food, skip everything else at this establishment. Buddha bowls are basically subpar Bibimbap. Korean Burritos -- nice work on westernizing it and throwing it into a tortilla, but its just really not good food. I've been a few times and wouldn't mind going again, but only for wings.
