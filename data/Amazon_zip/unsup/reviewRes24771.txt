This place is great especially if you enjoy sitting in between two lovey dovey couples who are either awkwardly bumping elbows with you every second or on the opposite side giving you dirty looks for being too loud. The fondue is good but I'm not blown away. May give this a second try with a date next time instead of my BFF!
