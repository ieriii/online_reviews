We had the 12 course meal with the wine pairing. All the dishes were so interesting, the presentation stunning! The bite-size portion was perfect and the special dishes were one of a kind. Some things popped in the mouth, spilling out interesting flavors. The wine pairing was good at times and seemed unmatched at other times. But to be truthful, the food wasn't as tasty as I was expecting it to be. Or maybe my expectations were too high.
