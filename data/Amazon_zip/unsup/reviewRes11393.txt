Huh. So, this place was rated the fifth best pizza in Chicago or somesuch by Chicago Magazine, and we decided to try it out. Fifth best? No way. Pre-fire Pequods *owns* this place. I'd even take Lou's over it. But I digress... The atmosphere of the place kind of sucks. It's not much on decore or ambiance, and there's more than an annoying share of WP hipsters. Or wanna be hipsters. Actual hipsters I don't mind so much, but the wannabes are out of control. But I can stomach some obnoxious people in the crowd if the pizza is that good. So is it? Meh. I will say it's a solid thin crust pie. The crust is really, really good. But there were several execution problems when we were there: 1. Runny sauce. I mean, seriously? This led to: 2. Soggy middle. A cardinal pizza sin, in my book. The runny sauce definitely contributed to the soggy middle. While the rest of the crust was near perfection, the soggy middle just screams amateur and almost ruined it for me. 3. No crispy pepperoni. This might just be my personal thing, but if your oven is hot-hot-hot (as it should be to get that crust) then the pepperoni should crisp up nice. It didn't. We did have a "red" pizza... I'd love to try the white, because I am a man who loves him a white slice. However, "New Haven" style (no cheese) can pretty much shove off back east. Cheese or it ain't a pizza. New Haven style... please. Overall, it wasn't bad. I'll cut them some slack on the issues with our pie, since everyone can have a bad night. And the outer edges did show that if the kitchen were firing on all cylinders, they'd have an awesome thin crust pizza on their hands. So, I'll definitely be back--probably on a weeknight to avoid the more obnoxious of the crowd--and try one of the "white" pizzas. If you like thin crust pizza, it's worth a trip. Fifth best in Chicago? I don't think so... but not bad.
