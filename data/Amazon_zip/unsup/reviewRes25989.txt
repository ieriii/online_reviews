I've had 2 experiences with Simply It, one was dine-in and the other was delivery.. both were fantastic! First time I went was with a large group of 15 or so, they were great at accommodating our large group and the friendly service really impressed me. BYOB and very very reasonable prices, also a nice ambiance which was unexpected but definitely a pleasant surprise! Then I found out that they deliver!!! Finally I don't have to trek over to Argyle for PHO! The order arrived in approximately 1hr, everything was still hot and all properly packaged (separately.. broth from noodles from veggies, etc.) The shrimp spring rolls were AMAZING, the beef short ribs were good (tastes similar to Korean bbq), and the pho, while certainly not the best, hit the spot (and was delivered to my door! I really can't complain!) They also threw in 3 complimentary pears which I thought was really cute. The order came with a letter from the owner saying how they were struggling financially for a long time and almost had to close their doors, and how they are still struggling... please save Simply It because there really aren't a lot of good Vietnamese places in the city, and I would be so sad to see it go!
