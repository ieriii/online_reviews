first of all, to tank noodle... i just have to say in my asian accent "tank Q!" sorry, i had to do it. there is a saying that i came up with, that a vietnamese restaurant is as good as its pho. well that just means that tank noodle is a damn good vietnamese restaurant. the pho is freaking pho-tastic! if you are looking for a good pho joint, my vietnamese-blood can attest to this being as legit as it gets. the pho is comparable to the quality that you would find in little saigon in garden grove california, which is comparable to that you would find in the motherland. so that would mean that you are eating real pho without having to pay for airfare, fly for half a day, pay for a hotel, just to get a legit bowl of pho. that sounds like an awesome deal to me. pho is one of those kind of things that just warms your soul on a cold chicago evening. and tank noodle makes it a solid experience. the BYOB is simply icing on the cake, or rather... sriracha on the pho. mmmmmmmm srirachaaa...
