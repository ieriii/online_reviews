This is a review for a chicken wing shack. And it is awesome (the chicken wing shack, that is). While you can eat inside at the 3 or 4 very practical picnic-style tables, really you're here just to chow down on some good wings, not for a restaurant-style experience. Like many people, I LOVE wings, and after experiencing wings at Crisp, I'm completely ruined for your run-of-the-mill buffalo wings. I've been here 3 times and twice for take-out, and the food has been consistently amazing. After some experimenting, my vote goes for the Seoul Sassy and the Mild Buffalo wings. Get ready to be punched in the mouth with flavor! Also, note that these wings are basically full-size wings, so for the price, it's pretty great. One thing my friends have compared this place to is Great Seas, another Asian restaurant known for their Korean-style wings. I decided to go and compare, and after the amazingness of Crisp, I was left slightly disappointed. Great Seas wings are really good, and still tastier than regular buffalo wings, but they don't offer as much of a selection of flavors, and their wings are much smaller than Crisp's. Conclusion: Best wings in Chicago! (Beware of parking though!)
