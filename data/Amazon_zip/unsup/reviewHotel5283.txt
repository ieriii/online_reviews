The room I stayed in was extremely tidy, yet cozy. It had all the common items/appliances you would see in a hotel room -- hair dryer, TV, towels, small refrigerator. It was nice, nothing over the top. It was just a well kept room with a bed.The staff was very approachable. I would stay there again.
