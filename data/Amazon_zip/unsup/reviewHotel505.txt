Thanks to Chicago yelpers, we were here last week. You get a 2 rooms suite with free breakfast and free drinks at night. The breakfast is a good spread and it is the same menu everyday. You have the choice of 1 line with cooked to order omelets and biscuit with gravy or 2 lines with already made tray of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries potatoes and pancake. You can also get oatmeal, dry cold cereal, english muffin,toast, small danishes, donuts,oranges, banana, yogurt,coffee, tea, orange juice, cranberry juice or apple juice. The drinks at night is from 5:30 to 7:30 PM. The snack items are the same every night: nacho chips with salsa, peanuts, yogurt pretzels, raisins, banana chips, trail mix. and sesame sticks. The kiddis drinks every night is cherry sprite, lemonade,sweet tea or orange slices in water. The place was packed with kids. It is nice to have 2 TV sets and an extra room. It is about 6 blocks to the CTA station. You have to check in on the 5th floor. PJ Clarke is right on the property. Walgreens is down the street. Dominicks is right across the street. Close to everything but not near anything. We were down for breakfast before 8 AM and never had to wait.
