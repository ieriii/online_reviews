The two times I've dined here - once for my wedding reception, and once when my parents were in town - I've had an outstanding experience. Both times, our server went above and beyond her role. Nothing was too much trouble. It's really nice to get service like that. While it's true that there is a wait for tables, it is worth it - even if only to experience their to die for desserts. Iif desserts aren't really you're thing, you're bound to find something to please in GL's extensive and wide-ranging menu. Even the pickiest of eaters are bound to find something to please. (However, If dessert *is* your thing, be sure to check out the crme brle or the red velvet cake!)  Be warned that the meals are *massive*. If you're daunted by the menu's size or what to chose, the servers know the menu well and are happy to help with suggestions.  I noticed a couple of reviewers bitching about the fact that GL it's just a Vegas-themed Cheescake Factory/that it's owned by the same people who own the Cheescake Factory/or that it's "too touristy". I don't particularly care who owns Grand Lux, nor do I care that it's not the most refined dining choice in the city - I really like it and am happy to dine here when I get the chance.
