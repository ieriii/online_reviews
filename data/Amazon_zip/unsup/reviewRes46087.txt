If you're looking for a place to dine while on the Magnificent Mile that provides good quality and a cool decor, this is your spot. A few things to keep in mind when going. 1) The place is busy. I can't recall if they take reservations, but even so I do recall waiting 30 minutes or so to be seated. 2) The portions are HUGE. If you're a light eater, don't plan on ordering an appetizer and an entree. Besides that, I find the rest of the place great. The staff has always been personable, the decor is great (gold ceiling, great bar, and the east side of the restaurant has a great view), and the food is outstanding. I suggest the Asian Nachos. Their mixed drinks are also very good (and strong).
