I went to Icosium Kafe the other week as, like most other people, I saw it on Check, Please! We went for lunch one Thursday at the 2433 Clark location. The place is not very large with probably 10-15 tables/booths. The decor is very much along the lines of the menu with it being Mediterranean but with a heavy dose of both Turkish and Algerian themes (if that makes sense). We decided not to have anything for an appetizer but some chips were brought to our table to keep us busy until the food arrived. [Disclaimer: I like spicy food but if you don't, stay away from the red sauce they bring. If you're not used to heat, it may be too much for some people, but works well on the crepes]. Having gone with my parents, we decided to each get something different and then sample each others when it arrived. I ordered the Crepa de Roma with the Merguez as my meat selection. My mother had the Greek Crepe with Smoked Salmon and my father had the Icosium Crepe with Merguez. I'm a fan of French crepes but having tried the Algerian crepes at Icosium, I'm thinking the French might have done some good in their colonization of Africa. All three crepes tasted extremely fresh and were surprisingly light, despite taking up a good portion of the plate. One crepe will definitely suffice for lunch, but since there were three of us, we decided to give one of the sweet crepes a try for dessert. The Bananas Foster Crepe was a perfect finish to the meal. The crepe was delicious and the ice cream was refreshing. I would definitely go back to Icosium Kafe is I was in the area and in the mood for a cheap lunch. I could also see this as being a great place for a date. Easy to get to with the CTA stop out front, but we didn't have any trouble finding a meter to park at.
