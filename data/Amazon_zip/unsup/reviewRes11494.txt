WOW, I have not had such a great brunch experience in a long time! Let me make this clear though, it was the FOOD, not the restaurant itself that wowed me. First of all, it was crowded on a Monday (it was early afternoon and I thought I was the only brilliant one for coming to this place on a random week day. Nope, apparently not.) Secondly, the hostess told us to wait in one place, then a waiter shuffled us to another area... all while a table sat empty and waiting for us. I was a bit annoyed but then the red velvet pancake arrived and the annoyances were completely forgotten. OH MY GOD, sooo good. I shared one pancake (apparently you can order single pancakes) and then we each ordered an omelette. Those were deliciousss too. Coffee was Intelligentsia. Basically all around amazingness.
