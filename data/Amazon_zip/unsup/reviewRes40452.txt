I'm a big fan of this place, great food, atmosphere and service. I ordered the special of the day, which was the Chef caught bluefish driven in from somewhere on the east coast the day before. Everything we ordered was delicious, and the drinks were fun and unique. Don't bother getting a beer here... I just told the bartender my favorite spirit and he made me a great drink.
