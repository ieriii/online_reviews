I think that this place is too progressive for its own good. It quite simply is the best food I've had in 5 years. Yeah, it can be pretentious and confusing but if you have fun with it, and are prepared to relax and enjoy the food, it's spectacular! Really worth every cent and the servers and wait staff are wonderful. My choice for fine dining in Chicago.
