Went this past Saturday for the first time. Got in line at around 9:45am with 4 other friends and the line was already wrapped around the building. Was really curious to see what all the hype was all about. With five people, we had a chance to sample each other food. I personally ordered the Foie Gras and The Marty Allen. As a group we also had two orders of Duck Fat Fries. I honestly have no complaints about the food whatsoever. I savored every bite. I would say that the 45 minute wait was well worth it. Great food, Great service. This is a must try if you're in Chicago.
