A rather fun experience. All in all it was about a 4 hour meal for the 9 course menu plus a few extras. I guess that night they were shorthanded two people in the kitchen so it probably doesn't take that long normally. Dress casually, jean are fine. Chef kept commenting on how much he liked my shirt. I should have traded him for a discounted meal. Here's was we had, I don't think I missed anything. 100/person, well worth it. I was totally full and entertained by the end. "bloody mary" - amuse octopus corn chowder & popcorn quail egg ravioli in brown butter tagliatelle w/ huckleberries & liver barramundi w/ anchovies sweetbreads & gravy roe & watermelon gelee & pickled rind - probably my least favorite of the night scallop honey bourbon - shot, kitchen staff needed a short break from cooking campfire shortrib pretzel ball w/ beer cheese filling tomato? sorbet - palate cleaners celery root cake
