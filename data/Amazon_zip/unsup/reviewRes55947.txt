My extended family of 10 dined at Caro Mio last night. We were promptly seated at the time of our reservation, greeted warmly by the owner and staff, and assited with our drinks. The food, including appetizers and entres was outstanding. as was the service. Street parking was not a problem and the seating was close but not contentious. In conclusion, every dimension of a great dining experience was enjoyed. Caro Mio is now a regular spot for us. Thank you to the ownership and staff.
