Given some of the raves I've read here, I was expecting a much better experience than I had. I was hoping for a Cafe Spiaggia type of deliciousness, but ended up with food that, while authentic Italian, fell just below nearby Calo's level of deliciousness. Service was somewhat disappointing too--my date and I felt more like we were our waiter's afterthought. Overall: not bad by any means, but there are better places around to spend a night.
