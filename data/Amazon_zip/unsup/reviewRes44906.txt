Holy moley! I've had deep dish before, but never in Chicago and not quite like this. I'm just gonna put out there before I review that I prefer thin crust NY style pizza when I have a choice of pies and I am also lactose intolerant. There was a little bit of a wait, about 20 minutes or so, but I was ok with that. We were able to put in our pizza order before we got a table which was good. Now for the pie, it was truly a pie. The crust was thick and firm, the sauce was on top and the cheese was sandwiched in the middle. It was gooey and a bit too cheesy and salty for my taste, but my hubby loved it. He made me go there two nights in a row. When in Chicago, I guess. The salad I got, a Caesar, was just ok. Go for the experience.
