I have been coming to this place since it first opened, I thought it was just what the neighborhood needed and I liked talking to the owner. I recently went on vacation and upon my return I went to have dinner. OMG, I never expected to see the menu has changed completely. I can understand if you add new items to the menu or even put specials as an addition, but what I found was another restaurants menu in it's entirely. I cannot believe Albert (the owner) has to stoop this low as to take upon someone's menu . I talked to the owner and he told me that he hired a new cook. Albert, word of advice; stick to what you do best stop trying to copy what other people are doing, you had a real diamond, you used to be unique, now you are just another Cuban restaurant trying to be like all of the others. You have the veterans Bolero and Cafe Laguardia at your door step which are very similar. That is why I would go to you, now you are just like them but smaller, I will not be going back to you any time soon. VT
