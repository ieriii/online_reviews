What's my new favorite restaurants in Chicago? Shaw's Crab House! Am I upset that I've lived here for almost 3 years and just experienced their marvelous food this past week? Absolutely. The DH and I were seating at the Oyster Bar (what a great ambience!). There are a lot of options to choose from, but we started with what the restaurant is know for, their oysters. Being indecisive, we asked the waiter choose and he did a great job. They were oh so yummy that we ended up getting another round before choose our next dish - the Maryland Style Crab Cake. I was a bit taken back by the price - one crab cake is $15 - but the DH and I shared it and it was more than enough, extremely tasty and worth trying again. To my surprise, they also offer sushi. I thought I would give it a try as our waiter kept raving how good they are. We tried the shrimp tempura, to be on the safe side, and again, it was delicious. Last but not least, we had dessert, which I highly recommend the chocolate swiss cheesecake. Overall, we had a great experience at Shaw's Crab House. I highly recommend it!
