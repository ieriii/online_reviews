This place is awesome!!!  We went here after seeing it on Check Please, and I have to say, as good as their reviews were, they did not do this place justice. Its the the best old school Italian food I have ever had. They serve this amazing bread when you sit down with the best tasting Parmesan cheese that I have ever tasted. With the entrees you get salad bar. I had a steak smothered in tomato sauce and cheese and my husband had gluten free chicken Parmesan and gluten free pasta. Everything was really good. We had enough food leftover to have dinner the next day also. The prices are very reasonable.  The service was great. Next time I want to try their pizza.
