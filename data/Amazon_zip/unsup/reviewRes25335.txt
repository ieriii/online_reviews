Over rated! I don't understand the hoopla about Geja's. Con: 1) Expensive 2) Food was mediocre 3) Long wait. We had reservations & we still had to wait. 4) Place is soo dark 5) Too crowded. We were super close to people on the next table.  Pro: 1) We had a good/nice waiter. I know there are some complaints about poor service. Perhaps we lucked out? I don't get why you'd spend so much money on something mediocre. I just think this is where wannabe snobs come to eat.
