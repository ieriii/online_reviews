I was sad that my date and I had to part ways, we had lots of fun together. We had our last meal here at Coast a few weeks ago. Thank goodness for the wine and the fact that this place is BYOB because wine makes everything better. We shared some great edamame and a few rolls. The spicy tuna roll (with avocado, cucumber, and tempura crumb) and the smoked salmon roll (with avocado and cream cheese) were my favorites. Loved the dark romantic atmosphere. Service was just right. Be sure to make reservations and hopefully you will be dining here under happier circumstances.
