So excited to have another new business opening in Logan Square! Went here with a group of 6 right after work on Friday. We were able to get a table straight away as we got there right at 5pm. We tried the Eugene porter, Iron Fist Pale, and the Cross of Gold. The Eugene was rich without being too heavy. I'm not a fan of Pale Ales but, my friends enjoyed the Iron Fist. The Cross of Gold was the best by far for me - not too hoppy, drinkable, smooth and flavorful. We also had the bruschetta , bacon popcorn, working man burger, margarita pizza, and pulled pork. The duck confit bruschetta was by far the best- highly recommended. The fries were also really good. The burger was great but, huge - you'd do well just to split it between 2 people. The other food ordered was of good quality and taste but, nothing that you simply must try. Price was about $25.00 per person. Between the rich food and beers we were all ready to go to sleep by 7:30 - Will definitely be going back for some lazy Sunday afternoons but, not before a night out.
