We've gotten pizza here multiple times and it has become our favorite pizza place in Chicago.  We love the buffalo chicken pizza, the california club pizza and anything with the spicy Italian sausage on it! Yum! They also have some kind of chicken surrounded by mashed potatoes, then fried and served with hot sauce. Not sure what it's called, but it should be called "the awesome." Great staff, super friendly and fantastic prices.
