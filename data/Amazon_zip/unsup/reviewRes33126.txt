HANDS DOWN; most favorite falafel in all of chicago. not to mention their prices are awesome, too. i have never been disappointed with an order. i've had them deliver, picked up and dined in. all good experiences. love me a spinach pie to boot. mmmm writing this is making me hungry.... **cash only**
