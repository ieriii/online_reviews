A very historic looking building. I have status with Hilton so when I stayed here they upgraded me to an executive floor and a pretty large room. I tried to request a suite, but they couldn't give it to me. No matters though I was here with the wife, but I was in town for work and I'd be only at the hotel to sleep anyway. The room was spacious and there were two bathrooms, which made the morning convenient for us. The gym has pretty modern equipment and it's decent from what I can remember. I was working late a l ot of the days so I barely had time to use the gym. The hotel front desk staff and all other staff were all very friendly and hospitable. There's always Granny Smiths apples at the front desk which I can grab a couple and eat them later. I also have access to their club floor to have breakfast and end of the day cocktail hour. The view from the club floor is sweet. It overlooks Lake Michigan and you can have your breakfast and enjoy the view. This place is right by Michigan Ave so you can get to all the shops from here not to mention hop on a bus to get where you need to. My wife and I took the bus to park during the weekend when the Taste of Chicago was going on.
