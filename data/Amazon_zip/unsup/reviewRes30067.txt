Based on the reviews we opted to eat at Opart yesterday. Now, I'm no Thai food connoisseur, so let's just get that out in the open from the start. Every time I eat Thai I order the Pad See Eiw, so this time I wanted to branch out (hubby wasn't so bold.) We ordered the fried chicken won tons as an app and they were delicious! I'd go back for those. The meal-y part of the meal was a bit bland, though, I must say. Hubby ordered the Pad See Eiw, and compared to other places it was under par, skimpy on the broccoli and sauce not quite as sweet as I like. I ordered a simple baby corn/chicken dish with rice (which WAS cooked to perfection... plus.) I guess I expected the sauce for mine to have a bit more flavor, but then again like I said, I'm no Thai expert.... Our server was perfect, and the price is right so we'll probably go back someday. If I do return I'll try something different.
