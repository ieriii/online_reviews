I love this place. I love small plate concepts, I love wine, I love cozy! We stopped in Sat at 5 and was surprised how crowded it was already. But get a table pretty fast. Ordered a fun bottle of rose. When it came to the food, I wanted to order it all but we settled on the pig's ears, octopus, bone marrow and beets. The pig ear was crunchy but needed a little more heat in the peppers. Bone marrow...how can you go wrong? The two together were a bit too heavy/fatty, better to order them on separate trips. The octopus and beets were tasty. All the food that came out around us looked good too. The prices were just right, we spent a total of $65 for two of us for 4 dishes and the bottle of wine. If this place was in my hood, I would be there once a week. Being downtown, I can only hope that I will have reasons to be there more often.
