Like stepping inside of a crayon box, but better. Two of my very cool girlfriends and I had a girls night dinner here on Monday. Although both of my friends had dined here before, I had to admit, it was my very first, but hopefully not my last. We started with drinks and I chose the passion ice tea, which was good but was a tad too sweet. We also split an order of guac, but was a bit pricey at $15. C'mon, $15 for guac for 3 people? Pricey. One of my friends ordered the Chuleta and my other friend and I ordered Pollo Estillo Billy and the fried sweet plantains. The meals were absolutely wonderful. We topped off the night with Churros with dulce de leche and chocolate dip and chocolate cake. Absolutely wonderful and yes, parking is plentiful if you seek it out.
