I love Pequod's Pizza, but I had to give them one star because their delivery is HORRIBLE! They have messed up my order at least 3 different times when I ordered pizza from them for delivery. The pizza is amazing, but they just can never get their delivery right.......it's really sad! I ordered a vegetarian pizza and the guy brought me a pepperoni pizza! I almost threw up from the smell of it! Then, when I called them to tell them about how I was delivered the wrong pizza, they put me on hold for 10 minutes to figure out what they were going to do and then finally asked me if I wanted a "credit" for next time. I told them, Hell NO! Tell your delivery man to come back and take this pizza and give me my money back! They have very poor customer service on the phone. My suggestion is to dine in, Don't order pizza for delivery from this place!
