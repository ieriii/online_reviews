Service wasn't as good as the Greek town location but the food was every bit as tasty. Good thing we were two out of town friends catching up over brunch or else we may have minded my juice coming after the meal, or our finished plates sitting in front of us for 20 minutes, or having to aak for the check multiple times. I think the issue was our specific server so please don't let this deter you from trying out the place. The food was really great- fluffy eggs, juicy jam, and perfectly cooked baby reds.
