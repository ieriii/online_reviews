I LOVE the Grand Lux Cafe. I would have to say that I would choose this restaurant over the Cheesecake Factory, although they both rooted from the same business. I usually go here for special occasions, and I always have a great time! The environment is spacious and the decor is really something. The pasta with chicken and sundried tomatoes is my favorite, and their Mango Ice Swirl is delicious! Their martinis are very tasty too. I would recommend this place to anyone.
