We went here for brunch last Sunday and it was good, but not the best I have had. I had the mac n cheese, but it really needed more cheese! It was a little bland. The chicken sausage though was delicious and had a good maply syrup taste to them. My BF loved his meal and was raving about the potatos. The service was great and it is a very cute and inviting. The menu had a lot to choose from and I will definitely go back, but M Henry is still my favorite place for breakfast :)
