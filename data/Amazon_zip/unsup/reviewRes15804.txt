Wow! First time here, but a great experience. It is a bright, fun space. My boyfriend and I started with a Sangria and Strawberry Rhubarb marg at the bar, both were great but we both ordered the latter for round 2. For dinner we split a cheese platter, mixto ceviche, and split the nicaraguan beef tenderloin. The apps were delicious, but the beef was AMAZING. They actually plated split portions for each of us, which were still quite big. The meat was cooked perfectly and the truffled potatoes were fantastic. I would have trouble trying anything else when I come back because this was so good.  We finished with the coconut cake - also delicious. I ordered a cup of coffee with it, and that was the only thing that wasn't very good. Service was fine, nothing to rave or complain about.
