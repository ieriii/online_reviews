Giving it five stars surprises me since I have developed an early middle age contempt for pretentiousness, waiting, crowds, expensive drinks et cetera... but this place kicked such biases out of my head a little upon entry and totally out after sitting at the bar. What makes it worth all of its excesses is the bartenders: vested, smart and knowledgeable as hell about liquors we spent the night chatting with the him about wine, the West Coast and South American liquors. More than that, we got to sample five types of gin as we were schooled on the differences in production. I will happily be reeducated for the hipster revolution at this joint.
