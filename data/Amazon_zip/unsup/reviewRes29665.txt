I eat Thai food here, there, and everywhere. I was introduced to this place at my old job we used to come here for lunch pretty often. I still think it is one of the best Thai places I have been to in Chicago thus far ( I have only lived here two years, I have probably been to 20 Thai restaurants) I have not had a bad dish there yet and I have probably eaten there over twenty times. The restaurant itself is BYOB which I think is an excellent plus. The Red Snapper is very good among some of there other dishes. I also like that they made there Pad Thai with glass noodles. Also they have great appetizers.
