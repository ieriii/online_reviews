Aside from Lou Malnati's, I think Xoco is the only place we back back for seconds on your trip to Chicago last month. Or was it thirds. Anyway, it's all about the chocolate coffees and the churros. Something so simple done so well. The chilaquiles I had the first visit - they were OK. But I prefer the ones I can get in SoCal or Mexico that come kind of sloppy, right out of the pan. But the churros and the chocolate coffees...those are memorable. And really don't need the side of soft-serve for dipping at all...more, please.
