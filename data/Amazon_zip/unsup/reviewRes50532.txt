I had never heard of Wishbone when a friend asked me to meet her here for brunch. I said yes, because I'll go just about anywhere if you mention the word brunch to me. I had no idea what kind of restaurant it was, but all I could think of was the old Wishbone salad dressings, so I was picturing a restaurant where everything was made and slathered in Ranch. Wasn't I excited to get there and find out it's a southern style joint with black beans on everything. Yum. I had the Wishbone Burrito and it was perfect. I shouldn't have been able to finish the whole thing because it was huge, but I'm never one to waste food. I'll definitely be back.
