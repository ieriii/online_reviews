Hi Everyone, For Sushi this place is pretty good. Nice people and good sushi. It is always dependable. :) One thing that I will say is kind of weird is some of their severs are off sometimes. I mean like they have not been socially groomed to work with other people. You can BYOB, which is kind of great (but there are like 50 million rules in the good old days there weren't as many as there are now, you may want to call ahead)! What I really liked about this place is all the different people who come here...weird I know but it is such a great mix of people and somehow makes the experience more enjoyable. :) The food is great and they have a vast variety of different types of sushi. It is usually pretty busy but I have always had really great luck. I have waited 10 mins or less to get in without RSVPing :) So grab a fish eating friend by the hand and swim on down to COAST.
