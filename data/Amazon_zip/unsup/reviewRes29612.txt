went here tonight with John and Dave and it was yummy and cheap!!! and the whole ambience is really great. i LOVED this place. and our waiter was VERY attentive and Dave did a great job of picking one of the tables right by the front where the windows are. so pretty! the menu offers a lot on there, even a section for vegetarians, and a section for healthy choices. i got the cappellini pomodoro, which is angel hair pasta with fresh mozzarella and basil and whatever sauce you want, i went with the BV marinara [aka low fat marinara sauce] and it was DAYUM GOOD. John got the lasagna, the Monday special and it looked yummy and i'm pretty sure he enjoyed it because every little crumb on that plate was gone. Dave had the Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken and that also looked yummy for my tummy. We split the ravioli appetizer, which was...say it with me now...yummy! this is a GREAT place to go on a dinner date when you are tight on cash! or if you are just a cheapo like that. i wish i had needed to use the bathroom to see the rest of the place but from what i could tell, it was very pretty and just a wonderful environment. i'm going back soon! oh, parking blows unless you get lucky. you can take the 22 or the 36, get off at fullerton and walk 1/2 block north.
