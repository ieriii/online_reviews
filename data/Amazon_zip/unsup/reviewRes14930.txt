An oldie but a goodie! I started coming here a few years ago after seeing it on Check Please. The place itself is a little rustic. Dim lighting adds to the intimate feel. As for the food, it's a great value - every meal includes soup/salad, pizza bread, and a loaf of italian bread.  Chicken Parmesean - Very good with a side of pasta included. Even the meat sauce on the pasta was tasty. Lobster al diavolo - Slightly spicy with big chunks of lobster. Zuppa di Mare - My friend ordered this and I was able to have a taste. The seasoning was similar to the lobster dish but the tomato sauce had a more soupy consistency. Tons of seafood though! Tordelle al pesce - Homemade pasta stuffed with crab and cheese. Good but I don't know if I'd order it again. I prefer to stick with the classics. You can definitely taste the crab though.  Tortellini with meat sauce - Standard but done very well. Portion size is huge though.  Banana foster = LOVE! One of my favorite desserts in the city. They prepare it front of you. It was cool watching the first time, but usually I'm just salivating in my seat. One star off due to service. It can be hit or miss depending on the waiter. Some waiters seem like lifetimers and are great, but we once had a waiter who basically ignored us all night. Didn't even bother to tell us the specials.
