very flavorful! The food is here is very different and I have never tried the food here anywhere else. I had their milk braised pork shoulder, ceasar salad, bone marrow, clams, and fried Brussels sprouts. Hmm...I have to say that the food is a little on the salty side...I found myself drinking a lot of water during my meal. Also, this place was a little too crowded. Maybe it was holiday season, but it would have been nice if we had a more room. It was a very fun experience eating bone marrow, clams, and fried brussels sprouts. And I recommend yall trying this place!
