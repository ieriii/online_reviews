So I kind of loved my meal here -- which was a massive surprise given that Spanish isn't always my thang -- onto the noshing, which took place in a vast space located within a hotel, decor is appropriately "trendy industrial" -- but I digress -- the food is quite tasty. Went for a late lunch over the weekend and were one of 4-5 tables filled (out of idk 30+) -- the menu looked limited at first -- perhaps 7 starters and 7 mains -- but everything we had was delicious. The turnip soup (sans serrano) was creamy and soul-lifting, and my avo, asparagus, and green bean salad was crisp and tasty -- each ingredient in every dish served a purpose. Oh, and the side of catalan spinach w/ pine nuts and currants was tassssssty. Scallops were nice, but only 4 per serving. A lady with my lust for these creatures needs at least 8, please chef Garces, please. They have a lunch deal, $18 for 2 courses or $35 for 3 -- I didn't look at the dessert menu, so I can't judge the worthiness of that option, but for 2 courses of this quality for $18, I'd go back any day for a quick lunch. Civilized, yet in and out within an hour. Oh, vegetarians be warned, not a massive selection, though pescatarians will be just dandy. Carnivores will not suffer in the least. All flavors are more nuanced than expected. Win.
