My good friend, Charles, has said on a number of occasions that he wanted to take me to Wishbone, but we've never actually gotten around to it. This morning, while searching for a place that wasn't packed, I remembered Wishbone, and Jim, Dawn and I hit it up for brunch. It was surprisingly uncrowded when we arrived, but by the time we left it was jammed, with people waiting outside. Frankly, it was pleasant to not eat in a place where you can barely hear yourself think, and can't really appreciate the decor because there are people in front of it. The food was good. I won't say it was great, but I enjoyed it. I had the shrimp and cheese grits, and it was delicious, but really too rich for brunch. The biscuit was very good, too, and as I've said in other reviews, any place that gives me a choice of teas gets high marks in my book. I also tasted the Yankee scrambles (I think that's what it's called) and they were quite wonderful. Adding cream cheese to scrambles can sometimes go disastrously wrong as I've found out at my own stove. But these eggs were fluffy, cheesy and filled with scallions. In all, it was a pretty darn good brunch an fairly reasonable for all we got. I'd say Wishbone is generally a winner.
