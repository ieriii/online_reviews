I don't know what Chicago's infatuation with the color purple and pigs are (oh, and revolving doors too. But I digress), but I am sure GLAD this unusually strange obsession exists! The Purple Pig was suggested to my boyfriend and I while in Chicago for work and vacation; and I am oh so glad it lived up to its hype. Pros: -Delicious cuisine in European style portions. -Full bar. -Attentive service. -The Bone Marrow Spread, and Milk Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes is pure genius. Both meals melted in my mouth. I highly recommend the two dishes. Cons: -Super busy. We went on a Wednesday night. I can't imagine what the wait is like on a Friday or Saturday! -Cramped. Really small restaurants, such as The Purple Pig, are cursed with this attribute. All in all, simply DELICIOUS! The negative factors did not phase me at all the moment I tasted their food. All is forgiven, Purple Pig, 5 stars for you.
