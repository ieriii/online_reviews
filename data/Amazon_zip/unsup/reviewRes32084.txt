Our unruly band of adventurers came to Demura with the hope of Uptown-style hospitality and flowing libations. We were not disappointed. The location, a short trek from our camp in the village of Anderson, seemed to require near constant vigilance. Yellow and white vehicles sped toward crossing pedestrians with malicious velocity. Other groups if hungry scavengers sat, propped up against nearly every building nearby. Once our party opened the glass front door, everything changed. The smell of heavy spices immediately put us at ease. Once seated, the barmaid came with honey wine for two of us and malbec for the others. Our toughest fighter ordered for all of us because of her familiarity with the locale. The jovial conversation at our table brought stares from other diners, but the service never faltered. The food came in good time and we ate in fine spirits. The random sampling of this cuisine gave a variety of flavors to qwell our voracity and we left with the sluggishness that accompanies such a fine feast.
