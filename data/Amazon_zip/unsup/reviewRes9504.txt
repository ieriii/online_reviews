service- average, nothing special. atmosphere- crowded and tight, and it smells just like home with all the asian flavors. like it! price- decent... nothing too outrageous for the city food- overall, i was really excited to try a lot of the dishes, but not too impressed with what came out... 1. chao tom: Grilled shrimp wrapped around sugar cane, With angel-hair noodles, mint, cilantro, & lettuce, with peanut plum dipping sauce. The Sauce was easily the star of the dish- very tasty and probably the best dish we had. The shrimp was oddly overshadowed.. .literally by huge hulking pieces of lettuce. It's not really grilled shrimp.. it's a grilled shrimp paste that they mashed. It's a messy dish with lots of hand and finger interaction. Sadly, this was the best dish of the evening. 2. ngeu xao black, north Atlantic mussels sauted in a basil butter cream sauce okay- nothing too special i thought 3. ca hap Steamed fillets of Chilean sea bass, with cellophane noodles, oyster mushrooms, tomatoes, scallions, & fried ginger in a light ginger broth the noodles were excellent, but the sea bass was def. overcooked. sea bass should be flaky and fatty... the fillets we were served were tough. very disappointing.
