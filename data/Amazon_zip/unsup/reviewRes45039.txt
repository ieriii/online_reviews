I made a 7:00pm reservation at Anteprima for a Tuesday night. I got caught in some traffic and when I called to let them know I would be a bit late, there was no answer. Thankfully, they called me to check in, and had no problem holding the table until we arrived. The place was packed, so it was very nice of them to hold the table for us. I'm glad they did too, because I did enjoy my experience at Anteprima. Everyone I was with really liked their food. The ones I remember people ordering: Butternut squash ravioli, orecchiette, amberjack, and I think the spaghetto cacio e pepe). Their wine list is impressive and very reasonably priced.  I would recommend Anteprima to friends, but there are a few things I would note. It is very loud here. I'm sensitive to this because I don't have the best hearing, so it was a bit of an issue for me. Also, they took my stepmom's food away before she was finished, which was also weird because no one else at the table was even close to being finished with their food. So, not only was she still hungry for her food, but she was sitting with nothing in front of her while we all ate. Very strange (though we didn't say anything because we still enjoyed the experience overall). Overall good place. I'd go back for sure.
