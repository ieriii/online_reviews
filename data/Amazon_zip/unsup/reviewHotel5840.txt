I choose this hotel via Hotwire and couldn't be happier. Mark at the front desk checked us in last night and was wonderful. Then this morning Katie helped me out so much by rolling over my room to elimate an interruption in the room.  What a pleasant surprise at 830 in the morning. A great staff , location, hip modern feel stay here if you can.
