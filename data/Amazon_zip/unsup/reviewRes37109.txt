Fox and Obel is my new favorite high end grocery store. I came here after seeing that it was rated "Best Bread" by Chicago Magazine. After my two hour, self-invented, chocolate tour around Chicago downtown, I headed here to...well detox from all that sugar. I took my time in the store, trying to soak in its structure and the food that it carried. There is a cafe in front, as well as a bistro in the back. The store has a variety of local and organic foods; the prepared foods section contained sushi (caterpillar roll was only $7!) as well as entree choices that had an Asian kick to them  The store even carried fair trade Taza chocolate, one of my favorites after personally touring the factory in Boston. I finally found the bread section, and carefully looked over the choices. I ended up getting the sourdough roll because that was what was recommended by Chicago Magazine. Before I even went to the register, I simply had to take a bite: chewy and delicious, with the right amount of sourness. The flour sprinkled on top of the roll dirtied my hands, but the dryness of the flour actually added a lot of texture to the bread. While I still think Amy's Bread in NYC's Chelsea Market is better, Fox is definitely one of the better rolls I have had. The bagels were also especially adorable--each flavor had its own drawer. The store also had the most amazing customer service ever. Looking over at the jars of dried fruit and nuts, an associate came to help me, even offering to let me try some things. Right away, we struck up a conversation about figs (I had never had a whole fig fresh fig before) and how the store made their pancake syrup out of fresh figs. And when I went to the cash register, the associate specifically asked me if I wanted some complimentary butter with the bread I was buying. It was just so nice, so simple, so full of midwestern hospitality. I smiled the entire way home.
