ohmygosh. i lived in evanston for 4 years. i came back about 10 times since graduating and i never went to this place... until now. i'm so happy about this place i'm just going to do a play by play: you walk in and there's a line. you wait in line almost like a fast food restaurant and look at the menu to figure out what you want. there is a manager/waiter person who asks how many people are in your party, and somehow (as if by magic), he will tell you how long you have to wait for a table. by the time you finish ordering in the line, you will either be waiting on the side for a table or you'll have a table to sit and wait at with a number. you sit, enjoy a cold one if you so desire. i got the ahogada. now let me be VERY frank. i do NOT like tomato sauce. i don't like tomatos most of the time either. but the waiter suggested it to me. so i just did it. and boy oh boy i love him for this suggestion. i ordered it SPICY since i love spicy. and i was feeling congested. this bowl comes out with this red sauce and the torta filled with pork and other goodies. the red tomato soup was so... good. spicy and warm and perfect amount of tanginess from limes. the torta itself had a really really nice crispy exterior that soaked up all that tomato soup goodness with tender pieces of pork and seasoning. i will admit.. this place was pretty pricy. im from LA where mexican food is as cheap as it gets. but i really didn't care this time. WHOA did i just say that?! ;)
