It's so tiny and cute! And difficult to see, I guess. I wandered up and down B'way with sushi in mind, and it took me 3 tries to find Wakamono. o_O Okay, I did find it, and I ordered take-out (I was in a hurry). I liked it! The Godzilla roll and Mexican roll were both very good. However, for the price I thought they were a little short on the fish. But everything was quite fresh, and had plenty of spicy sauce (sriracha, I think? fabulous!), which I love. Crab rangoons were typical; the accompanying sauce was great though. I shouldn't have eaten those two big rolls all to myself! I had too much and ran off to an opera rehearsal. Then I had the worst sushi-heartburn ever! I burped spicy arpeggios all night. I would return w/ friends & take advantage of the BYOB and stylish interior... I have a feeling those features would bump my review up to 4 stars easily.
