Xoco = XOXO  And some more XOXO, with a dash of love for an added measure of obsession. Maybe I shouldn't be allowed within 10 ft. of the place. Freakin' wonderfully delicious. Perhaps I lucked out, but I wandered in here on a Friday at 11 am, not realizing that this place usually has a line out the door- and I was the 3rd person in line. SCORE! By the time I left, around 11:45, there was a line out the door which included probably an hour wait. Yikes. Nah Nah!! Suckas!!! All in all, not a super fast place- so expect that. I arrived at 11:06 and left at 11:45. I ate in about 5 minutes because I was on the verge of being late somewheres...  So, if you are in a hurry- stop here sometime when you have time to spare. My lunch with a hibiscus drink was $13 something. Not too bad at all. I ordered the daily special, which was a torta with lime marinated pork, avocado, fresh tomato, pickled onions, and habanero salsa. The bread was very tough, but very good. Tomato = freshly amazing and obviously local. The salsa was hot and flavorful. I wanted to drink it, but after a few bites my eyes were watering and my nose was running. I looked like I was crying by myself in a corner outside. My tears were tears of joy and love. So worth it. I didn't want to stop eating it. I'm so stubborn when it comes to hot salsa. Basically, the reviews don't lie. Not expensive and worth a visit. I would eat here weekly if I could. But they'd probably get a restraining order against me. My love is that deep.
