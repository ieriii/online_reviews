Very good breakfast. From what I've read, it can be a wait, but there wasn't any on the Friday morning I went. I had a breakfast sandwich (awesome!) and these banana/oreo pancakes with whip cream and caramel. Wow. Seriously, the best pancake dish I've ever had. A little bit rich and sugary, but so worth it.  My only complaint was the "large" orange juice wasn't that large, and was like $4. Otherwise, the prices seemed decent. I would definitely go back.
