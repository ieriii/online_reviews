I have been on a mission to find a good BBQ restaurant in Chicago. After trying so many (Smoque, Smoke Daddy, Fat Willy's, Lillie's Q, Twin Anchors, Honky Tonk BBQ, Risque Cafe) and feeling disappointed each time, I was almost ready to give up and say that I just need to fly to Chapel Hill, NC to get some seriously good BBQ. I have finally found my BBQ place - and am so in love with Chicago Q it is almost bordering on the obscene. We decided to try it on a whim and walked in without reservations. They seated us promptly and then placed homemade chips and bread & butter pickles on the table. Wow! Unexpectedly delicious! And I don't usually even like pickles! I decided to try the competition baby back ribs while my husband ordered the regular baby back ribs so we could do a taste test. I am happy to say that my choice was the right one, but my husband's dish was also pretty tasty when comparing to the other restaurants we've been to. I'm usually not a fan of dry rub ribs, but these ribs were so damn good that I could have eaten them without sauce. Btw, they give you 4 sauces that you can try, which is a cool way of trying different flavor combinations but also makes you realize how freaking good the ribs are because they don't even really need the sauce! And I like sauce! Let's talk about the atmosphere - it's parent-friendly, client-friendly, and just friendly in general. It's clean and simple but comfortable. Oh I also loved my gigantic piece of corn bread, which is hard to do because I usually don't like corn bread at restaurants. Can't wait to go back! Will tell all of my friends to try this restaurant!
