We went here last night cuz we were cravin' beef! Gosh it was soooo good. I had the Ruth Chris Classic which came with salad, entree and dessert. We also ordered a few extras :) List: House bread: OMG, BREAD! I love love their bread. So warm from the oven. Carpaccio: comes with thin garlic bread and spring salad topped with thick slices of Parmesan drizzled appropriately with white sauce (yum!) Harvest Salad: A bit much dressing for my taste but probably appropriate for most had bacon, corn, dried cherries, Cajun pecans... it was so delicious. My fiance kept stealing bites from me. Filet with shrimp: the Filet Mignon was cook so perfectly medium rare and came on a 500 degree dish. I put my asparagus on my plate and it immediately sizzled and cooked my greens. This keeps your steak warm throughout your meal which is an amazing idea! I wish I though of it first. Wait, does my oven even go to 500 degrees? Garlic mashed potatoes: gotta haven a choice of taters with your steak and this was a very good choice! Dessert: So chocolatey, so perfect. Oh yeah! The service was beyond great. My fiance's diet coke was flat and told the server and she came back with a can of diet pepsi since all diet coke was from the same fountain. That was awesome.
