I had high hopes for Big Jones. Any spot that wants to serve low country cooking is going to get a look from me. My friends and I have tried this place twice and both times we've been let down. The waitstaff was great, the drinks good and the atmosphere fun. However, those items alone do not make a great dining experience. It all comes down to the kitchen. Both times we went our food came out cold and in waves. We could tell the recipes were sound, but the execution was extremely poor. I don't think I will waste my time or money trying this place again. I really hope they get their act together and make this place work more consistently.
