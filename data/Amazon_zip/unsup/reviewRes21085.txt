Two years ago I stumbled upon this place on new years eve which also happened to be half price margarita night (every tuesday, thursday). This coincidence turned out to be a recipe for pure awesomeness. I tried the house mango margarita and lime margarita which were both amazing for amazing prices. That night, I also had the best skirt steak in my entire life and I know my skirt steak like I know my chicago bears trivia. Cooked perfectly medium, it served as a perfect compliment to my increasingly tipsy state of mind. Since that fateful evening, I have been back multiple times to this place. Try to the Steak Diablo, the Skirt Steak, and also if you feel like a pork night, the carnitas. If you happen to be vegetarian, my girlfriend always gets the vegetarian enchiladas which I always steal one off her plate. A vegetarian dish passing the stringent requirements of a strict carnivore is always a good sign. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. The only downside is having to sit in the back sometimes. I only complain since years and years of playing NES and now modern warfare 3 has dimmed my visual acuity so it's hard to see in such low light. However understand this is a common problem I have at many restaurants and other social establishments. If you're looking for good mexican food with awesome margaritas, it doesn't get much better than this
