I stayed here for 4 nights, and it was great. Beautiful views of the city from all around the hotel. The location was perfect for downtown: close to everything, but far enough that the price was right. The conceige was so helpful and had great tips on restaurants. I ate in the bar one night and though it was hotel-priced, the shrimp and scallop ceviche was well worth it. Overall, the hotel, staff, room and location fit just what I needed for a 4 day weekend trip to Chicago.
