This place it great - really tasty food, very reasonably priced (great lunch specials) and an owner who takes huge pride in his restaurant. Don't walk, run to this place!Plus if you read the screwed up story of what the partners did to the chef/owner you should support this local place as much as you can.p.s. There are always groups of good looking woman there to add to the ambiance.
