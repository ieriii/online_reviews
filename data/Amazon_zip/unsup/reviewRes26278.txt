I have been here multiple times and absolutely LOVE it! This place puts Melting Pot to shame. I've never been a fan of fondue until I've been to this restaurant so you have to give it a chance if you're unsure. One great perk is signing up for their email and you will always receive coupons. We always make reservations and have never had to wait when we show up. The portion of food is a lot, especially for the price!!! The ambiance is relaxing and romantic. Although I've also booked dinner there once with a bunch of friends for a birthday and we all had a blast. Sometimes there is live music which is nice. Make sure to ask for Michelle if she's there. She is such a great waitress and always checks up on us. I love her! They are so quick to refill your drinks and pick up your plates. There is literally someone standing around just to do that, seriously? How much more attentive can they be? It's great!! By the way, their Strawberry Mojito is delicious!!
