I love Graham Elliott, the person, and the restaurant!! It's an amazing, noisy, wonderful place to eat the most amazing food ever!! I love that they change their menu seasonally.... Lynn, one of the bartenders is amazing too!! When a date asks me where I want to go for dinner, I say GE...plus, it's right downstairs from my loft!!!  The wait staff is great and always happy to see you!!!
