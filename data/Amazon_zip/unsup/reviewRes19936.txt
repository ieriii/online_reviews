As any reader can tell from the other reviews, Coast Sushi is great. There was an hour wait on Saturday night, but we brought wine and set up shop at the tables in the front and the time passed quickly. Needless to say, byob at a sushi restaurant is a great way to save $$. The food, once we sat down, was perfect-- best thing ever was that they had gluten free soy sauce. For anyone needing that, this is the place to go...maybe call ahead to make sure they have some in stock (they were running low last night, and I think I finished it up :), but what really got me was how knowledgeable and accommodating they were with finding the right sauce and warning me about other rolls on the table that I shouldn't eat...everyone I talked to there was great, and I had full confidence in anything they suggested (and felt good afterwards :) I ordered the Chirashi, which was amazingly fresh and good. I didn't try anything else, but the rolls on the table looked just as great. The only reason it got a star knocked off the rating was because it was pretty dark in the restaurant, and so noisy that it was hard to hear across the table. Might have been okay for a romantic date, but I found it hard to hear (and see!) friends farther down the table from me. All in all, this is a sushi place that, despite not living in the neighborhood, I will come back to often.
