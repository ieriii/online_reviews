Eh, don't waste your time here. Go straight to Lou Malnatis!!!! BOMB ass deep dish pizza, you will not regret it... unless you love love LOVE cheese and pie crust then go ahead and eat at Giordano's. Lou Malnatis's definitely have better bread and tastier pizza with lots of sauce, all i tasted here was cheese and boring crust.
