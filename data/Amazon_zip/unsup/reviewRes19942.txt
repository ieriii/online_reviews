Coast is a good place. Not great but good. They don't have much selection under their signature makis but they have a decent maki selection in general. I had the Dragon and Una Avo and they were both very delicious. It is worth the $2 to try the authentic wasabi. Prices are typical. This place is BYOB. Service is okay but could be better. I sat at the sushi bar so I cannot speak for the acoustics if you were to sit at a table. It is loud in general.
