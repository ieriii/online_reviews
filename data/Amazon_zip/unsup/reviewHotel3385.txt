I hated this hotel. The husband wanted to stay at Public but I was turned off by the NYC price so we made a reservation at Allerton. I am glad I read the reviews beforehand on Yelp (to prepare me) because most of them are true. We had a room on the 13th floor. Housekeeping started doing their thing very early in the morning (this is both a good/bad thing). You can hear them outside of the door and they knocked on our door to clean (we learned our lesson to not forget the 'do not disturb' sign). FYI-I am also overly connected (Computer/Ipad/Iphone). They charge for each thing not per room. Cons: Hotel is Huge/Crowded (might have been the weekend we were there) Elevators are slow Wifi-not free (charge per item not room) Right smack in the middle of Michigan Avenue (super crowded with tourists) Grandparents with their grandkids heading to the American Doll Place (creepy)-sorry I don't have kids don't understand it yet $50 parking (they are not affilated with the hotel) Bathroom needs updating, it feels like your grandparents bathroom Our room smelled like cigarettes Pros: close to Tiffany, Zara, Topshop, American Girl Place Can walk to the MCA and Art Institute (approx 1/2-1 mile)
