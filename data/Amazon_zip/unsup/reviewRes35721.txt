Went last night with 3 others and had the $30 duck meal. AHH-MAZZ-ING!!! I loved the table service, it was fast, hot, delicious.The duck itself was soo moist and yummy, the buns were delish!!! I loved the soup and the fried rice was some of the best Ive had in years! The girl who carved the duck was very friendly, they were really busy as it was a Saturday night, but the service could have been a bit more attentive. Beer selection is ok, they have a corkage fee of $3 if you want to bring a bottle of wine. The amount of food was crazy, we all left with lots of left-overs, that I can assure you will be eaten up by the end of the day! I think its an amazing and yummy deal!  Nice buns.
