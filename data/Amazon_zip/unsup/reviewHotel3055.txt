This is a nice hotel for an event or if you are staying by yourself but... I find the bathrooms here insanely laughable. I guess it's edgy and cool for some people to have a window and door in a bathroom that make you feel like you'll be exposed any second doing your private business. Seriously...I think a lot of people had to approve this idea and I have to wonder what they were thinking or if they were at all. It wouldn't be the first hotel I'd recommend to friends.
