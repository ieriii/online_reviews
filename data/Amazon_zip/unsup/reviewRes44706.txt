I have had Giordano's several times. I have been to several locations including the one in Orlando. I have also ordered it online and had it shipped to my house.  This is my favorite pizza anywhere. I love being able to go here and enjoy some real pizza. I freaking love deep dish. I love the pie like crust with the meaty sauce and thick cheese. This place is so damn good. I have had some of the top reviewed places in NYC and there is no comparison to Giordano's. I have had Pizzeria Uno and while I really enjoyed it I still prefer Giordano's. I am interested to try Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Pequod's Pizzeria. But they will have to wait for the next trip.
