Loved it! After an early morning shopping extravaganza (see Sara Jane review), fellow yelper Isabella W. suggested brunch at Milk and Honey! She talked up the huevos rancheros so much that all 3 of us ended up getting it! Normally, I'm a stickler for everyone ordering something different for variety, but I let it slide this time. It's only offered on the weekends, and it was layers and layers of baked yumminess! One complaint was that there were way too many beans on the bottom - but beans are good for you! I love how efficiently they operate too - they give you a number, you go up to the counter and order, wait for a table, and shortly after you're seated, they bring you the food! This is definitely how I would run a restaurant during busy brunchtime! What an awesome way to minimize waiting time for everyone!  I hope to be back to try the breakfast sandwiches, french toast, and granola!
