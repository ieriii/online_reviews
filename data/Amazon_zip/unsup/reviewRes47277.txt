I've been wanting to hit this place up for a while despite the razor wire logo shenanigans, but kept avoiding it until tonight. I'm an ass for waiting so long. The menu is hilarious in it's prison themed titles but you won't be laughing when you sink your teeth into the punk bitch burger or the smash'n'grab chix sandwich. The half priced draws don't hurt either. Veggies are welcome in this jail cell as all the burgers are veggie substitutable. Ukranian Village's answer to Kuma's Corner . Kaiylee is a knowledgeable and effervescent server that made our first time that much more memorable.
