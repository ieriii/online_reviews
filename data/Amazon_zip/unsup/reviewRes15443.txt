Finally tried this place. It's aesthetically pleasing but not quite the quiet lounge I was expecting. The drinks [especially the Juliet/Romeo] were fantastic... and strong. Good because paying $12 per drink means I should get my money's worth. Typically I drink 6+ drinks before getting a little buzz, but two here and I was already feeling good! The place was loud enough to talk over the music so that was a bit bothersome since I figured with all the damn mood lighting and the pretentious feedback I've read. The music... ... I fucking hate hipster/indie music and it did not match the decor in my opinion. I guess I was expecting Dead Can Dance or Portishead, or some type of ambient music but alas, no. Also, I was a bit put out by the attire of the place. We were under the assumption that it was dressy or at least put some thought into how you appear but I saw a lot of t-shirts and jeans and sneakers. At least we looked good; but the "glamour" was definitely lacking. Overall, it was good. Will we go back? Probably for the J&R but it was good
