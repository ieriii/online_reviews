Worthy of the hype and worth the wait. Plan ahead to arrive early and put your name in. Then take advantage of the great shopping nearby while you wait (I recommend Vosges Chocolate). Ceviche was great as were flautas (loved the salsa). Oaxacan black mole with duck lived up to reputation. Had a spicy mixed drink with Serrano chili that was great as well. This is a place not to be missed.
