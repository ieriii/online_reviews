I've been here before - went for restaurant week - surprisingly seated right away. It was $33 per person which is reasonable for this place and for the amount of food. I loved the gruyere cheese fondue served with different chunks of bread and fruit. For the meal I had chicken/steak - my date had steak and scallops - I just wasn't a fan. I guess boiling meat in soybean oil just doesn't do it for me. It was fun - just not tasty. Dessert was awesome - chocolate fondue with marshmellows, bananas, strawberries, cake - yummy! I'd come back some day for just appetizers and dessert.
