Our second experience here was just as welcoming! We decided to use the 1/2 birthday $15 gift certificate mailed to us after signing up for their email list. As it was a Friday, we booked early to avoid the crowds. We decided that the special was a better deal (from the neighborhood coupon books), which included a shared appetizer, two pasta entrees, and a shared dessert for about twenty dollars off the full price! We had the bruchetta with avacado, the lasagna/pumpkin ravioli entrees, and tiramisu. Both entrees are highly recommended...my husband is very picky with his lasagna and the portion was large enough for leftovers. The pumpkin ravioli came with pieces of butternut squash, pinenuts, and a lovely burnt butter sauce....a wonderful fall dinner with cinnamon. Worth the trip every time!!
