This place is one of my favoriate places to dine in the city. I've been here twice now and I will go back again. The food is outstanding, it's the best Mexican food in Chi Town. I highly recommend Frontera Grill. The prices are good and the wait staff is very friendly. Also, they are constantly changing the menu. The flavors in the food definately stand out.
