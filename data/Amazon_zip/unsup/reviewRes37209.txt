It's great they have a cafe at the store. We got shafted out of a movie at the AMC up the block and decided to go kill time there to get our money's worth out of the garage (that's a whole other review). I got myself a BLT and a Goose Island Root Beer, and the boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with a Coke. The BLT was delicious, everything about it was great. Very lightly mayo'd, the bread was toasted perfectly and they used bitter greens rather than your standard iceberg lettuce - yum. We ordered a side of the truffle oil fries which I was excited about, but they turned out to just be regular fries with some sea salt on them. The mayo for dipping had some bits of what I think were truffles, but we couldn't tell. Not impressed. The sandwiches come with a huge stack of potato chips which weren't bad - next time I'll skip the extra side. She asks: "What did you think of your sandwich, babe?" He replies: "It was quite delish. The bread was a little harder than I typically like, but it was yummy. I liked the onions, though I don't know what kind they were." So there you go. Aside from a lone fruit fly bothering us as we ate, and the Peter Gabriel on the overhead bothering me as I ate, it was nice. If I'm in the neighborhood again getting shafted out of a matinee by enormous crowds at the theatre, I'll go back.
