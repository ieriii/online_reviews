The Green Mile can get a little bit campy, but sometimes that's exactly what I want. I've been a few times, and my feelings about it are mostly good with a couple of exceptions. The music is quite good. I'm a fan of jazz and swing, and they usually have that in spades. The drinks are usually competitively priced (though I only drink beer and mid-shelf whiskey) for the neighborhood. The ambiance would feel like a time machine to the 1940s if not for the obvious wear on the ware. (ahhh...homonyms...) My only complaints are the size of the dance floor and the tendency for it to be a tourist trap. Still, it's a cool place to take people from out of town.
