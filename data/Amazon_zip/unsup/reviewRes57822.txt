Omg...I'm surprised to see how many good reviews this place has. It is by far...THE WORSE PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. Especially, customer service. if you have about 2 hours to kill for brunch, over the top prices, and bad customer service, then Nana's would be your ideal place. I literally had to wait, (after asking numerous times) 45 minutes for a menu...In my opinion, Nana's is no big whoop for me and i hope that they don't stay in our neighborhood long..THEY SUCK! thanks.By the way...I had to give them a star. :( Yelp, post a thumbs down button or something!
