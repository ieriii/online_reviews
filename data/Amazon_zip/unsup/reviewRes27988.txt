Best Pizza I have ever had. I have trusted Yelp reviews in every city I have gone to and I have never been let down. This was no exception. Garlic cheese bread and pan pizza. My wife had garlic on her half of the pizza, we forgot mints...big mistake. She had to ride home in the back seat. I had sausage on my side and I could have made a meal just from the toppings!
