I have been wanting to try this place forever. I had been putting it off because it's not super easy to get to from downtown, but I am definitely glad I took the hot, sweaty cab right north to check it out. As others have mentioned, the beer list is absolutely incredible. Not only is it expansive, but it has accurate descriptions of the taste of every single option. As if that weren't enough, our waitress was extremely well versed in the list and was able to make selections based on what we said we wanted. I got the Left Coast Burger-Reuben and it was delicious. The meat was cooked the way I ordered it and the sauerkraut added a little tang that balanced the swiss cheese and pretzel bun. The service was speedy, and there was no wait for an inside table for three on a Friday night (the wait for an outside table was 45min).
