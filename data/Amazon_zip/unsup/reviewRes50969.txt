This is my local go-to place when I just don't want to have to think too much about where to go. I love the trout. I love the choices of sides. I love the cheap-o breakfasts M - F before 9. I love that you get a discount if you arrive by bike and have your helmet. I love that the air is clean. I love the friendly staff. I love the decor and the artwork. That about says it!
