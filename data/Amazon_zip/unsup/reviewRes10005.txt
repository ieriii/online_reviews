+++ Very nice looking outdoor seating area. This is probably why you'd end up here. ++ Service was terrific. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. They take good care of you. Also, they make really great pizza. One of the things we ordered was the speck pizza special and I loved it. It reminded me of the delicious pizza at Spacca Napoli, but with a more sensible crust (not paper thin in the center of the pizza). I would return here for a pizza and a glass of wine sometime. + Huge wine list. You might want to brush up on your Italian wines though, because that is all they carry and it makes it difficult to choose if you are only familiar with the restaurant staple varietals. I just let the waiter pick one out for me instead of making a blind guess and he did a fine job. - The food is mostly bland. It is rustic Italian, true, but I was hoping for a little more out of some of the dishes, particularly the Porchetta, which came out a little dry. I kind of wish that I had ordered a pasta or the fish special instead. We also tried the insalata di carciofini, burrata con culatello, and griglia mista. Everything was OK, but nothing was great, except the pizza. If this restaurant were anywhere else, it would be alright to serve average food, but it is in the same neighborhood and price bracket as such flavor sanctums as Girl & the Goat and Carnivale. I was just a bit underwhelmed. -- The patio is amazing, but I'm going to go ahead and recommend that you don't let them seat you by the plants along the wall. An uninvited guest popped out and said hello at the end of our meal. I tried to downplay it and I didn't want to make a scene, because I know that it is hard to keep wildlife away from patio dining areas and I know that they are probably doing everything that they can to do so. Yanyao even named the critter "Giuseppi" and pretended that he was part of the waitstaff, but I can definitely see other people freaking out if they had seen what we did.
