Four and a half stars. Food is terrific. If they have it when you go, get the cornbread-bourbon pudding for dessert. Wonderful. It's all very creative and tasty as heck. I wanted to order one of everything, but ended up with pork belly + risotto and braised short rib + ravioli. The beer list is long and solid but not quite up to par with other beer-focused bars in town. I'm not into whiskey so I won't comment there but the list looked great if I ever wanted a whiskey education. Our server was overworked, so I felt bad for him and forgave a couple mix-ups. He was very friendly and knowledgeable. Service in general is very good though the hosting was unusual. Wife and I were told we would have to wait 5 to 10 minutes (no big deal), but ended up waiting 20 or 25 minutes (also not a big deal; it was a Friday night and crowded) for a two-seat table that had been open the entire time (that is the weird part). Go early because it gets crowded as heck. Will definitely go again.
