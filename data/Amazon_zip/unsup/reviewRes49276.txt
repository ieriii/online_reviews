I've been craving red velvet cupcakes so I tried one here. It was very mediocre- won't go again. I love red velvet for its cheese cream frosting, and this one tasted more buttery and out of the can, than anything else. The dough was pretty gooey. It's not terrible, just not worth the money. For 32 cents more I get an AMAZING red velvet at Sugar Bliss in downtown. At least it made me stop craving red velvet now.
