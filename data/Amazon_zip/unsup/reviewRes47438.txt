Do you have a birthday coming up? Have it here!! Seriously. I just got finished throwing a party here last Friday and had an awesome time! Sol did us right and made sure that we were more than provided for (you promised a good time, and you were right) Our server Kaylie is phenomenal, I was never without drinks (full strength, not watered down like many other package deals in the past have done) The owner even came out and catered to our music requests. I really felt like everyone went out of their way to make us happy. . . thank you thank you thank you
