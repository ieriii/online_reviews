We came here last night for dinner and before we even ordered our meal we were served tortilla chips with three different types of salsas and taquitos that tasted delicious! We each ordered a horchata for drinks. I got three tacos (only $5!!!) with chorizo and beef tongue. I cleared my plate and ate everything! I think my favorite was the chorizo. My friend ordered the flautas, one with ground beef, one with chicken. It came with rice and beans. She loved it! Between the two of us, two drinks and two entrees totaled $8 for each of us!
