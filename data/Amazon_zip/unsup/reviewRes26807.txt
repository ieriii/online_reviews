Marissa G. and I decided to cross off a Yelp bookmark together on the way to the White Sox home opener this year.  Cool things seen: 1. Elderly chubby Mexican woman with a velvet fedora hat accented by a peacock feather chowing down. 2. Frightened suburban 6th graders on a field trip who had never ventured outside of Michigan Avenue. 3. Pepto Bismol sitting at the cash register (I don't think it was intended for communal use). 4. Tubs of different salsas lined up at the cashier counter waiting to be scooped into small bowls and enjoyed with their freshly made tortilla chips. Comida deliciosa 1. Guacamole. $5 for a small which is about three times as large as what you get at Chipotle. This was the creamiest guac I've ever had. What could make it better? Well, their amazing freshly made thin tortilla chips of course! These delicate chips add a lightness to the rich guac. 2. Asado de Puerco. $8. Pork so tender that it literally melts in your mouth. The ancho sauce was very mild, perfect for my sensitive palate! 3. Horchata. $1. That's right, you CAN still get something for a dollar nowadays! Granted their horchata is served out of one of those large plastic tupperware dispensing devices, it's sweet and refreshing. Gotta love rice water! Service was extremely attentive and friendly. I loved that they'd even speak a little Spanish to us too. How did they know that I had four years in high school?! We also were given complimentary sweet empanadas, one filled with raspberry jam and the other with pineapple, along with a tamale looking appetizer. It was like a 3 course lunch for the price of one course! Don't forget that they only accept cash (ATM inside) and they're BYOB with a liquor store no more than 3 storefronts away. Talk about convenient!
