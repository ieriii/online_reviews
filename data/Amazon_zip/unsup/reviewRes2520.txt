I'm leaving Chicago in a week after a 3 year stint here. Hot Doug's is, bar none, the best restaurant in this town. Friendly, unique, affordable, delicious. When you have friends in town, bring them to Hot Dougs. When you vacation in Chicago, you have to go to Hot Dougs. Don't listen to the "you gotta try a slice of deep dish Chicago pizza" crowd, just know this is the great Chicago treat. Try a unique sausage from the revolving menu choices provided instead of something from the "you can get these types of sausages anywhere" menu and enjoy one of the bizarre choices like a Smoked Mole Chicken Sausage with Jalapeno Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese or a Portuguese Linguica with Saffron Rouille and 1-Year Manchego Cheese.
