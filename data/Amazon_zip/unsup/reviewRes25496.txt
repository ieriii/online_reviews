My fiance treated me to Geja's for my Birthday earlier this week. We both had never been and it was his 1st experience with fondue. We had a reservation but still had to wait for 20 minutes which I didn't really mind but was surprised to see a restaurant so packed on a Monday. (I overheard the hostess turn a few parties away as they were booked solid for the evening).  The Food: AWESOMENESS!! We both had the Premier Fondue Dinner (multi-course) which started with their house salad (sad that there were no tomatoes but the dijon-mustard vinaigrette dressing was sooo good!) and yummy cheese fondue. For the main course, we chose Prince Geja's Combination which came with shrimp (my fave of the night), scallops, chicken, beef tenderloin, and lobster-tail. And finally, flaming chocolate fondue with s'mores!! I suggest you check your coat (complimentary) as our clothes, hair, and even my purse (which still smells 4 days later) all smelled of deep fried food. The one complaint I had was that the restaurant was too cold even after our waitress closed the vent above our table. It's definitely not an everyday type of restaurant but nice for a romantic evening out!
