I have been to multiple locations, each one is consistently great. Their menu is extensive and they have a buffet style set-up. I have never eaten anything I didn't enjoy here, but their falafel is what keeps me coming back so much. It is the best falafel I have ever eaten. Their food is always extremely fast, fresh, and cheap. The only downside to this restaurant is that they only accept cash.
