This is a good casual place to grab a wine flight and some decent priced cheese. I've been here about a dozen times over the past year, so I guess you could say for a city this size, that makes me a frequent diner.  Experiences here vary like the weather on a day to day basis in Chicago. You never know what to expect. I have to say, as much as I love the black truffle oil cheese, most of the time...the service stinks.  The bus boys are ON TOP OF IT...picking up empty glasses the moment that the last drop of wine hits your lips. In my opinion, that makes me feel a little rushed. Servers on the other hand are sparse, and sometimes I feel I might drink more if I was offered another glass of wine. Most cases, I end up asking for it myself after i've flagged someone down. Maybe the manager can work on evening out the bus boy/server ratio? Last time I was in, and the reason I decided to write a review was a sight that I am having trouble blocking out of my mind: Cockroaches (plural, 2) crawling across the dining room floor in mid day....you know what that means! Maybe I ought to find a good cheese shop and buy my cheese somewhere else, that I can't the see bugs...ew.
