My dear friend is a huge beer geek so this was the pefect place to take him for an early birthday dinner. He had his choice of hundreds of craft beers and I was able to partake in some super yummy food. I couldn't tell you what he drank but I was thrilled to see the Goose Island Green Line on tap. All I remember is him telling me that he wants to come back and try the 120 minute IPA - apparently there are 120 IBUs in that thing? He had the duck reuben, I had the sweet potato pancakes, and our other friend had the duck meatballs and french fries. I never heard one complaint throughout the meal and I think we all left the restaurant quite satiated, slightly tipsy, and our wallets still intact. All in all, a fabulous place. The downside? Way too far up north.
