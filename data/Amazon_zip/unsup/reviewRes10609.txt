Wow, the service sucked. Absolutely sucked. That is why I gave this only two stars. The food and outdoor patio were great. But I just could not get over the service. And there was plenty of wait staff on the floor. Once we sat down and placed our drink order, our server disappeared for almost an hour. We had to call over another server in order to put in our order. And that is when our guy reappeared - maybe afraid of losing the tip???? It took us TWO HOURS to get our entrees from the time we sat down. Service SUCKED and that will make me think again before going back. Let's face it, there are plenty of great Italian restaurants here in the city, this was not one of them Friday night.
