I went with 2 friends who I haven't seen in years and we were just catching up for a bit and did not want to order quite yet, but our server was very pushy and seemed annoyed with us. He came around after we said we needed more time and just gave us even more attitude. We all work in the industry, 2 of which are from Vegas and work in clubs and bars, and we were completely taken back by this service. He took our order and only came back once we were finished and try to to be all friendly when asking if we wanted dessert. Seriously dude? Could you not tell how we were not happy what so ever.Moving on, the food was amazing. And that is why I had to give it one star....otherwise I would have given it zero if I could. Love the sushi it was the only thing that kept me from not complaining.I want to go back and try more food but if we have the same server trust me I will be walking out.
