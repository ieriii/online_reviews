I would disagree with most here. There deep dish is so doughy its unreal and lacks flavor. Maybe the thin is much better. lou's, unos, ginos, art of pizza are much better choices for true chi pie. Maybe this place is just a hipster joint that receives undeserved high ratings but i don't care for it. To each their own.
