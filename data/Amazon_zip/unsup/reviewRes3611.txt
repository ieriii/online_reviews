I have been going to Crisp since this past summer when I was wooed in by the sign out in front advertising Fuhnke chicken and Korean burritos. 6 months later and I still try to go once a week. My favorite is going at lunch for the lunch special Steak Bowl, just the Korean style beef, green onions, rice, and the Allison's hot sauce (a cream based spicy creation) and a drink for $7 or so. Best when you eat it there and its hot but still good taking it to go as well. I also enjoy their fried chicken, usually the half-chicken is enough for a meal, or the lunch special wings and fries. I prefer the Crisp BBQ sauce (seems based on the red bibimbop sauce) but the Seoul Sassy has a much more Asian feel and is still good. My other staple is the Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl - the Bibimbop with a bunch of veggies and a fried egg, paying extra for beef and organic brown rice. It's a little filling, but oh so good. You can find pop by the can in the fridge and also upgrade for another $1 for Vitamin water or some fancier drinks. I'll stick with the Diet Dr. Pepper.  Love it.
