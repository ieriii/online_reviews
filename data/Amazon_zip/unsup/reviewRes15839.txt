Came for restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised. Place was packed on a Sat night, and we had to wait quite a bit despite having made a reservation. With a big group, we got to sample everything on the RW menu (there were only 2 choices for each course anyways). The arugula salad was a tad salty but otherwise pretty refreshing. I did not try the black bean soup but heard positive feedback. It was the seafood stew that made me fall in love. There were two big pieces of fish, lots of clams and mussels, all cooked to perfection, sitting in a flavorful broth/sauce that was so well executed I could almost taste the different ingredients/herbs that went into it. My only quibble was there wasn'e enough of that for me to mop up with bread. The other entree choice was a pork & rice dish that was also very flavorful with fork tender pork (and lots of it). Diners with heavier palates will prefer the pork. Desserts didn't not shine as the entrees. Both the ice cream sandwich and pecan cake were too sweet, though the pecan cake had a nice, crumbly texture. Overall a pleasant meal, would definitely come back outside RW since their regular menu isn't too pricey and the portions are very generous. Dining room was not very good for conversation, but I guess that's part of the vibe.
