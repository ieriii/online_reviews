I stayed at this hotel last weekend and it was a mixed experience. Perhaps I should have done more research before choosing to book here but my family had had a good experience a few years back so I trusted their opinion. The valet parking was more than we would have liked to spend. Thankfully, I knew of a parking structure a few blocks away that was less expensive. The elevators were so tiny and besides the lobby, the whole place looked old school to the point of run down. I like a good old school hotel but this was to the point of it looking like it wasn't well kept. The bedroom was fine but had a lot of window dressing in my opinion. The bed was comfy but the carpeting had some issues. The shower had rust spots and made me question the cleanliness of the bathroom. Overall, it was a decent experience but I think we would either upgrade our room or look for other options.  I can't give it a great rating but won't give it a horrible rating either. PRO'S: Proximity to Michigan Ave Lobby Area CON'S: Check in on the 2nd floor (fairly confusing) Cleanliness of the bathroom Price of Parking
