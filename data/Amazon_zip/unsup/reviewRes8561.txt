my favorite foodie friends took me here on friday. and i am SO happy they did. it took a little while to get seated, but i barely noticed since the owner came by and gave everyone waiting little bits of cheese, pizza, etc. to nibble on. i am easily placated with treats. and the smoked mozzarella did it for me. and the black truffle pizza that he brought by made me fall in love with him immediately.  so we ate. get the eggplant appetizer. it's seriously tasty stuff.  the pizzas were tasty. the crust was the perfect combo of crispy and chewy. and the toppings were fresh and man, the bufela pizza just rocked. the porcini with proscuitto pizza on special was tremendous as well...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  we were too full for dessert, but it all sounded amazing and i'm sure it would be fresh and tasty.
