my boyfriend and i found this place on accident. we had planned to eat somewhere else but it was closed. we saw that the whole restaurant was full so of course we were curious. the food was great. you have to try the dill rice and kabobs. i can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu because everyones food looked so wonderful.
