If you are looking for authentic italian ( forget this place !!! ) I just moved recently to chicago and still searching authentic Italian food . I am oriinally from Italy and wanted to try this place reading the reviews.Atmosphere looks good. Prices look ok , But careful. !!! what you see on the menu is not what you actually get. I ordered mozzarella di bufala and got pecorino cheese instead. I also orderd salumi di cinghiale and got salami. 3 slices each - 12 Dollars. What !! Asked the waitress about it and she admited that most people get it confused. Well, then change the names on the menu.. Its like asking for a glass of water and getting lemonade. Also oredered pizza. Way to small not crunchy and all. Pizza and Costco is better :) Wine list is good but way overprized. Too many chefs and nobody speaks Italian. Very dissapointed in my culture in chicago in little Italy. But I will keep on searching.
