A little cramped inside and the seating situation was a little funky. We got a number before we ordered our food & were confused on where to go! Ordered chips, salsa & gauc- all very good, but kinda pricy for the amount of food you get. One of the best salsas I have had in a while. I ordered the carnitas torta (Tuesday's special of the day) & it was really good. The churros were delicious. I would love to go back!
