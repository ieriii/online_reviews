Although I had to wait half an hour for my sausage, it was well worth it. I had the mushroom and Swiss cheese pork sausage with chili-garlic mustard, "ducky" shiitake mushrooms and Esrom cheese. The sausage was perfectly cooked, full of flavor with shades of red wine. The Esrom cheese, a bit sour, is something I would never eat on its on. It complements the strong flavors of the sausage quite well, however. The interior was a bit packed, and I had to sit on a stool by the window. With the business they are getting, I feel that they should upgrade the space. Nonetheless, I will have to come back to try duck sausage with foie gras and intriguing duck fat fries.
