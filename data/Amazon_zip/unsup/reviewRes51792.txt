I have been dying for this place to open! They were supposed to open in September, but just opened last week. It sucked, but whatever, it's so well worth the wait! When we got there on this past saturday night, it was incredibly busy, which I was happy about for support on local businesses, but we got seated pretty fast (there was just the two of us though, so that's why) The chips and salsa was very good. The salsa is fresh and they refill it for you. We ended up getting a pitcher of strawberry margaritas and I was determined to finish it. We both got a dinner combination, which was i think 9 or 8 dollars each but it more than filled us up and enough to take home. For the price and the amount of food they give you for it is really affordable. The pitcher of margaritas cost around $27, but it gave us enough for four drinks each, full to the top! It's a cute place and the remodeling opened it up alot. I love this place, we go to it all the time! I take my friends here and to Bowman's when they come to visit, and they all love it as well!
