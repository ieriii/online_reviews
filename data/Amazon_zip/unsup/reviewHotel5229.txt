The Ritz is so full of lustre! They make me want to use the french spelling of words.The kind of people that can generally afford the Ritz are the kind of people that mind their own business, and I like that. They do not smile at me as they walk by. They leave me be.I really like how the staff knows all the guests first and last names. Talk about custom service! They're inquiries about my background made me feel really special.The concierge makes great use of the internet so you do not have to. How wonderful! They can find anything you need on that crazy world wide web! Oh, and the security guys...boy did they make me feel safe. Being very sure to determine who was a guest and who was not for my safety. Wow.Parking was $37. Is that not to be expected though? They take your car for you AND bring it back to you! You can not beat that kind of hospitality.The Ritz still has its' sparkle!
