So delicious! Everything on the menu looked fantastic, but my eyes went straight to the pumpkin ravioli in burnt butter/sage sauce. This is one of my favorit dishes, and ST did not disappoint! It was a perfect pasta dish, and they did not skimp on the portion! The calamari was standard but yummy, and the wine list is legitimate and well priced. The service was good, and the candlelit tables and dimmed lighting created a great atmosphere for a romantic dinner or a Saturday night outing. My one complaint is that there is nowhere to wait, really. Before we were seated we waited in the tiny entrance along with the horde other soon to be patrons. There is a table right at the entrance and a few comments went around about how terrible it would be to sit there. The crowd was literally inches from the table. As hungry as we were, we would have waited for the next table had that top been ours.
