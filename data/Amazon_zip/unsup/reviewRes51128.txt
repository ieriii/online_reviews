As a vegan, I tend to visit places like Karyn's Cooked and The Chicago Diner more than anywhere else, but when I get a taste for black bean cakes with mango salsa and sauteed spinach, I head to Wishbone. They have a few vegetarian options, and can make quite a few items vegan with only a few tweaks. Make sure you call before you go, since the kitchen closes at some point in the middle of the day (I can't remember the exact times), and on the weekends you can only order from the brunch menu until very late in the day. Avoid Wishbone on Sunday mornings, when bratty kids dominate the place (my own children sit and stare in bewilderment at how other parents allow their children to behave).
