My best girl friend and I wanted a great byob spot for dinner, I found this little ditty on yelp. We walked in on a Tuesday night, sat down right away, and was greeted right away. Our server was enthusiastic and charming. Very charming! We had the calamari salad, it was a bit salty but every bit deelish. We had a special gnocchi that wasnt on the menu, and it was a great large portion. This is a great date spot. I will definatly return here over and over. The only downfall of the night was the horrible music in the background.
