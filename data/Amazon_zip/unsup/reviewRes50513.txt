This is the restaurant that beats the entire city of New Orleans at its own game! Tasty food, great drinks, amazing people, you cannot beat Big Jones for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner! Their Gumbo is the best (literally better than any I had in NOLA). I love that they have added some tastings to the menu this winter because they have such an amazing palette of food. I'm trying to think of something wrong with the place and really, there isn't much. It can get loud when they are busy, but it is a happening place so its not surprising. It can get a bit crowded too. Now, that said they have spread their seating out well enough that this is not a huge issue but it can come up from time to time. One item of note is no place to put your coats in winter. Kinda nit-picky but thats all that they do wrong. Nothing else is bad. Seriously. Great food. Great drinks. Great people. What else can you ask for?
