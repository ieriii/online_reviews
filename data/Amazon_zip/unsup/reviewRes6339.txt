Davanti is fantastic! Wonderful wine list, great variety, and the food is consistently excellent. However, one of the best kept secrets is their burger and a Peroni special on Monday night for 10 bucks. It's a pretty lofty statement because Chi-town has lots of great burger joints, but their burger easily ranks among the city's best!
