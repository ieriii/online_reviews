I had to deduct a star. I can't rate this place five stars in good conscience. I'm still a fan, but I have to get real about this reviewing business. Garcia's is where you go when you've been drinking (or playing monopoly, I guess) late at night and you just want a fish taco or two. Don't bother dining in. The service isn't great, and I personally think the tacos taste better after they've been wrapped up for carry-out. Their salsa is really excellent, but overall the food just can't compare with places like Las Palmas, Los Nopales, or El Tapatio.
