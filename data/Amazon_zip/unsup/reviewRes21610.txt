So happy! I wanted to go to my stand by Mi Tierra... my dining companion - shall remain nameless - demanded something new. Now I don't mind change but I really didn't need to be disappointed with this meal. It had been a challenging day. The decor is pleasant. The servers friendly and attentive. It is the food and beverage that were tops. I usually order too much to get what I want other places. On the menu at #6 are all of my faves together on one lovely platter! The cheese burrito was tasty, nothing special. The flank steak half was PERFECTLY cooked. The real stand out was the best Chile Relleno ever. It was tender and wonderfully crispy. The disappointment is usually the batter, not here. I will be back again and again. The drinks were tasty. We had Sangria and Margaritas. I would order either again based on the special of the day. I love a good deal. The flan was good as well. I had coffee and an after dinner drink. It was such a lovely meal. I can hardly wait to go again.
