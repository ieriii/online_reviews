I went to Icosium (how do you spell it?) on a Sunday mid-day - teeny tiny place - so I find it hard to believe people have rated it "good for groups" good luck to you I say! Reminded me of a NY place- everyone sitting elbow to elbow - but you get used to it - and you can sit next to some obnoxious 20-something I Have it all figured out consultant girls - and think - this is who will be taking care of me in my old age.... sigh We had two lunch type crepes - one with brie and escargot - another with Merguez (lamb sausage) and they were both delicious - however - to amplify what others said - it was s  l  o  w  service - the Owner/Chef (?) walks around trying to work the room - but all I wanted to say to him was HEY! Go make my DARN Crepe! We had apricot iced tea - but it was not very apricotty - so next time I will try one of their other standards. When the crepes arrived -they were YUMMY as Rachel Ray would say. However they could do something with presentation - maybe a small fruit salad - rather than the wilting bit of cantaloupe on my visit. I am proud to say - we both entered the clean plate club! Then - for science and for this review - we felt COMPELLED to try the Belgium Chocolate and Raspberries Crepe.... Decadent! LOVED it!  Overall this place is fun and great - if you can get used to the cramped space and the slowness. Prices are REASONABLE - and Algerian Decor and Music they were playing was great.
