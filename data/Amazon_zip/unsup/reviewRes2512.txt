Honestly, the food is great. Doug is a great guy and the reviews are pretty accurate. However, what's the minimum wait nowadays? 45 minutes to an hour?  I'm sorry, this is a standard vienna beef dog with above average fries. This is something you can get at a dozen hot dog stands within a 5 mile radius of this place. Therefore, for those of us who can't plan our days around standing in line at a local hot dog stand, this place is simply not accessable. Man I miss when this place wasn't as popular and located in RV.
