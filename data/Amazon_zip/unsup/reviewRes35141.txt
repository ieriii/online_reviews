This place is really, really good. I've been about 3 times within the past month, and every time has been awesome. I can't believe that I've missed this place the hundreds of millions of times I've been through the intersection, but that doesn't really matter now because I've found it. And hot damn am I glad that I did. Happy hour is just that, a jubilant, wondrous sushi-licious hour (or two, if you are so inclined) to munch on some scrumptious, luscious, discount sushi goodness. The salmon tempura roll is divine with astoundingly buttery, melt in your mouth texture that should be experienced as often as possible. The crab rangoon roll is magnanimously, ridiculously good, and is therefore my favorite. How it can actually be defined as sushi is a mystery, but as a lover of all things cheese oriented and delicious, I really don't care. Overall a great place to go to get top-notch (albeit more than slightly unconventional) sushi. And it's byo, so bring it.
