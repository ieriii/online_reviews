Great, uplifting atmosphere for a lazy Sunday. Maybe it's the bright interior and bustling crowd. Whatever you decide, make sure to include a side of the potato pancakes!! Delish! Expect generous portions and flavorful food. The omelets and frittatas are solid choices. My friend got the South Beach specialty, which is half a pineapple filled with fresh fruit, yogurt, granola and walnuts; it was incredibly refreshing, although the portion is a bit much for one person. Maximize the deliciousness consumed by sharing amongst your dining companions! I haven't come across a bad dish yet.
