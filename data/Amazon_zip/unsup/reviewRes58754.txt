It was quirky and interesting- a very casual atmosphere with playful but sophisticated food. The combinations were original. I felt overall it was a little contrived, my salad for instance was presented in wedges which looked great but actually left solid parts of lettuce undressed which I didn't care for. My colleague ordered a dish which sounded like a baked potato but was actually a soup with the same flavors. I think it would be a very fun place to go with a date, but it was not exactly right for the business dinner I needed.
