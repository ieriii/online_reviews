I truly believe that how a business recovers is as important as doing it right the first time. It was amazing to be called to the front desk this afternoon only to find the owner of the restaurant there to meet me and to apologize for the experience. WOW! I give Kudo's to Mir to taking time out of his day to come to my office and apologize about the service and pricing. We will definitely give them another chance.
