Love this place. have been here 5-7 times in the last two year and have never been disappointed. BYOB is always a good thing, but they go out of their way to encourage it and make you feel good about bringing your own bottles in. Service has always been great. Food is amazing, Food Portions are large, and the owner always takes time to say hello and ask how things are. Have taken family members from out of town here and will continue to head here once every few months....
