Stopped by this stylish indian restaurant on a rainy Thursday evening. The Lamb Pasanda was the best I have ever tasted. The portions are generous; plan on leaving with a take out bag with what will probably be your lunch for the next two days. Service was very attentive and friendly. The only complaint I have is that I'm so full my tummy hurts.
