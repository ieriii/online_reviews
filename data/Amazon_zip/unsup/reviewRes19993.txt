Scrump-Diddly-Umptious. I honestly don't exactly remember what we ordered, but I do remember that we ordered a lot of sushi. And it was all great! And it's BYOB, which is a plus. The place is chic and sophisticated, yet at the same time very relaxing. However, the tables are a little too close together. I overheard a little too much info on what the couple at the table over were gonna do afterwards... But all in all...Coast...go there.
