I'm so glad I finally got a chance to try Glenn's. I hear it was on the Food Network recently, and that's a great thing. First of all, we did get a similar reception from the hostess as someone mentioned below. I probably should/could have made a reservation, but we were there at 5:30. I realize that for the First Catch, there are probably a good number of people trying to nab a table before 6. However, I think there are nicer ways of asking if we had a reservation of not. That was really the only "downfall" of the evening. My boyfriend and I both had the First Catch. I had mine with tilapia, he the trout. What I found really pleasing was that everything seemed a step above what they could have used in terms of ingredients. The clam chowder was delicious...creamy, hearty and not too salty. The salad, while simple, was used not with iceberg lettuce, or wimpy slices of cucumber, but with dark greens, ripe tomatoes, and homemade (?) thick cut croutons. Our fish was cooked to perfection, and while I don't claim to know the difference between fish being flown in daily or a couple of day old fish, this seemed extremely fresh. I thought the green beans and carrots our server mentioned as the vegetable side would be drab. Instead, I was happy to munch on crisp wax beans and baby carrots. The potatoes were nicely seasoned. It gets a little crowded with people milling around waiting to be seated, but overall, atmosphere was nice. Our server was friendly and available. I don't think I've been to a restaurant in the city quite like this, one that specializes in a large variety of fresh fish. Plus, who can beat $12.95???
