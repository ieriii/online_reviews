Ethiopian food is filling. As an Ethiopian food neophyte I was surprised myself. Maybe my friend and I ordered a wee bit too much food for just the two of us but chances are if I went back I would probably do it all again! We started with the sambussa appetizer (like an Indian samosa almost) sampler which include tuna, chicken, beef, spinach, lentils...they were tasty. We needed them too because though we had a reservation we still had to wait 15 minutes...then had to wait more time to order...then had to wait even longer (was it really an hour?!) before we got our drinks. It was an insanely busy evening I'm sure due in part to the recent Groupon but service was SO slow. Food was good but I'm sure the long wait and hungry bellies made everything taste that much better! The vegetarian/meat messob was the entree and seriously the portion for 2 could have easily fed 4. Lots of spongy pita (injera?) to scoop up all the hearty entrees was divine. My belly was so full and the honey wine was the perfect compliment (though ask for a sample first because its not for everyone!)
