this place was amazing. perfect. it's everything I ever wanted in a southern food restaurant. I ate fried green tomatoes, and eggs new orleans and sweet potato fries and green goddess dressing and cute little cornbread looking biscuits and pomegranate sweet tea. I felt like a character from Fried Green Tomatoes. One of my favorite meals ever. Definitely going back. I think of it as a really good place to go with lady friends especially for some reason.
