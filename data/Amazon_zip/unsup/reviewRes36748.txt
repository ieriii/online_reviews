Until recently I lived right around the corner from Indie Cafe, so I've been there on several different occasions. All in all this is a decent restaurant with good food, reasonable prices, and dependable service. I'd say the sushi is a little more impressive than the Thai menu, but for the most part everything I've had was good. The place itself is clean and well decorated and you can't go wrong with BYOB. My only complaint is that I've ordered Pad Thai twice and it's been greasy and somewhat tasteless. Considering it's one of the most basic staples of Thai food, I would have expected better from Indie Cafe. If you want to be on the safe side, the sushi or the curry dishes are a solid bet.
