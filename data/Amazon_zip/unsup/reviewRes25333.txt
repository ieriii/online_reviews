Say the words "Chicago-style deep dish pizza" and most of us out-of-towners are thinking about Gino's East or Giordano's. Some are familiar with Lou Malnatti's, which is a fine establishment, and superior to those first two names. But the money spot is Pequod's Pizzeria. It's not even a contest. Everything is FRESH and done big. The crust is caramelized -- you will never eat a better pie crust in all your days. May I recommend the sausage - great flavor, and hearty. You won't leave Pequod's hungry. This place is a banging value, too. Call in your order ahead of time, because it's bound to be packed. We tried the garlic cheese bread and onion rings, too -- both were phenomenal. Do not leave Chicago without trying Pequod's. Do it.
