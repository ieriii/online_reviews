perfect place for a romantic getaway! ;) stayed here with my boyfriend for valentines day and we were pleasantly surprised. the room was very romantic and modern. large space, great view, ceiling to floor windows and a very comfortable king size bed. everything about this hotel we loved, yet there were a few minor suggestions we think that the hotels website should mention before booking. would not say this is a family oriented hotel. i would not recommend this hotel for people that are not open with sharing, hearing, and seeing everything that would normally go on behind closed doors. this is because the bathroom door in the room did not close fully which made it kind of awkward to use the bathroom. also the shower did not have a door, which means if you don't have the heat on full blast you will freeze to death. yet, since i did stay with my boyfriend this room was very romantic and perfect for couples. will be back :)
