The food was just okay (way overrated). One of our hot dogs even came out really burnt. The worst part of this experience was the customer service. This was the first restaurant I've been to where the servers AND the owner were plain rude. The owner, who took our order, was rushing us to order and gave us such a bad attitude. Then, when we tried to get seated, one of the employees there showed us his bad attitude. All I have to say is this: The food was too mediocre to put up with such terrible customer service. I'm sure they think they're popular so they probably feel no need to impress the customers, but I would never go back there again. I never saw a single friendly face there. Everyone looked like they hated their jobs there. If you're looking for a good hot dog joint in Chicago, I'd recommend you go elsewhere if you're looking to have a pleasant experience. (I've had better in Chicago-I just can't remember their names anymore since it's been so many years.) I really hope that the staff at Hot Doug's will read this comment and seriously re-evaluate how they run their business, especially the owner. If he doesn't provide good customer service, then it's not surprising that his employees don't either.
