Highlights: - 8 course meal was amazing, creative, tasty, unique. - BYOB! - Service was great, food came out lightning fast and servers were descriptive and helpful The space is not what I was expecting at all, it's a lot smaller and very intimate. I'm so happy they did a groupon and we got a chance to try this place. The food was so creative and very fresh and so many flavors hitting your mouth at the same time. But what I really loved was the service. We had a groupon and they treated us with total respect. You know how those coupon haters out there can be. Not only that, we had an additional $10 off for using it on a Tuesday, which we had to remind them of but after we did, they said they had another couple in earlier that night that they were going to call and give them $10 back! AND as we were chatting with the owner(?), we asked for their extra wine bottles and he happily went to the back and got 6 bottles for us and mentioned how they also were collecting wine corks for a couple's wedding. I just think these people are so nice! Not fake nice, just good people. But go for the food, it is a little pricey but it's a special place and worth the experience.
