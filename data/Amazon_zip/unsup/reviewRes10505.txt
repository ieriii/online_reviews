Last time I went to Piece I had only planned on grabbing a quick late-morning beer BUT, ended up staying and ordering lunch... then kept on drinking through the afternoon and stayed for dinner too. Seriously, my mate and I spent about $300 in there that day. It kind of felt like tailgating (with karaoke). Needless to say, whenever people visit me in Chicago, I take them to Piece. The pizza is delicious no matter what you order. Last night a friend from Germany flew in and we headed to Piece with luggage in tow. We did white pizza with sausage, tomatos, roasted red peppers, and mushrooms. The sausage was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. The roasted red peppers were tasty but could have had more "roasted" flavor and the tomatos were perfectly ripe. The white pizza added a delicious buttery/olive-oily flavor. In addition to the pizza, we tried several different types of beer. My mate was impressed with the selection of bottled beers and I was most impressed with the seasonal "festivus" beer. If you like dark beers, this is THE place to go in Wicker Park. My family will be here next week and I will be taking them all to Piece. it's a no-fail great place for food, drinks, and fun atmosphere!
