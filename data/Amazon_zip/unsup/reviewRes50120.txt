Not to be confused with the 40/40 club in New York. Yea. I honestly thought it was like a branch location of Jay-Z's New York Nightclub. I came in with a camera looking to take a picture with Jay. Honest Mistake. Well, I didn't find Jay, Freeway, Kid Capri, Memphis Bleek, or the rest of the Rock-a-Fella Crew sipping on champagne, I did find really good food. I was shocked by their wings and cheese fries. Seriously. It kind of weird-ed me out in a good way. I think they feed their chickens protein shakes. The wings are insanely huge and so delicious. I am a huge fan (or was a huge fan!) of Buffalo Joes in Evanston....until I had these wings. The wings at Joes are soo tiny now. ugh. Their cheese fries are served in this huge platter with melted cheddar...not that fake cheese sauce that grosses me out. Overall a good neighborhood sports bar. I would go again.
