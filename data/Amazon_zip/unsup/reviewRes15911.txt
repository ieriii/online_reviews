Aaaaand my My 200th review goes to the tried and true...Carnivale. The food is here is always good and the drinks even better! Sangria highly recommended. Everything I have ever tried has made my tummy sing. I'm more of a carnivore when it comes to Latin Food so one of my fav dishes would have to be the oh so tender adobo (def a pork dish). I love anything that melts in my mouth - less effort to the goodness. But I can't hate on the fish tacos either - thank the heavens for a good fish taco in Chicago. All together now: Thank you, Heavens!!! Never a bad meal. Never bad service. Always good and fun. That's how I like it - keep it up, Carnivale! But pllleeeeaaaase bring back the garlic potato salad...pleeeease!!!
