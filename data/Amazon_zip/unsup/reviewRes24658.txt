Hands down our MOST favorite Catalonian/spanish restaurant in the city! I celebrated my birthday there and a couple of other occasions, including showing off the great city dining to out of town friends! The chef is an Iron Chef - nuff said. when you order you really have to ask the waiter what dishes the Chef won the Iron Chef for - i forget which ones exactly, but if you ask the waiter they will gladly tell you! My favorites are the flat bread with beef shortrib and the shrimp one is also very good. Potatoes bravas, they're little balls on a narrow plate with spicy mayo underneath, lamb chops - amazing, the jamon/serrano ham salad, dates wrapped in bacon, grilled octopus, jumbo shrimp...pretty much everything is awesome at this place. It keeps me coming back and never disappoints. Except for the service, sometimes. Usually you have to wait a long time for the bread that they bring you, which is almost like a bruschetta ... and recently they started charging if you ask them to bring extra. :(((  It's in south loop, on 8th and Michigan...street parking a'plenty around there. It's inside the Marriott Blackstone hotel.  Definitely recommend! Thumbs up
