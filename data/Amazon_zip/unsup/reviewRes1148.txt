Awesome variety of sausages that lives up to the hype. Duck Fat fries are closest thing you'll find to In N' Out fries in Chicago, but only on the weekends. Prepare to wait in line for at least 2 hours if you show up after they open on a weekend. Did the tourist thing when a buddy was in town to check out the hype and stood in line from 12-3. Between two people we spent $47 on about 6 or 7 sausages and two orders of duck fat fries. Overall, its a good place to order a bunch of different things and share. Tried the foie gras and it wasn't my thing, but hey, I tried it.
