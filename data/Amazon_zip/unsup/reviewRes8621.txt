the finale and highlight of a my trip to chicago. i dont claim to be an expert on brazillian bbq, but ive been to a few other places and none of them even comes close to the magic that is fogo de chao. being in chicago, most locals might not appreciate the quality of the food served. being from a place where a they dare call a slab of tofu a burger, i was in heaven. i tried 12 of the 13 cuts, sevral of them multiple times. leave me alone, im a pig i know. i dont think theyve ever seen a 5' 6", SKINNY asian male eat so much. the gauchos seemed just as impressed with my digestive abilities as i was with their food. unfortunately, i dont visit chicago enough, thankfully they have a fogo de chao in southern california, not TOO far from me, i guess.
