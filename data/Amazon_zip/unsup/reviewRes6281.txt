I love this place. I've only lived in Chicago for 3 months but have been here twice already and am dying to go back! The food is terrific, not your usual Italian restaurant. Every thing was amazing but my favorite items were the focaccia, the egg and spinach ravioli, and the avocado, tomato, and watermelon salad. The polenta was also great and the ragu sauce that goes on top changes daily. There are several vegetarian items but also many with meat or fish as well. You can't make reservations but the wait is worth it. For less wait, I'd try weekdays either early or later. I went on a Tuesday at 7 and had to wait for an hour.
