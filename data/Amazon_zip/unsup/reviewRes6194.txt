Really, Really happy with this place! We went here on a Friday night around 5PM- we were in the city so we figured "why not!". They do not take reservations so dining at off hours is ideal if you want to be seated without a wait. We walked right in and were seated immediately... there were only 2 other tables occupied when we got there. The menu is designed to share and everything comes in smaller plates. I like this since I can never decide what I want! My hubby and I had: the ricotta and honey, the egg toast with truffles and asparagus, a salad with apple and hazelnut with a delicious vinaigrette, the polenta and pork shoulder ragu and a pasta dish with Italian Sausage and tomato.  Everything we had was really good but the standout for me was the egg toast with truffles... SO GOOD! My husband loved his pasta dish as well and the polenta is served table-side on a wooden paddle- very cool presentation and delicious. We finished our feast off with the carrot cake dessert- OMG, it was the best carrot cake I have ever had. I will be back just for the carrot cake alone! Very reasonable prices for the food and the wine! The restaurant doubles as a wine shop so the price per bottle is a steal and you only pay a 7$ corkage fee. For all of the food we had, and a good bottle of wine- the total was 115$.  By the time we left at 6:30- the place was packed! So if you are driving from the burbs or don't feel like a wait... get there early.  Another plus- street parking right in front of the restaurant.  I really enjoyed this restaurant and will be back soon!
