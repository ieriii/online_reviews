It's nice to see my old stomping grounds transition into a up and coming area. If Bridgeport was like this years ago, I would have never left!  I love the fact that this place is located right off the neighborhoods. When Diner, Drive-ins and Dives promoted this joint, I was totally on the board to try this place if I ever came back to visit...so I did! I loved the cozy and laid back atmosphere. I could see myself having brunch and kickin' back with friends. I'm totally on board with the farm to table concept as well. I feel better eating food that is fresh and organic and not to mention, the food just taste BETTER! The meals consisted of the Oyster Po-Boy sandwich with duck fat potatoes, pulled pork sandwich, chicken sandwich and mac & cheese. All and all, it was all a satisfying meal. The portions are very generous and you leave FULL. Can't say too much about the service...maybe a little discontentment while working around the holidays, perhaps? Oh well, their food made up for it.
