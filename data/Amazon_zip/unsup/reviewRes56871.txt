The food was great. We went with 6 people and they honored our reservation immediately. The thing I didn't like was that as soon as we sat down they handed us these large menus. That was before they asked if we wanted a drink. It made us all feel like we were being rushed to look at the menu, place an order, eat and leave. We were there to dine and have a relaxing evening. My advice to them would be to let us settle in with a drink or bottle of wine and then ask if we are ready to look at the menu.
