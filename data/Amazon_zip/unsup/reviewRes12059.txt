I have been waiting to come here, but I've been lazy. A friend came into town and I found myself walking into this place, and I was very excited to try this place out. For starters, the decor is amazing. it's spacious but cozy, and it was busy on a Friday night. I ordered an original Mojito and the Ropa Vieja (I am a complete sucker for Cuban food). The mojito was the best I have EVER had, and it was seriously perfect. The ropa vieja was tender, and the plate was huge. We also had an appetizer of bacon wrapped dates. They were good, but just a bit too sweet for me. No worries, though, we finished the plate! This place is perfect for small groups or going on a date with your S.O. The server was friendly, and I just really liked the vibe here. I will definitely be back to try other dishes!
