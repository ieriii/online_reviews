I am afraid to say that I am not a fan. As visitors, in search of a Chicago Hot Dog experience, this left something to be desired. Sure, the carhop service is a hoot, and relatively friendly. The whole thing is kind of great in a certain sense. But the dawgs themselves ... I get the nostalgia angle, really I do. However, the food suffers from being stuffed into a little box like that. I end up with steamed fries, a squashed hot dog bun, and a really messy meal that I have to work hard not to get all over myself and the rental car. Maybe I'm asking too much of a fast food joint. But from a purely food-quality point of view, this has to be our worst hot dog of the trip.
