Demera is closer to my hood than many of the other Ethiopian restaurants in town, and just as good. It is great for big groups. The last time I went we brought 5 kids and were especially accommodating, and very excited that we were introducing Ethiopian fare to them. The prices are very reasonable, and the food is delicious.
