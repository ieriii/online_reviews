I was referred to Violet Hour by a bartender from Nightwood after discussing my disappointment with the local Bar Scene. If you're looking for cocktails made the way they are supposed to be, by bartenders who are proud (but not pretentious) this is THE place. Every detail including the spirits, flavor ingredients, even the ice, is carefully crafted for a specific cocktail. It is pure old school drinking at it's best. If Charlie Trotter were a bartender, he'd be behind the bar at Violet Hour. Sit at the bar and allow this place to redefine your thoughts on what a cocktail should be all about.
