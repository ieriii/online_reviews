Wow, after reading all the reviews I was pumped to go to Wildfire. I have to say MAJOR disappointment. I've heard over and over about the short rib(S). Actually the menu should read SHORT RIB. If I had more than 3oz of meat I'd be surprised. I was expecting maybe 2 ? 3 ? maybe 4 being a short rib isnt that expensive a piece of meat. Well I had one the size of a couple breakfast sausages. 23.95 ? One little piece of meat on a plate with a bit of veg. I had to pick my jaw up off the table. My gal had the herb chicken and I could say about avg at best. Really I am disappointed with all the hype. May go one more time and give something else a try.
