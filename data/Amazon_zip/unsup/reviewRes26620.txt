This is a review of Nuevo Leon's catering. So I was in charge of getting food for my office holiday party, and I ended up going with Nuevo Leon. First, I like the food in the restaurant and figured catering should be on par with the in house experience. Second, it is dirt cheap. Like cheaper than fast food. For $6.95 a person, you get to choose three entrees, plus rice, beans, tortillas, chips, salsa, plates, napkins, and silverware. I was feeling greedy, so I added a tray of enchiladas, $1.25 per enchilada. We went with the bistec, chicken fajitas, pork ribs in chile verde, and cheese enchiladas in ancho chile sauce. All excellent. People seemed to really like the enchiladas and the ribs, though some were a bit reluctant to eat the saucy ribs with their hands. What a bunch of weiners. I know this sounds crazy, but the rice and beans here are really delicious, remarkably so, hence . . . these remarks. The secret ingredient is lard. Don't tell the vegetarians. Also, very large portions. We had a ton of food leftover. Except for the enchiladas, which were mobbed. You know this already, but this joint is cash only, so a little bit of a pain with a big catering order, but because it's so cheap, totally not a big deal. You have to order two days in advance. Also, delivery only if the group is 50+ people, and the delivery charge is $15. I thoroughly recommend the catering from here, I had another holiday party that was catered by Connie's, and it was more expensive, there was less food, and the quality was worse.
