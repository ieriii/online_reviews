I moved here from New York, so I'm used to just grabbing a slice. After being here for a bit I've been hankering for a slice. I went here to do just that. While they have the concept of interesting slices down they just don't execute. If it came right out of the oven the pizza would be good. But it sits under heat lamps and then they serve it right to you. Take the 3 minutes and throw it back in your oven for me.  I'm not even sure the the oven would help it get to that delish NY style slice, but it would def bump them up a star. - I updated after a kind email from the owner saying they will warm up slices if you ask. I think they should probably just do it all the time.. I look forward to trying out their chicken some time
