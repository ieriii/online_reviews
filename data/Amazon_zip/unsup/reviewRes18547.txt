Can't help it, I love Rick Bayless and I love this place. I always get the milanesa torta. It can do no wrong. About half the time I get chips and guac. Great stuff. Love all the agua frescas, I've tried many flavors. Had the churros a few times. They are good but not really my thing. Also had one of the hot chocolates, didn't love the one I chose. Love that they do takeout now, but once in awhile I wait in line and eat at the restaurant. Still waiting to bump into Rick!
