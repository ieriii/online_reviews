This place was literally like sushi heaven for me. The rolls were fresh and inventive and the sushi was like butter. My only caution to future patrons is that it is not cheap. Drinks start at about $10.00 each (not sure about BYOB) and rolls seemed to start at like $12.00. Basically it's delicious but know going in that you're going to pay for it.
