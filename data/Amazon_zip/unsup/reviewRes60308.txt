I do like Wakamono. It's in a great location and the Sushi is fine. BUT there are so many sushi places in the neighborhood let a lone within 5 blocks of this place that I don't understand why it is so expenisve. Our bill for two people was over $100 and I don't think we ate that much and we only had 4 beers.The sushi was good, but for the price I would rather go somewhere else. The service is just OK. As with most Sushi restaurants, I don't think the service is ever amazing. The atmosphere inside is very cool although it was nice out so we sat outside. Some jack trying to parallel park hit the planter that outlined their patio made the glasses on our table fall over. The server looked at us like we purposely knocked them over so that we could be covered in beer. All in all, it was OK.
