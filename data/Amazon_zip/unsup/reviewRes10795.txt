Haven for the broke and hungry...and the more pizza you get, the better value you get. Ideal for groups. There are two generic pizzas you can choose from - white and red. White is my favorite. You can also mix and match toppings. It's become so popular that it seems all of Wicker Park flocks there to pay homage to pizza on the weekends. When I go then, I usually wait anywhere between an hour to an hour and a half. Be sure to wait at a place where you can hear the hostess, because no one will come looking for you. That could use some work. Otherwise, go eat some pizza!
