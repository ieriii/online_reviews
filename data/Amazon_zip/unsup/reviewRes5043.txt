Came here for the second time today with my foodie friend. The wait was only 15 minutes however, it was 3:30 in the afternoon. A must try to start with is the whipped feta spread with cucumbers. It's a great appetizer to share for two. They bring extra bread to the table, which is awesome just by itself. We were really excited to try the fried prosciutto balls but they ran out for the day. It was only 3:30! So our waiter suggested we try the fried manchengo. This was so tasty! You can't really go wrong with scallops and Purple Pig satisfied our fix. There are three scallops on a skewer paired with a white aoili sauce. Yummm! We also shared the "JLT" with fried egg. We were not the biggest fans as the meat was a little too salty. The service is a little slow. He didn't really check on us and didn't fill our water until asked. We didn't even get his name. He also did not inform us that his shift was ending and a new server would take over our table. She however, was very attentive. All in all, I'll definitely come back. I think it's better to go in a smaller group and expect to wait atleast 40 minutes if you are trying to go for dinner.
