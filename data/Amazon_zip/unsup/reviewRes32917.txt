Food was excellent although we all agreed the appetizers were beyond amazing. I am torn between 3 and four stars because of the service. Waited at the bar for several minutes before either bartender asked if I wanted something to drink. Table service started slow, we had empty cocktails on the tables and no waitstaff to be found. But.....once the cocktail issue was resolved, waiter was attentiven and everything ran smoothly. We wanted for nothing for the rest of the evening. I will definitely go back again!
