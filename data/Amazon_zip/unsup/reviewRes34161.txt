I just got back from Yolk, and my experience was pretty uneven. We were a big old party of 18, there for an "engagement brunch", so maybe everything would have been different if I was just a guy trying to get some breakfast, but anyway... We'd made our reservation a couple weeks in advance, but they seemed somewhat surprised to see us all. I'm not one of those people who thinks a breakfast place sucks if you have to wait to be seated-- if it's a popular place, it's going to be crowded and you'll have to go during an off-peak time if you don't want to deal with the crowd. But Yolk definitely does not have enough spare room to deal with all the people lining up. When the first few people in our party started showing up, the host kept trying to jam them into the corner even though there was no more available standing room. One of us finally had to remind him to look at the reservation book again-- there were 18 of us coming, no more space to stand in, and it was already ten minutes past the reservation time. He finally sat us in two groups at two different tables (although they were next to each other). In my opinion, we'd had the reservation for long enough that they should have accommodated us better. Our waitress was great though-- one of those special souls who is able to deal with a big group in a crowded place without resorting to violence or profanity. And the food was pretty good, although nothing special. I "made my own" skillet and was pretty pleased with my handiwork. I also tasted the french toast, which was good. They do get extra points for letting us bring in champagne bottles to make mimosas (I didn't organize the event, so I'm not sure if that was arranged in advance). And the decor is cool, if you can see the walls through the masses of people-- sort of industrial chic. Overall... meh. Brunch wasn't bad, but it's such a challenge finding parking in the area, I'll probably consider a whole bunch of other places before I come back to Yolk.
