Super cute vintage place. Love the subway tiles and dinning rooms. A lot of the reviews said it was a glorified pub so I didn't really know what to expect but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. The place was clean, the service was great, the food came out SO FAST, and it was pretty darn good. My husband had the sausage trio with brie potatoes (delicious) and I had the Amish Chicken - the quinoa was DELICIOUS. I would have liked a bit more of the mixed greens and fontina cheese but it was just enough food to not be over stuffed. I had half of the chicken on my plate, they give you half a chicken - definitely enough for left overs! We would of loved to try the Brie fondue appetizer and mussles but weren't in the mood to be rolled out. Definitely give it a try.
