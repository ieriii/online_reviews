We used to live down the street from this place, and I still wish I'd have gone there more. Great atmosphere here; small restaurant/bar with lots of random stuff of the walls that they've accumulated over the past few decades. Probably one of the best selection of burgers I've ever seen, and I've liked every one I've ever had.  This place gets packed on the weekends. Honestly, I'd recommend a weeknight to try and sneak in here. Get the Gruntburger. Sure, it'll shave a week off your life to eat it. But really, what were you going to do with that extra week in your 90's?
