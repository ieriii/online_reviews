Garcia's is cheap sit down Mexican food. Been there a few times and it is always good. Chips & salsa are actually pretty good, too! Although the guacamole is a little funky. I think they add sour cream to it to make more. And I am super picky about my chicken but this place has pretty decent quality meat. Watch out for waits on Friday nights but you can always order To Go. And they are open really late so feel free to stop in on the way home from a bar!
