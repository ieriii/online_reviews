Gorgeous hotel, nicely appointed rooms, missing in-room wifi.  For a historic hotel, this one doesn't really feel dated or old. The rooms are nicely updated and of good size. The bars and restaurants are excellent, though pricey. The workout facility is large and updated, with a nice variety of equipment spread out over several rooms.  The staff were all friendly and helpful. The only complaint I had was the lack of in-room wifi. Otherwise, this is a very comfortable, well-located hotel.
