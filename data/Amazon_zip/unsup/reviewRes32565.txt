If you love Ethiopian but don't want to schlepp all the way to Edgewater, you've got a great option in Uptown at Demera. I've tried a few of the neighbors up north, as well as Demera, and they've all been equally good food and service-wise, although I especially love that the latter is so close. I usually go for the awaze tibs and dry tibs, which don't tend to vary much between restaurants, or even between Ethiopia and the States, and they were both hot, flavourful, and spicy--everything you could want in life on a plate of injera.
