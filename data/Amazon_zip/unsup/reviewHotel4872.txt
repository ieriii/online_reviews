Room 980 here. Perfect view of the lake, the fountain, the rising sun.Everything else is exactly how the others are reviewing it here. Except that i had plenty of hot water.Only reason to return is if it is at the super discount i got on this stay, too many other noteworthy landmarks to visit next time.
