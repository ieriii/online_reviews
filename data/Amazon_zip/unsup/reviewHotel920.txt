The Burnham has the best doormen in the city! They are so friendly and hail cabs for anyone! The Atwood Cafe is very busy, especially for lunch - you WILL need a reservation. The food is actually not all that fantastic, just decent. The location (right across the street from Marshall Fields) is a popular one.
