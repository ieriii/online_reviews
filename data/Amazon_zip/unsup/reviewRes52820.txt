Before you go: They don't take reservations unless your party is over 5 (even though on the phone they pretend to) And...it's BYOB Don't forget! Great service and our server was cordial, had recommendations and suggestions. Apps included the empanadas (MUST GET THESE!!!), the bruschetta (would skip next time) and plantains (ordinary). We also got some yuca by accident, which wasn't the best. Entrees however, were awesome! My boyfriend and I split the Surf & Turf and the steak was flavored and cooked perfect. A little light on the shrimp, they were small...but tasty! And by the time we were done, we were full. A friend had the fried pork chops and literally the pork was coming off the bone. Something I have to say I've never seen w/ a pork chop. Usually it's a hassle to get that tasty tender meat so close to the bone. Tasted it and it was heavenly. Didn't even taste fried...if that makes any sense. Perfectly seasoned. I'd skip the dessert here, if you've had your fill of drinks and food. The rice pudding was dry, but the coconut flan was pretty yummy! Would definitely go back again. The patio was pleasant and cozy. And parking is a breeze.
