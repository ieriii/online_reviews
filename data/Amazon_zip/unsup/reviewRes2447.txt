I cannot wait until saturdays or when i have a day off work to go to hot dougs, it literally makes my week. Had a go a hot dougs again today, got there a little late (3:15) i thought that they were open until 430, but it was only 4. Got in around 4:30 and doug was still smiling and serving everyone that came in. i had the moutain man and the gyro and beef sausage; both were wonderful. i just can't say enough good things about the food as well as the staff here. a must do for anyone visiting chicago
