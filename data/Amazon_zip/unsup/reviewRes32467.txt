I am a very picky eater. Very picky. I went to a diner group at Demera looking for some adventure and found two things: a new love of Ethiopian food and a renewed willingness to try new things. Since we were in a group, we ordered a bunch of different plates which all came on one big platter with some greens. You eat the meal with strips of a spongy bread called injera...which I'm told is key to a great Ethiopian meal since it can make or break the taste of the food. In this case, it was all good - and there was just enough spicy food to satisfy those at the the table that enjoy it - as for me, I was pleased to taste new, but not overly spicy, dishes. Our server was so helpful and explained everything to us without making us feel silly. Overall, I was so excited about this experience. I plan to do it again soon. I definitely recommend Demera - I see this kind of food being best for a date or dinner with friends. It's so interactive it might be difficult for a business meeting or dinner with someone you don't know well - unless you want to get to know them real quick! :-)
