Okay so NOW I know why this place is so popular.... Maybe just maybe...Las Tablas has some of the best food in Chicago, coupled with fast efficient service, and BYOB to boot? Yeah, definitely a 5 star review! This is a true Columbian establishment, complete with hand carved tables and chairs (carved by the owners family!), fresh ingredients (the plantains were amazing), and coffee that tasted like....well, better than the "Columbian" Starbucks coffee, that's for sure. This is an Atkins-lovers paradise...lots of grilled meats and vegetables. For appetizers there are empanadas with different fillings and sauces. These empanadas are fantastic b/c they aren't deep fried! Rather, time and attention is taken to make all of the food at Las Tablas, and I just can't put into words how yummy it is. Perhaps the BYOB brings folks in the door the first time, but the food itself keeps us coming back. Come here with a big group; all entrees are around the same price so it is easy to split the bill. Or come here on a date...the restaurant gives off that romantic vibe.
