I love this place. Casual like fast food but very clean and friendly. Solid Italian pasta menu including manicotti. Three styles of pizza in a multitude of ingredient combinations and you can buy a slice if that's all you want. The prices - incredible, especially if you catch their daily specials. I keep their menu in my car and order on my way home. Oh, plan on having the leftovers for lunch or even the next night if you are an average eater - generous additions like soup, salad, and bread. I've used them when I host family-style get togethers and order their ravioli. I always get good reviews on their sauce and add Italian sausage from Bari's on Grand. Only drawback, mediocre desserts. I'm puzzled over some negative reviews on another site that claims the good reviews are fraud. The parking lot is always packed (but rotates quickly) and you can't fake that kind of patronage. The only thing the negative reviews tell me is that some people feel passionate about pizza and don't get that there's a range of opinions. Clearly, lots of people like this place. I do.
