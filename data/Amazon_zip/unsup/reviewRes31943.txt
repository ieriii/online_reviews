Saw in the Red Eye that the Rockit guys were opening this up, and since I love Rockit I came asap to check it out. Called for same day reservations but earliest available was after 11pm, but they said they had a bar area we could eat at. This is just like the setup at rockit so we just headed over. Definitely is the new trendy place judging by the lambo and # of Range Rovers being valeted. We could sit right away in the bar area, even though it seemed really busy which was a plus. The furniture was really uncomfortable though. They obviously were going more for form than function. As for the food, I can't complain with what I had. I think I had the "Number 10" roll and it was really good. I'll be back to Sunda but I'm gonna make sure I have reservations for a reasonable time because the bar area wasn't very comfy.
