Love this place, been there several other times & are never disappointed. I brought my family to eat there today on Christmas Eve - nothing but a lovely time! We thoroughly enjoyed our food & our waiter (Ronald Carpenter) was very very knowledgeable, professional & attentive! We enjoyed his service a lot - I recommend if you want quality service ask for Ron. I would definitely go to Grand Lux OVER The Cheesecake Factory any day (I was a fan of Cheesecake until they started hiring low class people - every time I go there there's always an issue or someone's drunk)! Also, there is actually AMPLE lighting that I can see my food, the prices are fair for where it's located & there are huge portions of food to be had! Thanks RON! We'll definitely be back!
