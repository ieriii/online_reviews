An unforgettable experience. I have to agree with fellow yelpers - if you're deciding between the tasting and the tour menu, the tasting menu is plenty. Although the tasting menu portion sizes are small, they really add up and both my friend and I left full and happily satiated. The wagyu beef course still haunts me and the creativity of their menu and presentation really makes you see why they're rated #1 in the US this year... happy sigh..
