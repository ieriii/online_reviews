Solid deep dish. The crust is awesome, by carmelizing cheese around the periphery it takes it to a whole new level. Sauce was very good as well. Lots of flavor. We did a green pepper, sausage, onion and the secret ingredient my buddy Monte went with, fresh garlic. Solid choice. Ambiance would be best described as chill. I saw another review call it blue collar, which i wasn't too sure about. But it's just lacking any pretense or BS. In a good way. Ok selection of beers, so all in all we'll be heading back here.
