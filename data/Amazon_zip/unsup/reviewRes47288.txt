I finally made it here and the reviews are dead on. Awesome kuma style burgers! The fries the burgers come with were kind of soggy and a little over seasoned so I would definitely recommend going with their Mac n cheese instead. For $2 more it is so worth it! Service was good too, staff was very personable and welcoming! The only thing was it was freezing inside, but other than that I will definitely be back!
