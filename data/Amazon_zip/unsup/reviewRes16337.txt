I went here for a private party. They had neat photos in the area where I was seated. It was pretty dimly lit but the room next to us had a bright, orange/yellow hue. I'll take the dimly lit, please! Walking in, it was unbelievably crowded. That probably goes without saying considering its location. This place is hype. If you like the places on Randolph, you're sure to like this place too. It's good but not outstanding. I think one experience was enough. The food is pricey, drinks are pricey - you're paying for the experience, really. This is a "place to be seen."
