This hotel is absolutely fantastic! In every possible way. Despite the fact that the main lobby was closed due to the fact that they were completely stripping it and renovating it, I still had an amazing, two-night stay there with my father, my cousins and their 2 dogs. Yep, dogs. They are pet friendly there... The rooms are gorgeous and the beds extremely comfortable. The carpet is dark in the bedrooms which is awesome because it absorbs the light although the marble floors in the bathrooms are really, really cold. The hallways air conditioned to perfection and the elevators are numerous... I counted 11 when I was there two weeks ago. Absolutely nuts, but in a good way. The concierge staff is friendly and the bar is well stocked. Speaking of the bar, the sitting area and the entire bar room is breathtakingly beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous! I cannot wait to return to Chicago and hopefully stay there in the future. This is one of America's fine hotels. And it shows.
