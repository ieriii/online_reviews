I've been going to tank noodle for about 6 years now, and my mom has had tank noodle since i was in the womb. This is my go to place. Never do i ever go to any other pho restaurant. The pho here is simply impeccable, but the prices have seemed to go up quite and bit and I think they're skimping just a bit. But whatever, its still some beast pho. :) (#39 is where it's at) Expect to be standing in line on the weekends and in the winter because this place sure is packed. I think that they have fresh broth on thursdays because wednesday it's closed, or maybe i'm just imagining things. Its always better to go in the winter to enjoy some hot and delicious pho along with some hot tea :)
