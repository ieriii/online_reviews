Just in a nutshell....the waiter was rude and had an ass face from the time we sat down until we left. Maybe he had a problem or was in a bad mood, but that kind of attitude is not acceptable. We ordered a "parrillada" and the first cut with was spoiled. YESSS! The meat was rotten! I couldn't believe what I had spit out in a napkin. Dinner came to a halt and after 10 minutes of waiting for the server to actually come back over he immediately agreed with us when he smelled this rotten dead piece of meat they had served us. He kinda apologized and we ordered a salad and arepa because my stomach was just upside down at that point. The manager was never sent to our table....the parrillada was taken off our bill and there was no discount on anything or any other incentive to try to get us to come back. This is absurd and being that my family has had restaurants forever, we still cant understand how the F$#@ this is even possible. I'm debating calling the health department because this is dangerous and ABSURD in the restaurant business. We are from Argentina and eat meat everyday so I immediately knew the meat was off. But someone else that isn't used to eating meat everyday may just throw that sauce they call chimichurri on it and never realize the shit they are eating. This is horrible and I really do not wish it to happen to anyone. Poisoning from cow meat will send you to the hospital real fast.....
