Valet parking was free the night I went! Snowstorm outside, but the valet cleaned the car off nicely when bringing it to us. The food was very good and reasonably priced. And though the menu has but one Greek beer (generically named "Greek Beer") it was a nice light pale named Hillas, that was perfectly paired for the food. Since the Greeks invented beer over 6000 years ago, I found it odd that they only serve one kind, and they don't seem to be particularly proud of it. Then again, the menu, though large, is a bit skimpy on the descriptions overall. Our waiter was attentive and a fine time was had by all in our party.
