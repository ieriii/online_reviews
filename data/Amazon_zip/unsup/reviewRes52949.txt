Yuca fries, you make me cry, why you have to say goodbye? What a cool experience. My lady friend suggested we give this a shot, so we showed up at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night. It was packed, but there was enough room to squeeze into a corner table by the window.  The waiter was informative and friendly - the atmosphere in that place is completely relaxed and fun, and the music really gets you in the mood for some traditional Cuban cuisine.  I had the special, some fried pork that had been marinaded overnight, along with some black beans and rice. The pork was savory, tender, and melt-in-your mouth good - the beans and rice were average, but a nice compliment.  We also ordered a shared plate of the famous Yuca fries, which unfortunately were served cold. Whoops. But no problem, we notified the waiter and he brought out a hot, fresh plate with a smile - great service and the flavor of those fries totally won me back.  Desert? Si, senor. Coconut flan, nice and fim, the way I prefer my flan, with some coconut shavings on top.  Oh, and the bill? Just $29 bucks. Worth a trip - this is a great spot for a date, or to take friends and family.
