So I love brown liquor. Bourbon and Rye and Whisky and Scotch. My pals. This place loves them too so I knew things would work out between us. I tried the bourbon flight - it's $12 for three tiny tasting amounts but it was worth it for the variety. Then the bartender, who looked kind of like Mario the Hero of Video Games, made me the best Sazerac I have ever had (and I'm from New Orleans, so that is quite a compliment.) Only problem: The bar is not very big, and they don't allow you to sit at a table unless you're ordering food. We ordered some small plates, but that was not enough to warrant a table and I had to stand for most of the evening since there weren't enough barstools to go around. AND - more bike parking would be SWEET!
