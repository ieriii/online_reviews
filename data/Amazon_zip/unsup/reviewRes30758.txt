Was really excited to finally try this place out since I rarely am in Bridgeport... Went in for brunch by myself last weekend, sat at the bar and received maybe the worst service Ive had in Chicago. Waited long for a drink order, coffee sat empty for at least 10 min. before asking if I wanted more...10 minutes after I ordered, the bartender asked my what my order was again, then waited like 20 more minutes for my pumpkin pancakes to arrive, which were not cooked through in the middle.. I politely asked for my check and the bartender replies: "Don't worry, it's on me, trust me I won't feel a dent, I own this place." Wow. I do appreciate the fact that he comped my bill, but with no tact once so ever.  The second star is only because I didn't have to pay for my time being wasted.
