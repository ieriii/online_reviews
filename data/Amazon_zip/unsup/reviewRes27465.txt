I am a huge pizza whore and decided to have my son's first birthday party at Pequod's! I love their pizza (especially the deep!!! It is the rare deep, but not stuffed kind!) and knew they had a nice sized party room. At first I was feeling a little guilty that maybe it was a selfish decision, but after having a successful birthday bash there, all guilt was gone. The pizza, service and value were all great!! Maybe parties at Pequod's will be a new birthday tradition?
