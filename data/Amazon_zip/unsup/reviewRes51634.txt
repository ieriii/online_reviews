it's funny the things you remember... i remember the margaritas were significantly good (how i remember beats me)... but i most importantly remember the service was significantly bad don't go here before a movie... because you won't make it... don't go here when it's busy... because they WILL forget about you don't go here on a rainy summer day and sit by the window... because you'll feel it without being accommodated for it don't go here with more than 2 people... because after 2 you have a 50% chance they will forget you're order completely thereafter (only 3 of 4 got served their plate!) don't go here ravenous... because you will need to wait quite awhile before you eat don't get the mole.... unless you like it more gritty in texture and chocolatey in flavor don't drink your magarita tooooo fast.... because the waitress won't be attentive enough to make sure it doesn't run dry for 15 mins before it needs to be replaced don't go out of your way to go here... there is a hundred other great mexican places in the city there are so many don'ts you may as well "don't go here" but the food isn't bad, and the drinks aren't bad, and the atmosphere isn't bad.... this is the only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1. it's just the service! if they fired 50% of their non-waitresses and hired real ones they'd be 4-star! so maybe only when you feel lucky... and only if you are in the area... do give them 1 chance... but don't give them as much mercy on yelp if they fail you too!
