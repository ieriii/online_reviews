We have been going to Noon O kabab for several years. The food is consistently delicious! Prices have trended higher, at an increasing rate recently. Given the quality of the food, its still a good value. Our favourite is the Beef Koubideh and my son loves the Persian Salad! Pass on the new wraps, better to leave Burritos to Chipotle!
