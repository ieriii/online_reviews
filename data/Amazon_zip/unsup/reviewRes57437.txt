The best Mex. food and Marg. ever. It's small but what do you expect out of property in Lincoln Park. The services is great especially since they got NEW servers who are REALLY nice at heart. The best part about this place is, that no more smoking. If I had someone blowing smoke in my face I would give them an evil look. Hello not everybody is a smoker. The prices are really good as well. Don't worry people once you have Gerardo serve you, you will never miss Victor not that anybody does.
