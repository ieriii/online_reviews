What can I say?!? I LOVE Giordano's deep dish pizza! My family buys the frozen ones and takes them back home every time we eat there. The only disadvantage to this Giordano's (as opposed to other ones throughout the city) is that it is the busiest. You can expect to wait 1-1.5 hours to get a table. On the bright side, you pre-order, so your pizza should be just about ready when it is time to eat.
