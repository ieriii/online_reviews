the food here was outstanding. i can't believe it doesn't get more attention. i'm sort of glad though because the price is reasonable and it's not impossible to get into. it's really amazing though. the food is seasonal and i loved each course. i wish i would have written down each of them because i loved them so much, but it's been over a month and i can't remember everything. i remember the duck duck goose, and i know there was a to die for gnocchi, with apples or pears? and another dish with squash. the only course i had complaints about was the salad which was several separate elements that i thought would have been better all together. i don't mind a decomposed dish, but there was only one cashew separated from the salad, which tasted great but because there was only one and you can't really cut a cashew, only one bite was fully balanced. another amazing part about this place is that it is byob... can it get any better? the service was great. the chef brought our dishes to us a couple of times, which was a highlight for me (for some reason, i get totally star struck when i meet chefs). one of the best meals i've had in chicago. i can't wait to go back now in spring and summer to see what they offer.
