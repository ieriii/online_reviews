Visiting Illinois for the week but only a few hours in Chicago so we decided to stop by Hot Dougs for a late lunch since there were so many great reviews on yelp. We went on a Tuesday afternoon around 2 ish so it wasn't super busy. The restaurant is located on a corner and it was basically street parking. We got lucky and found a spot right in front. Between the 4 of us we ordered 2 Chicago hot dogs, 1 Elvis Polish Sausage, 1 Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, 2 Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Trugole Cheese, and a large fries. My favorite was the alligator! It was the game of the week and my first time trying alligator...eek! But it was actually really good. Too bad we warent here on a Friday or Saturday b/c those duck fat fries sounds delish! Between Hot Dougs and Pinks Hot Dogs in Los Angeles, Hot Dougs is definitely more unique! Where else can you find alligator sausage hot dogs?
