Headline: Best Indian in Chicago outside Devon St. I've been to India House twice and I've become a big fan. Being in the River North neighborhood--and not on Devon--the food may be not as authentic; they may need to cater to more mainstream Chicagoan tastes. Anyway, the naan bread and sauce starters are terrific; and the entrees are great as well. I recommend getting one of the chef samplers so you can try a bunch of great dishes. Oh, also, I love that you can see the kitchen from the dining room! In my experience, sometimes some India restaurants don't seem very clean, and I get worried about the kitchens, but this is not a problem at IH; they proudly display their clean kitchen.
