THE $30 PEKING DUCK DINNER IS THE BOMB! The duck is carved tableside and comes with 6 buns, plum sauce, green onion, and pickled radishes and carrots. The rest of the duck is then taken back to the kitchen and turned into duck soup and duck fried rice. The main attraction is the peking duck and it is delicious! It is plump and juicy, and not overly fatty. The skin is nice and crisp. You will probably need to order more buns since it only comes with 6. The soup and fried rice are OK but not great - it is a bonus anyway since the peking duck by itself is worth the money. I came with 2 other people and we could not finish. The decor and atmosphere of the place is like that of any asian/chinatown restaurant, but the food more than makes up for all of that. Highly recommended if you are looking for a cheap, delicious, and satisfying chinese bbq meal! P.S. Our waitress was super friendly and very charming!
