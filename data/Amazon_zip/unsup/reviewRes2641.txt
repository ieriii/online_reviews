Awesome. Lines are too long but they just have incredible homemade sausages consisting of all sorts of meats. The toppings are a perfect complement to the type of sausage. The duck fries are crispy and wonderful. Don't bother if you're just looking for a Chicago style dog but if you're in the mood for something special, go for it.
