Been here twice. Amazing, amazing, amazing! I love the atmosphere, the owner and the whole staff are incredibly friendly. If you want a place with excellent Cuban food, great prices, and great service, then this is the place!! I had the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef) last time I was there, and it was phenomenal. I would take bites of my friends food and everything is always so flavorful! I always crave this place! They also have big portions, so I can this incredible food for lunch the next day! Perfect. I recommend ALL of the appetizers. Really, just order anything. You just cannot go wrong here. Oh, and it's BYOB, has a heated outdoor patio. It's wonderful.
