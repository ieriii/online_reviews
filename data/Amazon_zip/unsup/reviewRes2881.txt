We came here for our 3 year anniversary and was pleasantly surprised at the efforts to personalize our experience. I wasn't expecting a fancy, stuffy place would take the time to print personalized menus with or to bring a special dessert saying Happy 3rd anniversary. The waitstaff was amazing, they were always available for questions and loosened up with jokes once they realized we were there to have a good time. We went for the Chef's Collection with Wayagu beef add-on, which was perfection! Each plate keep getting better and better, with both beef plates being the highlight of the meal. Desserts were to die for and we stumbled out of Tru with dazed looks of satisfaction along with baked treats for breakfast the next morning.  What an amazing experience.
