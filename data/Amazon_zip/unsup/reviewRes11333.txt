Not sure what all the fuss is about. The food was bland (my group had egg dishes, so maybe their pancakes and the like are better) and the portions were so large it was kind of nauseating. The waitress messed up our order and we were presented the check before we were done eating. I know they're busy, but I don't want to feel rushed out of a restaurant. Isn't brunch supposed to be leisurely? I'm sure you can find a cheaper, better breakfast joint just about anywhere--minus a 45 minute wait.
