I like that they provide so many choices. As a vegan, I haven't found many other places that provide a safe haven of wonderful offerings. They are busy all of the time, I can only imagine how much work it must be to create all of the food in such a tiny little place. The days of beans and barley are a thing of the past. I know they have been around for a long time, and their age is starting to show.A bit of advice: If the diner folks want to stay current they need to start thinking about sustainability, local and eco-green. The building looks a little run down, and exactly how green is it? Do they use organics?Local? Is it a good organization or just a front for a wealthy dude to make $$ off of us trusting vegans? Just asking Diner Man, we see your Jag parked in front with the vegdiner plate. How about investing in your cash cow consciously? Get with it Diner your customers will soon be demanding it.
