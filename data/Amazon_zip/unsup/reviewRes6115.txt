I really loved this cozy restaurant and its delicious "Italian comfort food," as I kept calling it. Davanti is really perfect for date night. The warm, gentle lighting and light wood finishes were so relaxing and romantic. The dining room in the back of the restaurant got a bit loud (especially thanks to a tipsy birthday girl and her entourage), but it looked like the tables up towards the front were much quieter.  We showed up at 9pm on a Saturday night with no reservation (I don't think they take them) and were told it would be a 45 minute wait, but were seated in maybe 10, with large pours of tasty wine in hand.  We had the Foccacia di Recco, which was a soft salty thin pizza stuffed with a cow cheese that tasted much like cream cheese -- not incredibly adventurous, but a really nice combination of salt, cream and dough. This sounds really weird, but I think this would be a great thing to eat if you're feeling under the weather. The burrata salad was delicious and massive. Who doesn't love a huge piece of burrata for $8? The egg ravioli and the warm farro salad, which was a special, were also very good. The wines by the bottle were a little confusing to me - they look extremely cheap, but they are listed at retail price so you have to add the $7 corkage to drink them in the restaurant.
