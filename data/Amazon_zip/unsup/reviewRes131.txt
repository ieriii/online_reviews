There is no way, NO WAY, this place can get anything under a 5 star. My husband and I dined here last night and this morning we woke up and said to ourselves, "did last night really happen"? It was surreal. The food was incredible, but that you expect. However, nothing beats the experience and service you will find at Alinea. Come in with an open mind and leave feeling incredible.  Many ask if it's worth the $. My answer is, you're not paying for just the food, you're paying for an experience, and YES for that, it's worth it. An experience that you'll remember for the rest of your life.  From the moment you walk in, you're transformed into another universe and look forward to what's to come like a kid waiting to unwrap each and every birthday gift. Each dish that comes out, is a surprise and a new experience.  Overall, this place is a must if you can justify the cost (eg. promotion, big birthday, giving birth, etc.). Without alcohol, expect to pay about $500 with tax and tip. Until we meet again Alinea, you will be in my thoughts...
