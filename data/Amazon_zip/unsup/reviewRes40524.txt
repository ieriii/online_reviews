$10 for mediocre pho? what ingredient in VN justifies this cost? Oh, that's right, overhead. I know people who don't know any better will pay at this cost, but coming from SoCal, it's highway robbery. The eggrolls where small and had only one piece of lettuce to wrap it. oh and it's $4.50. A meal with 2 bowl of pho and appetizers with bubble drink should not cost $50. Once again, not a sub-par Vietnamese restaurant. There are better options, Chi-town, go to Le's Pho or Pho 888.
