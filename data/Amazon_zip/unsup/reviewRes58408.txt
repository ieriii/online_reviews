I wasn't sure if I should believe all of the hype about Piccolo Sogno, but my experience on Friday night made me a believer. After a year of reading about the acclaimed patio, I couldn't imagine that I'd truly be stepping into paradise, but this urban oasis really made me feel like I was in an Italian garden. Our server, Jeff, was knowledgable, honest, and entertaining. He dubbed himself our tour guide for the evening and took us on a wonderful adventure of Italian cuisine. Each dish we tried was more delicious than the last. I loved that each pasta dish could be ordered in appetizer-sized portions, which allowed our group to sample more of the menu. Don't skip the Ravioli Piccolo Sogno. The appetizer-sized portion is four pieces of Ravioli, so you can definitely enjoy it and still have room for an entree. Everything about this experience was decadent, from the atmosphere to the food itself. This is a MUST TRY on the Chicago restaurant list. http://www.girlthateats.
