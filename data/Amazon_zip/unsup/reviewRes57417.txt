+I am very happy that I tried Mayan Palace. The service was definitely out of this world. Extremely attentive and friendly. They check on everything every few minutes. Salsa was fresh, spicy and delicious.Ceviche was just amazing. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.I will definitely be going back to Mayan Palace.-(It was hard to come up with negatives, so I am being very critical here)The Steak Diablo dish could have used nicer steak. A few of my pieces were very fatty. The sauce on it was amazing though and made it a pretty good dish.My wife's red snapper with mango salsa was delicious, but definitely too spicy for her. It had fresh chopped jalapenos on it.My water was never refilled, even though it was empty for 30 minutes.
