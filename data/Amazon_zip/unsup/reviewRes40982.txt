Dinner for Schmucks.  That's what I call Bonsoiree.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I went BACK to Bonsoiree with a group of new friends. Because I was giving it a second chance.  I will add only one more star to my review because there were maybe 2 dishes that were decent.  But again, everything just DID NOT WORK!! It was horrible. I sat there and yes, I ate the food because I was with a group of people.  And again, after my "meal" I was starving!!  For that much money that is ridiculous!  Again, I have to point out that if you look at their website both the owner / chef and sous chef have little experience. And come on Bonsoiree, stop attempting to be Schwa, because you'll never be as good as they are.  You might be able to trick a few people into thinking this is good food but I know better.  You might be able to plate some food stylishly, but it's just simply not good.
