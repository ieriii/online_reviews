The service is impeccable! When going to a bbq restaurant, the last thing in mind concerns service but they were so attentive from every aspect: offering refills to the sweet potato chips to bread and butter pickles, always filling the water glass, and even noticing the white linen napkin shedding on my bf's suit, they gave him a dark napkin instead.  We are so pleased with everything this place has to offer. We love bbq and waited to try this place since we had other favorites in town, but honestly, this place blew us away and we plan on returning often! The portions are generous and every bite is mouthwatering. We ordered the Hush Puppies, Kobe brisket sandwich and their brunch special: pulled chicken benedict, everything was so delicious, words just cannot describe.  This place is highly recommended.
