I went to Graham Elliot recently as part of my birthday celebration, and I could not be happier. From the friendly and accessibly service to the laid-back atmosphere, everything exceeded my expectations.And the food was no exception! I could list everything we ate that night, but as the menu changes frequently that doesn't seem necessary. Here are some highlights:The cocktail menu has something for everyone and every one I tried was delicious and unique. From the savory Peaches and Herb to the tropical Almost Paradise, they were all tasty and fun. Favorite: Blueberry Hill-sweet yet tart, lovely blueberry compote, I could have had four more!The sweet corn bisque could not have been seasoned better. Every bite was like a celebration in my mouth that I just wanted to eat and eat and eat. The corn nuts gave it some texture, and the garlic marshmallow was different and worth it.I had the the sea scallops for my entree and I never knew fried pickles could go so well with anything. Each bite of every ingredient together was great and the scallops were cooked very well and melted in my mouth.Dessert was good, not totally mind blowing, but I loved the use of ingredients and the plating was beautiful. If the blackberry panna cotta is still available, it is a must try for berry lovers (of which I am one!).All in all, it was a whimsical and satisfying dining experience. The portion sizes are on the small side, which I think is perfect because you can try more. It is also on the pricey side, but I think that is reflected in the quality of ingredients. They have a tasting menu option ($75 for five courses) and I think it'd be worth a try.I plan to go back when the menu has been changed up and I already can't wait. If you go in with an open-mind and a sense of adventure, this place should be amazing!
