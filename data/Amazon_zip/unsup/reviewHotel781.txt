I wasn't really impressed by this Westin that much. I didn't have much time to hang out in the hotel because I got in at midnight the one night I stayed there, but my room was underwhelming. The amenities were all good as you'd expect, but there just wasn't the flair of other Westins. My bathroom was kind of small, the room had an odd configuration and it gave off the 70's modern vibe.
