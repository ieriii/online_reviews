Boutique-y feel with the big chain level service, the James was a dream. Having booking through a hotel club website, we got upgraded to a suite, and the syite had what we called "a champagne room" WITH A PROJECTOR! seriously. I mean the welcome basket was cool and all, the bed was oooooh so comfy, but there was a champagne room with a projector. It's bathroom was luxe and bright, lovely and spot-on (but no Ace Hotel clawfoot tub confection, alas).
