It's hard for pizza to disappoint, and when you add stuffed to the equation, its extra hard to fail! The place was crazy packed, but we surprisingly only had to wait about 20 minutes. We ordered bruschetta and zuchinni sticks to start with, which were both very yummy. We also ordered the stuffed special, which was my own little slice of heaven, in my opinion, accompanied with an icy cold refreshing Stella. If you're not into pizza, and cheese ain't your thing, then Giordano's is NOT your place.
