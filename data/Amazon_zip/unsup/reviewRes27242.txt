Short review here. Just thought I'd chime in to say this is one of the best and well priced Mexican restaurants that I've been to in Chicago.  I always pack it down while I'm here and wind up groaning like an old man as I get up from my table. It's cash only here .. and good luck finding parking. It's also a favorite of the Chicago Police Department ... you'll find them illegally parked all over the place as you struggle for a parking spot. Cross the street for some great desserts over at Bombon.
