I've worked here before but hands down their sushi is great.  A bit pricey but it's worth it. The Godzilla roll is to die for!!! The music and atmosphere is great. Service is nice, some I'm familiar with. I would go here every so often, not my spot to go here frequently cause the money is tight. But overall, great sushi!!!
