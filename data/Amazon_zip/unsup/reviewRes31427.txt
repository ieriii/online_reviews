Pretty good breakfast joint. It lacks some seating area for waiting, but I think that's common with most Breakfast places. Nice that they added the double doors for the winter. The host (owner) seems pretty nice, she always seem to greet everyone with a smile always seems to be there. Theres' definitely a family restaurant feel to this place. If you are tired of going to IHOP or even Yolk and want a more of a mom and pop feel, this is the right spot.  I like the all-organic touch. Not many places would go through that trouble, organic is no longer a fad. Being that is all-organic, it does add to the price. But i think if you are health conscious and want something fresh, its worth it. I have had many of the different items on the menu, from Nanadict (it was good, but the egg had a partial egg shell that was not part of the menu, not a big deal...at least I knew it came from a brown egg), grilled chicken sandwich, breakfast burrito, and other sides. The home fries are okay, not much flavor unless you spice it up with hot sauce and ketchup. The pancakes are okay too, had better elsewhere. I really liked their Breakfast Burrito and Grilled Chicken. There all-natural fruit sodas are pretty good too. I definitely go back and have been since they opened. Even though it is expensive, I give them credit for making it all organic and natural. Not sure if the home fries and pancakes taste different to me because I'm not used to the all-organic flavor or what, but I would recommend trying the non-traditional breakfast items. Nice additional to the ever changing Bridgeport neighborhood. Definitely recommend for all to try at least once.
