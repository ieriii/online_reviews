This place is great. The food is really nice, beautifully presented and creative and the prices are not to be believed. I've had sushi, various curries, some noodle dishes and a couple of different salads here and I've always been very happy. I need to start branching out because they do have some unusual things on the menu. Recently my friend ordered some kind of beef salad that was fantastic, and their signature seafood salad is also very very good. The service is a little bit unreliable, but with the great food, cheap prices and BYO option, it hardly matters.
