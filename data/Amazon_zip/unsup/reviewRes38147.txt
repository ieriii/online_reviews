My absolute favorite beer watering hole. You'd be hard up to find a more extensive beer list, especially if Belgian's are your forte (they are mine). The servers know their shit when it comes to beer, too, so ask away and offer them to surprise you (I do all the time). If you're a beer geek, this is a must-see. Err, must-drink. The food is excellent. I've had almost everything on the menu and I've loved it all. The frittes, the mussels, even the grilled freaking cheese is excellent. My mom has a gluten allergy and they find things on the menu that she can eat and she loves it. I've only ever had one complaint about their food and that was when they switched from using wine to using beer to steam the mussels. And don't get me wrong, I still LIKE them; I just noticed the difference in taste. I've been dreading writing this review because I have no idea how to express the awesomeness of this place in a few short paragraphs. Just go. For dinner, for a snack, for a happy hour. I'll probably be there, too, so look for the little brunette throwing back pints of pale ales and say hi.
