Well, it certainly was a delicious meal. I wouldn't say the best Italian I've ever had, especially not here in Chicago, but good none the less. The service was prompt and the food came out as we were told it would. I particularly enjoyed the Cappellacci di Zucca (pumpkin ravioli) and the Linguini alle Vongole (clams in a white wine sauce). The flavors were wonderful and made me want to just eat the whole entree instead of sharing with friends! As for the desserts, always my favorite part, they were tasty and were not at all overwhelming as some Americanized Italian desserts can be. It was a surprisingly spacious restaurant which made for a great dining experience as our large group was in the backroom, where it was relatively quiet. I would definitely go back with a group, especially since it's a semi-pricy place and Italian meals are meant to be shared with friends and family!
