I've never actually eaten at this place, but we always get it for take out. Between two of us, we've probably ordered every pasta dish on the menu and haven't found anything we didn't like. It's fast, cheap and delicious! I have no complaints about the food here. Recommendations: Farfalle Pollo or Lobster Ravioli
