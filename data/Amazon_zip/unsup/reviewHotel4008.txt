My review might be biased, based on what I feel is a FANTASTIC price that we got for this hotel on Priceline. We didn't expect to get such a great location downtown for our budget. Wow, this hotel is huge. It's a little old, so the design of the structure itself and the layout of the lobby areas feel outdated, sort of early 80's high-end business-modern. That was probably the biggest drawback. Seriously! If you like to feel like you are entering a posh hotel from the moment you drive up, this probably isn't the right hotel. Otherwise, the room was updated and comfortably appointed, no complaints there at all.  We were placed close to the elevator, so I was concerned about noise. We didn't hear a peep! Impressive. We LOVED this location - right on the river, JUST off Michigan Ave. (which I view as a positive, cutting down on street and pedestrian traffic outside of the hotel), it was perfectly positioned to walk the river, the magnificent mile, and Millenium Park. Will return!!
