We drive by this place all the time and there is always a line out the door (good sign!)... We finally decided to go today (Thursday) since we were both off and knew there would not be a line... To my dismay, the food was mediocre at best and the service was lousy! (And I'm not one to complain about service). I ordered the Denver omelette which was just bland and had no life to it. I felt a little confined even though it was only 50% full - can not imagine how it feels when its full. The coffee was below average, not dark enough for my taste and they simply refused to refill it. At any other breakfast joint, I have never had my coffee below mid-mug. I had to ask the busboy for a refill because my waitress never came by after we ordered our food. The hostess refilled the table next to us and never turned around to refill mine. Finally, the busboy had to come and refill it. They never came to refill coffee during the whole breakfast... The only good point was their jelly/jam, that was really good.
