Woulda been four stars before the remodeling but they lost their atmosphere and now with the exposed brick and flat screen tvs (hey at least they actually show HDTV) they look like eveyrone else. Yeah the pizza is still good, not perfect, but with the distinctive touches mentioned in other reviews.
