This place was terrible. We waited 45 minutes to be seated, okay that's fine whatever. Then we get seated and it takes about 30 minutes for our waiter to come to our table and ask what we want to drink. After waiting for a long time for food we get it and it was disgusting! I ordered the "California Reuben" which is supposed to be the best thing on the menu to get. WRONG. It tastes nothing like a reuben which is fine because it's fake meat, but it tasted horrible for food in general. I cant even describe how bad it was, I immediately felt nauseous after having a few bites (keep in mind, I am a vegetarian). My bf had the gnocchi, I didn't try it but he said it was disgusting and it had the look and texture of fried bugs, the outside looked like some sort of crunchy roach and the inside had the texture of bug guts (like when you crush them and white pus comes out) and tasted like it too (according to him). I was expected good from this place because of all the yelp reviews. We are both down to try new foods and open minded, but this place was just absolutely gross and I had a terrible experience.
