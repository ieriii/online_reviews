I used to live in Chicago and be a frequenter of Superdawg. Now I just dream about this place...or, get all nostalgic when I see it on those random "Best Hot Dogs!" food shows on TV. Delicious dawgs, crisp and snappy like I like them, topped with that ungodly fluorescent green relish. Fries - top notch. Milkshake - NOM. Getting to eat in your car and have it be socially acceptable - can't beat it. Maybe nothing really qualifies as "the best", but it's certainly an experience. I can't wait to go back.
