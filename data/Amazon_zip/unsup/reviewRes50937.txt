Big cups of coffee and little beignets greet you here in this hotel lobby southern resturant. By far the best butter grits I've had since leaving the south. I also had the fried catfish which was wonderful and tasty with the grits and eggs. I think this place is the #1 brunch spot in Andersonville. All my friends liked it too. They take reservations and don't seem to have the same sort of crazy wait that other brunch places have. This civilization seems refined beyond compare. I also had some of the best gumbo with rice: so tasty with cut chives and cajun spice and sausage.
