Great service and great food...as good as it gets. The combo plate was outstanding. When we arrived, there was some confusion over our reservation but our party of seven was seated immediately. Waitstaff was attentive but not intrusive and we were all served our food simultaneously which removes that awkward moment when some are served and wait for others while their food gets cold. Nice work!
