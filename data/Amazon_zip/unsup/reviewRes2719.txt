Took my dad here when he came to visit and it was the perfect place to have dinner.  Ambiance - lovely. Tables are set far enough away that you can have a conversation, easily hear one another, and not be bothered by the chatter going on at the tables around you. My dad (almost 60) just loved it. Service - just as expected: excellent. Our server was knowledgeable and very helpful when it came to deciding what to eat. Food - Delicious. We all went with the prix fixe, three course menu as the selections jumped out at us. The food was so delicious, portions perfect, presentation fabulous. Cheese cart is a must. Wine - Extensive wine list; something for everyone. We ordered a bottle. Would I go back? For a special occasion - absolutely!
