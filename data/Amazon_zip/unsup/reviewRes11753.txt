Great pizza. Great beer. Thats pretty much the deal. Where can you go to get fresh brewed beer and authentic pizza? This place! Can get pretty busy though, so plan to wait if you are coming during weekends or evenings. This place is awesome for groups and good to take out of towners. LIke I said, good concept. Not the best pizza or brewery out there, but awesome when combined. Also have to go sized beer so a pizza and fresh brew might be a way to go if you dont want to deal with the wait!!
