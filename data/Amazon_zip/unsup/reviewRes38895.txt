Good Italian food. The gnocchi is good, but no where near as good as Sabatino's. The pizza's good, but all other things considered, Sabatino's beats this place in food, service, atmosphere, etc. Still, it's a good place to go once in a while, but I don't eat Italian food often enough to be able to have more than one neighborhood favorite.
