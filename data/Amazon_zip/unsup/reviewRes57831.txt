Nana's I have eaten there twice in the past two weeks; once for breakfast and one time for dinner. It is really interesting food, very good flavor and different for any other place in the area by far. For dinner I thought it was out standing. Everything we ordered was perfect. For breakfast it was good, but a little pricy. The options are very different for any where less that you can go. I would check it out; your taste buds will be surprised
