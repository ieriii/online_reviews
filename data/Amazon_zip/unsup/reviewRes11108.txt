Pizza and beer. It's become such a common American food combination that it's surprising when a restaurant messes it up. Sadly, plenty have fumbled with the seemingly simplistic combination. Let's be thankful that Piece brings something fresh to the table. Piece allows you to select from three styles of thin-crust pizza: Red (tomato sauce and mozzarella), Plain (tomato sauce, garlic, parmesan and olive oil) or White (olive oil, garlic and mozzarella). You can then select toppings to add to your base. From spinach and banana peppers to sauteed mushrooms and pepperoni, they have it all. Unless you're Meg Ryan, they can probably meet your pizza topping needs. Usually a restaurant's suggested serving sizes aren't very helpful but Piece's would be relatively accurate: we ordered two medium pizzas for three people and had a few pieces to spare. Stick with the suggestions -- so long as you're not three grown men feasting after a long and arduous weekend. Speaking of beer, Piece's microbrews were tasty and well-crafted. I started with their Top Heavy Hefeweizen which was very flavorful and very hoppy. Their Wingnut IPA really hit the spot though; it was fresh with a sweet fruit start but ended with a very distinct hop finish. We didn't have any trouble with Piece's infamous wait so it was a great experience for me. If anyone's craving New Haven-style thin-crust and looking to wash it down with quality beer, get a Piece of this.
