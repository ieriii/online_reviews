One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Also a sentimental favorite since it was my first date for my (now) husband and I. I LOVE their lobster ravioli (melts in your mouth) and also love the asparagus appetizer. Atmosphere is so cozy and romantic and we always get great service.  My one caveat is to always ask for a table in the front, by the windows, or outside in the summer months. The tables in the back are crowded and don't have as much atmosphere.
