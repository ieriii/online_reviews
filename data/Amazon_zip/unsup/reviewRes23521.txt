I have to say I was disappointed. Now, granted, my crepe was far too spicey for me to eat, but it appeared others in my party weren't too impressed with theirs either. As far as dessert goes, they did a fine job, but the dinner part left me unimpressed. As for their service, I was there at least 10 minutes before anyone actually came up to the table, and that was after I loudly mentioned as such to my companions. I say Meh.
