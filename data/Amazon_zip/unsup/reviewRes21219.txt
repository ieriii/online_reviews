Superchick with bbq sauce and grilled onion on a toasted poppyseed bun! YUM! All sandwiches/dawgs come w/fries - dark fried crinkle cuts.  The STAR of the show here for me was the chocolate malt. It will surely cause cravings. HHHMM just writing this, I could really go for one right now... You have options for where to eat - either in your car out at the electronic order stations or inside a makeshift eating area. All food is packaged in 'to go' type containers.  Also LOVED the crispy, pickled green tomato slice - unique. I have a garden and have pickled stuff before. I don't know why pickling green tomatoes never occurred to me before! Brilliant!
