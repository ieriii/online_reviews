First stop off the Orange line on my weekend trip to Chicago.  The Gage is surprisingly a HUGE place that has two floors with a large amount of seating and event space. The decor was very well done with a light green tiles that winds through the restaurant. The staff is very professional down to the very attentive bussers. Food was pretty good. We had two of the new sandwiches and I think they need to work out a couple of the kinks. First and fore most..... More Protein!  Both the Pork Belly sandwich as well as the Duck sausage were really great sandwiches. I just lacked meat on both.  Btw... I was sharing, don't judge a hungry man... My only complaints really. The dessert was a strawberry rhubarb short cake with hints of tarragon. Pretty good but the tarragon in NO way was evenly balanced. In my first bite I believe I got the whole leaf leaving me shocked and also causing the rest of dessert to be dull. All in all, great first lunch which left me excited about my weekend trip to Chicago.
