Decided to go here after there were no seats available at Soupbox. And so there was Crisp, right across the street. From the good reviews I've read on yelp and from watching them on Metromix, I thought that it would be a good idea to try it out....and what a great idea that was. I ordered the Chi-town Chicken burrito while my bf ordered the Seoul Sensation burrito, which came with marinated bulgogi. Both were delicious, especially with the spicy sauce. They have some interesting dishes here and although I have not tried the fried chicken, it looked really good. Crisp does offer an interesting twist on Korean food, and I would love to come back again and try the other dishes.
