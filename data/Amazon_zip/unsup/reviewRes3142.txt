A rare phenomenon occurred during my visit to Crisp. I could not finish the entire meal. "It must not have been good," you say. No, it was Korean fried chicken and it was bloody delicious. There was just so much food, I actually had to throw a little bit away. I got a bowl of chicken and rice along with an order of the wings. The rice bowl was good, but let's be real- you're here for the chicken. And I use the term "wings" loosely because it's actually the wing and almost a quarter the friggin chicken... in each piece. Not only that, but they douse it in this sauce that even Colonel Sanders himself would emerge from his grave to lick off my fingers.  These fried chicken place in Seoul almost all serve beer, so it surprised me that Crisp did not. But they told us this place is BYOB and gladly pointed out a beer shop across the street. Major win.
