Lots of complaints about how difficult it is to get in and I get it, its hard. But I can promise you that it is worth it. This is dining as performance art. And that is not to say that the food takes a backseat to the show. The theatricality of the presentations perfectly honors the beauty of the meal. To go over the details would be to give away too many surprises, but we had a fantastic time. You are treated like a VIP from the moment you walk up to the unmarked door. But this VIP treatment also has a wonderful comfortableness about it. It doesn't feel stuffy. We ended up chatting with the table next to us because it was just too fun. You get the sense that they are encouraging the playfulness to go along with the fun they obviously had coming up with the amazing experience. Do whatever you have to to get in here. It's a meal and and experience that you won't soon forget.
