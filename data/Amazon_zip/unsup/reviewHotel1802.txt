I stay here a lot for work, mainly because it's the closest hotel to my office. A lot of the rooms are really small and some of the bathroom are REALLY small, but the beds are pretty comfortable. The service has been good and the room service has some decent options.  The bar is a bit overpriced, but good service and good bartenders. The lobby is dark and there's always fairly loud music, so depending on what kind of hotel you're looking for this can be good or bad.
