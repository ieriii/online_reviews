This place is always the go-to spot for any special romantic occassion. I love trying new things and that's basically what this place is all about. They bring different meats to your table and you can get as much as you want (though be sure to pace yourselves, there's a lot to try) and on top of that they have the Harvest Table with lots of interesting cold plates and salads. I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses and the ambiance and selection just doesn't match up to Zed.
