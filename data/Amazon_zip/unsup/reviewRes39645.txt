Jona W. hit it on the head with her comment about "wild crimson fennel" lol. The food wasn't that bad though. It was creative and, for the most part, flavorful. Their small menu has shied me away from visiting L&E again, fearing that I would repeat choices already ordered by the previous dinner party. Overall, it's worth a try and gets brownie points for creativity, but loses out on value. So far, only Kuma's has validated a $15 burger. If you go, order per the chef's recommendations, and you will be pleasantly surprised.
