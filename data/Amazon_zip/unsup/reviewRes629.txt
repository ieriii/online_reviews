my 100th review. seems like just yesterday i was a noob yelper, putting my 2 cents out there for the interwebz to see. its been a great year yelping and i figure id end on the highest of high notes. at first i was going to review yelp for my 100th review. but that shiz is played out. i am going to review the best dining experience of my life for my 100th review. neither alinea nor its mastermind chef need my public adoration. afterall chef achatz has already been bestowed the best restaurant in north america and the #7 best restaurant in the world honors for alinea. it was an honor to eat here.  i dont need to break down the courses. every other reviewer has done so. you dont need to look at my pictures because there are far more artful and better looking ones out there (ill put my pictures up because i took the time to take them). however, i will tell you that you need to experience alinea. if you live in chicago and havent eaten here yet, what are you waiting for? if you live anywhere else in the country plan a trip around this restaurant. chicago is a beautiful city with amazing food--none better than alinea. it will be worth every penny. i tried for so long to figure out what to write here and in the end anything that i say will do a disservice to the food. it would also do a disservice to the chefs and the servers who labored to make my meal as enjoyable as it could be. it was four hours of sheer amazement. and if you are as lucky as i was chef achatz will plate your final course table side. alinea is the reason that yelp should expand to a 6 star review system. plain and simple.
