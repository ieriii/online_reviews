I just came here last night and it was just fabulous!our party was a bit unorganized and nobody called to notify them that we were running late by half an hour. our gigantic party of 14 people ended up waiting another 25 minutes because our table was seated to other reservations. the staff cleared out the dining room for our party, while then we ate lots of small little mini eggrolls, talked and had a great time waiting. before I knew it, we were in and seated!Onto the food, I ordered the pineapple callamari and this thing was just fabulous. Just perfectly cooked, not too overseasoned I ended up ordering another one to go for lunch in the afternoon tomorrow! BYOB that's a HUGEEEE PLUS!Our birthday girl was sang happy birthday to, they turned off all the lights in the dining room and the whole restaurant sang to us. It was so fun! I'm coming back here ASAP for the next big party we have, great foods and great services. They definitely know how to treat their customers and again, the food is just fantastic!
