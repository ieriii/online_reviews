So we went to this place on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed. The who system to get seats was pretty sketchy but we eventually got seated. We had called ahead to order the duck because it takes so long to make. We ended up waiting about 25min before our waitress came to our table, we asked for drinks and she didn't bring them out. We also had to wait about 50min for our food to come out. It was some of the worst service we've ever had. The food was absolutely delicious, but it really killed the experience having to wait so long for any service or food.
