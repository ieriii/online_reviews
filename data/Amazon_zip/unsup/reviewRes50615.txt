probably 3.5 rounded up went on sat night, had no prob the day of getting rezzies at 730. it was not too busy when we got there but by 8 was pretty packed overall food pretty good, i liked their gumbo. it was flavorful ad tasty, but there wasn't too much substance to it: could have used more sausage, chicken and veggies in the dish itself. nice that they make their own andoulle.
