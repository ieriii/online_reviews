This is my favorite restaurant by far. I was born in Miami and I love Cuban food! Although this is not typical Cuban food it is still wonderful. My husband is Serbian and loves their pork and I am in love with the steak. Their plantainos are great and wierdly enough the butter for the bread is delicious I am not sure what they put in it. The service there kind of sucks but I really don't care because the food is so great. P.S. to the servers I usually tip 20% but here I only tip 15% because of your sevice. I would rather tip the busboys!
