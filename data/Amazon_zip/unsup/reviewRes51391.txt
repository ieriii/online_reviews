Certainly there must be better Mexican food in Lincoln Square than this. My wife had enchiladas. The mushroom enchiladas in salsa verde were pretty good, not great. The chicken in mole was very bad - the mole had a distinctive powdery taste, which means the paste was not allowed to dissolve in the broth fully before being served. Big no-no. Her beans were totally without flavor. My tacos: asada, ok but lacked any real flavor. The steak needed seasoning, for sure. Al Pastor, totally bland, obviously the pork had not marinated long enough and was very fatty and chewy. Lengua, ok I love tongue tacos, but these were very chewy and lacked any seasoning, again, so they just had that sour boiled tongue flavor, which is nasty. Tostada de Aguacate: the crema was us style, so bad on a tostada, and the beans, again, like some inert paste of yuck. The rice was OK. Salsas were below average and not at all picante. Overall, I would not go here again, not even for tacos. Avoid this place if you like good, flavorful Mexican food.
