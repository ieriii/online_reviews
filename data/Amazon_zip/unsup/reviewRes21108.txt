I ate here for lunch on Saturday. I waited in line for about 40 minutes or so before placing in my order. Rick Bayless was there overseeing everything at the front counter area. I settled on getting the ahogada torta and a churros. The tomato soup that accompanies the torta complemented it well. I ordered it at a medium spice level. The churros was a delightful, light dessert. I have to make a couple trips back to try their freshly grounded chocolate drinks and other tortas and soups.
