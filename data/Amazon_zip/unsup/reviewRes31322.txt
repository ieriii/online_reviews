go! here! now! one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. every single thing on the menu is deeeeee-lish. the cocktails, too, are yummy and very unique. went recently with a large group and the service was impeccable. i love the art on the walls (all for sale, and reasonably too.) the chef is young and daring and very friendly... can't wait to go back and see what fantastic things he will cook up next!
