How did I get so lucky! I now have the best southern food restaurant just down the street from my house! Me and friend walked aimlessly down Clark st. And wondered into this new place. First we we were enamored with the charming, warm decor. We started with a mint juleps that was so perfectly made! A nice balance between the liquor and mint flavor. Next we ordered an appetizer, the relish plate. The server then brought out boiled peanuts...WOW what a treat! The relish plate was delicious but had I known I'd be getting the peanuts I'd of skipped it. I had a fried green tomato sandwich that was WAY too hard to pick up and eat but was yummy! And followed dinner with a red velvet cake made with beets. It was a little dry but i was so full and pleased with the rest of my meal I wasn't complaining. Over all this southern style restaurant was a hit! I'm telling everyone I know to check it out! So...GO!!!!!
