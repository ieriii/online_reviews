Oh Fox and Obel, how very far you've fallen. I've been with you since 2004 when I just moved to the city. Nobody really knew about you, and I'd sit in the cafe all by myself eating delicious food and enjoying the street view. Over the years, you became more popular, more crowded but still desirable. Unfortunately, the luster is long gone for a few reasons. 1. The shelves are nearly bare. What was once a well stocked grocery with lots of variety has turned into a barren, concrete building. 2. The prices have consistently risen in the cafe while the portions and quality have remained the same or even worse, deteriorated. 3. And this is my major gripe - the cafe now has servers. SLOW servers. The other system worked just fine, even efficiently. You ordered, placed the number on the table and the food was brought to the table. When I visited a month ago, I was annoyed that there were servers. This type of restaurant doesn't need a waitstaff. Furthermore, it does not work because the kitchen is on the opposite side of the restaurant. The service was TERRIBLE. My server was SLOW and didn't know the menu at all. And even better, now I'm obligated to tip for this crap service. The only bright spot was the black gentleman who bussed the tables. Give that man a raise! He was so nice, friendly and super hardworking. I think I know *exactly* why f&o introduced servers - they can pay them less. And now the restaurant patrons are forced to make up the difference in the way of tips. 4. They fired their head baker earlier this year. Fox and Obel had some of the best croissants in the city, if not the best. I haven't touched their baked goods since then. While I used to be a regular customer for many years, I don't see myself returning to Fox and Obel anytime soon. I would not be surprised if the doors are shuttered before the end of 2012.
