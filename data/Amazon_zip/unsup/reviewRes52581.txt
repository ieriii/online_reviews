You might not expect a vegetarian to write a good review of a steakhouse. You would be wrong. Brazzaz is fantastic for the salad bar alone, and totally worth the $20 all you can eat for the non-meat option. The salad bar includes hot and cold dishes, delicious cheese (always a plus!); pasta, rice; fruit...mmmm. I'm still drooling about the hot biscuits and the grilled pineapple. BF loves loves loves the meat, for the variety alone. He describes it as an 'intense eating experience' and I can testify to the food coma that overtakes him after we leave here. The service is almost too god- there are always servers bombarding you with meat (you almost feel bad turning them away), and refilling drinks. I don't think it would be worth the $40 dinner (especially for a vegetarian!) but this makes a great all you can eat lunch place.
