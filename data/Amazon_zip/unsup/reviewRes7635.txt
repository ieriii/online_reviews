Well I really liked Sapori, however my hubs did not, I guess you can't just please everyone. We've been getting coupons for this place forever and we kept meaning to go, I think his expectations were a little too high. We were seated in the quiet little side room, with five or six other tables which was very nice and romantic. I think I would have been annoyed had we sat in the main dining room in the front which was very crowded and loud. I would definitely recommend making a reservation for this place as it does get extremely packed.  If you get those coupons for the $68 deal, use them! You get: Wine - well, considering what you normally pay for a bottle of wine at a restaurant we knew it wasn't going to be very good, and we were right, but it was tolerable Bruschetta - very good, house marinated tomatoes, on yummy crusty bread Ceasar Salad - also excellent, the dressing wasn't overly creamy and the croutons were fresh and crunchy Two Pasta entrees - I opted for the Pumpkin Ravioli in a Brown Butter Sage, which was delightful. The hubs got the meat lasagna, which a lot of people seem to like, but unfortunately it had a slightly sweeter taste to it which unfortunately reminded us of Spaghetti-Ohs. Needless to say, this is why he was not a fan. Dessert - Chocolate Pana Cotta. It was good, but tasted like chocolate ice cream that had been melted and mixed with gelatin, which I suppose is what Pana Cotta is but was slightly unsettling.
