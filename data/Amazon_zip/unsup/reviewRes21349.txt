Your classic drive in, with option to eat inside when it's winter. We arrive at 10ish on a Saturday night, so if course no line. Whoopsidawg was a no brainer. Delicious charred dog with grilled onions and BBQ sauce. The fact that it was delicious sober pretty much means it's the best thing in the world at 2am. The pickled green tomato was tasty as well. Oh, and at this place, don't be afraid to order the chocolate shake, because that is a sweet treat....literally.
