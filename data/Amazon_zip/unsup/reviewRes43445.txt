BACKGROUND: I came here for one last Chicago brunch with my cousins before they move out of the country... *tear*. LIKES: - Huevos rancheros on the menu for the win! It comes casserole style though, which was interesting. It was actually pretty flavorful, and I didn't have to add any salt or seasoning. (Just hot sauce, but that's expected...) I think the only thing that could have improved this was adding chorizo.  - Huge cups of coffee. Anyone who supplies caffeine in bulk is a friend of mine. - Side of bacon was $2.75 I think? BUT THERE WERE 5 PIECES, AT LEAST! Epic WIN. - I stole a few of the home made chips from my cousin's panini plate -- mmm! Not too greasy, either, which I've found to be the norm with most home made chips. - Cute decor, really clean too! GRIPES: - No egg white or Egg Beater substitutions for the huevos rancheros. I realize this is about as ironic as getting a Diet Coke with a Big Mac, but I am just used to getting egg whites since high cholesterol runs in my family, and I'm not ready to give up cheese yet... - Getting seated was a bit disorganized, so I could see how this place could become a clown show if it were really crowded. --- There are other cool things on the menu that I want to try, like orange brioche french toast and tuscan onion soup with parmesan croutons, so obviously, I'll have to come back! And PRO TIP - They only serve the huevos rancheros on weekends.
