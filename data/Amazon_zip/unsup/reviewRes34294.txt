I had been dying to try Mia Francesca for years, as I've always heard it is some of the best Italian food in Lakeview. Hmm, I'm going to have to disagree. Their menu is pretty limited, and while everything was good, I wasn't impressed. Add to that the fact that they were blasting what sounded like someone's ipod playlist, and we had to repeatedly ask our waiter to turn down the music so we could hear each other. I just found that odd, as it is a nicer restaurant-so the music seemed really out of place. I think there are much better Italian restaurants out there, I wouldn't waste my money going back here.
