I have a complain first of all, it's always so busy! Seriously you have to wait so long just to get a table, food is usually good but the waiters are always in such a hurry and you can barely make any requests.The inside of the restaurant is very nice and huge, it's very affordable too and you can't beat the neighborhood!
