I have a love-hate relationship with Meli, hence the three stars. Loves: -I love that they have a large menu that includes a dedicated section with vegan options. Vegan brunch items, beyond just plain oatmeal, can be hard to find. Meli serves up some solid, delicious choices and has tons of other non-vegan options. -Ingredients are obviously high quality. The juices and smoothies are fabulous. Homemade ketchup is life-changing. Hates: -There are some problems with consistency. Today I ordered my salsa stacker and it showed up with no avocado. I asked the waitress and she brought some over, which was nice, but seriously that thing has structural integrity problems as is and trying to add avocado to the already high stack of veggies and tofu was a feat. Last week I was asked if I wanted a to-go cup of coffee -- free of charge. Um, hell yes, please! Today, I ask for it, and the waitress says, "Sure, but I'll have to charge you". Hmm... -Crowded. This place is always packed. I understand this because it's good food; however, when you are packed with only about 3 feet between you and the next table this presents a problem. Also, I always seem to be packed next to the table with loud kids. Not the place to come to if you are looking to have a leisurely brunch. - Just strange... The past two times I've had the same waitress and each time after I order from the vegan menu she asks me if I would like bacon or sausage with my vegan entree. What? Seriously? And today she asked me if I wanted a dessert "like the crepes or pancakes". Another entree as dessert with my breakfast entree? Que? In summary, the food is generally really good, but the place has a bit of weird vibe to me.
