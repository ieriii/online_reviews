amazing atmosphere, very fun, romantic, if you are going for a cute date, ask for a booth, it's def a perfect date place. be aware it's expensive, so be careful who you are taking out, not a good place for a casual date, unless you are ok dropping 150 bucks. If u are going with a long term gf or your wife, I recommend only ordering one main course, with salad, cheese fondu and chocolate fondu at the end, it's way too much food to order 2! Good food, great sea food, awesome beef, delicious dessert. It's got a better, more romantic environment than melting pot, but melting pot has a better selection and more choice and cheaper prices.
