I've eaten there now 3 times, most recently last night. As always, the food there is exceptional and the wait staff is attentive, skilled and very friendly. I really only have 2 issues with this place.  First of all the noise level. I had been there on weeknights before and it was OK, but last night (Saturday) was an anniversary dinner and the place was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard - not very romantic...The other real improvement needed is some work on the wine list. The wines are all Italian...which I get being an Italian restaurant...but they're also very poor value for the money. I had a $34 bottle of white wine that wouldn't stand up to a $9 bottle of California, Chilean, or Australian wine. So, my recommendation is to go and eat there, but go mid-week, when the noise level is lower, parking is easier (on the street), and bring your own wine - it's still cheaper even with a corkage fee.
