Let's put it this way... We actually drive in from the suburbs just so I can get an Ole Imperial burger at The Bad Apple. I love that burger. My husband has tried a few different ones and has loved them all. I like the fact that amidst the toppings, you still get a good taste of beef. The burger is tender, juicy, and flavorful. And I love all the options on the fries too, although I am always partial to anything with garlic. My husband loves the beer menu. There are beers on there that you don't often find in other places. I love that I can get a great burger at The Bad Apple without dealing with the wait or the hype of other burger places.
