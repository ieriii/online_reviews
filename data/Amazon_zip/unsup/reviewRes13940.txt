Been here twice now, each time was excellent. The bacon fat popcorn and pork belly confit are the stars of the appetizer menu and the white ale mussels were also quite good. Polenta fries left a bit to be desired for me but the sauce was tasty.  Definitely recommend the smokehouse burger topped with pulled pork, which is my favorite of the menu items I've had. The beer list is extensive and I was impressed with the Anti-Hero IPA although I will certainly be back to taste more soon.
