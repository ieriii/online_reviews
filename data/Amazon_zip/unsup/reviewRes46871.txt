I had a very nice brunch here. The space is very modern and trendy, yet comfortable. The $5 Bellinis were a great kickoff. I had the chiliquilies; an egg, corn tortilla, cheese and chorizo combination that eats like an omlette. My companion had eggs benedict with duck instead of bacon, and she said it was delicious. I had a small taste and I agree. The crispy potatoes were pretty good. However, they should perfect a savory and buttery hash brown and replace the current potatoes. If you are looking for a spot that is more upscale than a diner, yet not too stuffy and dressy, Uncommon Ground is a great choice. Another huge bonus is the parking lot! Street parking in Chicago is becoming a total ripoff, and places that offer free parking are poised to do well in the future.
