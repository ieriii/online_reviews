We spent a huge amount of money getting a big suite. When I called and booked it, they gave me one price. When we showed up, they tried to charge me several hundred more.  I ended up getting the quoted price, but what a pain. Our main room was too dark, so we asked for a few lamps to be delivered to when we were going out for the evening. When we returned, there was just one more table lamp, and placed on the floor! Then we discovered the TV didn't work. When we called to report it, the first question was, "Is it plugged in?" Did they think we were idiots? Even if they thought we were, when your guest pays that kind of money, you just say you will send someone right up. As it turned out, the TV was broken. There were some loose hardware pieces in one of our bathrooms, too. Granted, it's an old building and that is part of its charm, but they should make sure all the screws are tight. It went down after a national chain hotel bought it, that is for sure.
