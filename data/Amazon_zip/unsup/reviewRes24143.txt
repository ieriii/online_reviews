This restaurant was great. The quality of the food was superb. I had the Casado with chicken breast served with white rice, black beans, sweet plantains, an over easy egg & cabbage salad. It was wonderful. The rice water was very good. Wish I would have gotten it. (I tasted my boyfriends). I had the mango milk shake. It was okay. The service was great. They speak beautiful English so doesn't worry about that. The restaurant was clean and the bathroom was in good condition. I would highly recommend eating there and I would eat there again.
