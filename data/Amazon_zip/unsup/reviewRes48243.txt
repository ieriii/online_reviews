They didn't have pork belly on the night that I went :( Otherwise, everything was pretty good. It wasn't too difficult to secure a reservation on a Thursday night, and the ambiance and feel of the restaurant was laid back, but still classy. If you get seated in the middle area, you will no doubt overhear the conversations of people next to you, but they also have private booths for 2-4 people and also some more private tables. Not sure how you get these - I suppose just ask when you make reservations. Food was good. I enjoyed the pork rinds, the dover sole, and the country ribs. The french fries with the egg was decent, but not as amazing as everyone says it is. I found the food to be very affordable and a good amount to share if you come here with a couple of people. Overall, I thought this is a place I'd come back to again... and hopefully they have pork belly this time.
