I liked the food (a lot) but I felt like the place overall was a tad underwhelming. Let me start by explaining that my friends had hyped this place up a LOT. I'd wanted to try Xoco for awhile, so when some friends suggested it for meeting for lunch I was excited. The problem is, Xoco is just not a place for groups of people (I was with 6 others). We ended up having to do bar-type seating (there are regular tables too) and it was difficult to talk with everyone when you're sitting in a row. Now the food, I had one of the tortas but I can't remember the name of it. Was it good? Yes! Was it amazing? No, I don't think so. I had a bite of churro and ice cream and that really was fantastic. Didn't try the mexican hot chocolate even though I've heard it's fab. So, Xoco was good and deserves another chance. It's reasonably priced and the food is tasty - it's just not amaaazing.
