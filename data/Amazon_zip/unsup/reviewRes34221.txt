This place probably doesn't need another good review, but I feel like I found a new favorite place in Chicago, and just want to share my enthusiasm. I am not even a big fan of Italian cuisine, but this restaurant was just spectacular.  From the moment I walked in, the delicious smell drove me crazy. It was a Saturday night, and they were packed, and we didn't have a reservation, but they were very graceful about finding us a table and seating us in a timely manner.  Fried calamari that we got as an appetizer were a little bland, but the entrees more than compensated for it. My friend ordered a pizza, and it was great: very thin crust, flavorful mozzarella, just what I remember from my trip to Naples. I ordered pasta with mushrooms for $14 (sorry I don't remember the Italian name), and it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. It was very flavorful, not too oily, simply perfect. My usual concern about pasta dishes is that they are very filling, but not very memorable, but this was not at all the case at Mia Francesca. Will definitely be back!
