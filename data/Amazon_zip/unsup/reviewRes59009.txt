Although it wasn't officially opened yet...I had the pleasure of attending one of Sunda's advance tastings. The food, decor and service were all amazing and some of the best I have had in Chicago. The menu has a wide variety with a little something for everyone. From creative Asian appetizers to full dinners, sushi to Asian inspired cocktails, everything was tasty and exceeded my high expectations. I especially recommend the lemongrass beef lollipops, steamed bao buns, crispy shirmp toast with tuna jam and the Food Buddah's classic crispy rice with Kobe Beef or spicy tuna on top. A special shout out to the #10 sushi roll - I don't know what's in it but it was one of the best tasting things I've ever had.I'm sure this place will be crowded once it opens but it is well worth the wait!
