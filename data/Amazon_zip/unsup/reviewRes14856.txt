We have been going to Sabatino's for over 20 years and it is still my favorite Italian restaurant. If you want old school Italian, they do it best in my opinion. If decor and dining in a hip spot is what you want, this is not for you. Stick with the overpriced places in Lincoln Pk. I'm sorry for Mary W and her fellow diners that had an inexcusable experience for a birthday celebration. What she described is unacceptable. Our experience has been that the service is usually professional and efficient although we have had mediocre service on two occasions. This is out of perhaps 20 to 25 visits.
