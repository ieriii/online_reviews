Super friendly servers, a laid back vibe, and delicious/inspired dishes--I'll definitely be back! As a carnivore, I wanted to try out a meat substitute to see how it stacked up; the Radical Reuben was better than any traditional corned beef sandwich I've ever had. The vegan thousand island dressing (how can this be vegan?!) is spectacular. If you're not from the neighborhood, Chicago Diner is definitely worth the trip.
