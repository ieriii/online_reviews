I found Geja's to be a little overrated, but otherwise the food was fine. The portion sizes were generous, the quality of the food was good, and the price was in line with other fondue places. Although Geja's has been rated as one of the most romantic restaurants in Chicago, I found it to be rather cramped. The tables are very close together, it's a little difficult to navigate, and it was very crowded -- standing room only while we waited for our table. Overall I found them to be at the same level as The Melting Pot (my personal preference is The Melting Pot, but if you like fondue I'm sure you'll like Geja's).
