Had a great time. We had four people in our party and there was something for everyone. Our wine drinking friend loved the affordable list. Our meat eaters were satisfied with the meatballs, bone marrow and roast chicken. My wife loved how the music is in the background and we could have a conversation without shouting. If you like good food at affordable prices, you must try this place.
