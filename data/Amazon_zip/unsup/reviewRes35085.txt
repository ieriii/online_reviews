The rolls here are HUGE! You really get your money's worth here. 3 rolls for a party of 2 is more than enough. One of my fav sushi places to go to with many creative rolls to choose from. Their potstickers are delicious! The dipping sauce is unique with a spicy twist on it. Super yummy! Its pretty packed on the weekends and there is usually a 20 minute wait. Go on the weekdays and the place is empty because they do a lot of deliveries/take outs. Side note: stay away from the oyster shooters, they are terrible!
