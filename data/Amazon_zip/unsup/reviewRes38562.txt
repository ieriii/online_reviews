Great great deep dish! (They call their stuffed pizza) There were alot of cheese and the pie crust was crispy. It's a cheese heaven! We love cheese. When we took one slice out, we could see the cheese would of the pie would fall into that gap to fill that gap up, so you can imagine how much cheese you can get there. We love cheese so it's perfect for us. We would go there again and again and it's a must for us when we are in Chicago! totally recommending Giordano's. I've been to different Giordano's and I have no preference in the location. As long as it's Giordano's, they taste good to us.
