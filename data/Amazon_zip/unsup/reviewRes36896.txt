This place is very popular. The food is good and the variety on the menu is great. Overall, I like the place. However, what I hate about this place is that you have to wait about an hour to get a table because its so popular on weekends. Its hard to justify waiting around for an hour doing nothing so I'd rather go to Le Peep, where the food is just as good (not the same variety though) and there is never a wait.
