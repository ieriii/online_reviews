It is sad to plan carefully your meals in Chicago--two lunches and two dinners out--and to be disappointed with inferior food. We were pleased with the ambiance at India House. The martinis were expensive, but really well done.  Then came the appetizers. Chicken samosas - dry. Veg pakora - dry and bland. The chutneys made me worry for our health. They were clearly used at another table and not cleaned up or replenished before being placed at our table. The tamarind and mango chutneys were less than half full, and the spoon handle for the tamarind was caked with the sauce.  The lamb curry had a delicious sauce but the meat itself was dry and undercooked. Cubed lamb in a curry dish should be moist and fork tender. It was borderline tough. The service was inconsistent. We had to ask the bus staff to get more drinks and the check because our main guy was stuck to a table of ten. When he was free, I could never catch his eye. Won't be back.
