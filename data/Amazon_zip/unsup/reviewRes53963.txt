Well let me start off by saying that I have eaten cuban food before and i was shocked to taste such great cuban food in Chicago, the atmosphere was electric, cuban music playing and the hottest husband wife couple dancing behind the register so i dont know what was better but i know that if you havent been there go asap its like going to a show without the price tag, it is my new favorite place you will see what i meen when you go
