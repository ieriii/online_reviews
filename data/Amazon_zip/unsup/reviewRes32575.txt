ethiopian food, part 2: demera. if you've read all of my reviews, which you have, you know that ethiopian diamond didn't do it for me. for our 2nd girls night dinner, someone suggested ethiopian food at demera. fine. i was willing to take one for the team. there were 7 of us, just my sister and i vegetarians. everyone else got the family style messob sampler and we shared a smaller vegetarian messob. it was... fine. i guess it was a little better than ethiopian diamond and with less surly service. they didn't really tell us what the selection was that we were eating. injera, brown stuff, yellow stuff, green stuff. but i didn't ask for a fork this time. like a raptor, i learn. i wouldn't not eat ethiopian again. i just don't seek it out. i was glad i was just sharing with my sister because... don't do this with strangers. even if you don't think double dipping is gross just... don't. eat ethiopian food with your loved ones and don't plan this for a first date.
