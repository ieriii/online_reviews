Perfection! This cafe and market is paradise. The cafe has some excellent soups and sandwiches, all made to order and you can sit down and they will serve the food to you. This is truly not just an average grocer.  Panini is magnifique, and so is the chicken provencal - like a dinner at a high class establishment. The lunches here have been rated as the top quick-lunches in chicago. European feel. The breads are all fresh baked and the bakery has cupcakes and cookies that are all very unique. The prepared foods taste like they are made by top chefs and the meat and cheese selection is world class.
