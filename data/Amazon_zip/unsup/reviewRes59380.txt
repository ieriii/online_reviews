The meat and poultry section is very good and seems to have comparable prices to Whole Foods. The prepared foods section is very expensive. Last week I bought a large container of roasted veggies - $11.00 - huh...what's up with that? I still prefer Whole Food's cheese and fresh produce sections over Fox and Obel's but Whole Foods is too far away so I'll have to settle.
