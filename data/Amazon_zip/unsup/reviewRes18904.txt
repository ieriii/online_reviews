Came here for Saturday brunch. Making reservations for 10am was pointless... it was empty. That's when they open and if you get there a few minutes before 10, you'll have to wait while the kitchen's being set up. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Scramble and it was great. A slice of watermelon and a side of Brie Potatoes accompanies the meal. My friend ordered the Baked Dutch Baby Pancake... and let me tell you... ain't nothing baby about that thing! It's huge and uber sweet. Waaay too sweet, at least for me. My friend seemed to enjoy it... finished every last bite while I wondered how long before his physician puts him on Metformin. Hello Type 2 diabetes! Service was excellent. We were well attended to. Come here, you'll like it. :)
