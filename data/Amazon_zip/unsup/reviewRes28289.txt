I've heard people rave about this pizza place so had to check it out for myself. It's right by the Webster theatre so went there one evening when the movie I wanted to see was sold out. I'd give Pequod's a B. I really liked it, but that's because I really like pizza in general. Relatively speaking, it was no better than Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, etc. Crust was too bread-y and flavorless but burned cheese edges and tomato sauce were good.
