Three words...YUM YUM YUM!!!  Just got back from my first visit to Chicago, and of course I was eagerly anticipating eating some Chicago style deep dish pizza and Giordano's didn't disappoint. We had the stuffed cheese and it was fabulous!!! I love how the pizza is cooked first, then the sauce is smothered on top...brilliant! Beware though, it is extremely filling and would probably be very difficult to eat more than one or two slices. We had a wonderful server, Michael, who was very attentive and pleasant...he chatted with us briefly and and seemed genuinely interested in where we were from. I'm already talking about returning to Chicago soon, and Giordano's will be at the top of my food list!!
