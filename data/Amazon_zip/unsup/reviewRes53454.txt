HiWent to the most amazing restaurant in Chicago, Alinea. Check out their website.If you look at the menu we had the tour. Outrageous! Check out the gallery, look at the food. One example: a covered soup tureen. In it a spoon balanced across the bowl. In the spoon as small serving of seafood. Under it- two slices of japanese cedar burning and smoking the food. another example: parmesan cheese run through a seltzer bottle to create a foam, then frozen. Melts in your mouth and tastes like the most intense parmesan you've ever had. They make their own utensils most of which is quite unusual. The experience is best described as abstract art as food.
