I've been waiting to review this place for awhile. I've visited this establishment over 5 times within the past 2 years and not once have I been disappointed. The service is impeccable and the food is mouth watering. This is by far my favorite restaurant! Dinner is around $50 a person and lunch is about $35 for all you can eat including the salad bar. My boyfriend and I usually go for lunch and they have the same items then as they do for dinner. Their meats are nicely seasoned, juicy and perfectly done. My favorite is the pichana, first cut and done medium. Usually once you start getting picky about which meats you want to finish up on after you've had your fill of everything else, the manager and/or servers notice right away and ask you which meats you want served to you. Once you tell them, they bring them to you as soon as possible. If it's your birthday and you tell them, they'll do a little something special too ;) I love this place. Definitely worth the time and money! :)
