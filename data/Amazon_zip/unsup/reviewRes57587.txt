Romantic, cozy, and the longest dinner....ever... haha. Took my friend here for her birthday. She's a vegetarian so she got the $25 vegetarian course. I did as well. We felt a bit awkward because there were couples everywhere ... haha. We sat RIGHT next to the flamenco guitar guy ... too close for comfort actually. The cheese and chocolate fondues aren't that special. I liked the hot oil fondue though. I never knew that fondue also meant hot oil till I heard about this place. Filling and would be a great spot for a date... but it's going to take 2 hours or so if you order the 3 course. I ...uhh...kind of fell asleep while frying the veggies... hahahaha. It's all dark and then the flamenco guiar is playing right next to me... couldn't help it.
