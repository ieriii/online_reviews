My party of 10 and I had a great time! This was a very authentic KBBQ experience (cooking your meat yourself on grills at your table). None of us were Korean, but two of us lived in Japan and were very familiar with Korean food and how to work with the staff. I can see how it can be rough for first timers who don't go with people who have been before or know what to order. A few tips: 1. Research Korean food before you go so you don't have to depend on the limited English (and patience) of the staff to explain the menu. I recommend this site: http://www.lifeinkorea.c 2. Be swift and decisive in your ordering. You will get better service that way. The ladies taking your order will not tolerate small talk. 3. Start off small, you can always order more. One order of meat will feed two people if you order some sides like rice or soup (dol sot bim bim bop was excellent).  4. Make sure you wear something that is machine washable. The vents that are supposed to suck up the smoke can't keep up with the amount of grilling being done in the restaurant. You will leave smelling like KBBQ. Think of it like going to a bar before they passed those laws against smoking indoors. 5. Be adventurous and try the Korean beer and shoju. It goes well with the food. Do a little research in advance so you don't have to ask for a recommendation or just go out on a limb and get one of something and try it. If you're not ready for an authentic KBBQ experience (fast paced, sensory overload), go to Benihana.
