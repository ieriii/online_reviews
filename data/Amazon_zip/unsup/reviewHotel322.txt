If you like "European Style" hotels (but this one has a bigger and nicer lobby than you usually find in them), this place is for you.  I second David A.'s review right down to the last detail. There were no issues with noise (or anything else, for that matter).  Tastefully appointed and decorated with contemporary style, but with that "old building" charm.  There's a 15 minute unmetered parking zone right in front, to help you get situated.  We left an article in the room on one of our two stays, and sure enough it was turned in and waiting for us at the front desk. It was a light shell jacket and brand new, so someone in housekeeping would have been tempted to think "look what I found" ... but no; so that's encouraging and consistent with our overall impression of the place. We were in town because a family member had been in an accident and was hospitalized at Illinois Masonic (4 blocks away).  We found out that City Suites has a special rate for that circumstance, so if you are in that situation, be sure to ask. We feel as if we found a "second home" in Chicago, and while no nice hotels in the city are inexpensive, this was well within the "reasonable" range.  Very relaxing ambience in a hustle-bustle neighborhood helps to make this a winner, too. Both nights we got the "last available" room, so book ahead. It's not a large property.  In reading others' comments, it appears our room locations must have been advantageous regarding the noise issues.  So ask about that when you book. Finally, the comment about "quaint" (including TVs) is puzzling. They must have been doing some updating in some or all of the rooms. We had a suite both times, both had sleek flat screens, and the furnishings and linens, etc... were in the category of "chic".
