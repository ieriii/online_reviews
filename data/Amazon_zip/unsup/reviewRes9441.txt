Okay, admittedly I have not eaten inside the restaurant so I don't know anything about its "atmosphere." However, I did order take out from Le Colonial and I cannot believe how overpriced this place is. I ordered pan fried noodles with shrimp, scallop, calamari, and mixed vegetables and it cost $27.00 (before delivery and tip). Having never eaten here before, I expected to be amazed for that price. What I got, I could have gotten at any Asian takeout place. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. It also wasn't good. It was just okay. It also had very little seafood in it for $27.00. I had a grand total of two shrimp, little pieces of cut up scallop that probably only added up to one scallop, and few calamari thrown in. I will never, ever, order from here again. Incredibly overpriced and lackluster.
