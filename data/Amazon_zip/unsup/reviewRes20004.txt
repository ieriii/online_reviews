I think that this Rick Bayless guy has a bright future. Finally made it to Xoco this afternoon for lunch. I wanted to try a few different things, including a torta, the hot chocolate and churros. I opted for the Cubana torta, which is served with tender smoked pork loin, thick-cut and flavorful bacon, black beans, avocado, jack cheese, and chipotle mustard. Wow, the beans are smashed into the the crispy torta so you don't even know they're there, but add to the overall flavor of the sandwich. This is as good a take on the cuban sandwich as I've had at any Cuban restaurant, including in Miami. I also got the guac and chips, which accompany any torta well. To finish off the meal, hot chocolate and churros. The hot chocolate is a must. I'm no expert on churros, but it was good as well. The service was great - I was greeted when I came in and told they offer numbers to people in line when it was busy, but since there was no line, I could just walk up and order. The hot chocolate, guac and cips came out immediately and the torta took only a few minutes. By the time I left, there was a bit of the line and everyone had soup on their table (they had just started serving at 3 pm). They looked great - that will be for next time. I don't think this place is going to have a difficult time staying busy - the only thing is that once things settle down (if they ever do) they should consider serving soup before 3 pm (especially in Chicago's winter!) and offering take-out.
