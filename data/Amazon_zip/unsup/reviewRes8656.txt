I've been waiting to come here for years. I never get a chance to make it to Texas so Chicago Fogo had to do. First of all, I love and hate Brazilian BBQ because no matter what, you walk away felling like a cow. I've eaten at alot of places that's in the 40 bucks range so at 50 dollars for dinner(tip and drinks excluded), I think Fogo is right on the mark. Meat is right about 10 bucks better than most other BBQ places. Salad bar here was better as well. Better selection of cheeses, fresh beats were perfect, and of course, endless amounts of heart of palm. Now to the meat, the signature picanha was my favorite. Rib-eye was good and bottom sirloin was better than top sirloin. Parm pork was so-so. Lamb and sausage was great. Filet was the only beef that was under par...bit too salty. Oh yeah, chicken was tasty and tender....final verdict, would i do it again, yes but in maybe 5 years.
