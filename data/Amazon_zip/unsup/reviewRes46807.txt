What happened? I moved to Edgewater in 2006 and have been a frequent customer at Uncommon Ground on Devon. The food has always been great, the servers have been very professional and I've always enjoyed the experience. The only downside was, at times, a long wait. But that is always the case at popular restaurants. So this evening, I suggested to a friend that we go there for dinner as she had never been there before. We ordered calamari as an app. I have always said that UC's calamari is among the best in town. Tonight, it was dry, papery and the sauce was different. I swear it was just mustard. The big disappointment was the size of this $10 app has been cut down by 70%. There was hardly enough for one person, let alone two. This wasn't the case before. It used to be served on a large rectangular plate, but tonight it was on a much smaller plate. Very disappointing. I ordered the Sunshine salad with chicken, which I've had many times before. In fact, I just had it about 4 weeks ago and it was so big I had to get a box to take half of it home. Tonight, it was served in a soup bowl which is half the size it used to be. It was also not made the same way. It was basically a bowl of field greens with some cubes of chicken, peppers and radish. If there was dressing on it, I didn't taste it. Very disappointing. My friend had the chopped salad, which was also half the size it used to be. She enjoyed it but didn't have anything to compare it to since it was her first time eating there. Our server was attentive at first but as the restaurant filled up, we didn't see her much. I have a feeling she put our orders in as the small versions of the salad but we were clearly ordering them as our entrees. So I don't know what has happened to my beloved Uncommon Ground. There aren't many nice places to eat in Edgewater. I hope this was an anomaly. Right now, I'm not sure if I am willing to go back, though.
