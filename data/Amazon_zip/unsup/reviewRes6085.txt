Best Italian restaurant in town. -Chicken Liver Pate. Good. Bring the rest home because you won't finish it. -Truffle Egg Toast, Fontina & Asparagus. Amazing. -Davanti Burger. Very good burger. Fries were unique but not my cup of tea. -Pollo Solo Mio. Even the white meat was so tender and juicy. Service. Perfect. Extremely helpful and so friendly without making it look fake. Coke refills without even asking. Our waitress didn't even interrupt us when doing so. That's pro. Decor. Love the subtle Christmas decorations. Love the wall full of wine. Love the brick. The hooks to hang your coats are so creative. They use old school keys and they're all different. Add so much character. Come on a Sunday and there's no corkage fee. Sweet. Other specials every day of the week! Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.
