Violet hour makes me happy. No matter what kind of day, week or even month I've had, once I sit down and order a drink (and I've never had a drink here I didn't think was just out of this world) and have a few bites from their delicious cheese plate, life is good, I am happy and nothing can bring me down. This may very well be my favorite place to relax in the city.
