I am fat and I like meat. I was forced to get a vegetarian pizza because my manatee doesnt eat meat. Eventhough I was unable to try their sausage and pepperoni the spinach and cheese pizza was one the best I have ever eaten. As a fatty, I should be able to pound this thing down. But even for a pizza for 2 we were unable to eat it all. My stomach was in shock and disheartened. The pizza here lives up to the hype.
