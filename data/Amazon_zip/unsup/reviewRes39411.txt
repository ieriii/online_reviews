I went there couple of times before. I will never go there again. The food is ok... Side dishes are awesome. But servers are horrible and rude. If you are Asian they act like they want some respect from you just because they are older than you!!! I have to ask water, chopstick or whatever I need for at least 3 times. Ok then it's time to go... Once before I was there with my girlfriends and staff was rude so we didn't leave tip for them but for bus boy. He was same victim like us. They treat him so bad. And in the parking lot there's a lady who served us. She was screaming and yelling that we didn't leave the tip for her. Of course I wouldn't, but we did for bus boy and we won't tell you that!!! Well bad place, don't go there!!!
