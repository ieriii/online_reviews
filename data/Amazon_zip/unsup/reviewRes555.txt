OMIGOD... coming from a culinary town such as SF, I had high expectations. Every expectation was surpassed! This was the most amazing culinary experience of my life. From the waitstaff to the presentation to, of course, the food there was a rush of anticipation and sometimes wonder; as in "how do I eat this?". Great atmosphere, amazing food, unbelievable experience!
