I actually want to upgrade my review a half star. I still don't think the food is phenomenal, just good. The upgrade is more for the great customer service I received from my waiter Paul and another gentleman that worked there. Also, I visited the other location a bit earlier in the week, and my food was awful. I give this location props for being better than the other location.
