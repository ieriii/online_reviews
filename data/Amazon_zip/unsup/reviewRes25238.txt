Geja's wins over the Melting Pot! Geja's has to be one of the most romantic restaurants in Chicago. The music and the low lighting just the small booths, you feel as you are the only ones in the restaurant.  The portions are very large! My date and I were able to split a single person portion. It was great to get the whole experience of the fondue cheese, meat, and chocolate. Life was very sweet that day. Perfect birthday celebration
