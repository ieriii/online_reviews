My boyfriend remarked halfway through our dinner that this restaurant and its concept is basically treatment that was enjoyed by only royalty/people of extraordinary wealth up until relatively recently. And you know what, for $50 a plate this really is a royal treatment, and you get way more than you pay for. Things to love: the cheese balls (eat them while they're still hot when they first get to the table), the top sirloin, the slow cooked bottom roast, the lamb (best lamb I've ever eaten, period), the filet mignon, bacon wrapped and original, the dripping moist pork loin, the bananas smothered in butter, the jamon and manchego at the salad bar. I think the best part for me was having them take me seriously when I say i want the rarest piece of meat they have, as I was rewarded with a blue filet mignon every time. I also love that if something you want hasn't been around yet, they'll fetch it for you, and that you don't necessarily have to clean your plate or risk extra charges like at some other AYCE joints. I didn't eat it the last time I was here but if you're not ready to burst and would like a splurge, that mango cream dessert is really delicious. This place is delicious, the service is absolutely excellent, and you'll definitely leave with a well-earned meat hangover.
