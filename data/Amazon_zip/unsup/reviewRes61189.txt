not all dishes are created equal .. first time i stopped in i tried the carne asada .. thumbs up . real good . decided it was a good place to try again . second time i came i tried the tortilla soup and chicken in green sauce .. thumbs way down . tortilla soup lacked flavor, very bland, basically water n grease . and the chicken in green sauce not good either . overboiled chicken cracked pieces of bone no flavor either .. so i'll only come here for the steak ..
