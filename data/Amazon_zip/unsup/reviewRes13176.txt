I have gone to many steak places in my life time major steak houses and so forth,but this place topped them all. We were celebrating my mothers birthday here last night it was the best meal we have ever had. Staring with the great decor to the beautiful and plentiful salad bar. The meats were cooked to perfection and continued to arrive at our table as long as you had your green side showing, even if you didn't and saw a family member taking in something that caught your eye all you have to do was ask and it was your. The steak was perfect and you never had to ask for more it just keeps coming . Our favorite was the flank steak and upon request continued to come in all forms rare,well done etc,etc. The price is right and affordable for what you receive in return. We are already planning our return with friends that we have shared our experience with. Frankie our server was the best and so were his assistants thank you!!!
