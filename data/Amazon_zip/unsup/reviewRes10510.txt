I love this place. I love everything about this place. I love coming here early for dinner because the pizza is great. Super thin crust, never too heavy with the cheese and the sauce is flavorful. The whole pizza has a light feel to it which makes it perfect for pairing with something like the Top Heavy. This home-brewed hefeweizen is one of the best wheat beers I've ever had, and I like me a wheat beer.  I've worked my way through most of the home-brew list and they're all amazing and reasonably priced. I'm not saying cheap, and if you come for a full meal expect to drop around 20/30 (depending on how much you drink), but it's worth it once and a while. The only reason I didn't give piece a full five stars is because depending on which night/time you go, it can be insanely crowded, full of drunken karaoke singers and too busy for you to even order food. If you want the fantastic pizza on a weekend after 8pm I would probably just order take out and move on.
