This place is so warm and cozy and the food is awesome. One can see many celebs in here who don't wish to be noticed at the glitzy joints. The best dishes I've had so far are the fresh fish (salmon), the hash browns are to-die-for, the fish tacos rivaled the ones in Baja and scones with fresh whipped cream are always worth coming back for. The decor is so Bo-Ho and artsy---speaking of art, every few weeks the art on the wall changes and one can actually purchase it. The owner is also very friendly and gives you one-on-one attention---one can't help but be pleased here, not only with the food but excellent service. Being a local Chicagoan and loving food, I give the 3rd Coast the highest possible rating--it doesn't get any better than this folks!
