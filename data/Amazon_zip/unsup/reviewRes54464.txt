I want to love you Chicago Diner, I want to so bad, alas, you disappoint me everytime. The service is usually pretty good, but the food is really not that great. I have had a reuben, not so great, a roast beef sandwhich, ick, veggie burgers, eh, taco salad, gross. The only thing I have ever had from here that is awesome, the vegan vanilla chai milkshake is absolutely amazing, nothing can compare,.
