I stayed here this past weekend and had a room facing the lake. It was a nice and cozy room. I had access to the Executive Room for a continental breakfast which was nice. The staff members were friendly.  I like the location of the hotel, across from Grant Park and I enjoyed the view of the lake and the city.  I didn't get a chance to experience the in-hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them but I will the next I stay hear.
