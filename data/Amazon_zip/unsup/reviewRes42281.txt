Two Words: Major Disappointment Before I start my rant here I would like to say that the only reason that they got 1 star was because our waiter was decent. I have been here over a gazillion times ever since they opened their doors and after the last time I don't think I'll ever come back. A few days ago my friends and I came here for dinner after a long day at work. We were seated within a few moments and were then left to decide what to order. We ordered a sauteed beef dish, simmered pork and shrimp, 2 phos, and a soda chanh( lemonade with club soda). First off I ordered at least five minutes before everyone else did so how the hell did my dish come out 12 minutes after everyone else? Anyways.. While I was watching my friends enjoy their food the waiter brought out my soda chanh or should I say cold Theraflu? Seriously, it tasted so bad that my friend and I were adding sugar and lime juice to it and it still tasted like crap. People in order to make soda chanh you must use CLUB SODA! Damn if you can't make it don't put it on the damn menu! Oh and that's not even the best part! The best part was when I realized that we had absolutely no napkins on the table and I asked one of the waiters for some napkins and guess what?! HE FREAKING IGNORED ME!!!! I was literally a foot away from him and trust me I know my voice carries! So after I went to steal napkins off some other table my dish finally came out and the staff was so lovely that they started cleaning with Clorox Bleach, the smell of the bleach went so well with my pork and shrimp dish that I wanted to throw up. So folks after having such a wonderful dinner, I have decided that the next time my friends and I want to have a nice dinner we'll go to Mcdonalds!
