Located on The Magnificent Mile just north of the Riverwalk, we popped in here for an early mid-week dinner. We beat the rush and got a couple of seats next at their communal table. It seems like it gets busy with the after-work crowd. The tagline is cheese, swine and wine. We didn't have any cheese, but a full thumbs up on the swine and wine! Our friendly server recommended a wine for us to try -- the 2006 Alpha Estate Axia, a mix of syrah and xinomavro, a greek varietal. We enjoyed it and it paired well with all our dishes. The Purple Pig serves small plates making it easy to share and try a few things. We started with the Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries. The deviled egg is made with bechemel sauce, put back together, breaded and deep fried. The arugula salad is bright and vinegary, a nice complement to heaviness of the egg. We next enjoyed Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. Three huge bones are served with tiny forks so that you can scoop out marrow to spread on bread. The combination of salty pork flavor, fresh herb salad and fresh crunchy bread with drizzles of olive oil... so delicious! We enjoyed two entrees: Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette. Both were fantastic, but I think the Pork Shoulder was my favorite -- fork tender and paired well with creamy buttery potatoes. We finished on a sweet note -- the Butterscotch Pudding. Creamy and sweet with nice hints of salt. As we ate our pudding, a design at the bottom of the bowl was revealed -- a drawing of a pig. Yes, we pigged out at The Purple Pig and enjoyed it. Oink oink!
