There are tons of good steak places, and although Kinzie doesn't compare to Joe's in my opinion- this is next in line. I think they do an excellent steak, and the service is really good. The steaks are done to perfection and the baked potatos are perfect as well. They have good salads as well if you don't want a steak- I've been for lunch and have had a salad before. Also the desserts are worth stuffing yourself for too.
