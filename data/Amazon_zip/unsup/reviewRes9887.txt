I ate here for lunch with 2 girlfriends on 6-26-12. We sat at the outdoor seating which was amazing. It's definitely the best outdoor seating I have experienced in the city. The food and drinks were good, and the service was excellent. I ordered the gazpacho and the griglia mista. The griglia mista was delicious!!! I shouldn't have ordered the gazpacho, because the griglia mista was a big serving size, and I was too full at the end of lunch. I will definitely return to this restaurant.
