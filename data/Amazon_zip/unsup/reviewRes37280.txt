Fox and Obel catered my wedding. We had just passed appetizers which consisted of: crab cakes, tofu with peanut sauce, and spring rolls. AWESOME!!! We also had a table with little sandwiches, dips, and best of all.... CHEESE! Fox and Obel has some of the greatest cheeses, so this was one of the highlights. Unfortunately, being busy mingling, and talking and dancing, I hardly got to eat a lot of food...but I will say I had guest after guest wondering where the food was from! I work at a venue and see different caterers every weekend...my biggest worry was staffing. The staff of a caterer takes care of so much more than just food, they basically are there to ensure everything, from the bar to the candles are perfect..that guests don't get too out of hand, to cleaning up and breaking down the tables at the end of the night and cleaning up. I have seen some disaster cases with caterers and the employees, lackadaisical, strange, dirty, etc. This was absolutely not the case with Fox and Obel... the staff was impeccable...Even my guests had fun chatting with them about the food, and couldn't believe how friendly the caterers were. Kelley whom I worked with in planning and tasting was there for every silly question and request I had. I couldn't be happier, having a great caterer, with great staff, and amazing food not only sets the bride and groom at ease but makes for a super happy event!!
