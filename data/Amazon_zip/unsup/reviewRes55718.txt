I have been coming to this place since I was a young child, as a person who was raised with home made Italian food I am extremely picky. The Venue is older looking and dark inside, but has some real authentic charm to it. The staff is extremely accommodating and courteous. Like I said, I know real home made Italian food and have never been unhappy with any of their courses. Make sure to make a reservation well ahead of time as this place packs up very quickly, they even have some nice outdoor seating now for the summer time. Try the baked clams, chicken vesuvio, and any veal dish. Manga!
