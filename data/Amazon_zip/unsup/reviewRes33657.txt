There's something for everyone at Yolk - their menu is as big as an IHOP-esque menu (maybe even bigger), and they do serve a mean omelette - I liked their potatoes as well. The waiter was attentive, and the coffee was pretty good. Since this place is pretty big, we didn't have a wait at all. Don't expect anything schmancy here, but if you want solid brunch fare for a good price, Yolk is the place to go.
