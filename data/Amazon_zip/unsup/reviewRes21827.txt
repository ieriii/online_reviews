I'll make this one short and sweet. This place is just OK. It's nothing great, kinda cool with the old drive-in thing but food is just OK. But you know what's stupid? Ask for ketchup on a CHEESEBURGER and they tell you they don't do that. On a BURGER?! Hot dogs yes burgers no ketchup? Never heard of that. (And I grew up in Chicagoland) THAT'S JUST DUMB!
