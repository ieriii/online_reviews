Let me start by saying I love BYOB restaurants, seek them out, and praise them when deserved  I am extremely adventurous in terms of sushi, and have been very rarely let down.  I went here with a friend and saw the high rating on Yelp and was expecting to be amazed. Maybe they didn't get a fresh delivery when I was there, but I had to spit not one but two different rolls out in my napkin due to a stale fishy taste and chewy consistency. I have been to many, many sushi places in Chicago, across the country, and a couple places abroad. I love trying unique maki rolls, nigiri, and sushi .  So for me to have to spit out two different rolls in my napkin was extremely shocking because I have never once had an issue with even the most daring sushi.   Also, they have a $6 corkage fee. That is pretty extreme for a BYOB.
