It's really strange and interesting how the restaurant is broken up into two sections: the small front section and the larger back section which is reachable by a long thin corridor. I think the back room is for larger parties. We had a very large party and I think the waiters were getting kind of frazzled because the food orders kept getting mixed up and they were barking random questions at us. Anyway, the main problem was the food. The grilled chicken was old and dried up, the bean/salsa flavors fell flat and it was altogether very disappointing Mexican food. I've had muchhhh better, even the food trucks have more punch.The guac was sadly bland, which is a sin. Only the margaritas were enjoyable, and I think they were virgin. A kitschy Mexican place with not much to recommend. Pass.
