My favorite way to dine is to split a bunch of apps with my dining companions, and 90 Miles is perfect for this. They have between 10 and 15 appetizer options, and I've enjoyed all of them I've had so far. My fave is the chorizo empenada! The portions of each are reasonable, and all but the tamales ($4) cost under $3 each.  Mixed with the fact that it is a BYOB, this is a very cheap place to dine. Last time I went, my bill for two people was in the $20 range. On top of this, the atmosphere is great. They continually pump in upbeat cuban music that keeps me grooving in my seat. 90 Miles has both a covered beergarden that is open year around (and quite warm in the winter) and a patio open in the warmer months. The place is always fairly full, but I've never had to wait to be seated, even on weekend evenings. Parking in the area, on the other hand, can be hit or miss, although it is walkable from the Western Blueline stop. It is an ideal spot for both a celebration with many friends or a nice meal for two.
