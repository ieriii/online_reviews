This is my go to brunch place for when my family comes in town...not because there aren't other great brunch places but they request it! I have only been here for brunch so I can't comment on the other menu items. The Huevos Rancheros are simply divine and maybe the best I've ever had. I also highly enjoy the build-your-own egg white omelet - delicious and healthy (well depending on what you put in). They earn extra kudos for having goat cheese as an option! The service is usually on par but this past Sunday must have been an off morning for them. We were seated and then no one came by, we had to ask the hostess who sat us if we had a server and she seemed dumbfounded. Then asked what the party name was (why this is relevant in finding a server I'm not sure) and then wanted us to move to another table - luckily there was a server who said he would be happy to serve us where we were seated. Overall a good brunch spot, just make sure to get there at a relatively early time or you will be stuck waiting.
