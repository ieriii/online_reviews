Mmmm lobster and crab bisque. And bread-sold!   I have eaten here many times and it really is quite tasty. The most recent time I went I had the coconut shrimp, which was tasty but a little heavy (it probably didn't help I had the lobster and crab bisque before- probably too much fish...) Great service, a very good restaurant that is reliable.
