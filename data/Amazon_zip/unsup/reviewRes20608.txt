The decor and location can't be beat, and the majority of their menu is small plates, so this would probably be more ideal for happy hour or a big group. I went for dinner during restaurant week and was able to sample the restaurant's version of their best foot forward. Food was just ok, portion size a little small (in comparison to other places visited during restaurant week), and overall slightly pretentious. I'll go back, but it might not be a first choice.
