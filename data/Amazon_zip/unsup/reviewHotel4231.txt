I came here to babysit while the parents were in town for a wedding. I arrived and went to the front desk to have them call up to the room. Oh no... that is too much to ask. The desk person pointed and barked at me to use the phones to call the room. I then get to the elevator and nowhere am I told that there were two different elevator banks. I go all the way up only to have to come back down and run across the hotel to the other elevator bank. I knew I'd have time on my hands so I brought my laptop to get some work done. Once the baby was asleep I decided to get rolling on my work. Imagine my surprise when I was told that I had to pay for internet. Really? You can go almost anywhere now and get free WiFi. Luckily, I was prepared and was able to work around this. THEN I ordered dinner. I was paying cash and told them right away that I did NOT want them charging the room and that I was paying cash. The food came and the gentleman who brought it did not have change. My meal (mind you, it was just one meal...chicken sandwich and a diet coke. It was nothing fancy and nothing more) was $28... I gave him $40 and he had to go downstairs to get change. He returned an hour later with it. I was not too impressed with this place and, in the future when I travel, I may just steer clear of any Hyatt. If they can't get it right in Chicago, I doubt they will get it right elsewhere.
