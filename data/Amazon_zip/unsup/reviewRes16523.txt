I went here just before my gigantor crash in March 2009. We had reservations but still had to wait a pretty long time on fairly uncomfortable seating. The waiting was in the bar area which was *packed* with hipsters and people clearly there to "be seen". They were very grumpy about making any accommodations for me in my highly weakened state, but at least they finally showed me the bathroom on the same level on which we were (eventually) seated - I estimate we waitied for an hour and a quarter past our reservation. So, the first thing they did was apologize for the wait and comped us an appetizer. It was tasty, though I remember feeling as though they should have done more. Anyway, there were five of us at dinner, and we just ordered a bunch of food and shared it all family style. Although I got shafted on ordering anything I personally wanted, I found most of the dishes quite tasty. Some, however, were inedible past 2 bites due to sodium levels (I wasn't under strict restriction at that point, but I was watching it pretty carefully anyway). The drinks were apparently good, and the non-alcoholics (Mojito Smoothie) were really nice - something I appreciate greatly. Anyway, if salt doesn't bother you, and if you like hip scenes, this is a great place to try. The waits are long, but the food is tasty and a fun time can be had by all.
