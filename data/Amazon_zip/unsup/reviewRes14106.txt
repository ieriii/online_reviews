One of my favorite restaurants in all of Chicago. No, it ain't a diner, but don't let that throw you off. The food is really well prepared, somehow sophisticated and really down-home-good at the same time. The meatloaf sandwich always satisfies, and the pasta dishes and reuben are fantastic. It's small, sometimes crowded, but SO worth it. Wish they had beer on tap - they don't. This place actually made me start a yelp account, just so I could weigh in about it. LOVE the Glenn's!!
