I've only been here once, but it was truly a treat.  I'm not very fluent in the names of Vietnamese food, and quite frankly I'm too lazy to save this review and google it, but we had these "do it yourself" spring roles.  I might not be able to name them, but I can describe how fan-effin'-tastic they were. You get a mountain of meat, fresh veggies, and basil with these rice papers. You dip the dry rice papers in a bowl of warm water and fill them with all sorts of deliciousness. It is the perfect summer meal! So light. So delicious. So fresh tasting. This dish is a must, and Tank does it better than any other place I've tried. Oh, and did I mention it's cheap and byob? Well I should've.
