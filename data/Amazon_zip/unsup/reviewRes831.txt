Arrived at Doug's at 245 pm and we finally got in and ordered about an hour later. The wait is no joke and when I visited it was freezing outside. With that said, I would have done it again in a heartbeat. My fiance and I ordered 3 sausages (1 for each and 1 to split). We ordered the rib-eye steak sausage, the chicken and ham cordon blue sausage and an andouille sausage and a side of duck fat fries. The Cordon Blue was my favorite! It had fantastic flavor and fried prosciutto on top. So very good and juicy..... The Rib-eye was my fiance's favorite. The Andouille was in no way disappointing, it was very very good. I know someone will probably put a hit out on me for saying this but.... the duck fat fries are overrated. They're OK, but I have had much better at nearby establishments. Can't wait to for my next visit. Wishing I would have also tried the dog with foie gras.
