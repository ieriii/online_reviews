Wed night, very busy. Reserved and was given a table immediately in the main room. Surprisingly dull decor, as if the place had been on Kitchen Nightmares and had $1000 and 8 hours to redecorate. Loud. Waiter was polite and efficient, knew the varietals of each wine by the glass which was good. Oxtail appetizer was delicious and slow braised. Special of the Day risotto was just past al dente and the red wine reduction was very good. Only complaint was that the entree arrived as we were finishing our appetizer, a pet hate of mine. This is not a QSR experience... I'm not rushing to go back to this perfectly competent restaurant, but if I was told I was eating there next week I wouldn't fight to change the venue...
