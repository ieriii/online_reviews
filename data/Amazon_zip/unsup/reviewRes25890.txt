I've been here twice now and I think I may have failed on ordering both times. I knew the deep dish was what you come here for but I think I was confused or maybe drunk, I don't know. The first time we ordered thin crust. Right? Seriously, it's like going to a steakhouse and ordering pasta. I'm a moron. It was still good pizza, don't get me wrong. Nothing to do a little dance about. Six months later we made it back, yay! We ordered the deep dish, yay! I let my husband pick toppings and he went completely overboard, boo. Sausage, mushroom, green pepper and onion. I did not realized what a pile of stuff was going to come on our pizza. Lots of toppings are okay for thin crust but deep dish, I really just want to taste crust, sauce, cheese. The sausage pieces are about as big as my ears, FYI. So it was deece but nothing mindblowing like I was honestly expecting. The carmelized crust was okay but I'm thinking it would be even better if it wasn't suffocated by the garden growing on top of it. So I need to go back once more and get either a cheese or one topping pizza to figure out how it REALLY is. The good part is that I love the vibe of this place, the servers are all really nice and pizzas don't take tooo long to arrive. We always have an easy time finding parking on the weeknights too so I'll be back...
