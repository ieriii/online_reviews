HEADLINE: SAN SOO GAB SAN SAVES 3 FROM FROSTBITE This place was a lifesaver this weekend. With absolutely painful why-the-fu*k-do-I-live-in-Chicago windchill of -22, we made a run from our car to this wood-heated sanctuary of beef for a meal to remember.  SSGS scored immediate points when our server, like a life-saving St. Bernard, rushed to our table to bring us cups of hot tea. And then the banchan arrived. Those little appetizer dishes multiplied like a wet mogwai on our table with a final count of 24 dishes!  Finally, the meat...the glorious meat. We stayed away from the bulgogi this time (which tends to stick and fall into the grill) and opted for the kalbi and the ribeye. The kalbi was great, but the real star of the show was the buttery rib eye. Wrap that sucker up in a lettuce leaf with some rice, kimchi, and the sesame oil dipping sauce and you have a vegetarian converter like no other. 5 mouth-watering stars!
