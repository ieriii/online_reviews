So much better than any tapas restaurant in Chicago! Excellent ambiance, the Sangria rocked (I used to make my own in the 60's-70's) and the menu is full of perfect little creations to fill you up.Went here 3 nights in a row but during the week, stayed at the Hilton nextdoor & went to Bluesfest'09. Saw this place packed on the weekend so stayed away. Definitely go during the week. You will probably see some celebrities here. Sit at the little bar if you go alone.All the waitstaff are friendly & fun & goodlooking too!
