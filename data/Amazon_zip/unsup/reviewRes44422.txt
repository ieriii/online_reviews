I love wakamono and think it is probably the best sushi on the north side of the city. The atmosphere is swank and sophisticated and makes for a great date night or special night out. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. Some of my favorites include the peter parker, connie chung roll, and any of their nightly specialty rolls. The tuna and avocado dip is an amazing appetizer and I also love the crab rangoon which I believe are borrowed from their neighbor ping pong. The prices are a little higher than your typical sushi hole in the wall joint but I think they are definitely fair considering the quality of the food that they serve and the ambiance. Also, love hitting up the connected bar Wang's for an asian pear martini and a hip vibe. I will definitely continue to be a regular here as long as the food stays fresh and the atmosphere stays sexy.
