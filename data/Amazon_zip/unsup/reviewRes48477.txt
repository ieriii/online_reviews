4, 3 and 1 - Visited this place 3 times and i would rate them on a downwards scale and ending on 2... First time i absolutely loved the atmosphere, the food, the beer selection and the entire experience. Second time was new years eve. The food was a set menu which was not good at all. The entire staff seemed like they would rather be somewhere else (which i dont blame them for, but...). And then 3'rd (and last time) i was there was BAD! One of many thing that went wrong: We got served some sausages (as part of a dish) and it was frozen inside. When we told them they took the sausages out and brought them (The exact same 3 cut up sausages) back after 10 seconds of frying. At the end we just asked to take out the food and asked for the check - they newer came with the check but instead tried to make up for the mistakes with free desserts! For a restaurant to make up for bad food with more food is SO bad - and instead we had to wait an additional 45 minutes for the check! Anyway - love Avec, Blackbird and so many good restaurants in the neighborhood that i really dont see any reason to eat there again!
