I had a good experience with the staff- they give a personal touch that's refreshing. They were happily accomodating to my party's various special dietary needs (no nuts, no seafood, vegetarians, etc)... They pointed out how I could save some cash on an event I asked them to cater. They gave careful reheating instructions and just generally took care with my order. For a large party- you can get family style for $12.50/person. Hard to beat that price in Chicagoland.
