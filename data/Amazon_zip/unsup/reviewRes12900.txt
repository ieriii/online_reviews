i've been going to churrascaria restaurants for a while. love them, but try not to eat for 2 days before ... due to glactomy that occurs at those places :) well, i might have figured out a best way to "beat" them. i've ordered a take out .... 1lb of few meats, few sides. $80 worth of food that was Impressive (amazing, godly, etc, etc :) and yet ... because it remained in the refrigerator for 2 weeks, it allowed me to taste it, in small portions!
