Whenever we have anyone in town come visit us we usually come to Dermera. It's fun to have the food come out on one platter and everyone share or at least that is what we do. We usually get the 21. Dermera Messob (for two) with this you get to choose 6 portions (veggies, meat, seafood, and kitfo) from the entire menu. The beer selection here is great too, I'm not that big of a beer person but the St. George (an Ethiopian beer) is tasty. The coffee here is sort of crazy.. if you want some order it ahead because it takes about 20 minutes to make. I've heard if you drink too much you can hallucinate or something.
