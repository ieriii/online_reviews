This is one of those places that I have heard a lot about but didn't ever go to, I thought it was a Chicago novelty kind of like Chicago style pizza...I want to tell you my friends (Hot Doug's lingo) that I was wrong. If my heart could handle this, I would eat here every single day, it is that good. They have unique sausage items that you can't get anywhere else in the city, like Elk, buffalo, etc. and for people who don't like to try new things...yes, they have the Chicago style hot dog. Finish everything off with some fries cooked in duck fat (available on Friday and Sat. only) and you have an awesome meal. The only complaints are the long lines and the random hours.
