I've been going to this place for years and have always had great experiences. I was hesitant to take friends from out of town in for their first time and for my first time since Chef Mendez left. I was not disappointed. The guac was fantastic as usual and Ropa Vieja really impressed my friends. I had the Short Rib entree and even though it was very good, I did miss Chef Mendez's peanut sauce. Drinks were great; service was very good. I was impressed that the host (maybe manager) was able to give me rundown of menu differences since the change in chefs. I'll be back again, for sure!
