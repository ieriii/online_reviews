I really wanted to like this place. We did a lot of research to try and find out what to order. Started with the spring rolls which were great. Then we had the Pho with tripe, etc. It was pretty much dish water with body parts floating in it. We also order the shrimp hot pot which was a steaming heap of garbage. Two large shrimp so over cooked that the meat was largely MIA - and it was close to $20. Finally, we ordered the sizzling steak platter just to have something edible.
