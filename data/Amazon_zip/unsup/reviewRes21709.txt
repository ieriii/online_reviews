Well, the dancing dogs made me laugh.....(especially at 12:30 am) after a cubs game! We made the trek, and since it was so late, had the luxury of standing there looking to make up my mind without someone looking over my sholder. Went with the Superdawg, and a root beer float....the fries were ok...(could have been much better), and WHAT is with the neon green relish? It tasted ok, but looked kinda funky..lol The hot dawg was great, you could tell the quality and had it not been soooo late, I would have had another! Maybe the onion chips would have been a better choice....and hubby LOVED his T-shirt...
