The combo with the skirt steak and chicken is a keeper. The meat just melts in your mouth, so tender and juicy I don't know how they do it! Service is a little slow but who cares when the food is this good? The place is super cute and romantic but perfect for a girls night out as well. Did I mention how cheap it is? The entire meal was under $25! I would expect something of this caliber to be around $40 at least.
