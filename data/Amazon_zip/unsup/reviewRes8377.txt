ooooooooooooooooooo. I love this place! We definitely need one in the Bay Area! Apparently, the closest one to us is in So. Cal. If you get a chance to hit one - or if they ever build one out here....give it a shot! We were served 17 uniquely prepared meats and a variety of side dishes! Great atmosphere to feel casual - yet still a bit refined. Fast, respectable service to boot! Two thumbs up! Thank god for business trips!
