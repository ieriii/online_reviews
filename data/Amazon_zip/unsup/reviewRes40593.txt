This is the one you go to to sit down, get your free chips, and order burritos. They have a new one on the menu that is irrationally large. I won't be ordering it, but it was ridiculous and somewhat impressive to see. No al pastor here, sorry. Go next door for that. (Just to the north, not across the street.) Nikki, you were mianly suffering from the staff's expectation that you knew what was up. Next time, read up on Yelp or ask someone who knows what is up.
