THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PUBLICAN MEATS SHOP.... The first time I walked into the publican, it seemed like the servers behind the counter were anxious to get me out. It probably didn't help that I came in near 6PM. I found out that the shop stops making sandwiches around 6PM. No problem. So, I had to come in a second time to order my sandwich.   So, the second time I came in, I was happy to be able to try these unique and different sandwiches from the meat markets of the west loop. This time, the staff was much friendlier. A worker greeted me when I came in and gave me a much warmer welcome than before.  Although I'm not big on pork, I ordered the pork sandwich because it was advertised as 'better than a gyro'. It came with chips and cost about $10. I was expecting the sandwich to be made with a bread bun, but it was wrapped in what looked like a tortilla. There are some greens on the inside with some white sauce that tasted great. The meat was good and I enjoyed the sandwich. I didn't think it was 'blow your mind!'...'out of this world!'...but it was unique.  I plan to go back and try a few more sandwiches. In my opinion, the sandwiches may be overpriced at $10, but it is definitely a good place to check out. There are also meats that can be purchased with herbs and spices in the store. So, I also plan to buy some meats to bring home in the future.
