I've ordered from this place a bunch because they deliver. Yes. You read that correctly. SUSHI DELIVERY! Enough said. Some of the rolls are effing HUGE! The Godzilla is hands-down my favorite from this place. If I'm feeling especially lazy and want sushi, I order from here. Not my favorite in the area by any means, but great for those cold winter nights when you just don't feel like going out and are craving sushi. Oh, and I ate here once on what ended up being a terrible date so I'm not going to comment on the place further as it will likely skew my opinion of the sit-down experience.
