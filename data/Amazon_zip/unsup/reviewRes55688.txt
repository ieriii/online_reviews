Word to the wise: Don't go unless you have a reservation, and they don't seem to like families as well as they like adults. At 4:15 PM on a Saturday we were asked if we had a reservation despite multiple open tables. They did seat us, but were begrudging not welcoming. Some of the empty tables stayed empty the entire time we were there, and we even had dessert. At about 4:30 we watched them turn away a family with two children who also had the nerve to arrive without a reservation (despite the continued empty tables), yet a few minutes later somehow manage to seat four adults who arrived without a reservation.  The food is good, and if you like seafood then there is a really wonderful selection.
