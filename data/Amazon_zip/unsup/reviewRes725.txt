I refuse to start this review with Alinea is an "experience" because this is a cliche. In any case, a better description of Alinea is an "achievement" - this restaurant has succeeded in making dinner a singular event. As you would expect from a restaurant that has been named #1 in North America and #7 in the world, the food is beyond description (at least mine). Ingredients, preparation, presentation and, most importantly, taste are all marvels. The service is exemplary -- it seemed as though a small army was at our disposal throughout the night. That being said, I have dined at other restaurants that excel in these areas as well. What pushes Alinea further yet is its attention to detail. From the creation of many of its own intricate eating utensils to the number of special options available (reserve wine flights and truffles shaved table-side), to having our car waiting out in front as we exited, Alinea is as close to perfection as a restaurant can realistically hope to get. As you might expect, you pay for the privilege of dining there (the bill for two was four figures). For most, choosing Alinea will come down to a number of "ifs" - if your palette is up to the adventure, if you can afford it, and if you can appreciate the little things that put it in rarefied air, find your way to this experience (damn, used that word after all).
