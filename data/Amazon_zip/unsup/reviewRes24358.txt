I had the worst 15 minutes of my life in the bathroom after eating here. Maybe I'm lactose intolerant. Maybe it's the foods fault. What i do know is that the atmosphere and food are okay. Starts with some bread and cheese whiz. Eventually you get the entree...veggies for us. Then chocolate and fruit and such to dip it into......then finally after an hour of driving 3.44 miles back to North Center....and only ten more seconds to find a bathroom, the night is complete.  Staff is nice but power dumping tofu and veggies all night is know way to spend an evening.
