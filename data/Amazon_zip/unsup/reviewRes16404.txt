I would've given this place 4 stars but.... Let me start with the good. Went here recently for a friends birthday. Now, the food was actually quite good and flavorful. We had the appetizer with meat and plantains in it. Sounds gross, but was amazing. For entree, I had the Arrechea and husband had the Chursasca (sp?) While they were both very good, I thought they were overpriced. Also $10 margaritas that come in martini glasses was a bit overpriced too. However, if you're willing to shell out the money, the food was good. The bad...the loud loud music. I mean, I know this location used to be a club, but it isn't anymore. Shouldn't I be able to hear the person I'm sitting across from. Kinda lame. Also, the waiters seemed to rush us at the end, they cleared the entrees really fast and I felt were a bit pushy. Also they sat us on the top floor, which meant that the bathroom was two flights down. A bit annoying, but whatev. If it weren't for the negatives, i'd probably give this place 4 stars. Valet parking was only 5 bucks, so that was nice. But overall, not the greatest place for friends to dine, as you won't be able to hear them.
