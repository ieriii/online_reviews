Tru's simple stark elegance seems to encourage diners to whisper politely to their companions so as to not disturb other tables. Attention to detail has been paid on everything. We got the Grand Collection with cheese course, which ended up being about 12 courses, a handful of which they modified or created to be "pescetarian"-friendly. Dishes ranged from understated perfection to aggressively creative, one of which was some insane preparation of smoked sturgeon made to look like caviar, presented in a Tru branded "caviar" tin with a mother of pearl spoon, true to it's shapeshifted inspiration. Don't gild the lily that is Tru by waiting for a formal special occasion, as the experience is one in and of itself.
