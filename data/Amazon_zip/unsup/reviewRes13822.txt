This is a unique place, a really peculiar hybrid of casual neighborhood diner and seafood restaurant. They have a wider selection of breakfast cereals than most supermarkets, and a full selection of diner style breakfast combinations, so I recommend this place for people looking for American style eggs or pancakes breakfast. On the other hand, they've got a good selection of seafood, with some excellent salmon and other fillet choices. I highly recommend the clam chowder and the lobster fettuccine. So it's a good place for seafood dinner. The night we were there was for a company holiday dinner, and they had two other large groups, they handled all three large groups plus other diners quite well. I know my group was little bit of a pain in the ass, I give the service high marks. It's an excellent choice for groups, but large or small, you need to make reservations, I'm not the only one who likes this place.   I took a business card from the place, so I would remember to write it up here on Yelp, and thus only afterward did I realize that the owner's name was familiar...years ago I believe we worked together at Wrigley Field in security/crowd control. If he's the same Glenn Fahlstrom I used to work with, then he also used to be an actor.  I'll bet it is the same Glenn because, like the restaurant, I remember him as being a unique combination of qualities. Hey Glenn, have someone proofread your menu board for inappropriate apostrophe marks, that bugs.
