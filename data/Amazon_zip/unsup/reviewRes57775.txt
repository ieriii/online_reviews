My daughter and I were staying at the Hotel Indigo when at 10:00pm we decided we needed something sweet to eat . Two doors down we found this amazing cafe. The staff was wonderful, inviting us in like we were old friends. Janet, the owner suggested the raspberry scone, it was served warm with whipped cream and melted butter, truly delightful and the cafe latte was a perfect addition. As we nibbled away Janet joined us making it even more enjoyable. Normally I would want to keep this wonderful little spot to myself, but you just must try it!!!
