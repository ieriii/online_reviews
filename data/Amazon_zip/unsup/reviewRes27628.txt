Great pizza with a less than desirable crouton crust.  If you're going unhealthy, you might as well go all the way and order some hot wings too. The wings had a great crust, but was lacking that roundhouse kick to the face flavor. It was merely good.  We ordered the deep dish sausage with the caramelized crust. They actually topped it with real Italian sausage chunks, not like the wimpy M&M sized ones from Domino's. Plenty of cheese, good tasting tomato sauce, and great tasting outer caramelized crust. When I bit into the bottom crust, it felt like I was biting into chalk. It was dry and lacked flavor. I could've probably broken it into pieces and replaced it for croutons on top of a Caesar salad. "Best Pizza in the Universe". I guess it depends on what your definition of "universe" is.
