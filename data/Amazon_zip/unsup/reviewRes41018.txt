Came here for my birthday and it was amazing! There's nothing really to add except: -1/3 star for being seated 45 mins. later than our reservations. -1/3 star for it taking longer than 3 hrs. (the dinner reservations seemed to be spaced two hours apart, so that's how long we were thinking it would be. we had the latest time, and after seeing one of the cooks walk through the dining room with a case of beer, it seemed to take longer and longer between each course). -1/3 star for uncomfy chairs. if the meal is going to be longer than two hours, i don't want my ass to fall asleep.  that being said, the flavors and courses were amazing, i will definitely be back, i would probably just not make the last reservation of the night.
