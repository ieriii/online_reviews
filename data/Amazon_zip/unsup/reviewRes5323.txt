Great food! I thought there would be a huge wait but we arrived a little before 7pm on a Saturday night and the place was only half full. We sat at one of their long communal tables. This is sort of an Italian tapas place, with lots of small dishes to choose from. And of course a specialty in cheese which is not my favorite so we sorta tried to stay away from those. Although they do have a wide selection for those that like frommage. We ordered the following to share: Prosciutto Bread Balls Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette Milk Braised Pork Shoulders with Mashed Potatoes Scallops Spiedini For dessert we had: Farro & Ricotta with Chocolate Sauce (NOT my favorite... it was like oatmeal with chocolate sauce?!) Nutella Panino with marshmallows and bananas Every dish was amazing and a good sized portion to share (we had 4 people and ordered 1 of each of the above). Service was fast and efficient and there was never any hurry to kick us out the door even though it started to fill up later on into the night. Definitely recommended.
