I want to like this place, I really do. I love pastries, and was on the hunt for a place to study after the demise of Filter. Alliance was one of the first places I tried because I live ridiculously close.  I came here on a Wednesday afternoon to get some work done and indulged myself in an iced chai and a red velvet cupcake. Service was slow; it seemed like each of the counter workers had no idea what the others were doing. I got my chai, which was quite nice, if a bit too sweet to my tastes. Their seating area is next door, so I took my delicious-looking cupcake and settled into a table near the wall. The cupcake looked beautiful, but when I bit into it, it was a dry and crumbly mess. I took a bite of the frosting, which was grainy and inedible. I was so disappointed I couldn't finish it.  Now, I thought this was just a fluke; maybe they just had an off day and forgot about some cupcakes in the case. No big deal. So I went in again, because the seating space is ok and hardly ever busy. I got a brownie, which unfortunately suffered from the same problems as the cupcake: dry, crumbly, and like it was at least a day or two old.  Alliance gets an extra star because their bagels are decent and their seating area is not usually busy. Avoid the pastry.
