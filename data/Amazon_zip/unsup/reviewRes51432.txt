The burritos are seriously delicious, but they're the only thing I've had there. I give them major props though because the vegetarian burrito is cheaper than the meaty burritos, which is not true for the majority of delicious burritos I've had. Negative? You have to pay extra for cheese! Everything on the menu looks tasty, and it's always packed (always a good sign).
