Best lunch specials ever! Not only do they come with soup, salad, spring roll, AND fruit, but a choice of lemonade, hot tea, or iced tea. Nothing on the lunch menu is over $9. Love it. The beef short ribs come with a generous portion of 4 strips and steamed/fried rice. As someone mentioned before, it does taste similar to Korean galbi. Their banh mi's are different than Ba Le's (simply it has mayo, no pate), but equally good. I love the fact that I don't have to drive all the way up to Argyle for Vietnamese sandwiches anymore. Best of all, Simply It is BYOB w/out corkage. Their dining room is clean, simple, and perfect for GNO or small bday dinner. The owner is super sweet. He included fresh cut oranges with my sandwich order. Fruit always tastes better when it's cut by someone else. =)
