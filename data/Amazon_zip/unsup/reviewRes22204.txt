Being latina, I never understood the term "comfort food" that is until I ate here. Everything is BANGIN and so full of flavor this place has easily become one of my favorites. The staff is real cool and helpful, but it's the food kills it every time. Everything on that menu is a hit and after going here 7+ times they have yet to disappoint. Side note: the food doesn't have much heat (sadly) but sure does make up for it with flavor!!!!! Cash only BYOB
