We came here on Saturday night 7:30 reservation. Complimentary Valet parking when you pull in. Our favorite part of the night was the food! I had Chicken Parmesan and she had the pasta on special and both were so delicious. We felt better then Maggianos'. A piano bar with wait staff in vests/bow ties. Sat upstairs in the old school decor. The food came out promptly, the bottle of pinot grigio was great, the cannoli was awesome, but there were 2 complaints....the coffee was warm and wasn't asked for a refill and lastly the bill was incorrect. I looked at the bill and the wine was $13 more than it showed on the menu. Oh well, she fixed it. We will come back here again, just take a close look at your bill. I only came here because I found the high reviews on yelp.
