Me speaking to my husband: I need a new adventure day...sigh.  Him: Where do you want to go? Thus began a brunch in Bridgeport. I liked Nana from my first whiff so we stood for 20 of the 25 minute promised wait and it was worth it. I was very excited to get a table in the larger room at a nice big table. Nana is nice. I had the Nanadict and my husband had the steak and eggs but since we had never been here before we didn't know if we would like it. We were really hungry and it was nearly 1:00 sans food Sunday. So we ordered a back up of Pumpkin Pancakes. It was all terrific, the pint glasses of OJ delectable and the art on the walls, so tempting to buy. Now that my Adventure Fridays are on hiatus, Brunch Sundays could become a semi regular replacement. I would definitely come back to Nanas, it was nummy!
