I worked at a small bakery for over three years and have baked my entire life aside from that, so I will always, ALWAYS try any bakery I come across and I'll be brutally honest about it. So Alliance has some really realllllly delicious stuff (the German chocolate macaroon might be one of my favorite things) but I wouldn't put their sandwiches on that list (they are fine, just not especially great). I will often pop in just to grab something small and sweet and different from what I can get most other places nearby. The main reason for a three star review is the seating situation... I'm really glad they are so busy that it's difficult to find a place to sit without having to ask somebody to condense their stuff and share one of the big tables, and I also don't really mind that the... lounge?... isn't actually in the same space as where you buy the treats. *And* it's okay that it feels like a library in there- I just know that I can't bring friends or chat up a stranger without a bunch of dirty looks from some very serious web surfers. It is a room for reading, typing, daydreaming, and checking out attractive people, sans conversation. Got it. Okay, so I guess that's a little annoying but it's a personal preference... But mainly, my only *real* problem with Alliance is that it smells funny. I mean, has anybody else noticed this?? Just the lounge area, but seriously, it's a weird weird smell and it's been there my past three (short) visits. I won't describe it here the way I described it to my roommate but yeah. I hope somebody will investigate that.
