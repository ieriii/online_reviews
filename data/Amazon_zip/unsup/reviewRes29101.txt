Super delicious. Super fresh. Super authentic. Super spicy. Delicious guacamole. Great sommolier (sp?). Great place for groups - make your reservations! A fun place to try new things- including tequila! Desert was not my favorite, but my palate is not used to these types of desert. Rick Bayless is great!
