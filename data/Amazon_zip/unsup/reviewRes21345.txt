Great overall meal at Xoco. The line was there, but it wasn't too bad. We had a drink in line while we waited and looked over the menu. Every piece of our meal was delicious. The guacamole was very good, the Milanesa Tortas was outstanding and the churros with ice cream dipping sauce was out of this world. I also tried the chocolate shot with almond milk and it was delicious.
