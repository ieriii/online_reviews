I came here on a Saturday night with my fiance and sister. It was different than I expected. It has more of a lounge feel to it. When you walk in, there's a cheese/wine bar immediately to your left, then you'll see a sofa lounge place straight ahead and then tables/booths/dining area behind the sofa lounge place. Overall, I thought my experience at BIN36 was excellent. Service was great - our server appeared to be knowledgable about the menu as well as the BIN36 experience. We had wine flights, a cheese flight, and our own individual entrees. This was my first wine flight, and I loved all the wines in my wine flight. I had the steak with the bone marrow. I LOVE bone marrow - it's soo delicious. It was good times with good food and wine and great company. What more can you ask for on a Saturday night? I'll be back and do recommend BIN36 as a good place to eat and a great place to do wine flights.
