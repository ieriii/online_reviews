I am updating my review because my first experience seems to be kind of a fluke -- What I mean is that I know that Art of Pizza is capable of great things, but rarely do they deliver. Some Yelpers have mentioned that they have "off days," but I think that it would be more appropriate to say that they have "On days," seeing as they are "off" the majority of the time. At least in terms of slices... The last four times I've been there the slices were room temperature and lacking in cheese and ingredients. It is also strange that out of their infinite array of slices, they do not offer a spinach deep dish. Yes, they have spinach, mushroom and onions , or just mushroom and spinach, but why not just go for a plain spinach slice? I don't know anyone who likes baked onions on their pizza. Anyways, I'm sure I'll go back just in anticipation of an "on day," but I'll try to order a full, hot pizza in advance. Deep dish, spinach.
