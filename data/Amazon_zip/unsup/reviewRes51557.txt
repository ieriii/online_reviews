You know, I've been here sober, buzzed, semi drunk and completely incapacitated...and the food at Garcia's taste the same regardless. I would deem it average... there is a lot of good Mexican food in Chicago, unfortunately there are many options in the Lincoln Square neighborhood. Yes the burritos are good, but the carne asada was quite tough... the ceviche was pretty much unedible.....the salsa is really good, tastes homemade... but the were a let down. I want tequila not something that's driving me to look for my insulin. I hope it gets better... glad they've made it all these years...they obviously must be doing something right....maybe I should drink more next time...
