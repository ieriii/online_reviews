My husband and I went to Tru for our anniversary last week and were thoroughly impressed. We have been to some of Chicago's finest restaurants and were excited to dine at the well known Tru and compare it to our other dining experiences. The thing that most stands out about Tru is the attention to flavor that they give. No, the dishes aren't crazy spins on the homey classics like you will find at Graham Elliot or Schwa, but they hone in on the flavor of every bite with carefully picked ingredients and methods of cooking that make for an outstanding meal and because of this it's modern French cuisine at its finest and deserves 5 stars. If you are looking for an incredibly posh fine dining meal experience, this is the place to indulge in. On the flip side though, if you are looking for a fun and relaxed atmosphere to go with a gourmet dining experience, this may not be the place for you. The restaurants I mentioned above have an atmosphere of warmth and fun that Tru lacks. This is not a negative feedback point of Tru by any means, there is a time and place for each of these experiences and I only mention this so that you know going in what to be expecting and can enjoy your experience to the fullest. We had a splendid time and will never forget the glazed veal or white sturgeon caviar... aMAZing!
