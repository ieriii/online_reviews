I've eaten here twice with friends, after moving to the neighborhood. I have nothing but good things to say! I've tried a handful of different crepes but my lunch favorite is Crepe Marrakech and for dessert, the Crepe Perla is bliss in your mouth. Food: The crepes are delicious and plentiful! Service: Attentive and efficient. Ambiance: Nicely decorated with some beautiful textiles and just an over all friendly environment.
