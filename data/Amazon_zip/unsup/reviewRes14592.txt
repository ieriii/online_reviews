hm. seemed like a ton of hype from yelp. guess i missed the train. I ordered the lechon sandwhich and was pretty disappointed. A brick of pork between two chunks of bread. the meat was tender and well cooked, but lacking in flavor. great if you love to challenge your arteries. it came with onions (which didn't enhance much of anything) and sweet plantain-- if only there were more of it into the sandwich. I just was completely disinterested in eating it. half of my meat was removed as i ate it. my bf tried the ropa viejo? ( might have botched the name). It was with a shredded beef, smothered in sauce, but with some peppers I think. It just reminded me of a beefy stew in a sandwich. little soggy. little salty. the house hot sauce didn't really do much to change flavors for me either. i dunno. i really appreciate the spot for what it is. better quality than a grab-n-go for sure. it's a pleasant break away from typical grease joints. but still. no ball out of the park for me. if you're on the run and dont want a huge sit-down experience, i would keep this place in mind. otherwise, i'm a bit indifferent. the waitress was very helpful in suggesting items to me, since i was clueless. but i still don't think that the place warrants a "tip slot" on the bill, since it's not as though they truly wait on you other than hand you your plate. (it's the kinda place where you eat your grub and toss out your tray like in a cafeteria). but is it cheap? yes. decent? yes. but next time maybe i'll just sample the sides like the empanada, tamal, n flan.
