Went to Glenn's for breakfast after reading lots of positive reviews. The food was delicious and the service was friendly. The boyfriend and I went on a Monday morning so it was not at all crowded. We decided to share a bacon, spinach, and provolone omelet. It comes with one outstanding potato pancake and a toast of your choice. Everything was pretty amazing but I'll start with the potato pancake. This potato pancake is unlike any other I've had. They mix the potato with chives, sour cream, and possibly cream cheese (?). It might be some other really creamy cheese or just something I'm not thinking of. Either way, they are the best. They're crisp and flavorful and creamy on the inside. I want one right now. The omelet was effin huge (it is 4 eggs, afterall) and was chock full of our three choice fillings. I've gotta say that the spinach was really good. I don't know if it's organic or just cooked in something beforehand but every bite was better than the next. The whole thing was very good. We had an english muffin for our "toast", which came pre-buttered and got a side of ham as well. Everything was great and we left very full just sharing a plate. The coffee is good too! Our waiter was really friendly and talkative. The atmosphere is pretty laid back. The restaurant itself is not too big, not too small and they have outdoor seating as well. There are lots of things to look at on the walls and such and the sun shines bright through their big windows. All in all, a great place to eat.
