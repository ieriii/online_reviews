We just stopped in for drinks at the bar while waiting for friends to arrive at another restaurant, so maybe I didn't get the proper RJ Grunt's experience. The bar service was OK. The bar is TINY (like six people can sit there) and the server was still kind of slow. She didn't have much to do since all six of us weren't ordering drinks constantly, so I was a bit disappointed.  The beer is overpriced and the cocktails are even more expensive. There was a list of non-traditional cocktail drinks, so that could be cool during dinner. Definitely not a place to go if you're just looking for a quick drink in the neighborhood. Just walk over to Lincoln and find one of a thousand bars.
