The standard Chicago style hot dog was great, especially the relish. Fries were good as well. Their specialties, not so much. The foie gras dog was lukewarm, soggy, and plain unappetizing. Service was speedy. Overall, not worth the 45 minute wait in the freezing cold for this. I would imagine the wait is even longer during the summer.
