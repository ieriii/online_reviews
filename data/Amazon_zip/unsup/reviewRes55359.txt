I haven't had much persian food but this place was pretty good.It's a little pricey for the location, environment, presentation. The tadig was pretty good, but a little on the buttery side. It's basically just crispy rice with sauce poured over. Everyone raved about the hummus but I didn't find it all that special. It was good but nothing special. I got the walnut-pomegranate sauce chicken and the sauce was surprisingly pretty good. Even though it was sweet, it was also a bit savory, with a creamy texture.
