Ceviche (all of them) was my favorite dish of the night. Definitely some of the best ceviche I've ever had. One of their "classic" dishes (at least that's what the waiter told me) was their Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena. Described as a "Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak, marinated in spicy red chile and wood- grilled, served with black beans, sweet plantains with sour cream, and guacamole." Steak was cooked and seasoned to medium-rare perfection. Really good and came with tortillas on the side.  Overall, a very solid dinner. A bit pricey for Mexican food, but the food was certainly authentic. Looking forward to trying Xoco at some point.
