Worst service I've ever had. employees there so arrogant and has no clue on what service is. When I was guided to the table, one of the servers were wiping out the table surface. He just very briefly wiped the table once (you can tell that the table was still very dirty) and then started to put down folk and knife while leaving the rag he was using to wipe in the center of the table. what's worse was that he actually put folk and knife on the dirty rag!!I got upset and told him not to do that, but he did not even apologize but just made excuses. then He even told me to leave if I don't like it. What a stupid arrogant waiter! I never had a chance to try their food cause I left the place right away. but trust me. they are people never care about hygiene and service. No doubt that something worse happens in their kitchen where nobody can see them. I will NEVER EVER GO THERE AGAIN. and urge you all to reconsider going there.
