Its definitely a see and be seen place. Very good service overall for being so busy and staffing pretty much based on looks rather than beverage knowledge. This is a safe place to grab a late night bite and some drinks, if you happen to want to hang/park in this hood. I would give it four stars if there weren't so many 20 somethings trying to pick up everything with a heartbeat that walked by every ten seconds.
