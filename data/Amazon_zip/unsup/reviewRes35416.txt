After the 4rth visit..i learned a few new things=D a. Bejing Duck Dinner's price increase ($35 to $37) b. YOu can substitute noodles instead of fried rice with the dinner (I recommend it). c. Thousand Year old egg congee is yummy! (if your into this dish) d. Try "mike's chicken" if you don't feel like duck. (it's off menu, you need to ask for it). Service is poor on busy nights, short staffed. Bring along a few chinese speaking friends. (not necessary, but helpful.)
