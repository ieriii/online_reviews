When it comes to gastropubs this place gets a bit lost in the mix. Its a gem in Logan Square because the rest of the area has not much to offer, but there is nothing particularly magnetic about this place...Unless you thoroughly enjoy dining on a complete MEAT menu. I'll credit their endeavors on creating a very unique menu but it lacks color. There is so much brown, grey, and white that you feel like you're ordering from a Charlie Chaplin inspired menu. Execution by the chef is superb on what he does offer so that is good but if you could get your server to bring you anything in a fashionable manor you're bloody lucky. Bar service is even worse, nice lot of gentlemen they are but when it gets busy an expeditious demeanor would carry this place to 4 stars. Decent place if you're in the mood for a large beer selection, primarily colon cancer causing dishes, and aren't in any sort of hurry.
