We ate here a few months ago and it was by far the best dinner we've ever had. Though unbelievably expensive for one meal, it was worth it. Truly a destination worth visiting and experiencing. If you go, get the 24 course. For two people, we found that with one of us ordering wine / sharing a glass, the amount of wine was just right (though my girlfriend and I are not big drinkers). The highlights were the hot/cold potato, black ruffle explosion, and cauliflower soup. There was only one dud--a butter themed dish that was way too rich/buttery, bordering inedible. Everything else ranged between very good to "this is the best thing I've ever tasted." Service was flawless. Very innovative, outside-the-box cooking; the best part about Alinea is that the extensive detail and culinary technique that goes into the dishes are designed partly to make you think about an experience food in a unique way, but more so to create flavors that are astonishing. I can't say the same of Moto, which was high on concept/creativity and somewhat absorbed with interest in novelty/technique/playing with food (e.g., all of the liquid nitrogen), but did not deliver flavors within the same league as Alinea (not even close). If you were thinking about going to just one molecular gastronomy restaurant between Moto and Alinea, I'd recommend Alinea over Moto in a heartbeat.
