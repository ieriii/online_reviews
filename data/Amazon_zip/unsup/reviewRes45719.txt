SOLID....I went with a group of people the other week without knowing a thing about this place. Generally, "bar" food isn't my favorite but this is well beyond your traditional bar grub. From pork chops to crab cakes to their insane Mac-N-Cheese, Wilde delivers. Very good atmosphere here with friendly staff and a great beer selection, I was really impressed with this place.   Its definitely a bit more pricey than your typical bar but, on the other hand, its not a typical bar and their food is on par with some local restaurants/steakhouses. I highly recommend this place for small groups or to just hang out with a drink and dinner. Great new addition!
