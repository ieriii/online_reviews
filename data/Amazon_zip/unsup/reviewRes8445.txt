Food - pretty good. There are places I like more, but this is pretty yummy. We had the pizza made with Buffalo cheese - knowing what I know now, I would save my money and just get goat cheese because they taste alike. Still the pizza was pretty good - although my preference is a crisper crust. The roasted vegetables we got as an appetizer were good too. They get an "A" for the free Cannoli they passed out when we were leaving. Service - excellent. Our server was so friendly and patient while we tried to figure out what to order. She made helpful suggestions on the wine as well. Atmosphere - if you sit outside it's great. The street is relatively quiet and pleasant. If you sit inside you will have blood coming out of your ears from the ruptured ear drums due to the high decibel level. We had to go inside towards the end of our meal due to rain and I couldn't believe how insanely loud it was. We discussed this with our server and told her we loved the outdoor seating, but that this was intolerable. She agreed and said someone had a decibel meter in the restaurant one night and the readings were near the dangerous zone. Overall - I would come back here, but only if I could sit outside.
