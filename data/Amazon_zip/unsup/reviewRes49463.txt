I actually came here a few years ago with a very large group and was just reminded of the place. The experience was enough to drive me to search for it and write a review. This place did a fantastic job of handling the large group. The selection was very generous considering that we had 40-50 people in our group (we practically rented out the place). The meal was fantastic - so flavorful. If you are on the north side, it's worth your time to check this place out.
