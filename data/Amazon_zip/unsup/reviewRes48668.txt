Know before you go, acoustically-not so great. i.e. it's way loud. Lots of "what's" and "huh's" across the table. Now than, the food. They suggest sharing the plates and for two of us recommended 2-3 plates apiece. The sizes seemed all over the place so kind of arbitrary how to decide. We started with the beet salad with ricotta & aged balsamic. If you like beets, you will like the salad. Nice portion and really tasty, earthy beets. Next the chef's selection of oysters which tasted fresh (a quality I find immensely important in my oysters) served with just a light champagne vinaigrette (neither added nor detracted so....) The smoked trout with heirloom tomatoes, guanciale (non-smoked bacon) & fromage blanc was tasty but served on bread, which isn't mentioned on the menu; I thought it took away from the dish slightly. But the fromage blanc was speared on said bread so to get that flavor well, you had to eat the bread. Ok, than there was the suckling pig with grapes, escarole & grits. I fully expected to not like but love this dish. It wasn't to be, turns out it was my least favorite. Mushy in texture and overall flavorless. I was crestfallen at the lack of, well anything. It just kind of existed on the plate. We actually had great service the night we were there. Overall I think the price points are a little off (including the wine list) and I just wasn't blown away like I thought I would be. And although it should seem relaxing with the type of service they are going for the noise just doesn't allow. So over priced and loud but good service and a couple tasty dishes.
