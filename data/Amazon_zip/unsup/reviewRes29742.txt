It's Saturday. The early morning sun is shimmering off the lake and a blustery autumnal breeze makes you want to seek shelter. No more of a perfect place to walk into than this charming little tea room for breakfast. At least that's the impression I got having never been here before and led to it by the comments and photos of others on Yelp! Smiling faces and bustling waitresses greet you as you step down into the pleasant setting. Seat yourself and relax in this quiet and intimate eatery. The food? Just look at the photos. The camera doesn't lie. Tastes as good as it looks. I had the house omelet with hash browns with white toast and marmalade. Enough for the hungriest of appetites! My girlfriend had the stuffed French toast, a photo of which we just has to share!! I had to sample that too! Treat yourself. You deserve it!
