I went there on a Saturday morning about 9am..there was a short wait (about 5 minutes) and our server was very prompt about getting our menus/beverages/order pretty quickly. The variety is incredible! Tons of options for vegetarians as well. The portions are huge, and come with a side of fruit or potatoes AND toast/englishmuffin or pancakes (holy cow!) The strawberry orange juice is delicious! The prices are fair and reasonable The service is pretty darn good! The ambiance is nice... I will warn you..as I was leaving near 10am, the line was exceptionally long... There is a parking garage about 500 feet from the restaurant, that will allow you to park in the garage with validation for 7 dollars!  I really do recommend yolk, do not let the other reviews scare you away...if you do decide to go, be open to a possible wait, as I hear there can be a long line on certain days...!!
