I just lowered this to 3 stars from 4. The food is stll very good with lots of banchan (complimentary sides). However, the service needs to improve!!!!!! Do not go when it is busy b/c they will hustle you out...i.e. return to your table after 2 minutes when you ask for 5 to decide and the waitress will just stand there, ask you to leave b/c there are people waiting (understood but right after we sign off the tip? come on...), tell you there is no after service Korean sweet tea (which is customary) b/c the kitchen is too busy to do such things.  They give new meaning to Korean hospitality which even I think is too rude (and I am Korean!). It will be a while before I return.
