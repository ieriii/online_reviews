They have the best spicy tofu dish and Szechuan String Beans. I also love the lamb dish. I almost get these three dishes every time I go there. The branch in Downers Grove is also great. I'm sure they use the same recipes. LOL... The only thing they need is better services, friendlier waitresses. Sometimes they are kind of mean, too rush. But I still love their food.
