Wow, great food! If I lived near this place, I'd be there all the time. Went with a group of four so it was hard to find a seat, but we waited it out and were sat in the cramped, small dining area. Don't let that turn you away though since you should be going for the food. Our clan each had a different menu option, from the traditional Costa Rican dinner, to burritos, and sandwiches. We tried three varieties of shakes and the consensus was the oatmeal is the best. Holy shucks the chican rice is good! I actually took home the leftovers from others in my party and was glad I did since the burrito tasted fantastic reheated the next afternoon. Hit this place up and make it a frequent stop if you're within a few miles. Call ahead and take out seems to be the best bet. Oh, and be aware of the hot peppers that look like bell peppers, they'll ruin your palate for the evening.
