The second I stepped foot into this restaurant as a sixteen year old, i fell in love! The decor is uber cute! From the mosaic tiles on the floor, to the lamps, and sleek layout it all screams ADORABLE! I also envisioned myself working as a hostess there, which reminds me, maybe I should look into that dream....;) All the food is freshly made. The food is simple and light in taste, it speaks for itself. Although, i agree on the potion size, which in turn tricked me to thinking I was "really cutting back." It's an experience!
