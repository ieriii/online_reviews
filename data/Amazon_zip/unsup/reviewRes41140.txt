A gem. Walking to Bon Soiree from the blue line stop, we were a little dubious about what we were getting ourselves into (neighborhood's not too inviting), but Bon Soiree was a real winner. Great, imaginative food, an indie/classy atmosphere, and BYOB -- what more could you ask for? The menu fixe ($20) is fantastic: instead of limiting you to only one option, you can basically sample the entire menu with it, and what a menu it is. No corkage fee, either, and apparently there's a patio, too. The service could be a little better (we were handed our entrees before I'd finished my appetizer), but given that it's more or less a two-man operation, it's understandable.
