Went there tonight for a birthday celebration with a group of about 16! Absolutely delicious! OMG! I had the lechon special - grilled pork that was actually roasting out front on the corner! So tender. Black beans were delicious. Even my friends who usually hate beans, were eating the beans! Goat cheese empanada, ropa vieja empanada and stuffed tostones were some of our appetizer choices - YUMMY!. Plaintains were perfect - alot of places serve them too mushy. These were just right. Top it off with cafe con leche. Great evening, fun crowd, good food - I definitely will be going back!
