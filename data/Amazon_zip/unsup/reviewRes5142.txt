We waited 30 minutes longer than the restaurant had suggested to us... which was fine.. but I suppose it put a slight ding on the meal. We started with a salad, which was nothing special, and cheese. The cheese was DELICIOUS, I want to be made of that cheese so I can eat my fingers when I get hungry. It was goat cheese with a truffle, but had a different name that I can't recall. Anyway, get it, it was so good. Among dishes I liked: Pork shoulder, yummy ... Eggplant on bread with goat cheese, also good... Scallops... very good. That's about it. We had 30 dishes and I thought 4 were exceptional, maybe 3 or 4 were good, and the rest I could have done without. The bone marrow was nothing special, I was also dissapointed in the pigs ears, jambon, and some others that are now escaping me. They offered us free dessert because of the long waits for our food and service, but none of the desserts looked good... SOOO we asked for money off our bill instead, and they obliged. That was nice of them. So bonus for that.
