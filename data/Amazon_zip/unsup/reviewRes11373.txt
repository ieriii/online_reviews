Love the pizza, love the beer -- hate how busy you are because everyone else loves you too. (Best time to go is mid-afternoon during the week!) Bonus star for adding a separate takeout pick-up area! It used to be total chaos trying to pick up my large red with spinach, ricotta and garlic when the bar area was busting at the seams with people.
