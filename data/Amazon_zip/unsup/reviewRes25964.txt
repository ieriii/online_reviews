I was one of the 20+ gals who went to SImply It for GNO. Bottom line, it was friggin awesome. This was my first time at a Vietnamese restaurant so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. My anticipation quadrupled when I realized it was family style meals and I didn't have to just choose one thing. Perfect for a Vietnamese virgin like myself. The meals kept coming and everything was amazing. My favorite dish was fried calamari and pineapple in an actual pineapple! Absolute Heaven. Despite our girl rowdiness, the servers were absolutely amazing. Our empty plates never sat on the table for more than a minute and our wine was constantly being pured for us and having the cork done. Overall, great experience and great restaurant. I will definitely be back.
