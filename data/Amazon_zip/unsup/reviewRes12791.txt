This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago! I've been going to this place for around 10 years and will continue to go back for as long as I live in this city. The atmosphere is casual but lively and its perfect for a group of friends or a first date. The noise level is pleasant and you never feel like you have to shout. I've had almost everything on the menu at one time or another and my favorite entrees remain the honey-jalepeno pork chops, ropa vieja (excellent!) or the pistaccio-crusted chicken. The outdoor patio in the summertime is a great place to enjoy a relaxing meal, but anywhere in the restaurant is comfortable. And on top of it all, it still gives diners a great bang for the buck....I don't think I've ever spent more than $30-40/person after tip. Not much else to say here...GO TRY IT!!!
