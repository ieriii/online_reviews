Tru is a must-do! I expected the dry, hoity-toity snootisms, but I was wrong. We were pleasantly welcomed in, seated immediately and our waiter made us very comfortable. I scanned the room and it was a nice ecclectic mix of people. We did the 10 course tasting which was a bit more elaborate than the prixe fixe menu. I'm a sucker for truffle, so the standout for me was the risotto with black truffle shavings. Exquisite! Don't get me wrong, though, every single course was mmm mmm good with creative presentation, from the squash soup housed in a hollowed mini- pumpkin to the decadent chocolates. Service was impeccable with not only attentive servers but synchronized serving. I'm talking about coordinated timing of the setting down of flatware. Nice touch. We were there for a special occasion so the menus had been customized with well wishes in acknowledgement. Another nice gesture. It's definitely a place for a special time, as I couldn't imagine a 3-hour meal on the regular. However, for a memorable fine dining experience, Tru is one of the best.
