I've only eaten in once, but I've had their pizza (take out and delivery) more times than I can count. It's awesome. You get a ton of pizza for what they charge you. Also, you get a free 1 liter of pop with an order of $15 or more, which is pretty much what a large or x-large pizza costs. You can also say you have a coupon for $3 off the x-large and they'll usually give it to you without collecting. 2 things: 1) Make sure you save the coupons that come with the pizza. Collect 20 of them and you get a free pizza (it says sausage, but you can get others) 2) Make sure if you're ordering for pick up, that you make that clear. We had them deliver it once when we were just about to leave to pick it up.
