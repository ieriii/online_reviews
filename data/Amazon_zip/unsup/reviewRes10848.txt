I am a fan of pizza that comes by the foot. No seriously, order a large at this place and its like two feet (that might be a slight exaggeration) but the pizza is friggin large. Atmosphere: So I am of spirit that a pizzeria should have a stereotypical guy named Luigi and have old pictures of little Italy, but Piece blows that out of the water. Its a sports bar-esque joint with fairly good techno (insh insh insh) and multiple flat screen TVs so you can watch the Chicago Bull suffer miserable. Seating usually for people of 4, but we rolled in 10 deep and were easily accommodated.   Service: Fairly attentive, and I dug the "grunge band" look of our server Food: The pizza was QUITE tasty, and admittedly I was a little surprised. Piece offers you different sauce options and a myriad of different toppings, which include your standard fare but also interesting additions such as artichokes and yes... mashed potatoes. We got a meat lovers for the carnivores in our group and a veggie delight for the rest of us. The pizza was terrific though it all slid off the thin crust when I picked it up. This place is of the thin crust persuasion, so you deep dish fans might be not be satiated. A large pizza is a proper large (i.e. 2 foot wide) and probably is good for 4 normal people, or 6 super tiny girls.   Mommy Factor: I am sure my mom would rock out to the Nirvana that made it the playlist here, and its pretty sanitary to bring the kids out with. Date Factor: This will not winner them over for Chic and cultured, but this is fun and tasty place for a date. Bling: 1 large pizza ran around 20 bucks depending on what toppings you ordered. On the account that it can feed up to 4-5 people that's not too bad in my book. Drinks range from $2 cokes to more expensive brews. All in All a satisfying meal sans drinks will run 8-10 bucks per person. Not too shabby. Upshot: Eclectic pizzeria with a sports bar feel, with less shoes sticking to the ground and tetanus.
