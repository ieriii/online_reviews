sultan's market rules. the food is fresh and delicious and spicy and cheap. the salad bar is awesome and don't miss the roasted brussel sprouts - they will convert any brussel-sprout-hater.  if there is a line, it always goes fast and you can spend that time ogling the salad fixings. the SM staff is friendly and cute and have even spotted me some cash on days when i have been a buck or two short.  and for dinner time visits, the place is BYO! you can't beat it.
