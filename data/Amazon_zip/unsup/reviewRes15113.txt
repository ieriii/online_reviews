i'll start by saying i didn't really eat here. well, i mean i did, once i finally managed to snake a seat at the bar. but it was only an appetizer, (mussels in white wine) so i guess it's not really fair to rate their food just yet. perhaps another trip for this express purpose is in order. that being said, i'd like to discuss the beer i had. i started with the iron fist pale ale, which was pretty tasty. nice hop forward start, then settling into a more balanced finish. a very well crafted beer, but not one that i'd travel specifically to have. (and believe me, this is a trek from ravenswood.) then i had the willie wee heavy. toasty right from the start. very warm entrance, smooth finish, but a little too long of a taste for me. again, a decently crafted brew, but damn, that bus ride down western seems like a hell of distance. i finished the night off with another iron fist, just to confirm what i had originally tasted. (okay, and maybe to continue the buzz a little bit.) and it was confirmed.  my friend had the workingman mild, and then the cross of gold. and based on the little sips i had, both were pretty good. as far as a session beer goes, the workingman mild seemed pretty spot on. great taste, low alcoholic content. very nice.  i'd like to add that i was disappointed in a couple of things. one, that they didn't have the anti-hero IPA on tap. that was really what i wanted to try. and two, that they didn't have the bell's sparkling ale as a guest draft.  but ultimately, like i said, the beers were very well crafted. however, i wouldn't travel just for the beers. with places like piece, on north ave., and half acre pretty near my house, it just wouldn't seem worth it. i hope that when i go back to give the food a try, i find that this place is actually worth the trip. and then the beer they offer will be just icing on the cake.
