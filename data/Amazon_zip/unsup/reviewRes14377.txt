First time here was completely random; as some friends and I were headed to the Cold War Kids concert down the street at Schubas. We decided to grab a quick bit before the show and landed here - oh, how lucky we were. None of us had eaten a Cuban sandwich before (well, I won't count that one time in Miami b/c it was purchased at a Hilton) so we didn't really know what to order. The owner walked us through the whole menu while making some recommendation along the way. All chose the Cubano with Roast Pork. Pure deliciousness between some tasty bread. We were now armed with full bellies ready to rock and have a few beverages. Since this, I have been several times, my wife loves it now too, and we try to frequent whenever around either of the two locations. Great people + great food = Great times.
