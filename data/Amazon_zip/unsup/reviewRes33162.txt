"SULTAN'S COME ON DOWN" because the PRICE IS RIGHT! (Corny; I know) Really though, the price was right on for the quality. The falafel sandwich was heaven? amazing? delicious? so good I should have ordered 10 and froze them for the possible rapture?.. we will just go with this: *insert visual of Homer lusting after something delicious i.e. donuts or Sultan's falafel sandwich* The dinner portion was really generous for the price and the lamb shwarma was very good.  We ordered out so no comments on the restaurant/service/decor. The pick up was fast and the food held up well by the time we arrived home. The menu is not extensive but that is fine by me. The dishes I tried were very good so I appreciate their quality over quantity approach. I will have to update later if I ever get a chance to eat in.
