Unarguably my favorite place ever. I have been here over half a dozen times, and will always bring someone from out of town here for an incredible dinner. Everything is cooked to perfection. Service is amazing. Well worth the $50 per person. Personal favorites include: Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon and the Rack of Lamb.
