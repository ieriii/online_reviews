I want to sit at this place and just chill! the decor is amazing! the colors! so rich and warm! That being said, it's a very cool place to go on a date! It can be romantic also. The food is very good. I have had the ceviche which is ORGASMIC! that's right I said it: Perfect amount of lime added to it! I love their platanos maduros(sweet plaintains) and their rice and beans. Drinks were great too. This is a great place! I def will return!
