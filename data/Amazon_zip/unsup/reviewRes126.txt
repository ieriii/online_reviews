Even with all the hype, it's awesome. I now know what dining experience I've missed. When we got out of the taxi, we weren't sure where Alinea was, exactly. By chance, someone asked us if we were looking for Alinea... "oh, yes" (must have been our attire or she just stands there and directs people idk). After finding the unmarked door, everything changes. Gosh, the waiters there are darn good waiters. They know so much about every course (and we had 20+ of them). The courses are beautiful; it felt like being an Iron Chef judge. The entire staff is ready to serve you. At one point, I asked where the restroom was and one of the waiter walked me there. When I went in, I was surprised that the toilet paper-end was folded in a triangle. Is this done after each person's visit to the restroom? When each course came out, I felt a little rude taking photos of EVERYTHING but I didn't want to miss anything. Make sure you make your reservations on the first when the books open for the month, 2 months prior (I'd double check).
