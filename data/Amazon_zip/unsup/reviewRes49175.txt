I love Alliance Bakery!!! I ordered a cake several years ago for my husband's birthday - absolutely fabulous. Chocolate cake, banana filling and chocolate ganache. Amazing.  And most recently I ordered a cake for my sister's birthday... amazing and moist!!! It was a two tier cake: bottom tier vanilla cake with dulce de leche filling... top tier red velvet with cream cheese filling and both tiers with vanilla bean butter cream frosting. YUM!!! The design was amazing as well! I found an image I liked online and emailed them a copy. My sister and all of our guests raved about the cake.  Also... Mitchell and Peter are great! They respond to emails fairly quickly... which I completely appreciated. LOVE ALLIANCE BAKERY!!! Thanks soo much for the wonderful service and product!!!
