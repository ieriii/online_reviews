Somebody needs to explain to me the hype behind this place. The food was just average. Nothing great. Between the four of us that went we each had a different meat and I tried them all. We had a stuffed burger, a filet mignon, a chicken item, and a fish item. Each one was just okay. For the price I expected better. The drinks we had were overpriced and just okay as well. I will never go back - unless someone else wants to pick up the bill.
