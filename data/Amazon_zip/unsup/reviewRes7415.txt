I ate here on Thanksgiving Day, and it was great. While they had a traditional Thanksgiving Day menu offered, I ended up ordering off the regular menu. The quality of the food and presentation was great. I mean, who offers four different kinds of BBQ sauce with one entree? The variety was good, the atmosphere was nice, and the staff were all super friendly, even if they were working on Thanksgiving Day.
