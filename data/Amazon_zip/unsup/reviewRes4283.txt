Not bad, Not bad at all... Though I do wish they had a better beer selection. I think I've only been here on Thursdays and the music is always great. Maybe I'm a sucker for a horn section but nevertheless, I think most will enjoy. There's dancing and the bartenders actually know how to mix drinks. Even their well alcohol isn't that bad. There's a fair amount of seating and the crowd is always attractive and have an eclectic age range that I appreciate. I'm not a huge fan of the surrounding neighborhood... I went the wrong way once and am convinced I saw some shady biz-nast... and I think there's a methadone clinic not far. Go here on Thursday and get a little dressed up... it'll be appreciated there. :) OOH- I think most Saturday nights they charge a cover charge that I'm not willing fork over, so beware.
