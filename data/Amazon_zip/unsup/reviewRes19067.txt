Hard to believe we had never tried The Gage before. Probably because we tend to go to the University Club if we are in that part of the Loop. After a drink in the bar, we were seated at a table next to a fireplace. You have the details about this place from the 700 plus reviews but wanted to add that the service was outstanding. How often can you ask the waiter about how he would recommend eating leftover mussels (the portion was huge)-cold or reheated? His suggestion-use a fry pan with some vegetable stock until the mussels are serving temp. Other staff showed a complete understanding of the menu items, preparation and made great recommendations after listening to our tastes. The owner stopped by, showed his sincere interest in how we found the experience and bought us a glass of wine just because. Please try this restaurant-it is well worth it and represents one of Chicago's better bistro restaurants.
