Our favorite place for a great breakfast/brunch on the weekend. They have great food and their specials keep regulars like us satisified with something new to try every time. They open at 6:30am and with an infant we're up anyway and it lets us get our day started in a great way. As long as you get there before 8:30am the wait is none to minimal. For us it's right up there with Bongo room, but much more convienent.
