Extremely disappointed! Got a gift certificate for our anniversary, was unable to get a reservation (6 weeks in advance) for Topolobampo. Arrived at 5pm on Saturday, waited in line 20 minutes to put our name on the wait list. The hostess quoted 2-2.5 hour wait. Checked with the hostess after two hours and fifteen minutes and she told me it would be another 30 minutes. Total wait 3 hours, still no table. Had three drinks (two down the street at Flemings) and left without eating because by then we weren't hungry. Totally disappointing special occasion. Wouldn't know how great the food is...
