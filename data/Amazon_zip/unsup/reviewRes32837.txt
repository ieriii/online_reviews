Well, I think vegans are so starved for a restaurant at which they have more than one option (I certainly am). This place has a few good choices--the shakes are delicious, and they serve tease cheese which melts better than other fake cheeses--but it's very easy to order an entree and hate it. I got the sweet potato quesadillas and could hardly finish them; they were bland and the consistency made me lose my appetite. I've kept coming back here because I felt that I just had to find the few entrees that are delicious, but I've given up. I'll take my buisness to someplace with less of a wait.
