piece is far and away my favorite pizza place in chicago. their style of east coast pizza is almost completely non-existent in the midwest. it tastes very authentic in comparison to other thin slice joints around town. not only is the pizza delicious, the beer is fantastic and the staff is awesome. i have always loved their german kolsch beer, the golden arm. i usually like to sit at the bar and hang out with friends because the bartenders are very friendly and attentive, and generally have pretty good taste in music.  atleast there isn't some crappy juke box.  however, i have always had very positive experiences sitting at tables as well. we've had a couple of work parties there with groups of around twenty and they have always been able to accomodate us with no problem. i highly recommend piece to anyone who enjoys pizza, beer and a very cool staff!
