I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night, and it was still packed full and lively. Our waitress was incredibly nice and knowledgeable; she knew about every dish and was enthusiastic about the specials. We got a guacamole (delicious!) and taquitos appetizer. My only quarrel with the appetizers is that they are very small. Small even for appetizers. There was enough guacamole for about 10 chips TOPS.  I had the catch of the day for dinner, a delicious white fish with an absolutely FABULOUS sauce...I'm talking lick off the plate good.  The food was great, the service was great, as was the atmosphere. The price is not bad for what you get.
