For Vegetarians, this is about as good as it gets. What a great concept too, Diner style food, made fresh, made vegan, made delicious. Great customer service the three times i've been in, charming staff, and five star service. Certainly a place to indulge without guilt. Definitely coming back, gotta make room for desert!
