I waited a while to write this because I thought it must be a fluke--but this retaurant has the most consistent TERRIBLE SERVICE of anywhere I've ever eaten--I've wanted to yelp the last 3 times I've been there but held off--this morning was the last straw. I live nearby, and have probably been to Wilde 15-20 times since it's opened. I have never had good service, but the last 3 times were truly insulting. Today, my husband and I waited a full 7 minutes (in a nearly empty restaurant with busboys and waitresses walking around galore) and no one had even brought water. We got up and walked out, I promised myself I'd write this, and here it is. UNBELIEVABLE. The last 2 times before today, one in Feb, one in March, I literally had to get up and go find someone who worked there and ask if maybe a waitress could take our order after sitting for nearly 10 minutes without even a drink order. Yes the interior is cute, the food is decent (although obscenely expensive--$9.00 for pancakes that come with nothing--it's $2.95 for an order of sausage) and yes, it has a ful bar but the service is so bad I will never set foot in there ever again.
