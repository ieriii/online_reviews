I don't know if everyone writing reviews here are friends of the restaurant or not. But, we had a really bad time here. The service was horrible to the point of we actually decided to start timing until someone came to speak with us. The food we actually did get served was not even that good. Maybe they will improve but I'd wait 6 months to a year to tell anyone to go. Skip the mushy fried deviled egg they reccomend. In short any restaurant can have potential but it's your money and Id reccomend you spend it elsewhere first.
