Calo is delicious! I've had several meals from here-some multiple times they were so good-the gnocci for example. This restaurant is located in Andersonville, and the cherry on the sundae is that they have a free parking lot directly across the street so you won't have far to wheel your belly after stopping by this wonderful restaurant. The service is helpful & friendly and the prices are quite reasonable. Bonus is they have a carry out menu-again parking directly across the street. The only reason I don't eat here more is because I'd be ridiculously fat. The food here's awesome! MANGIA!
