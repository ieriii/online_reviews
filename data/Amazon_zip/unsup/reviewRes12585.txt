have been to Texas about 4 to 5 times. Went for thanksgiving a couple times, for some special occasion like birthdays/anniversary since they usually send you a good coupon. The food is great and I like it better than Fogo de chao in Chicago. 6 months ago I would have rated 4 stars, however, in the last 2 times we went we had just terrible service both for dinner and take out. Just really bad and that kind of ruined the meal. The food is always great though, but service just really ruined the experience. so it is a 3 star for me. cause if I am going out and dropping $50 per person, I want to feel good about it,
