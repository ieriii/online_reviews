had dinner here last night, and was not as wowed as I had been the first time around. A few major letdowns: the salsa that comes with the chips. Its served out of squeeze bottles and was definitely lacking in amazingness.  we ordered the rolled potato tacos (which were tasty) but the side of refried beans were pretty bland, and had a few dry powdery chunks (leading me to believe they had been made from powder). It would have been waay tastier if they had given us the same black beans that were in the burrito. obviously byob, the beer cooler, outdoor seating all pluses. the menu has a lot of variety, the portions are huge. we'll be back,, but its not one of our go to places.
