Wellp. I'm impressed. Came here last week with my roommates ... just to change things up a little bit from the typical "Sunday night Lou Malnatis" routine. Not really sure what I was in for but it was really that good! 312 on tap ....yum & make your own burgers. Okay sure. Why not? The wings were delish & the service was great. They even brought out warm wash cloths with slices of lemon after we finished. How romantic is that? I do have 1 warning though ... be prepared to be stuffed.
