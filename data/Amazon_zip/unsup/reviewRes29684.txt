Perfectly gringo-executed authentic Mexican cuisine that is as ethnographically sound as it is delicious; a staff as brimming with personality as head chef Rick Bayless; colorful decor to match the vibrant menu; honorable and thorough commitment to organic/local/sustainable food - the crowning achievement of this being Rick's Rooftop Garden, the organic vegetable, herb, and fruit garden on the restaurant's rooftop that supplies the ingredients for a daily rooftop salsa. The only reasonable complaint about the restaurant is the wait time, though if you prepare yourself for a wait, plan for a non-peak time, or have a hookup, it shouldn't be a bother.
