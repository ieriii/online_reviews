Very cool place. My friend and I went around 9:30 PM on a Friday and only waited in line for about 10 minutes. I'm not much of a cocktail drinker, so I had trouble with the menu because I didn't recognize a lot of the things on it and I figured that if I was paying $12 for a drink, I'd better like it. I ended up with a Margarita (I was trying to play it safe) and unfortunately, it wasn't for me because it had something in it that was spicy and they also aren't able to serve them with salt. My friend had a very cool drink though, I think called a Juliet and Romeo, so it balanced out. If you're looking for a romantic date place, or a place to kick off your night with a group, or if you have an appreciation for elaborate cocktails, then this is for you! The atmosphere alone is worth a visit and I'm glad I went, even if I didn't love my drink!
