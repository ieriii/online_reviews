The pizza's really great, particularly the pepperoni, but I'm really giving this five-star review for the $5.98 two-slices-and-a-drink deal they have every day. It's not a bad way to eat in this economic climate, or any economic climate, for that matter. Careful though, this place is popular and you can end up waiting a long time if you get anything made to order after 5 p.m. or so.
