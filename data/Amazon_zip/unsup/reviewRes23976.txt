Nice niche place the sandwiches and shakes are real good, and they deliver too. I had to edit my review from three to four stars though because on a recent order that I had placed for delivery, about a half hour after I had placed the order they called me back and told me they had run out of bread so my sandwich would be a tortilla wrap, but "don't worry" he told me, it was just as good - it wasn't. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't what I had ordered and I felt like I paid for something and didn't get it. I get it stuff happens but c'mon who runs out of bread? But I felt at the least they should have offered to give me a discount or something extra, which they did not.
