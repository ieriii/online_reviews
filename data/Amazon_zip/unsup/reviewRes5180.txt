Hurray for cheese, wine, and swine. This new place on the miracle mile is a new gem in Chicago. It's just been awarded the Michelin bib gourmand award for excellent food and value. We had a great time just a few days away from christmas as i felt lucky to get in. Good thing that they don't take reservations and it's first come first serve...so we got there before the dinner rush.  The menu is Mediterranean inspired with lots of choices and small plates to choose from. In general, they have an excellent selection of smoked meats, cheeses, and of course very unique ways to serve a pig. We tried the Pig's ear with fried egg, milk braised pork, seared steak, big ed cheese, chorizo stuffed olives, braised pig tail with hard boiled egg, and smoked meat tray. I would recommend all of the them. For dessert, i'd reco the banana and nutela sandwich. Really good. They also have a monster selection of wine but we stuck with one - gavani, a Tuscan red wine. Great place. Go with some time because you need to sit and enjoy the food and atmosphere.
