I know Chicagoans are crazy for hot dogs but I never realized it until I saw the line for Hot Doug's. I was told this was *the* place to check out while I was there and I'm glad I piled in line for it. The sheer amount of available "encased meats" can be overwhelming for a first timer but I was able to find my selection before I got to the counter. I ordered one of the specials of the day (can't remember which) but it was delicious! I can almost still taste it and I haven't been there in a week! I would almost pay someone to have one personally delivered to me down in FL. Yummy!
