Love this place. They have solid burgers with good buns and great toppings. I've also tried The Leftover which is turkey meatloaf with cranberry sauce, stuffing and cheese. Fries are awesome, beer selection pretty snazzy. The wait staff can be either on point or kind of slow, but theyre always nice and make sure you get what you ordered. I also enjoy the decor. yay!
