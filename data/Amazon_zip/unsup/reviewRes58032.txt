I visited Mia Francesca and i thought it was fabulous. The food was excellent, the server was almost perfect (she was helpful and attentive but not bothersome). The location, I thought would be distracting, but the street and traffic was invisible as I ate with my family. I am trying to figure out what would have improved the experience or restaurant, but I really can't think of anything. I'd give a 4.5 but Yelp doesn't allow it. Great restaurant - definitely one that we'll be returning to.
