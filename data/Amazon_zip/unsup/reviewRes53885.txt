The Purple Pig was so good! I loved it! The best thing about this restaurant is their small portions which allowed us to order tons of stuff and share it. We even shared with the couples (who were strangers) sitting next to us at the communal tables! The wine selection was amazing, and I still have cravings for the deep fried deviled egg.
