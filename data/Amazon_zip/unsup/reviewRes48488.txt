Too loud. Too much togetherness - no privacy. Too expensive. We couldn't hear the waitress regarding the specials. We won't be back. The service was OK, the food was OK, the decor was OK. But nothing could overcome the horrible noise and din---no one could hear and everyone was shouting. The bathrooms are very pretty & it is obvious that a lot of thought went into the interior design. However, nothing was done to help people hear one another when the room is full. We didn't enjoy sitting at the refectory style table and having neighbors talking to us when we couldn't hear each other. I went with the friends I wanted to visit with & not to meet strangers.
