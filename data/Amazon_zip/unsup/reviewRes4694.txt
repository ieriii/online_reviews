I tried the Purple Pig for cheese and wine. It was cold, windy day and the restaurant's ambience provided the feel of being in a cozy European ski lodge - perfect! I can't remember the exact cheeses we ordered, but we were happy with our choices. The prices were a tad bit on the high side, but not outrageous. One thing that was disappointing was that when our waiter poured our wine, there was a little bit left in the bottle - just shy of one glass full. Instead of giving us each a little splash more, we watched the server pour the remaining wine down the drain. It was an opportunity to make us feel special as customers, but instead we got the message that the restaurant would rather throw something away than give us a little something extra.
