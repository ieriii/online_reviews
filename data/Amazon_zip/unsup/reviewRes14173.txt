It's places like 90 Miles that are causing me to move back to the NW side after a 3 year stint on the lake. Excellent fried plantain and empanada appetizers, la-la-la-lovely ropa vieja (enough for two meals!), and the best cafe con leche I've had in a loooong time. The price was right, the service was friendly, and their patio made us feel like we were outside - but it was so warm we could be in complete denial that 20 degrees awaited us upon departure. I cannot wait to go back soon!
