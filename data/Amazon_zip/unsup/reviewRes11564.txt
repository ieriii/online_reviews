I found out about piece from playing in Chicago ultimate frisbee summer leagues. Piece is a sponsor. The pit area is usually reserved for ultimate players on Monday and Wednesdays after our summer league games. I would make the drive out of my way from the fields, past my house, just to get some pizza at Piece. The pizzas are always creative and delicious. I can't say that I have ever been disappointed with a slice. The atmosphere is so laid back. I'd be comfortable coming here in any attire. It can get a bit loud, but that's okay too. Then add their brewery to it and you can't go wrong!
