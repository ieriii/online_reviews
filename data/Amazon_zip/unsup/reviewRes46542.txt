R.J. Grunts was the first salad bar concept in Chicago and even today it can't be beat. Located right in Lincoln Park this is a great place to visit after walking around the Lincoln Park Zoo or even if your just in the area. Each time you walk through the doors you are greeted by the friendly waitstaff. If you go for lunch you can normally get a table right away but sometimes it gets rather busy for dinner so keep that in mind when planning your night. I love their salad bar and soup combo. If you are a fan of French Onion soup with a thick layer of bubbling cheese on top this is the place to go! Even when it is hot out, I will always love the soup/salad combination. I love being able to choose my own veggies to go on salads and all the fruit is always fresh and delicious (and of course healthy!) They also have great burgers and fries. Every time I have gone there the food has always amazed me and the atmosphere is always lively. I remember going there as a little kid with my parents and always having such a good time at R.J. Grunts. It is a very family friendly place to go.
