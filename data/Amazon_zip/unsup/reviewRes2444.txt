Well worth the wait, will say that off the bat because their usually is a wait. If you are a hot dog enthusiast this is a place to visit at least once. I usually get the Dave Kingman (Chicken Sausage) and a regular dog, but there is a pretty good menu including some exotic choices you are not likely to find elsewhere. It's the kind of place I try to take as many people to who haven't tried it before. Not keeping this a secret, since the secrets already out (Travel Channel).
