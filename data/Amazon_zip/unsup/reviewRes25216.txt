I'm betraying my primary rule in this review that the food is the single most important thing which completely overrides all other factors. At Geja's, it's the atmosphere that will wow you. I came here with my wife for one of our anniversaries and it was the most romantic restaurant we have ever been to. There are numerous private-like tables, and a few more geared towards larger groups of four or more as well. The interior is perfectly lit with a nice old world reddish hue about it. The food itself is typical fondue, and it is certainly too pricey if food is your main goal of the evening. The appetizer and dessert fondue pots with respective cheese and chocolate dipping pots were both excellent. The main course is somewhat bland as it is just what seemed to be non-marinated meat and an oil fondue pot. No big deal, it was still a nice evening. To cap it off, Geja's was kind enough to offer my then-girlfriend-now-wife and I complimentary champagne, and it wasn't the low end stuff either. I throughly enjoyed Geja's as it is one of the more unique fine dining experiences Chicago has to offer. I have no doubt we'll be back for another anniversary sometime soon.
