chicago stuffed pizza... but tastes just like zachary's in california! not that it was a bad thing. the whole procedure is the same too: come in, put your name down, come back, order pizza, come back, get seated, wait for pizza, can't finish pizza, take rest of pizza to go. us 3 girls shared a medium special. i like the crust, however too much cheese - like one inch thick - and not enough tomatoes/sauce. we took half to go and microwaved it for breakfast in the hotel the next morning. mmm.
