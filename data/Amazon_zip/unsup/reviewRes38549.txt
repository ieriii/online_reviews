Best beer selection on tap and in bottles in Chicago. English ales, Belgians, Germans, Americans... I am going to waste my lifetime drinking here. The ambiance and food support this goal: the rooms are full of wooden tables and booths, the back one is non-smoking with high ceilings. It looks like your favorite destination bar ought to. As for food: the frites are amazing on their own, but become like ambrosia after beers two and three. The seasonal menu always pleases. Futhermore, any joint with a homemade neon shrine to Bell's in the window deserves extra credit.
