Burgers were great. Excellent french fries. You can get the short pours which lets you try a bunch of stuff. Beers were really good too. Lots of people had their kids in there for lunch. We took the brewery tour at noon on a Saturday, and the great part of the tour was that it was given by one of the brewmasters. He was very laid back and really friendly, and was able to give great answers to all of the questions that we asked. If you have been to other brewpubs the most they might do is show you the brew room and not much more. This one was great, lots of info.
