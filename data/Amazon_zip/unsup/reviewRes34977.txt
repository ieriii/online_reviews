Tasty and easy way to spend $100.00 while waiting for a boat tour. Went here with my wife and knocked down a dozen oysters and the crab bites. Both were fresh and delicious.  I've never had the bites before and I must say that it is a wonderful delivery method for crab legs. All they do is cut the crab leg into 1 1/2" sections that allows you to easily poke out the meat with a fork and eat... brilliant. The oysters were fresh and briny in the good way, and the menu has wines to pair with them. Easy peezy. Oh, we also enjoyed the fine oyster shooters. Think Bloody Mary shot with an oyster in it. Also superb.
