My best friend took me here for the first time on my birthday. It was a wonderful dining experience. Everything was perfect. The staff was very attentive and met all of our needs often times before we even requested anything. The dining environment is inviting and spacious. The tables are spaced just enough to give you a sense of privacy.  It is a never ending supply of meats, pineapples, salad bar and more, so be sure to come hungry!
