I will never ever stay anywhere else in Chicago...ever. I've been coming here for about 5 years and every year it gets better and better. Just today we came for an anniversary stay, and they were so thoughtful that there was a lovely card and treat in the room when we got here. That is on top of the amazing staff, great lounge, and great breakfast in the morning. Best hotel I have ever stayed in, hands down. Thank you to the wonderful people here:). Consistent incredible service-hige kudos to the concierge!
