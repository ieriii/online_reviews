Superdawg is a family favorite. Kids love the car hop service, hot dogs and burgers are great and the grilled cheese is really yummy too. Thick shakes and fantastic onion chips. Love that you can now order a dog, burger, etc without fries for $2.50 less and you can also get drinks for a buck. This is great for our family because the kids never eat all the fries, so we now order at least one meal with no fries and save a little $. Superdawg isn't cheap, but it seems they are trying to provide cost saving options, which I really appreciate.
