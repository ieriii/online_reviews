Lovely boutique hotel in River North, just blocks from Wacker and Mich ave, and a quick walk to the L, countless restaurants, bars and the hub bub of the river. If given the option, I will always go boutique over chain, and will sacrifice a bit of room space for personal service and friendly touches. I thoroughly enjoy the breakfast spread on each floor by the elevators: no better way to start your day than with a complimentary orange juice, coffee and bagel while still in your plushy robe and slippers. The manager's cocktail and cheese reception each evening is a nice touch, although I am usually at a proper bar during this time frame. The property is immaculate with modern styling and chic touches that are simultaneously impressive and subtle, the service is wonderful and the location is great. A+ on the ever important issue of bed comfort. - 1 star because, well it is a nice hotel, but it isnt a 5 star hotel. The internet was spotty, the TV could have been bigger and the room was on the smaller side. Still, extremely nice. Great value, ill see you next spring!
