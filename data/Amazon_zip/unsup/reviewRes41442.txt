Tank was one of the first Vietnamese restaurants I visited in Chicago, and I thought it had the best pho until I visited Pho 888. I thought Tank served the best canh chua until I visited Cafe Hoang. But Tank has the greatest variety of Vietnamese food and it's the perfect place for a large group. I love their gio cuon (spring rolls) and their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches). And last night I fell in love with their bun rieu because it tasted exactly like my mom's (plus a few extra ingredients). Next time I go, I am definitely going to try their bun nam (so far, I've only tried Pho 888's).
