This place has spectacular food. The only reason it's getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because your clothes stink after you leave. They have to install better ventilation. I'm sure they underestimated the quantity of food they would be cooking and thought it would vent okay...however the place is always jumpin and for good reason. I had foie gras over speckle with apples to start and it made my heart, brain and tongue all go crazy. Great dish. Everything was phenomenal. Had the veal for an entree and it was wonderful as well. The chocolate banana bread pudding was really really tasty. Service couldn't have been better and the woodwork in this place, especially the ceiling in the back room is clearly the work of a master craftsman.
