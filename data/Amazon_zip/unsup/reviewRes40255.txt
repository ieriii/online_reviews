Quite possibly the worst customer service I've ever had at any restaurant ever. Read on... I came to this restaurant yesterday and ordered two chicken burritos to go. Seems simple enough, right? When the guy took my order he said nothing about the kitchen being backed up. There were maybe 6 people ahead of me, but I'm a patient man, I can wait. 35 minutes later, the guy behind the counter says nothing. No apologies for the delay, no offer of chips while we are waiting....nothing. I check on my order. There's one order ahead of mine. Well, I've waited this long, so I make a call to my dining companion and explain the situation. And I wait... Now almost 50 minutes have gone by and the guy tells me they are out of chicken. I explain to him that I've waited long enough and I'd just like my money back. No can do, he says, I can order something else though. I explain that I'm dining with someone who has dietary restrictions (Hindu -- no beef or pork) and that I've waited for chicken, I've paid for chicken and politely ask for my money back. Again. Well, he says it's not the policy of the restaurant to give refunds and he cannot authorize it. At this point I ask him to get someone who can authorize it and he says he can't. I ask him to call someone and again he says he can't. He tells me that he can give me a credit and that I can come back and pick up dinner in two hours. At this point a woman comes up and says that they can make more chicken, but it will take ten minutes. I tell her that normally a to go order takes 10 minutes, I've been there for close to an hour, and that I really just want to go. End result, after almost an hour of waiting, I received no food, but I did get my money back, but no apology. Instead the cashier said that he hoped he didn't get into trouble. Well, I'm not aiming to cause trouble for him or anyone else, but honestly, I can't be bothered with a restaurant that has so little concern for its customers.
