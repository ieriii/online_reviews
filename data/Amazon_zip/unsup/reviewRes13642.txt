I do love this place, it's just too busy. Good for them, not awesome if you just want to have a beer or two. I have been here a bunch lately and have had a few different items. The Chicago style tofu is pretty awesome. The pizzas are pretty good; the Twice Baked Potato was a little boring. BUT I went here last weekend for brunch randomly, albeit because Lula's was closed due to flooding, and they have a great brunch. Bloody Mary's are a drink that I always want but when I get it, I'm usually disappointed. Revolution's Cheesehead Bloody Mary is super! The IPA Greyhound is fantastic as well. Last recommendation: the pepper and egg pizza. Super, super good. Oh, and their beer is fantastic too. Great waitstaff.
