I shared a delicious meal with my Dad here over Thanksgiving weekend. The place was packed at 6pm on a Saturday, so be sure to make reservations. The menu is pretty extensive with standard diner fare and breakfast is served all day. However, the real star here is fish. I had the salmon and my Dad had a pretzel crusted sturgeon. Absolutely delicious - be sure to also get the french onion soup. It might have been my favorite part of the meal, full of cheesey/bready deliciousness. The prices are reasonable and the servings generous, I'll be sure to go back.
