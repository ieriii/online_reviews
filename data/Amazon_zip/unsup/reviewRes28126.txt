i've only had the thin crust and i plan on giving the deep dish a try. with that said, it wasn't all i expected it to be. it was ok thin crust, a little too doughy for me. and the appearance of the place doesn't look the cleanest but its someplace to eat before a movie since its across from the webster place theater.
