I was on the fence with Eh...I've had better, and A-Ok, but decided that rounding up was the right thing to do (from what would have been 2.5 stars). First things first...know your audience when choosing this as your destination. It is not conversation friendly (which includes trying to listen to your waiter provide descriptions of menu set up, and recommendations), and it is NOT for those that don't eat meat or fish. It does have a great beer list, and our server was more than helpful with suggestions, and even a taste of one of the draughts, in an effort to help us make a choice. Also, we ordered a relatively inexpensive wine, which was good for the price. Food was where I found myself somewhat disappointed. Personally, I don't care for oysters (the only shell fish I don't eat), and they account for what seems like a quarter of the menu. Otherwise, I love pork, and fish, so I should have been good to go. Unfortunately not.  Pork rinds...definitely an acquired taste, which I haven't apparently, nor did anyone at my table think were worth any hype. Then recognizing pork shoulder is fatty, the one I received was beyond. I ultimately had about 2/3rds left of mine when I was done trying to trim it decently (the other one at the table was a bit better). Then the mixed plate of pork was a good dish, very well flavored, but again, we were left without a significant portion. The sea bass was excellent, and had a great smoky taste. The chicken was a great portion, and perfectly cooked. A couple of salads rounded things out, and they were decent, but nothing special. Nobody was in the mood for desert, and I guess we were just hoping for more. There will not be a return visit.
