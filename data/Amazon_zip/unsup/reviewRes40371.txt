La Pasadita has solved many a late night craving for this fat boy and grizzled veteran of late-night food. I can probably eat 10 tacos in a sitting, but I usually go for three to five. I love the simplicity of the tacos here and dare I say authenticity. No cheese, no lettuce, no sour cream. Just meat, onions and cilantro. The meat has a nice charred taste to it and the cilantro cleanses as it goes down the hatchet.  I must add one downfall to Pasadita but one that is easily navigable. Do not under any circumstance order the steak burrito. There is so much meat stuffed into this fucker - what is wrong with that you ask? Well, if you want a pound of grease sitting at the bottom of your stomach and then at the bottom of your toilet within 20 minutes be my guest. However, if you want something tasty and easier on the bowels, eat the tacos.
