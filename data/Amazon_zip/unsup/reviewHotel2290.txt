While I have not stayed in the hotel, I recently attended a conference here and was amazed by the level of service. These people do it right and are extremely helpful and friendly. The conference was on floors 6 and 7 and it seemed that there was a member of staff to help navigate at every turn. The breakfast spread looked yummy and the coffee stayed on all day. The boxed lunch was more than enough food and done very efficiently. After the conference, I was even able to get some work done in the lobby, using their free wi-fi. I would gladly recommend this hotel for any corporate event.
