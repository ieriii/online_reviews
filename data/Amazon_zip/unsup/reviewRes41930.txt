My friend suggested that we have a quick dinner here before heading over to the Riveria. This place is large, busy and crowded. We were quickly seated to a round table that we had to share with a handful of other people; didn't bother us as much. You don't come here for the ambiance, you come here for the food! The menu is huge; I believe there was 10 pages of food choices to choose from. I had a hard time choosing, but ended up ordering a vegetarian dish; a green tofu curry and fresh shrimp spring rolls for our appetizer. The food was delicious! Some of the freshest ingredients I've had at a restaurant! The proportions are huge and the prices were inexpensive, at least for what our table ordered ($9 for a large bowl) and a few bucks for the appetizer. It's BYOB and very casual. The place is clean and the staff is quick and busy. I would love to go back!
