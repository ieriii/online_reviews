I give this restaurant 5 stars. My friend and I walked in on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 and got seated right away. The service was excellent. We ordered the cream cheese crab wontons (which were very yummy) and I ordered the Wakamono roll and the hamachi with scallion maki. Both were excellent. There was a substantial amount of fish in the hamachi maki. My friend got the shitakke mushroom tempura roll (very good). It's BYOB and by 7:00-7:30, the place was packed. I would recommend this place over Sushi Toro if you are willing to pay a little more for better service and a little better taste.
