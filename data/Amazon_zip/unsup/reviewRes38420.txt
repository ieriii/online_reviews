Hands down best Chicago Styled Pizza I've had! The ambience was great, the decor was great and food was spot on. I walked into this place already anxious for some real Chicago Style Pizza for the first time. The awesome aged wood for walls with tags and notes of "... was here" made the place feel warm and inviting.  We got the "special" stuffed pizza. The cool thing is that when you get pizza with sausage, they give you a choice between ground sausage or a layer of pretty much a sausage pancake. I was skeptical of the layer considering how salty most sausage is, but can't deny the sausage lover in me, i go for the full on pancaked layer. the pizza didn't look like much coming out but once you slice into it and see all the delicious ingredients oozing out you can't help but to drool. The crust is so buttery, light and crispy. The toppings tasted fresh and not so canned, like some other restaurants make it. Thinking that this is how chicago styled pizza is supposed to taste I also visted Lou Malnati's (the "first" chicago styled pizzaria). The "Malnati Chicago Classic" pizza there was good, but did not have the bold flavors i liked in Giordano's pizza. Also the sauce on the Lou's vegetarian pizza also had the canned tomato flavor that I don't really like. So all in all Giordano's is the place to go for good pizza. I'm gonna have to try Gino's East. If I get a chance, I'll keep you guys updated. :)
