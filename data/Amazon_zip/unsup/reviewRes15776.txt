Before moving to St. Louis, I had a dream about Violet Hour. I dreamed that their cocktail menu was like, 10 pages long because each drink had a lengthy discussion of their ingredients and such. All except "Pimm's Cup" (which I believe Andrea W. mentioned in her review from quite some time ago). Anyway, all of the drinks had these mammoth descriptions and then Pimm's Cup just said "Punch" next to it. And of course I ordered it because Andrea W. said it was good. I also dreamed that we had some appetizer that appeared to be worms. Very bizarre, I know. I am happy to report that there are no worms on Violet Hour's food menu and that the cocktail list is much more condensed than I had imagined in dreamland. I generally don't enjoy rum cocktails, but was tempted by one including creme de violete, I believe. I can't remember what it was called, but it was delicious, as was the maple nut eggnog, which I ordered solely to be able to say I had a drink with a WHOLE RAW EGG in it. That makes me proud for some odd reason. Justin enjoyed his gin drink, thought the custom-made ice cube was pretty cool and really enjoyed himself. We went at about 8pm on a Wednesday, so had absolutely no trouble with lines and were content to sit in the darkened place sipping our masterfully-constructed cocktails and listening to what I thought was my stolen iPod (Zero 7, Radiohead, Neil Young, Portishead, Miles Davis and a variety of other fun odds and ends). Our server was as sweet as could be, the drinks were really well-crafted, unique and delicious (a tad on the pricey side, but that's quality, I guess) and the consensus is we'll be back when we head back home to Chicago. Oh, and as for Pimm's Cup being just "punch", I have no idea if that's true because it wasn't on the menu when we visited Violet Hour. Crazy dreams... I do hope they keep that rum cocktail around though--what a tasty treat!
