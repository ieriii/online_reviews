Six of us went here on a Saturday night and were eagerly anticipating this meal after reading the good reviews and being fans of the show top chef. Regrettably, the experience was mostly forgettable, but more importantly, the bang for your buck is simply the worst I have ever seen at any restaurant. It was almost $300 per couple and we only had 3 bottles of wine which were all towards the lowest price range on what is a very expensive list. The service and ambiance were adequate, and none of the food was bad; it just wasn't great either. We tried a broad spread of offerings from the menu and had at least 15 different dishes brought to our table over the night. We each opted for the prix fixe and even ordered more dishes on top of that. Unfortunately, the best tasting was the grilled cheese with cider. The entire group agreed we would never head back for average food at exorbitant prices. There are just too many good resaurants in Chicago to waste your money on an average experience.
