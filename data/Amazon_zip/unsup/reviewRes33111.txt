Came here because my breakfast staple, The Bongo Room, was closed. It's a holiday so understandably they were busy - we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for a table - no big deal. But over the course of our meal, from the greeter to the busboy to the waitress, everyone was rude. No smiles. I don't care how busy you are, smiling and not being apathetic towards your customers is pretty important. Service took FOREVER. On a 100 degree day, we were brought water with no ice (although our waitress brought us full glasses of ice when we asked.) Silverware had to be asked for after the food came. They got our orders wrong. Bacon instead of sausage. No side of toast. An eye roll from the waitress when we brought it up. And on top of it all, the food wasn't terribly impressive. The sausage links were too thick and tasted weird. The pancakes were not fluffy, and dry. Nowhere close to The Bongo Room. It'd be one thing if it was just an isolated incident with one employee and the food was excellent, but everyone was just in a bad mood and the food was sub-par. Very disappointing.
