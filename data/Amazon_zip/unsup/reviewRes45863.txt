O...M...G... Ahhhmazing!! We had a party of 6 and the service was great! Everyone liked their own food, and the portions were HUGE. I got the chicken flatbread spicy sandwich. It was good. The salad could have used more dressing, but I didn't complain. The sandwiches weren't spicy at all, but very good. Maybe some hot sauce.. Yumm. OMIGOD. DESSERT. We got 2 orders of beignets. They were delicious! It came with sauces, chocolate, raspberry, and whiskey sause (I think). It tasted like white chocolate. It was heaven. I am definitley going back. I don't live in Chicago, but I go there all the time, and this is the place to go to!! P.S. it's like a Cheesecake Factory... but BETTER ;) Oh, and it's not the cheapest place, but worth it.
