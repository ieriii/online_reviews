Not much to add that hasn't already been said! This place is amazing, I live in MA but travel to see family in Chicago frequency and make Hot Doug's a must for each trip! Lines can be long, but don't let it scare you, worth the wait. Prices are insanely cheap as well. Pretty sure I remember it being cash only.
