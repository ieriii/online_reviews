Really great hot dogs. Cool staff. I missed the duck fat fries since they only serve on the weekends, so that's what's holding up the last star. I really appreciated the strange dog concouctions and it was pretty nice in side. line was long but it was a breeze really. Definitely going to try the duck fat fries next time (can I get cheese on them too?).
