I liked this restaurant for breakfast, but not for dinner. I had stuffed french toast, which was delicious. My friend had a breakfast burrito, which he liked a lot. Service was good as well. But I do not think I would come back for dinner again. My friends loved their food, but it was just okay for me. Maybe perfect for organic food lovers :)
