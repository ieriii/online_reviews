My aunt was staying at The Indigo Hotel literally three doors away so we popped in here for some dessert and hot chocolate on a cold night. The three stars isn't for the quality of the food, the food was outstanding. The apple pie a la mode was outstanding and the ice cream was amazing. The hot chocolate were also quite decadent and delicious. The problem was the service. They told us to sit wherever we liked and menus were brought to us right away but that's where the problems started. No one came to take our orders. I eventually went up to the counter to place our order. Then the check never came so we left money up at the counter. I'll be back to try breakfast but I hope the attentiveness of the service improves. This place is outstanding and I see a lot of potential.
