The ropa vieja will melt in your mouth - the mojitos will make you forget your worries. The staff is courteous, the space is, uh, spacious and we love the food. The Cuban roast pork is the heavenly mix of tender and succulent that is oh-so-difficult to muster.  6 years we've been coming - never disappointing - and do yourself a favor and get a side of Maduros (Fried plantains) to share because you will not be wanting to part with any that come with your meal.
