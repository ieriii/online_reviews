Loved the Fairmont - it was old time elegant and the staff so helpful. We had a corner suite and the room next door that could close off from the rest of the hallway and let the kids roam. Lake and Navy Pier view. So nice. The lobby is beautiful - round with a wine, cheese chocolate bar in the middle (three of my favorite things) In the morning it was a coffee, juice, pastry stop. How cool is that? And the restaurant? Check this out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ Normally I wouldn't seperate a restaurant from it's hotel with different reviewsbut this isn't "ordinary" Service was prompt every morning (sometimes too prompt) Beds were comfy, turn down service with water left at every bed, nice bath products. Location is great - between Michican Avenue and Navy Pier, allowing us to keep the van in the garage with one exception. Be warned - Parking is expensive here. EXPENSIVE. (I think it was $60 a day) We spotted a small park from our window...perfect for the kids to play while we sat and watched. Waterspout fountains for them to run in. We were the only tourists...others were residents from nearby condos. It was a great find. Why only 4 stars? Besides the cost of parking after you're already forking it over for rooms, on arrival we pulled up at the lower level and asked if that was OK. They told us it was better because the front entrance is undergoing renovation. Then we waited in the heat with 5 kids for 25 minutes for a bellman. Not a good first impression. Also...no pool although they can send you to a nearby hotel's pool. Two hotel lobbies in my swimsuit...I don't think so. And you had to go thru a tunnel at the front entrance due to construction. Creepy. Construction won't last much longer, and I would definitely stay here again! Two thumbs up.
