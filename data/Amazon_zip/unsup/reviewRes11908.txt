I had time to kill in O'Hare airport and I took the advice of tourist information to take the Blue line South to the Damen train stop to The Bingo Room for brunch. Easy one block from the train . Hip neighborhood too. Huge line of Bongoers waiting to Bongoed in The Bongo Room. There's some pretty out- there cuisine choices: Pretzel Pancakes? I don't think so, but my "normal" breakfast was good. I recommend getting here early. Great for anyone stuck in the airport early
