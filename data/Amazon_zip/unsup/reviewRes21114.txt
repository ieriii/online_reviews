a perfect fusion of drinking and eating. every time i go, and its alot, the service never fails to impress, and the food never disappoints. the beer list has most of my favorites, and the cocktails are great. but i keep going back mostly for the duck confit, the goat cheese soup, and the amazing ribeye sandwich at lunch. even the burgers are fantastic, and nice and cheap.
