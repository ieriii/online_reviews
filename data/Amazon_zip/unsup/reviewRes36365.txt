Meli has to be one of my favorite places to go for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. They're open at 6am - so for any of you early risers, this is the place to be. I've noticed people holding breakfast business meetings or just grabbing a bite for an early morning flight. Weekends and lunch can get crowded here. Expect a 15 -30 minute wait at 11-noon on a Saturday or Sunday. This is a great one stop shop where you can find anything for anyone from the health obsessed to the slather-me-in-bacon types. I really like their sandwiches and omelets and almost always go home with leftovers. During peak hours, it's hard to stay and linger since it gets so loud and you see anxious faces of patrons peeping through the window hoping to line their aching stomachs with some freshly squeezed juice and homemade oatmeal.
