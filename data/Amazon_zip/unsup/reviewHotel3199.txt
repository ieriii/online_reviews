because i love W hotels, when my parents visited chicago again, i had them stay here. i told them it was a very nice, modern hotel. they looove modern but they were unimpressed. it was a cheap makeover of a dated chain hotel, and though the friendly staff has earned them a star, overall the experience wasn't great. aside from paying for a pricey room they added on a lot of additional costs such as internet, expensive parking and astronomically high breakfast costs. because of this, i cannot trust a brand anymore and will be using websites and also just walking in to see the feel for a hotel before i rely on the greatness of other locations...
