This is a good place to take a date for a romantic evening. The pasta is awesome. I had New York Strip steak there and it was great. It was moist and cooked to my liking. Their food is well prepared no matter what you order. The wait staff are super friendly and on top of things. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
