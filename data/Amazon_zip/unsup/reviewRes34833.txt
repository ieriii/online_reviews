It's really hard to give any restaurant 5 stars.  If its a place that I love and would go back to because the food, service and atmosphere is above the rest they get 4 stars. Sushi X gets 5 because they consistently deliver based on those three things. Their rolls are creative and delicious. The outside does not tell the tale of what's going on inside. Not very large, but the seating is decent.
