Located right on Michigan Avenue, this restaurant is definitely worth the stop! Usually there is quite a long wait to get a table, but it is worth it. A very unique place to eat at in Chicago. In addition to its unique dishes, the wine menu is great. I recommend the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Pig's Ear. Keep in mind that the portions are not large, but ordering several items will fill you up and give you a satisfying experience.
