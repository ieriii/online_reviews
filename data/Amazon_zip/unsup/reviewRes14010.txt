This place may be on an odd corner and not look like much from afar, but it's packed with flavor. It's easy to drive by and not know what 90 Miles is all about. I've been doing it for the longest time. One day I had a craving for a good Cuban sandwich on the north side and made my way here. They have a small lot that will fit maybe 7 cars and it's never a problem to get in there for a weekday lunch. They have a nice variety of sandwiches to choose from and even some vegetarian selections if that's your thing. They also have a great variety of sides, various preparations of plantains and cassava. I've had a Cubano, Media Noche, and Bistec sandwich so far. All of them come with a few fried plantain chips which are light and crunchy. The sandwiches all brim with flavor; the meat is juicy and well spiced. The breads toasted texture compliments the meat well and really soaks up the juices without falling apart. I did order the steak with fried plantains as the bun instead of bread once too, though I can't remember what the name for it was. Even though it's a little starchy and leaks oil like a BP spill I can't help but love the concept and execution. There are a few imported soft drinks as well which are a little on the sweet side (cane sugar) but great to try and pair well with the saltiness of the food. The employees are awesome and the girls behind the counter are engaging. They bring your food out to you and with the outdoor seating area you get a mini-vacation vibe. Prices are reasonable and the portions are filling. While the cubano sandwich isn't my number one in the city (Cafecito gets that nod) it's still a great spot. Get down there now and check out this place before the lines form.
