I have been to Nana twice, first time Oct 2009, don't remember what I ate for breakfast, but remember I was quite pleased. I was just there last week June 2010 for brunch and ordered an iced latte along with the Lemon Ricotta Hemp & Fruit Pancakes, they were delicious! There were 5 of us gals that went for brunch, everyone was more than satisfied, and I was impressed with the outdoor seating arrangements and the live herb planters along side the tables was quite clever. I live in Tucson, and will definately make it to Nana everytime I am back in my old neighborhood of Bridgeport. I'm glad to see a classy, reasonably priced, little bistro there. Good job folks!:)
