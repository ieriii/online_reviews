Hello, classy. With a sexy entrance lobby next to the steakhouse, this boutique hotel is where you want to stay when you visit Chicago. Rooms were spacious, comfortable, and furnished with trendy pieces. Kiehl's products in the bathroom, and luxurious spa robes and slippers in the bedroom. Oh, and quite deliberate placement of mirrors in the bedroom.
