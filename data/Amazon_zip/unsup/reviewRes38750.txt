i would have given this place five stars but the 2 hr wait for a table is a tad insane. but that goes to show how amazing the place really is. they have a nice system tho - order your pizza before you actually get seated so once we were seated we didn't wait long for our food. the pizza is AWESOME. deep dish at its finest. and my cousin got the chicken fettucine which was also very good!
