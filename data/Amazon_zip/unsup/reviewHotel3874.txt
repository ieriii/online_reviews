stayed here for a "staycation" for me and a mini vaca for my friend. great location, though honestly i never knew it was there. the room decor is very zen though the fact that the shower is open to the room by a big window is a little creepy even though there are drapes. the hotel didn't seem to have that many other guests besides us though vertigo lounge was hopping on the weekends. i would def stay there again. its a small hotel so be prepared to have to converse with the doorman everytime you come and go. seriously by the end we were just trying to avoid him. haha.
