2 Hostesses were very rude and disrespectful. So disappointing! So i would have given this place five star right of the bat, because i love their burgers and beers, HOWEVER...Last night, the 2 hostesses managed to disrespect me and my friends in the two seconds that we were in there. As we were walking into the restaurant, the two women receiving the customers saw that we had left over beers from the Maifest. They both started waiving their hands on our faces saying "hey, you can't bring those in here." They immediately escorted us out of the entrance way to the street. I was appalled and taken aback!!! So this may sound like its not a big deal, right? WRONG! How hard is it to say, " Im sorry, those are not allowed in here." Wouldn't that have been more civilized to say? We felt like dogs being shooed away. These two women were staring at us from the window like we had done them wrong afterwards. I had recommended this place to so many people and its sad to have been discouraged by 2 people this time. I will definitely file a complain and report them so no one else gets the rude treatment we've gotten.
