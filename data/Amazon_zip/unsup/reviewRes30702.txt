My first impression walking is was a good one. The space is beautifully decorated and we wear seated promptly. Our service was just ok. The waiter forgot our drinks twice (blamed it on the bartender) tacky. He always acted very rushed and like he had somewhere else to be. There were different servers bringing the food, which they literally threw it down in front of us and off they were. The drinks, I had the watermelon martini which was very good, and my boyfriend is a scotch drinker. Twice they brought him the wrong scotch. The first time the waiter promptly changed it out, but the second time he refused. Now my boyfriend knows his scotch, he has been drinking it for years and has like 30 different scotches he has collected. I thought that was just unexceptable service! Our food...the Brussel sprout salad was amazing and we also started with prawn crab Rangoon and pork belly skewers which were all very impressive, very well cooked . Then onto our main courses which were not quite the success. My boyfriend had the sesame grilled lamb, and I had the pork shank. The lamb chops were unetible. The lamb was RARE or raw whichever yuck. I had the pork shank which was very good. Told the waiter that the lamb was raw and he seamed very irritated. Kind of like who do u think u are. Whatever. Right there kind of ruined our meal. He accommodated my boyfriend sent it back. About 15 minutes later after we had to ask him twice for our drinks he cames back and says. Sorry about that lamb, they cook it in a water bath, I looked at it and it was a little flimsy. What??? Flimsy. Is that code for raw?  The place is so loud you can not hear the person next to you talk. Like super loud, even for me Not impressed. Way to hyped up. Frankly I don't care what famous people come hear, Chicago is overflowing with much better options.
