I wish there were more eateries like this in the Southeast. I have only dined at this place three times but every single time they did not fail to wow me. The first time I was with a group of 10 people - the staff quickly put together a few tables for us and efficiently took care of the loud and more than slightly intoxicated bunch. The next time I went for lunch with one other person. Again, the service was excellent (snazzy and zippy) and the food had me on an eater's delight. The third time I went with a married couple and their young child. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, everything was straight aces yet again. Location is convenient, food selection and quality impressive, efficient service, and plenty of satisfied repeat customers. Epic win.
