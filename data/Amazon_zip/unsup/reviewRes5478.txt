My boyfriend and I were recently in Chicago and spotted the Purple Pig. It was not on our agenda but we decided to stop in for a bottle of wine. Once we were there it was impossible not to get more. We had lots of wine, lattes, and an amazing dessert that consisted of marshmallow cream, nutella, bananas, and powdered sugar all in one! The service was outstanding. We had to come back for more so we came in for a second try. We ended up ordering way too much food but it was so worth it. The pork dish with mashed potatoes was outstanding as were all of the other entrees we had. We were not disappointed with anything. We had the same server, Elvis, and he was great! Very friendly and remembered us from the beginning of the week! This place was a little tucked back so I am so glad we found it! If you are in Chicago you have to try it!!
