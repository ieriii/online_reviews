Brazzaz is my favorite of the "I have 16lbs. of red meat on my plate right now" restaurants. The meat tastes the same to me as it does at Fogo, etc. but in a much more minimalist environment. One great thing about Brazzaz--they have legitimate sides in their buffet. I need carbs with my meat, and they offer some pretty good mushroom risotto and pasta. Otherwise everything else is pretty standard--cold side items, icky california rolls, delicious buttery biscuits, etc. But the best part of all--the coupons! You never actually have to pay full price at this place. Buy one get one free whether it be for lunch or dinner, and some of the coupons can be used for up to ten people. Hordes of red meat for half the price? Yes please!
