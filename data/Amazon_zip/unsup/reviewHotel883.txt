Stayed here for work via booking on http://Hotels.com. Hotel is very cool, great staff like what seems like all Kimpton Hotels. The room was tidy, loved that they had Aveda bath products. Room was small, but had a really interesting view into the neighboring apartment building. Check in and out was smooth. I did not eat at the restaurant as iI was on the hunt for 3Floyds and they didn't have any there. WiFi is free if you are a Kimpton rewards member, which is awesome. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
