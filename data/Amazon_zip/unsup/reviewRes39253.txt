I sit here in preparation of writing this review, and a commercial for Taco Bell's Beefy Crunch burrito airs. A poorly made tortilla with grade D pseudo-beef, nacho cheese, and fritos. I think, where do paths diverge? How is it possible to watch that commercial and think it worth one's time to purchase that monstrosity? Three words that I shall use to convey the message that I want you to receive in regards to L&E: FUCKING. EAT. HERE. Not necessarily in that order. Though if you place the first at the end you'll most likely wind up in the pokey. Though it may be worth it. And if you find a girl who'll do that, keep her. Duh. -Cheeers.
