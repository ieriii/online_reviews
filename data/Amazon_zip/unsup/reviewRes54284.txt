My first taste of Costa Rican food and I liked it :-)I thought it would taste more Mexicany buy it was milder than what I expected.  I had a steak burrito, 2 chicken tacos, and an Orchata. The seating was a little tight but I really wanted the outdoor cafe but the wait was 45 minutes, no thanks.Overall it was a good experience and I would go there again.Paul
