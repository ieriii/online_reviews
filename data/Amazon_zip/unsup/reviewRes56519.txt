As a relative newcomer to Chicago, I was excited to try out Frontera. Certainly, the line (which formed at 5pm on a Thursday night) was impressive. Unfortunately, that was the only impressive thing of the evening. The food was mediocre at best. Both the pork and chicken were dry and the inelegant, heavy dousing of mole sauce didn't make up for it. Too many tables meant I got more than one opportunity to enjoy someone else's derriere in my face as I attempted to eat dinner. And the service was barely adequate -- comparable to what you'd get at your average IHOP. Sorry, Mr. Bayless. I guess you're making a mint on the TV Show, the cookbooks and the supermarket sauces. And it's a good thing because eventually someone will figure out how entirely overrated your restaurants are.
