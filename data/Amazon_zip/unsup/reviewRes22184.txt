This is a favorite place to come for my dad and me. We both work downtown so every once in a while we'll stop here after to work for an early dinner.  We came here last night and everything was wonderful as usual. Sometimes we will order meals, but our favorite thing to do is just split a bunch of appetizers so we can get a little of everything, and that's what we did last night.  I'm not going to insult anyone and misspell a bunch of Greek words, so I'll just say we always get quite a variety and always enjoy everything. We have never had a bad meal and the service is top notch!
