We split a full slab of the "competition" St. Louis ribs. Ribs are not supposed to fall off the bone. I don't know why people keep saying that's how they're supposed to be. Rub was okay, sauce was decent. I wasn't in awe, but it wasn't bad, either. I just don't know if a full slab is worth $33-35. I thought the dessert was excellent, though. We had the peanut brittle and espresso ice cream dish. Very original, and very tasty. We really liked the hush puppies appetizer, too. Wine was a bit overpriced, and selection was not that strong, though. So it was a bit expensive for a barbecue meal, all told.  I liked the concept of upscale barbecue. I thought the space was great, too. They put us in a quiet room in the front of the restaurant, which was perfect for a V-Day experience. I thought the service was very solid overall. They do the little things right at this place, no doubt about it. I'm really at 3 and a half, but I can't go to 4. This is one of those places that looks like it's going to knock one's socks off but doesn't quite get there. Smoque is still the gold standard in Chicago for barbecue, to me anyway. At the end of the day I have to ask if this barbecue should be going at such a premium over Smoque. If I am just doing takeout, the answer is no. Dining in, this place certainly has more going on, and that is a real premium feature. This is Chicago, though, and it is pretty competitive for barbecue here. The concept here sets it apart from others, but the food isn't quite what the other operations have.
