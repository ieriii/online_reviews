I think this is one of those cases where my expectations were so high that anything short of greatness was going to disappoint. Publican is good, but not great. I had the country style ribs and it was pretty tasty but the chicken my date ordered was pretty average. Ambiance is nice, wait staff was very helpful, beer list was semi-respectable. This place is a solid C+. Not awesome, not awful, just average.
