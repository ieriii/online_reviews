Came here with a party of 3 on a Wednesday night. As we walked in, tons of different colors surrounded us and live music filled our ears. The hostess greeted us promptly and asked if we were interested in either the dining area or or the bar/lounge area. We decided to go to the dining area since the bar/lounge area was loud and we couldn't hear each other talk. We did not make reservations so we had to wait about 15-20 mins (not bad since it was already packed). We started off with the shrimp ceviche. All I can say is Y-U-M-M-Y!!! You can taste the different flavors of the lemon, chiles, avocado, and corn all coming together. The shrimp is fresh and succulent. It was also accompanied with some type of chips. People were not lying when they told me this is a must try. The entrees came shortly after. My friends ordered the chuleta (pork chops with squash and brussel sprouts) and the arrachera (skirt steak with rice). I can not comment on the taste of their dishes, but according to them it was good. On the other hand, I ordered the pollo (Peruvian style chicken with potatoes). It came with two good size chicken thighs on top of a bed of red potatoes garnished with red and yellow bell peppers and green beans. The chicken was soo tender and juicy on the very first bite to the very last. We finished off with the carnivale ice cream cake. And can I say YUMMY again. It was a three layer cake with passionfruit, pistachio with chocolate chips, and guava with cheesecake ice cream. It sat on top of basil, strawberry, and pineapple sauces. Oh and the best part, they drenched the cake with chocolate fudge. Overall, our waitress was very knowledgable and sold us on everything she named and described. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun. Also down in the bathroom area, they offer a photo booth and a shoe (flats) dispenser for the tired working ladies. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone.
