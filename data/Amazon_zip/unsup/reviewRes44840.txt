CHOMP. As you can see from my profile picture, I like Giordano's. I've reviewed a handful of restaurants on yelp, but this has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. They're deep dish is easily the best I've ever had, although I've heard of a few classic Chicago chains lurking out there that I have yet to sample. Still, Giordano's pizza is a mouth-drooling gigantic slice of epicness presented to you on a metal platform as if it knows just how good it is. The Italian in me I'm pretty sure was beating up the Belgian in me when I first saw the slice in all it's glory. Top it off with some grated parm, and your good to roll. The service isn't great, but that's almost traditional when it comes to Pizza. In New York you get insulted when ordering the floppy, in Chicago you get ignored when ordering the Dish.  A Must Try. MAMMMA MIA!
