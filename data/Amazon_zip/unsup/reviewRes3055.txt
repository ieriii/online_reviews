With wings the size of a turkey leg at a Renaissance Fair, Crisp delivers as one of the best wing places I've ever been to. The BBQ sauce is good, but the Seoul Sassy is really what makes their wings special. The bowls, able to be customized whichever way you'd like, are giant portions that are usually enough for 2 meals. Only two real warnings with Crisp. When going, be prepared to wait for a table or take your food to go. There isn't a ton of seating and lines can get long around dinner. Also, don't let your eyes get too big for your stomach. Portions are bigger than expected, a 5 wing order is the size of a 10-15 wing order anywhere else, so meat sweats are almost inevitable.
