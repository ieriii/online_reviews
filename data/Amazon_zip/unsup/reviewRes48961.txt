My 8 pm reservation had us ordering at 9:06pm. The food was tasty, and the beer was fresh, that is when we could manage a server to come take our order. Twice I had to ask for service after waiting 20 mins for drinks and the same for a table server. Pretty unacceptable for a place that serves $23 8 oz portions, tasty as they be.
