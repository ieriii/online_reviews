My buddies and I decided we were in the mood for some seafood and one of them recommended this place. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, filled with all sorts of delicious aromas. The menu caters to all different types of appetites and palates. Not knowing what to choose, I noticed they had an "All you can Eat Shrimps" on Thursday.. and well it is Thursday, so why not! We all agreed that was the way to go. Now I want to first say that based on food and atmosphere this place fully deserves 5 stars, but based on service got a 2. I believe a server is a full reflection of its establishment and ours failed to deliver in service compared to how good the food is. William or Bill first appeared to be your everyday welcoming, well-seasoned server but soon got caught up with excuses of why he managed to get our drink order wrong and why it took him 15 minutes to get us some refills and some water. At our last check-in we asked for the check, and once having received it we paid in charge & cash w/ tip to the exact amount. I had said nicely that the change was his. Well Billy's scorn first comes out when he brings us the charge slip to sign and returns the cash and says "Here's your Change." Slightly confused we shrugged it off and left on our way, well not only a few minutes out, he comes out letting us know that we forgot our card. As we thank him, he begins to question his service as he waves the tin can (thats what they use for a checkfold) with his tip in it. We politely inform him that his service was mediocre and that there were a few issues but it isn't like we stiffed him. We gave him 12% and I truly believe that was fair. Well now Billy boy didn't think it was and had some nerve to bark "We remember faces" -Really? You're gonna throw a backhanded threat to a patron? Not cool.. So all in all.. Food is good.. stay away from Bill, cause if he's not happy about his tip, you'll probably hear about it.
