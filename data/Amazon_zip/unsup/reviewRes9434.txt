I enjoyed my visit to Sprout with my boyfriend and mine's 5th anniversary. The food was a bit complicated, but overall I liked everything I ate. I had seaweed for first, which was delicious...a lot of different things going on in it which was a little much, but the broth they put over the top of it is delicious! I had the fish for second and that was my favorite overall dish. It was complete and everything made sense together. My last course was the corn. The dessert was definitely interesting and a lot of the elements on the plate were very good, but the straight popped popcorn on the dish were odd and out of place. The best, as everyone seems to agree, is the small grilled cheese paired with cider. There is a crispy fried piece of cheese the size of the actual sandwich handing out the side...I love a perfect piece of cheese crisp. Overall a good experience, they also have a vegetarian menu for about $40 I believe it was...definetly want to go back and try that tasting menu!
