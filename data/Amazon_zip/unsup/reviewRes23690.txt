This place seems a bit overrated, and full of tourists. The food is decent, and reasonably priced, but I have had better. The fish is fresh and lamb is good, but some of the other "authentic" greek dished leave something to be desired. Service is better than some of the other greektown places, but the food was a bit bland and greasy.  For the type of patrons that this place caters to, it could definitely do better.
