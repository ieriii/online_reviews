charming place, lovely outside area, parking lot. friendly enough staff. but truth be told, it's one of the worst combinations of an eatery for me: overpriced and supremely average food. i simply cannot believe their prices. for a neighborhood place with decent enough beers and wine, i expect more price variety in their food offerings. you may not believe me if you check out the menu on their site: the food descriptions sound delicious. no prices, however. another totally irksome quality in a restaurant. i always give places (unless they are truly wretched) more than 1 chance. sometimes even 3. uncommon ground failed every time. everyone i know who has dined there has the same reaction: 'eh'. on the other hand, the new talent buyer for music used to book amazing shows for the city of chicago and should prove to make things quite compelling.
