Shaw's is a Lettuce Entertain you restaurant and you know, Rich Melman just knows how to make an enjoyable place. I have been coming here since this place opened and have never yet had a bad experience. It ain't cheap, but if you want fresh seafood in the midwest you gotta expect to pay a little more. They have live music here too a few days a a week, but if you come in a off day and you are really feeling flush, you can go next door to Andy's for some great jazz. Or you can start out in the cajun themed Oyster bar, which pipes in New Orleans music and is a fun place in its own right.
