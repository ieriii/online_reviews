Nice place, a bit loud for my taste but they can't be blamed for being well known and crowded. Dining here was a great experience because of the fact that you get 4 different complimentary BBQ sauces to try, although the ribs are actually succulent and flavorful without sauce. You also get complimentary BBQ flavored chips and the best bread and butter pickles I've ever had, so if you are by yourself, or are trying to save money, or just in single-minded pursuit of MEAT, you can still have some variety in your meal. Although the ribs were absolutely fabulous, the sides were disappointing. The bacon cheddar hush puppies were on the dense side, and not very bacon-cheddary; the chipotle mayo dipping sauce was great though. The fried green tomatoes were well fried but ultimately disappointing -- good thing the excellent bbq sauces make anything go down easy. Service was great, and when our server noticed that we particularly enjoyed the pickles, he offered us more to take home.
