I'm upping my star rating and review after I actually ate inside the restaurant here. The inside is extremely cute with several wall hangings and a skylight in the middle section. Apparently, it helps to know what to order at this place. My friend recommended the spring rolls with tofu and just as the waiter took our order back, the spring rolls arrived on our table. I was shocked by the quickness of it all but it happened again when I took another friend here and we ordered them. This crew is quick! Additionally, I do recommend the garlic beef dish (not sure of it's Thai name but I believe it's number 65, if memory serves right), as it is outstanding. Overall, much better experience now that I know what's good to try and have been inside the actual restaurant.
