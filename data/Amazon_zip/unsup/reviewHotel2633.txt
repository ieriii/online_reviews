The James Hotel treated us like money even if we're more like pesos. From the time we entered the door until the time we checked out, everything about the place was first class. They helped us celebrate our nine-year anniversary by upgrading our stay to a suite. They also completely covered the room in rose petals and had a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries waiting for us as we entered the room. The hotel's location is great as you're within walking distance to most of the touristy areas in the City and only a block or two away from the red line. It's a perfect hotel in a perfect location and I'm glad I found the hotel on Yelp before I made a reservation at one of those corporate hotels that don't pay attention to the details. When I travel I want to feel taken care of and this place did its best to make us feel like we home away from home. This place is so money, it makes me want to party.
