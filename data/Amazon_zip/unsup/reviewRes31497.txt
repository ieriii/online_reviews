As a vegetarian, I hate to give The Chicago Diner only 3 stars. I love the esthetics and philosophy. However, the food was disappointing. I had some kind of veggie scramble and sausages which were tasteless. The sausages were overcooked and rough to eat. I'm not a fantastic cook, but most of the things I can make at home tasted better than that. I'll probably still go back and hoping that next time is better.
