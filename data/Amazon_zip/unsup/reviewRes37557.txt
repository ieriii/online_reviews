I'd been salivating about Hopleaf for eons. The one time that I did formally try to go, we were turned away by a 3 HOUR wait for dinner. I went on a first date there a few weeks ago, and for the most part, it was worth the wait. We were quoted a 20 minute wait for a table for dinner (it was around 8 on a Wednesday night), so we figured we'd get a beer for the wait. Unfortunately the bar was already totally swamped, and we spent the better part of our 20 minutes attempting to wrangle our way to order a drink. Just as we were about to place our orders, the hostess came by to tell us our table was ready. I suppose that was better than a beer, anyway. I got the grilled CB&J, apparently one of their most raved-about dishes, and it was excellent. The mix of the fig jam and mild cheese was to die for, and I will gladly scarf done anything that's fried. The fresh potato chips were good, too, though I was a bit disappointed by the Stilton mac & cheese, which was bland and a little undercooked. Their beer selection, of course, is what brings the masses. I got two glasses of Framboise Lambic, which I've had elsewhere before, and it was just as scrumptuous as I remembered. Next time I'll have to get a little more adventurous.
