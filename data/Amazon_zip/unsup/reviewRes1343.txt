Hot Doug's is one of my favorite restaurants! The owner, Doug takes the orders, everyday. My husband and I share a drink and we ordered a large our first time there only to be told by him, "Why not get a small?, it's free refills, and it's cheaper!" I appreciate that. He gets to know his customers. It's busy but I've never really had to wait long. The food is AMAZING. Great flavor combinations, innovative combinations and ingredients, delicious food! I take ALL of my out of town guests there...and they all have LOVED it! The only cons *and I'm being picky*: Crowded because it is small, Cash Only, Inconvenient Hours (including lots of time closed around holidays or for vacations) Pros: Great Service, Excellent Food, Great Atmosphere (& Music!) Edit: Hot Doug's continues to shine! I went in yesterday and had the Veal, Pork and Parsley Weisswurst with Bock Beer Mustard and Port Derby Cheese and it was amazing as always!
