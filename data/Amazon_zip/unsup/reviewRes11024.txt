Piece. You have sports, you have beer, you have pizza. Why must you not have ample seating? Now, I understand that they have a lot of tables around - but it get a little obnoxious after 10 when the bar area is completely filled with shoulder to shoulder traffic, with no place to sit (unless you are eating). And your videogames...dear god please move these to a better spot so that while I am sticking my ass out for my next shot, I don't have to move it out of the way. I like this place - I just don't know if I can simply 'walk in' and 'sit down'. I will still recommend this place if you haven't been there.
