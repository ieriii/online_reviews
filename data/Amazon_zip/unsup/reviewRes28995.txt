I really want to like you. And maybe, if I ever got to eat at your place, I would. But I will probably never find out. You see, you don't take reservations for parties under 5 (at least that's what I've been told when I tried). This is frustrating when you really want to bring an out of town guest to this allegedly awesome restaurant, but don't want to make them wait TWO AND A HALF FRICKIN HOURS to do it. Maybe that wouldn't be so bad if your bar could accommodate us and the other 50 people waiting. I really want to like you but you make it so hard. Please reconsider this policy.
