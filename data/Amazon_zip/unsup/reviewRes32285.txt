For a place that regularly appears in Us Weekly, I was expecting to be intimidated or let-down by the oft-hyped Sunda. However, our waiter was incredibly friendly and very patient with our very large -and very indecisive- group, taking the time to really talk through the menu with us, with his suggestions being spot-on. And one thing about super-trendy spots is that their interiors are way cooler than the usual takeout and dive bar spots that I frequent, Sunda being no exception. The food was fresh and full of flavor, with the rock shrimp tempura being the thing that dreams are made of. I had the shrimp and sea bass curry and had one of those experiences where you are painfully full, but its so good that you want to just keep eating. We went for lunch and had no problem getting a reservation the day before. The crowd was light, the waiter was attentive, and the food was incredible.
