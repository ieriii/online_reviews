To make a long story short, I pretty much liked everything they put in front of me. Drinks: -- Death of St. Germain (Gin, St Germain, Curacao & lemon) Food: -- Bread service was delish....piping hot corncakes & honey butter.  -- Pork Belly with little pancakes...this dish was like breakfast. Bacon + mini pancakes, um YES! :) -- Beet salad was great. The cheese provided a nice balance...plus I can now say I like like beets (as long as it's served with cheese). -- Gumbo. I don't think I've ever had it before, but I did like it. I was expecting it to be really spicy, but it wasn't too bad. -- Pulled pork shoulder sandwich with fried okra. Eh, it was alright. The slaw was disappointing--where was the flavor?  -- Take a pass on the bread pudding and request more corn cakes and honey butter! Also note: Make a reservation (they are on Opentable). If you're over 5'2", don't sit at the bar. It's like sitting in a cramped airplane. Dress in layers, as it was uncomfortably warm in the restaurant.
