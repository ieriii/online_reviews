I was in Chicago on a fun mini-holiday. My party really wanted to go to Frontera, especially since they just won the James Beard award. However, it was a Sunday night and Frontera was closed. We were pretty bummed and we were at a loss about where to eat (since none of us were from Chicago).We wondered down the street and were standing in front of a parking lot with a sign for India House. We thought Indian food would be the perfect way to end our Chicago holiday. Boy, we were right.Not only did we love India House, we're really glad that Frontera was closed or else we would have never selected India House that night.The food was terrific and the menu offers something for everyone. From samosas to tandoori to a great beer/wine list, we loved every minute of our meal. Thank you India House and thank you for being open. We are sure to pay you a visit the next time we are in Chicagoland.
