Loved this place. Thanks to our server @ Rosebud for suggesting... We couldn't get a reservation until 9:30pm -- but so worth the wait. The food was amazing! The staff was wonderful; the manager provided his card to call anytime we visit Chichago.Enjoyed some wonderful Amarone and a perfect meal -- starter: pizza with truffle shavings! We didn't even know about the patio until we finished dinner and the manager took me out to show me around -- Can't wait till next time!
