Better than I thought it would be. In fact, overall, I really don't have a big complaint about this place. Stayed for a conference at the same time Lollapalooza was going on and the staff did a good job keeping the groups separate but happy. They added cell phone coverage to the basement conference-level floors which is a huge help so kudos for them for doing it. The Big Bar served nice drinks and was a good place to sit and watch the thunderstorm roll in.  Other plusses? Good breakfast buffet. Comfortable bed. Downsides? Street noise (right near a fire station) and slow internet. Lobby is a little bit of a mess with renovations ongoing.  Would I come again? Sure, if the conference were staying there. The problem is that there are so many other great places to stay nearby (eyeing the Radisson Blu) that its hard to seek this one out. But it was A-Ok in my book and a solid place to stay for business.
