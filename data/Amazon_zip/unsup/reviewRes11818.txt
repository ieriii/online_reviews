Great beer and fantastic pizza....this place is all around just spectacular. I love the do-it-yourself pizza menu with different sauces and toppings. Because, seriously, only I can make a truly delicious pizza. I like almost all of the beers that they brew. They also have live band karaoke on Saturdays, which is about the most fun activity I can think of while drinking.
