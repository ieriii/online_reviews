mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. so so so good. this place reminded me of the old fancy restaurants that you see in bing crosby movies. old school charm with the hustle and bustle that make it comfortable. i had the prix fixe menu for $32 - house salad, roasted chicken, dessert. it was great! large salad that was more than just lettuce, a full half of a roasted chicken and tasty tasty key lime pie. my dining companion had a similar without dessert. with two glasses of wine and two cups of coffee, our bill came to $90. great value. a meal like this in SF would be at least $120 - especially with the filet mignon that my dining partner had. i wish we had one in california...just another reason for me to visit chicago more often!
