I went with a group of friends for brunch one Sunday. We were a little concerned when no one else was there, but the place filled up by the time we left. Everyone was really pleased with their choice. I had the breakfast burrito. Although literally every brunch spot in the city has a breakfast burrito on its menu, this one was a pleasant surprise. It had refried beans and was a bit crunchy on the outside -- definitely not soggy like a lot I've had at other restaurants. The only complaint I had was the service. Our waitress was really slow - it was almost like she was too cool to even work there. Oh well, overall it was a great choice for our monthly brunch.
