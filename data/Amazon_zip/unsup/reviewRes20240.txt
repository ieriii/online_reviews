I went on a Wednesday in April at 1:30. There were two people in line and a five minute wait for seats. Really, really perfect timing. If you can go on a Wednesday, do it. The torta of the day is pork belly and it is incredible. There is a little bit of a sweet, wine-y barbecue sauce. I would eat it every day if I thought I could handle it. I ordered the soft serve with the maple-bacon-salted caramel sauce and it was much better than my friend's blueberry tart (which had WAY too much tart versus blueberry). The servers got a little confused and said they would bring it about twenty minutes after delivering the meal but I think they forgot. I asked someone about it and still didn't receive it. Finally after going back up to the counter and asking for it again, they brought it out. It was worth the wait but a teeny bit frustrating. We also got chips and guac, as well as a pea soup that was pretty good. Really though, the pork belly torta. Damn. Damn.
