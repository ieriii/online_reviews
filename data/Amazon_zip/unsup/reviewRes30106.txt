The "Reuben" sandwich and sweet potato fries are the way to go. Milkshakes are good, but a little overpriced. I know some of the servers here personally and can tell you the service you get will be based on at least 2 factors: 1) Whether they feel like seating you right away or not. It's completely arbitrary, doesn't depend on how busy they are. So just be patient, even if you see empty seats. 2) Whether you come in with an attitude or not. My vegan friends are for the most part great, unassuming, laid-back people......but a lot of vegans aren't. Just chill out and ASK, don't DEMAND anything....
