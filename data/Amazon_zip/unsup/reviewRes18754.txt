I've been to Bad Apple so many times and I haven't reviewed it yet?! The Bad Apple is definitely one of my favorite bars to frequent. I've never been for the food and quite honestly, didn't even know they served food! I love the look of this bar. The outside, the inside; it's just one of those bars that looks cool. As a beer fan, this place does not let me down. They have a huge menu for beers, as well as a large selection on tap. The bartenders will help you out, too, if you just don't know what to order. The Bad Apple has delicious and strong martinis, as well as home-made fruit infused vodka. I prefer going here on weeknights. It's quiet and there are a ton of seats. Sometimes, though, the bartenders can get distracted by their friends on the slower nights and you might find yourself waiting to order or receive your bill. Weekends are very busy and there always seems to be one stereotypical genre of people controlling the Jukebox with their incredibly loud music. You may have to wait in line for the bathroom, too. But besides all that, I love The Bad Apple and plan on going back soon!
