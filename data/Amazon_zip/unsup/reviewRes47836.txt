This is a very likable River North hot spot. The service is warm, friendly, and inviting. The bar is beautiful as is the wine storage area. They are open to BYO corkage and do not pout about it. The harvest table circles the main dining room with four sections of appetizers and soups. Skip the tasteless canned variety soups and head right to the cheeses, breads, vegetables, potatoes. All are good quality and readily replenished. If you wish to order the dinner, meats, fish, poultry are brought to the table in the Brazilian manner. Some hits and misses here. Liked the lamb, beef, chicken, and salmon. Could pass on the duck and venison. Desserts are overly sweet and unnecessary. Would love to try the outdoor roof bar as weather improves. It is gorgeous.
