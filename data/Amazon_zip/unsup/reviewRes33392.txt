I'm not a huge fan of breakfast. Most of the time, the crap is too heavy or I get a crazy sugar overload. A friend suggested this place and it was also mentioned in Dining Out, so I thought why not.  OMG, I found my perfect breakfast there, the Iron Man. It's everything I love! Fresh, huge pieces of vegetables in an egg-white omelet and comes with a good portion of fresh fruit. I also added a side of blackberry-banana pancakes for only 3 bucks, not bad at all! Service was just alright and I didn't like the fact that you had to get up and pay at the counter. Hello, I'm trying to recover from food coma and you want me to do what?!!??! Whatever, I still love you and want you to open a joint up over in CA. Please come soon, my love!
