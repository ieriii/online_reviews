Went here for dinner for my cousin's b-day and had high hopes but really...I just didn't think there was much to be impressed about. The sangria we had was watered down, and the food was just ok. I mean it wasn't completely awful but imo not really worth the price ya know? Everyone at our table liked maybe a few of the meats but all agreed that overall they weren't that impressed. The service was decent and the atmosphere was REALLY nice but all in all that didn't compensate for the meh food. Sorry Zed... this was a miss for me.
