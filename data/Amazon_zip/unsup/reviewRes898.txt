Oh yes we did! Walked straight here after our lunch at Kuma's Corner. Hey, you only live once right ;) We ordered a bunch of little dougies to-go and to be honest, a year later and I can only remember one - the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with a truffle aiol. YUMM the others are good, but this is the wiener. Tip: Duck fat fries are only available Fridays and Saturdays :tear:
