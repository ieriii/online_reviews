I said Duck, not Schmuck! Duck - Sublime. Roasted to non-greasy perfection. Crispy skin, tender flesh, a little smoky, a little barbecue-y, a lot delish. Ask for the Pope's Nose (tuchas, kids, tuchas) to be served and take a little bite. It is NOT good leftover, so eat it first. Your bird comes with allumettes (matchsticks to you plebeians) of daikon radish, carrot and scallion. Bao buns that are soft, tender and tasty. Add a little sauce and you have a truly wonderful duck. After your duck has been artfully carved table-side, the carcass is whisked away to a magical place where they turn it into a large bowl of duck fried rice (fantastic) and a bowl of steaming duck soup (no Marx Brothers jokes necessary). I find the soup a little bland and superfluous, but most people love it. Sometimes, I will take it home, reduce it a bit and doctor it up. Then it is really good!  The ducks are somewhat local by the way; from Culver Farms in Indiana (I asked, this is how I know. I have NO inside line on the goings on here or vested interest in Sun Wah). You should call and "reserve" your water fowl a day in advance as they sometimes run out.  The rest of the food is also really great . Shrimp appetizers with bacon would make the angels weep (in my world, we don't have angels, but we are talking about combining two of the most reviled food items in the history of "my people", so I am thinking that weeping angels are appropriate) Singapore Noodles are really tasty. Nice yellow curry, seafood, meat and veggies combined to create a fine dish. Scallop dishes, vegetables, dumplings, it is all good. Bar-B-Que pork is porcine nirvana. I would venture a guess that most pigs would be honored to end up in this manner. We dine here often and have never been disappointed.  They are closed on Thursdays. Go figure.
