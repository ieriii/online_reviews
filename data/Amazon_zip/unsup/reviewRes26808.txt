The first time we went there was for lunch. We split a small pizza and it was pretty good. We sat by the window and it was fine. The next time we went there it was a weekend. We had a party of eight. I made reservations in advance. We ended up at two tall round bar tables on bar stools upstairs under a television. It felt like a sports bar. We split three pizzas. The one I tried was a deep dish pizza with vegetables on it. I thought it was too bready. I liked the salad and the appetizers well enough though. Not so much the atmosphere or the pizza. The only versions of deep dish that have really left me wanting more have been from Bacino's and Calo's.
