Went with the whole family and everyone liked it. Service is okay, but the food was quite good and the serving size means leftovers. Prices are modest. The menu is huge. We had the ginger chicken, the beef lemon grass, Hue soup and steamed chicken with vegetables. The ginger chicken was excellent and the other three were good. Good for family outings or those on a budget.
