I had my first experience with Thai food last night. It wasn't too bad, but I don't think it's my favorite cuisine. We ordered Pad Thai with Chicken, Ginger Chicken, Rice, Spring Rolls, Chicken Satay and some fried banana thing to have between all of us. The satay and banana were great, but I didn't reall like anything else. I don't know if it's just because I ordered the wrong thing, or because I don't like Thai. I agree with another reviewer that it was kind of odd to charge for rice, but it was only a buck, so no big deal. I probably will try Thai again, but I may visit another restaurant to do a taste comparison.
