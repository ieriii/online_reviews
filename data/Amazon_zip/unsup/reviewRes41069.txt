Wow it's amazing the different tastes, expectations and preferences customers have just by reading the reviews. I am typically the guy who loves a nice Ribeye, medium rare to medium, covered in garlic butter and is juicy as can be. I get what I ask for every time I venture to Ruth's Chris. Sides are large and good. Service from my experience is always top notch. Bartender was kind enough to recommend different wines and even write down the name of the wines I was being offered if I enjoyed them. I have no complaints here. :)
