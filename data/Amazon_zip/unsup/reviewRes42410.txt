I love this place. I go every time I am in town. They always remember me and customize a pho for me with lots of veggies because I love veggies and chicken because I need protein for my workouts. I've also had a grilled pork banh mi which was a heavenly taste of juicy deliciousness. Much better than the banh mi I've had in NYC. They also make avocado shakes. I love the communal tables. Sometimes they play hip hop which is awesome. Great people watching through the huge windows out onto the street wherever you sit in the restaurant.
