I expected something special from this place and walked away disappointed. I thought the steak and seafood dishes that I tried were very average. 1. The Lobster Bisque wasn't that flavorful, I had to add pepper and the lobster was quite chewy 2. My steak was avg at best, cooked over medium, when I ordered it med-rare. I do know it's not going to be exactly med-rare, however to cook it over medium is not acceptable. The flavor led me to question if it was even choice. 3. I tried my friends lamb chops, they were chewy, I attribute this to the size of them, they were too big. The service and ambiance are very good. The only reason I would come back would be for drinks and apps at the bar.
