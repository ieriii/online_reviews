Wow. The neighborhood I live in in Boston really needs a place exactly like this. Delicious breakfast food, not too expensive (plates are around $8-10), and fun atmosphere. I had "The Farmhouse" which is basically biscuits and gravy. Mmmm. I'll go back the next time I'm in Chicago.  Definitely crowded, though. We waited 20 minutes, which actually seemed like it was a reasonable amount of time to wait given how amazingly busy it was at 11:00 a.m. last Saturday morning.
