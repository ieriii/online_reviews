I go here almost every day. I was going to the starbucks across the street but it ws giving me some evil yupster vibes that were not fun in the morning, so I switched to Alliance. The gals at the counter are nice. I usually only get coffee. I always get a skim latte, medium. It is 3 dollars. Not bad. I have seen their cupcakes and cookies with witty sayings. Sure, they are witty but 2.50 or 3.00 seems like a lot of money to pay for a funny saying you could put on yourself. But you judge for yourself. They also have hummus in a cooler and sandwiches and bagels. But sometimes the sandwiches are stale. Oh yeah, also, one time these two old ladies were there, and they got a loaf of bread and asked to have it sliced. And they were told that Alliance no longer had a bread slicer. So don't expect to get your bread sliced there, buddy! UPDATE: Just found out Alliance was sold last week to a high end pastry chef. What will happen now?
