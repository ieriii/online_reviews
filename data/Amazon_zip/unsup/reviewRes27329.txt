Being from the land of Papa John's....mmmmm...thin crust with mushroom.........I wasn't sure what to expect with Chicago Style Pizza. After I kept asking around what one of the best neighborhood places to get deep dish was, I was told Pequod's was a great place to go. So I set out, excited....yay! Chicago deep dish! I went when I first moved here and again recently. Boy, I'm really not a fan. It's decent, and the caramelized crust is good, but I found it a little greasy for my taste. Also, the thing that really bugged me the most...nit picky, I know, but I adore mushrooms, and Pequod's does not use fresh ones; their mushrooms are canned. That ruined the pizza for me. Price is pretty average for what you'd pay...I wasn't shocked by the bill. Service is good. Place has a sticky feel in the air. I'd eat here again if I was in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. And then I learned...this isn't Chicago deep dish pizza...so wtf did I come here for?
