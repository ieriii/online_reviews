Freshness and flavors - excellent (had Hamachi Carpachio, Sunrise Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Sashimi 12 Piece Platter). But the servings were teeny-tiny at the price. Wait time - Great, which is to say none, at 7 pm on a Thursday (last night). Atmosphere - Awful. Way too loud, way too dark. There were only two of us, but I felt like I was shouting to converse. And as the place started to fill up, I couldn't wait to get back outside for a little peace! I had to tilt the menu toward the window to read it, as we were sitting near the back and it is very dark. Service - Cheerful and knowledgeable, but so slow we nearly left before our drink orders were even taken. Once we placed our order, the appetizer took a lifetime to come out, and we had plenty of time to cool our heels once that was cleared before our main dishes came out. Don't come here hungry, you'll be miserable waiting on the food and ultimately disappointed by the emaciated roles.
