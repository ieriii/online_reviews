so glad i got to try this place! it was a lot of fun even though my friend and i embarrassingly had a hard time finding the actual entrance. oops. anyway! the place is hip as hell - way too hip for me actually. very very dark, tiny tables, and high-backed chairs. we were in time for the summer menu and the cocktails were really great! i got to try the old & young and the public purse (both gin) and well as the midnight stinger and their sazerac. the best drink was definitely the public purse. they did a great job with the egg white. mmm foamy. the old and young was a typical fruity cocktail, which was good, but not very complex, so i don't think i'd get it again, at least not here. i liked the sazerac, but sadly, i could think of two better sazeracs i'd had in my life, both for cheaper. overall i really like this place and think it'd be a really great place for a date (not a first date though since there's so much pressure to be hip) or a quiet drinking night out with friends. the food menu didn't look that interesting but i think it'd be worth trying if i came back.
