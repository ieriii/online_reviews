Meh... Meh... Meh... Way too much hype for a place that in my opinion just is not that good! First off the exterior of the building is completely nondescript and is painted a horrid shade of grey. The interior is neat looking, but all hard surfaces, so if you want to have a conversation either go with people that know sign language or plan on spending your entire evening shouting. The hostesses were polite and nice, but our waiter could have been much better. He was not terribly helpful with ordering. When we tried to start by ordering appetizers, but he told us that they don't let people do that there? Very odd, and that is fine if that is how you run your kitchen, but tell us that when you give us the menus rather than when we are ready to order apps. He also seemed to only be able to serve one table at a time. Meaning he would check on one table go back do whatever they needed and then come back to check on the next table rather than managing his time by going to a bunch. The cocktails were great, but the food was not, and It was way over priced. The bone marrow was gelatinous. The burger was bland and the bun seemed stale. The beef tallow fries had a particularly unctuous texture. The scallops were under done and had the accompanying sauces and veggies did not do much to enhance them or make them unique, and the portion small.... A lot of the entrees seemed to focus on textures that I could do without. Fried soft shell crab? Ewwww no thanks!  There are tons of great places to eat in Chicago, and Longman & Eagle is okay, but not 20+ dollars a plate for an entree good. Go to Revolution, Province, Brown Trout, Sepia, The Girl and the Goat or about a dozen other restaurants in the city and get a better meal! Sure, those places may not all have the same trendy factor (although a few of them do), but at least you will get what you pay for and it will undoubtedly be better than Longman & Eagle!
