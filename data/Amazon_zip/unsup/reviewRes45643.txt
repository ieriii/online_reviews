Absolutely beautiful bar - mahogany wood, copper accents, fireplace, leather seats, big booths, two large bars...We had lunch here and enjoyed a very good salad and sandwiches. It doesn't look very big from the street but it's a fairly massive room. The ultimate in coziness on a gray winter day. Will definitely be trying to spend more time at this place when I'm in the neighborhood.
