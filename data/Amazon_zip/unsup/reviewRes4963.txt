This place was interesting to say the least. I have heard that there is usually a wait for this place and so I was skeptical about the length the wait on a Saturday night around 8pm. Warm summer July night and there were people waiting at several outdoor benches when my boyfriend and I walked in. We did the smart thing and opted to sit at the bar which was open and was a really good mood. The clientele was interesting as was the wait staff. The place is actually quite casual in nature. All the bartenders behind the bar were in jeans and rugby t-shirts and the patrons were a mix of casually dressed (like we were that night) and the club crowd. We ended up fitting right in. The menu was a little intimidating at first and although I like wine, I'm no sommelier. However our rugby shirt wearing bartender was quite helpful with pairings and food suggestions. The food was really good and it was small plates so nice for sharing. We started off with the manchengo and membrillos (sweet sauce). Ryan had chicken skewers in tzatziki sauce and I had the serrano ham on toasted bread with duck egg. Ryan's meal was better, in truth my ham was a little salty, but I couldn't complain when there was a nice cooked egg on top to compliment it. Although the plates are small they were filling and so we opted to share a dessert. Yum the panino con nutella was yummy. Definitely need to go back and try new plates and desserts.
