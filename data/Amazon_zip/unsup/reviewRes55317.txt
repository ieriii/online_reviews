I went there with my boyfriend for our one-year anniversary and it was actually quite a lovely place. The food is good but a little to meaty for my taste, I enjoyed the salad bar. The price is very reasonable ($50 per person) and I absolutely adored their Sangria! The staff was great though and never failed to answer our requests! Definitely recommending this place to friends.
