I didn't realize how huge this restaurant was until I walked into the main dining room. The Chuleta pork chop was just quality, succulent bone-in piece of meat. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Skirt steak wasn't as impressive. Still think Nacional 27 does a better job. Would I go again? I guess so with another half off cert.
