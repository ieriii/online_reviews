I had reservations for 6 at 11:45am. Unfortunately, not all of our group had arrived on time. Luckily, The Gage still allowed us to sit at a table of 6 without our entire group arriving. Even though it was lunch time, we were given both the brunch and the lunch menu. I thought that was great because it gave us more options to choose from. I ordered the fish and chips. Almost the BEST fish and chips I have ever had (next to the fish and chips I had in England). It was perfectly battered and fried. REALLY REALLY GOOD. The rest of the group ordered the roasted chicken and the house made corned beef hash. We all cleared our plates off! It was that delicious! Prices are reasonable and service was good. Other than the crying baby at the next table, the ambiance here was great. Be sure to make reservations because the restaurant was packed when we left around 1pm.
