The River Hotel is definitely geared toward the business traveler; if I am not mistaken I believe this hotel also operates as a Club Quarters location. Nonetheless this hotel served me well during my weekend stay in Chicago. I found hotel to be central to the activities which I planned. A brief walk northbound will lead you to the Magnificent Mile and a brief walk southbound will lead you to Millennium Park. The hotel itself definitely had a mature clientele, no ruckus or wayward people which was ok with me. My room was awkward. Clean but very awkward. I think the hotel did a really good job of trying to make the room as comfortable as possible, however it was pretty clear that guest rooms have been converted. My room was not particularly large but again the hotel did a really good job of trying to accommodate guest. There was a nice desk area that would serve the business traveler well. A mini-fridge and microwave was also on hand. The bed was not remarkable, but it was clean. My only true gripe about the River Hotel is definitely the bathroom. I am a woman; so bathrooms are important. Not only did it appear as if this bathroom was converted from a former closet, there was no bath tub. It's not that I wanted to take a bath, I just like to be able to distinguish my bathing space from the rest of the bathroom and this was not possible with the shower stall which was provided. If you are just looking for a place to set down your belongings and beat the streets...this hotel will serve you well.
