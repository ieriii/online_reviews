this review is based on menu items #39 and #40 only. same thing except one is the super size version of the other. cheap, delicious, authentic pho. 1 less star since their broth is getting "dirtier" at the bottom of the bowl instead of being completely "clean" and i noticed my last bowl was a little greasy. don't know if they are getting lazy since they are popular, but it seems like they are cutting a few corners in the skimming and de-greasing department. when i can't get homemade i go here.
