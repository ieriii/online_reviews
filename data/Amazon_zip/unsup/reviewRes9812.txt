We came here for Sunday brunch this past weekend. Having heard all the great reviews, we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance, asking to be seated in the atrium. When we arrived (they ask you to arrive 15 minutes early), we had to wait a few minutes before they sat us in the main dining room despite tables being available in the atrium area. Not a big deal. The tables in the main dining room are super close to each other. They had to pull the table back in order for me to sit on the bench against the wall (and I'm tiny at 5'1" and 100lbs). But expect to hear everyone's conversations around you. As for the food, it was just ok. We started off with the brioche. This was two TINY pieces of bread that came with a chocolate and lemon spread. The spreads were more like puddings...tasty but not spectacular...reminded me of Jello pudding. We then split the Steak & Eggs and the french toast. The steak was crab encrusted with a cornmeal coating. It was different but nothing that blew my mind. The french toast was good with a peanut butter mousse and fresh berries, but my boyfriend thought they were trying too hard with the melding of too many flavors. This from a guy who LOVES peanut butter and can eat it straight from the jar. We also ordered a side of the pork belly. This was a huge mistake on my part. I thought it would be more like bacon, nice and crispy. But it was just slimy globs of fat. Live and learn, I guess. As for the service, our waiter was somewhat inattentive and got our order mixed up a couple of times. They originally brought bacon buns instead of the brioche we ordered. Then we had to flag him down to get the order of pork belly, by that time we were almost finished with our meal. If you want a great brunch, go to M. Henry instead. Cheaper and much better food.
