My 88 year old mother that walks with the assistance of a walker and I have frequented Garcia's for years. She loves loves loves their shrimp fajitas and the waitresses there. We went this afternoon and wanted to run back out the door as fast as we could. Except, as I said, my mother is handicapped and walks with a walker. The music was extremely very very painfully loud. I could hardly hear a word my mother was saying and the waitress kept repeating our order to see if she heard us correctly. My mother is hard of hearing and also complained about the loudness of the music for a Sunday afternoon. We asked the waitress if they could have the volume lowered so we could hear each other. The waitress returned, telling us that the restaurant manager told her there was no volume control and that we needed to put up with it. We truly wanted to walk out the door but since my mother is handicapped plus a diabetic who needs to eat on schedule we stayed. The music blared as if it was a nightclub. We ate as fast as we could. I asked to speak with the owner who had just arrived. He was very apologetic regarding the volume. Our waitress seemed to be supportive of us too as she said she could not even hear the people's orders. I still think Garcia's food is great, but the ambiance and especially the extremely loud music is simply rude and not conducive to normal conversation and dinner etiquette. I love Mexican music but this was over the top obtrusive, annoying, and painful to the ears.
