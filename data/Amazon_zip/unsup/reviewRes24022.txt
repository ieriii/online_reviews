As always the food is great, I ordered the whole cooked fish, grilled squid and had some of my friend's combo orders this time. I have to say that the spanikopita at Pan Hellenic bakery is wayyyyyyyy better than Greek Island's. Also, our server seemed so rushed and a little rude here and there, so that wasn't the most fun, plus you can't be seated (I made a reservation too) until your whole party is here (i was going to start eating with a few friends first, and 1 friend already said she wasn't going to be able to join us until 45min later. Why is that a big deal?), so 1 star gets knocked off for that.
