This place is amazing. Every Thursday night, me and a couple of my girlfriends get together here. We enjoy the half of margaritas, queso fundido, and guacamole. The margaritas are made with real fruit which makes them the best in the city! The service is great, the margaritas are fantastic, and the food is to die for. Everyone should try this place sometime in your life!
