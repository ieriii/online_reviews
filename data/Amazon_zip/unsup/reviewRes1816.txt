I've gone to hot dog heaven! Never have I thought hot dog could actually be a gourmet meal...but that's until I came to Hot Doug's. After waiting for 2 hours in the blistering cold (yes, it was worth it), we ordered everything that sounded good! And the names of the hot dog creations were hilarious. { WHAT TO ORDER } * Chicago hot dog - you're in Chicago, you just have to at least try it! * Corndog - yes, it's good!! * Every darn thing on their special menu: ** Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (OH SO YUMMY!!!) ** Ribeye Steak Sausage * French fries cooked in duck fat - this is certainly overrated (served only on Fridays and Saturdays) but it's worth a try { ENVIRONMENT } This place is really small!! Order and pay first before you sit down at a table. { TIP } * CASH ONLY * Come when they first open (10:30). After 11ish, you are screwed! Check their website for operating hours. Sometimes Doug takes a day off and closes the restaurant. So call in advanced before coming here. * DO NOT SIT before you order or else you will get yelled by Doug (yep, I got yelled at ): ). This place certainly lived up to its hype. I will definitely visit this place again next time I'm in Chicago!! It's that delicious! *drooling*
