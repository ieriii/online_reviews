Got to try it out today for brunch...had the Crab Cake Benedict....it was pretty good. The space was nice and food good. The service was A+ too...they kept my coffee and water full the whole time. My only complaint was that while sitting on the booths...I smelled mildew...like an old Victorian house mildew smell...I am not sure if it is becasue the retro booths really are from the days of old or it is just part of the space's charm...it is an old building. I'm really allergic to mold and am sensitive to the smell but my usually smell challenged brunch mate smelled it too...They lose a star for that...other wise the place is tops. :-)
