I love Gino's deep dish pizza. I have been to this location several times. I tend to go for lunch so its not as busy. The staff is ok. It takes at least 45 min for your pizza to cook so be ready for some hunger pains. During my last visit I was a bit bummed out cause our crust was a bit burnt (and that's the best part!) If you have never had deep dish pizza add this to your list of places to eat.
