Best pan pizza on the north side?  Yes, it's possible. Definitely top three. My girlfriend/fiancee/wife (don't worry--it's the same woman) and I have been searching for almost two years for the best pizza in our vicinity, and this location, so close to home, may have been the right answer all along. We have finally found a pizza upon which we can both agree. And not only is the pan an A, but the stuffed is an A- and the neapolitan a B. Plus, they serve a mean grilled calamari--four big pieces marinated and cooked to perfection, served atop some steamed spinach. Their mediterranean salad is basic but good; however, recently we got their caesar salad for delivery and it was a major downer--anemic lettuce that didn't resemble romaine, plus a sparse few grape tomatoes and oily croutons. Okay, so don't get a caesar salad--just get a pizza. Any of them.
