I want to give Piece 3.5 stars. My best friend was visiting and we met up with her husband's friends here. They assured us that it was the best pizza in the whole world, so I'm excited! I see 3 giant boxes of Strongbow cider and I'm REALLY excited!! Any place that sells Strongbow is ok by me.  Bring on this life-changing pizza!!! We got a table quickly than the anticipated 2 hour wait they quoted us and ordered 2 large pizzas. I was really looking forward to pineapple pizza, but that isn't a topping they offer.  Pizzas arrive and they are ginormous with fresh toppings. Yummy yes, but it certainly wasn't the best pizza I've ever had. Everyone else had the beer and agreed that it was pretty fantastic. I'll definitely go back again, but won't expect to find that elusize life-changing pizza.
