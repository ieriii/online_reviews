My sister and I stopped here for lunch last week, based on the rave reviews from Yelp! My Quick Dish: Ambiance: Cute, warm, comfortable Area: high tops or reg. table seating, great bathrooms! wine shop in the back (and they have the license needed to sell un-opened bottles yay! or $7 corking fee for in-house enjoyment, full bar w/stools Main Eats: +reasonably priced,+The giant rigatoni w/ spicy tomato sauce was amazing! -BUT, the seasonal bruschetta left much to be desired. It was cold and OUT of season, cold butternut squash and and pine nuts in February? I think not. Also, they topped her risotto with a raw egg? Weird. Sweets: +The Chocolate Mousse was perfection! Service: Gavin or something..He was awesome and very helpful with the very Italian menu items. +I would definitely go for dinner, perhaps they could impress me a bit more & to buy some wine from their extensive wine list + Would be great atmosphere for a date/groups
