need to update their menu on website i do understand that they change their menu daily due to serving local and seasonal dishes however i made a resi to eat there for brunch and i feel as though their entire menu had breakfast related dishes brunch is part breakfast part lunch not just breakfast so i was a bit disappointed plus the waitress that i dealt with spoke to me like i was an idiot deff not cool
