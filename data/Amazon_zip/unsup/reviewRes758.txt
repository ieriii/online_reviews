I just want to reiterate everything Kristine said in her review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ I went on a completely different day and had the same experience. Come prepared, and avoid the mental breakdown. If you succumb they win. Also, beware wandering desert man symptoms, or else you will be so thirsty you will want ten hot dogs to quench your parched stomach.
