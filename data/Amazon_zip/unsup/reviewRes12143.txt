I love Piece for their New Haven style, thin chewy crust pizzas. I lived in New Haven for a number of years and am happy to have found a place that can authentically reproduce their wonderful pizzas. The staff is friendly, they have solid brewed beers, neat gallon beer jugs that you can buy for $5 to refill, and sports being broadcast on flat-screens (if you're into that sort of thing). I recommend the mashed potato, garlic, basil, and bacon, white (no tomato sauce) pizza.
