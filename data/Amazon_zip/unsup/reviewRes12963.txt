We've tried several of the brazilian steakhouses in the area, and I expected not to be too impressed with this place. However, I must say that it exceeded my expectations. The salad bar (which I'm always a fan of) was very large with lots of selections - from salad to deli meats to cheeses to pasta salads to sushi to hot sides.  Then the skewers started coming - from parmesan pork to filets to sausages, etc. The filet itself was several ounces and filled me up right form the start! The wait staff was great and the guachos kept coming around every minute or so. The mashed potatoes and cheese bisquits were good, but the fried bananas were exquisite! We also gorged ourselves and got the Banana Foster Cake dessert which was perfect! Fortunately, we had a groupon for the meal which helped b/c I would have trouble spending $47 for myself when I mostly had the salad bar and sides. The only annoyance I had with the place was when we first got there, we ended up having to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated. There were plenty of empty seats in the main room. I don't understand places that do that. We can see that they're not too busy so why have us wait? Overall - I would go back - especially if I had a coupon.
