I love Grand Lux, every time I'm in Chicago I make sure to pay them a visit. I am a not a fan of restaurant chains, but this place consistently delivers. Last time, we were there we had one of the potato filled appetizers, (cannot remember the name!) simply delish! I had the Carbonara and my husband had a pizza Margherita. Very very good! The Carbonara dish tends to be dry most of the time, but it was surprisingly moist. For dessert we had the creme brulee, excellent as well.We have also tried the Grand Lux in Miami, and it was nowhere near as good as this one. Definitely a hit!!!
