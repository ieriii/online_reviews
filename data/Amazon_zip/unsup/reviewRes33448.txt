It's like a buffet type place. You go and order what you want and pay for it after they prepare it for you. There's no waiters or anyone to pick up after you. But I'm going to assume that's part of the reason why the prices are so low. I would stay away from the salad bar only b/c I'm not exactly adventurous with things like that, and I know there's been many problems with bacteria and salad bars. BUT!!! Everything I've had there is really good. Especially the falafel. The taste is amazing and the sandwich is so good. Hummus is very fresh and yummy. The jerusalem salad is chucky and fresh. Last note when ordering a shawerma dinner get small cause that'll fill you up for sure.
