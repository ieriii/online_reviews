I love it here! Like many have said before, what is not to like about the free parking!!! That right there is a total plus. I have been here a few times, and every time I go I walk away with a really good feeling.  The first thing you see when you walk in is this guy that writes down names. It's a very good process because you don't wait more than 20 minutes. They call your name on the intercom after you had a glass of wine at the bar then they lead you into one of two very fun dining rooms. I love the room on the Halsted side of the street. The service is very good, however they are the best at making you buy extra things. How about an appetizer? How about more wine? Any coffee? Dessert? It doesn't end, but they always keep your water filled.  I always get the kebob. What is not to like about perfectly cooked meat with peppers and onions. There is something to be said about the rice and potato that comes with it. They are amazing! I love the potato and the sauce on the rice is delicious. The wine is cheap and the desserts are made from scratch. Highly recommended to take someone visiting or for a fun time.  P.S. You have to order the flaming cheese. You just must, trust me.
