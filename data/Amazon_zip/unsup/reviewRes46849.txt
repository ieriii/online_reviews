I've always really liked Uncommon Ground and have put up with their overpriced food since it's always been soooo good. Unfortunately tonight sent me over the edge and I don't plan to ever go back to this Uncommon Ground again. The pasta dish my BF ordered was ridiculously tiny for the $18 he spent. Five pieces of pasta with some grass on top doesn't constitute a meal, in my opinion. The mac & cheese I ordered was so overcooked, it tasted like hospital mush. I don't care if it has truffle in it - that doesn't make up for the rest of this $15 dish tasting like cheesy microwaved bread. I can get some of the best mac & cheese at Ditka's downtown for only $6 and I'd rather do that anyday over my experience tonight. Service was, as usual, awful as well. The waitress was snooty and unhelpful. And I'm sorry, but I just spent $70 and you're asking me to check in with the front desk to tell them we're done with our table because there are a lot of reservations? Ummmm...sure, especially since I already told you that we're going into the back room for the show and won't be near the front desk anytime soon. I'm typically really easy going and not overly picky about what I eat at restaurants, but this was extraordinarly disappointing. The prices are NOT worth the crap they serve. I have never felt ripped off after leaving a restaurant until tonight, and anyone considering going to eat here should seriously reconsider. Go to another local restaurant or the Wrigleyville Uncommon Ground, where I've had much better luck in the past.
