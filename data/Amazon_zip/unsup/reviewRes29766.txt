This place is my favorite neighborhood standby! It's off the beaten path and tucked into an unlikely setting within the gold coast. No tourists! I often come here for brunch with friends and linger for a few hours. The place can be quite busy for brunch but service is excellent. 3rd Coast is a much better version of similar types of eateries in Manhattan, without the rudeness or pretense! I highly recommend this place for almost any occasion.
