This guys make very good pizza. Very thin crust with just a little high quality toppings. My favorite is the proscuito and arugala. Awesome. Some of the pizzas have mozzarella di bufala. Very tasty. They make some good appetizers for those who dine in. The wait staff has always been friendly.  The only downside is the wait on a fri or sat night and the noise level. This is not a place for a quite night out unless it happens to be a Tue and even then, only marginal. The owner is very nice too.  Their huge wood burning oven, made with several kinds of Italian bricks and put together by Italian macons, is a wonder to see in and of itself.
