I went back and, boy, was my experience different from my last. Our server was like a pre-programmed robot. He really didn't have a good grasp of the wine list.  We had the chef's tasting menu again. Last time it was wonderful, this time, not so much. The courses came out too close together. Tapas should be spaced out and the meal should be an experience. I felt rushed and left way too full. I probably wont be back for food. The sangria was spot on though. Yum
