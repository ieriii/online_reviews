After a little discussion with a friend of mine about meeting up for brunch, she told me that one of her friend raved about this place and we should try it out..It was a Sunday at about 10am and very suprisingly no wait but the restaurant was already quite busy and we were put in a tiny table near the restroom/back door area.. It wasn't the best seat in the house obviously but at least we got a table..My friend ordered the pancakes with a side of scrambleeggs and i ordered the granola bowl.. The food was pretty good and pretty much satisfying for brunch although i would prefer more fruit for my granola and yogurt.. (it was hardly any fruit pieces in the bottom) but the "House Made" granola was amazing (just like many people have said on yelp).. The fresh squeezed orange juice was also good.I had to say I didn't expect much from this place considering all the bad reviews i read but it did pass... I give it a 3 stars coz I think if we had arrived 15 mins later than we did.. my overall experience would have been a complete opposite.. I would come back to try other things but would really recommend anyone to arrive early..
