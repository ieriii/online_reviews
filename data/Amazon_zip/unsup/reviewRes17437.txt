Absolutely one of the finest establishments in Chicago. Love the cocktails - lovingly handcrafted, tasty, and refined. I dream of being able to mix like the mixologists here. It is an oasis of excellence in a sea of mediocrity. One my first visit to VH I spent twenty minutes discussing the merits of several different types of bitters for a Manhattan (the drink by which I judge all others). How terrific is that? I've been to VH many times and always enjoy the experience. It is a place which requires attention to the cocktail and the conversation which will ensure with your companions. Perhaps I love it for the fact that you need to converse/discuss/interact with the people you are there with. The art of conversation is alive and well at the VH. But lets face it - they make an absolutely fantastic cocktail. And the cocktail remains the greatest civilizing force in the world. The room is wonderful, with most of the space being devoted to small, intimate tables with high backed chairs, making sure that your focus remains on your drinking partners, and not the scene around you. It's a place to converse, not to cruise. The seats at the bar are also terrific, as you can discuss/debate to merits of various drinks and ingredients with the knowledgeable staff. I remain in awe of the Zarzamora - combining both Bourbon and Fernet Branca - absolute genius! As one of the few Fernet Branca drinkers in Chicago (as far as I can tell) it was a revelation. In short - this is a wonderful place. It brings people together for conversation and sophisticated drinking. It is clearly a throwback and not for everyone. When I introduce friends to this place they are generally in awe, never having realized that this oasis of civility still exists in the modern day. Go, you will not be sorry (unless Hooters is your idea of a great drinking establishment).
