Piece offers "New Haven style" pizza and even credits this on the menu. Being from Connecticut, I totally appreciate the recognition. While Piece does serve their pizza just like they do at the most famous pizza place in Connecticut - Pepe's in New Haven, the taste doesn't quite match up. In any event, it was pretty good considering this pizza is thin crust in Chicago. I give Piece an A for its effort and relaxed atmosphere and a B for their own brewed beer...
