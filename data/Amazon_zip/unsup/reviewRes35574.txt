Today is a lucky day for you yelpers out there...the bubby is here to give his two cents. We had a fantastic date night this evening, starting at Sun Wah. We ordered the Peking Duck dinner (not on the menu) which consisted of 3 duck focused courses: soup, fried rice, and bao rolls. We were especially thrilled with the presentation: A "specialized cutter" rolls out the duck to remove the skin and meticulously slice chunks of duck meat for the bao stuffing.  They then remove the body of the duck and send it back to the kitchen where it is prepared for the soup and fried rice courses: Bubby: This being the first time I have had peking duck I was very impressed. The meat was succulent and extremely tasty, but the real treat was the skin. Mix in the plum sauce and some green onions on your bao (of which I could not stop eating) and you have a wonderful little sandwich. Don't forget to munch on the wings and legs, they're a dark meat lovers dream. And for the daring, the butt of the duck tastes better than it sounds so go a head and pop it in, it's worth the risk. The bubby's always been an ass man...
