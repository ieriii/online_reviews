I just joined Yelp this morning for the sole purpose of writing a review about Sunda and what a terrible experience I had there recently. 6 of us wanted to go there to enjoy drinks/dinner and were asked to leave, not in a nice way but in the rudest way ever by the most obnoxious waitress. Apparantly you can only get a table in the bar area if you are an "investor".Even if you are joining another party who has already spent $400 at that table, they weill tell you to leave. We probably also would have had a tab of several hundred dollars, instead we spent 0, left, will never return and will make sure none of our friends return either. I have been to restaurants all over the world and have NEVER been treated so poorly! This server should be fired! Telling nice, good paying customers to leave is beyond absurd. Who do you think you are Sunda?
