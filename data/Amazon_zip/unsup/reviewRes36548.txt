I would give Indie 3.5 Stars if I could. It's not amazing, but it's good. This location is close to my place, so it scores points for convenience. It's a small place, but very nicely decorated. They have cute little menus in these individual metal covers. Sushi is plated very decoratively. The waitresses here recommended the fried shrimp wraps for $7... pretty good. Seaweed salad was served in a martini glass with some masago. Very pretty and tastey. Sushi was regularly priced, pretty decent. We had three rolls and paid about $45 for three people. Not bad. Try their specialities, very yummy. Ask the waitress for sushi recommendations. They knew what was fresh and made very good recommendations. Very friendly and nice.  Didn't try any of their thai dishes so I can't comment on that. I would say this is a good place to head to when you have a craving for sushi but you have a friend who doesn't. Something for everyone. It's cute as a little date spot. BYOB keeps you safe financially. Don't expect the best sushi ever. Not for these prices and especially not this far away from the ocean. You're going to have to pay to transport fish that quickly out to these parts. No reason not to try this spot if you're close by. I'll definitely go back.
