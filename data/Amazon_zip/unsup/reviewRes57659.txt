This is the best AUTHENTIC Mexican Restaurant in the city.....hands down. If you are use to chain types like Chi-Chi or Pepe's Tacos...this is not for you. If you want to experience the TRADITIONAL and homemade foods try the guisados and tacos for starters...they are flavorful and authentically spiced and garnished. My family and friends have been coming here since the early 1970's and the food is still excellent and the service is average. At times, you get a small complementary taster plate of what they are cooking that day. The chips and salsas are good, the bathrooms need an upgrade and the quarry floors can get slippery when its crowed. They take CASH ONLY but its cheap and fast and you can BYOB! Loaded with locals and students...still the best in Chi-Town.
