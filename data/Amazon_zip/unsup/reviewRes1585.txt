Outstanding! My first experience at Hot Doug's was nearly 3 years ago, on a cold (45-degree), rainy November day. And the line stretched all the way around to the back of the building! Standing in line was an experience unto itself as groups of complete strangers would huddle under umbrellas. Myself and two friends somehow shared my gold umbrella with about 4 other people. Once inside the sights and smells were incredible. The Specials Board was just so overwhelming, and so incredible that it took well over a year before I ever touched anything on the regular menu. The duck fat fries alone are worth giving Hot Doug's 5 stars. That first day I tried to order a large drink but Doug (and Yes that is Doug) told me and my friends to get small drinks because there are free refills. That alone would have made me come back again, even if the food had been sub par. I could go on and on about this place, but there aren't enough 1's and 0's in cyberspace to hold all the data. Go for yourself and decide for yourself. Oh yeah, you can check out the specials in advance at his websie, http://www.hotdougs.com. And finally, if you like spicey, the Andouille Sausage is probably the best thing you will ever have at Hot Dougs. In fact, I rate it as the best hot dog/sausage that I have ever had.
