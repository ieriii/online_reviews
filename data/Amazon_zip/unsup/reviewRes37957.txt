I have been to Pizzeria Uno and Due and they are great but seem a little more "chain restaurant-ish" so we wanted to try out another famous pizza place. As many other reviews state there is a long wait. My party of 4 waited almost an hour on a monday night around 7PM. If the rating system was just on the taste of food I would give it a 5. The stuffed pizza was amazing and not greasy. It was packed with cheese and the crust was flaky and filled with goodness. The down side of this place is the wait (which was expected) but the way the wait was experienced. They tell you to place your order while you are waiting and it is supposed to speed up the time when you are at the table. the girl we "pre-ordered" with reminded me of the soup nazi from Seinfield.  The other down side is the amount of food we wasted. there was just 4 of us and we ordered 2 Medium Pizza's. As this was our first time there it would have been nice for them to mention 2 smalls would have been fine or maybe 1 large. between the 4 of us we ended up eating just one pizza and had a whole other left over. we did make good use of it and packed it up for a homeless man which was sitting around the corner (he was very very appreciative). the bill for 4 without drinks came to 60 dollars. beers were 5+ so for a pizza place it can be a costly evening.  It's one of those places you HAVE TO TRY but probably wont go back to.
