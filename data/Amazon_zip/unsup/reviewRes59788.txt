I would say Art of Pizza is right up there with Giordano's as the best pizza in the city. My friends and I ordered 3 pizzas between 8 of us and barely finished off two. You definitely get your money's worth with the large pizzas. Also check our their lunch/dinner specials because they are definitely a good deal. I would suggest the Wednesday chicken parmigiana.
