I've been meaning to try this place for years. Actually I didn't know what "this place" was; what I should say is that I've been meaning to try "that place on Argyle with all the hanging ducks" for years. The last game I worked on as an artist took place in a Hong Kong marketplace; I took photos of this place as reference so I could get the hanging roasted ducks just right. It was my finest moment in the video game industry. Anyways, we finally tried it. Look, here's the deal: They got ducks in the window. Every Yelper seems to say "Try the duck!" So I'm not going in and asking them to whip up their finest Empress Chicken. The five stars I give it are based on the full Beijing Duck meal. It rocked my world, as well as that of my awesome friend I was eating with. It was enough for four but we decided to splurge. So, yeah, either get the duck or don't whine about your beef and broccoli. The duck: perfectly crisp skin, perfectly succulent meat. Not a hint of gaminess. The duck drumstick from Sun Wah is like the Platonic archetype of a drumstick. All the courses are great - the skin and meat on a bun with veggies, the soup and the fried rice. Just ridiculously good. If you don't call ahead, there is a bit of a wait for the full duck meal, but that's pretty typical. They have to chase the duck around with a cleaver, you see, and the duck has all sorts of clever ways of turning the tables on the furious, thick-skulled chef. No, wait, that was some cartoon I saw once. Our waitress reminded me of a young Jennifer Tilly. Not that there's anything wrong with the current Jennifer Tilly! Stone fox at every stage of her career. She can hold my Texas anytime! I don't even know what that means.
