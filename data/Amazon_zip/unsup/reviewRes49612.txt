Turns out F212 is closed so we made a second visit here yesterday after dinner. This time a voyage to the bar for drinks and dessert, its not very intimate for a wine place but this is in the heart of tourist (suburbanite) trap central so that is probably not the objective... music was cool though. The smallish little wine store in front is a nice touch and they have more flights then I have seen anywhere!! everything from sexy reds, to international potpourri. The dessert was fine, cant really get a ganache wrong... and they served me a cappuccino in a pretty large coffee mug?? The times I have eaten off the real menu I was satisfied but it runs on the expensive side comparatively. I would take you out of town friends and business guests.
