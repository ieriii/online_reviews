I went to Meli for brunch a few weeks ago with some friends, and I was disappointed. My husband really wanted to try it because of the fresh juices, but he was disappointed when he found out the pomegranate juice is just Pom. As far the food, I've definitely had better. Portions are huge but food is just ok, nothing you couldn't get somewhere else. Also the prices are exorbitant--I'd rather pay less for smaller portions, since I'm not a fan of leftover breakfast-type foods and half my portion went to waste. We were rushed out as soon as we were finished eating, and there wasn't even much of a wait at that point. I doubt I will be back.
