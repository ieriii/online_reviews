I went to Gilt this past Saturday after a fundraiser at The Tile Gallery. My friends and I walked in around 11:30 and initially tried to get in to the downstairs area, but it was full. It looked like fun though! Then we headed back upstairs and tried to stake out a booth. We found a larger party headed out almost immediately. Our waitress stopped by within a minute or so and inquired about whether or not we had a reservation. (We were all fairly intoxicated as a result of the open bar fundraiser, so it never crossed our minds that we would need to wait our turn. Oops.) We said no, that we'd found the table on our own, but she was more than willing to serve us -- perhaps because we were a party of 9 ready to continue drinking! I had a glass of house wine for $4.00, and I was pleasantly surprised at the price. I didn't even bother looking at a menu and just assumed it would be around $6-$8. It was nice to save a few bucks! No one ordered food, but I did take a look at the menu online this morning and I am looking forward to going back and trying some of it! All in all, we had a great time. Half of the party stayed until closing at 2am. The atmosphere made it great. (My friend described it as a cross between a gastropub and a speak easy. Looking at their website that seems to be the vibe they are going for!) None of us wanted to go dancing. We were looking for an intimate atmosphere to hang out and catch up, and Gilt Bar delivered exactly what we wanted. Next time I'll make a reservation and eat some food. :)
