I read great things about Irazu, so I was very eager to go, and decided to put up with the HOUR-long wait. Although the atmosphere is fun and friendly, the food itself was underwhelming. My friend and I were sure to get the oatmeal shake, and the waiter's favorites, but we left unimpressed. I'm glad I tried it out, but I wouldn't stand to compete with the other hungry patrons for a table again.
