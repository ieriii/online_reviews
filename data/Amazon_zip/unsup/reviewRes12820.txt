Came here for a light dinner with a friend and had a wonderful time. The food was delicious. I wasn't too hungry so I just wanted an appetizer. The server's recommendation was the spinach quesadilla; I usually don't order quesadillas because they're generally ho-hum, but this was terrific. It was rolled rather than folded and was sitting in a pool of really tasty salsa. The margaritas were tasty too--not too sweet, very refreshing. The ambience was very laid-back and comfortable. I would definitely go back! Just wish it were closer to home!
