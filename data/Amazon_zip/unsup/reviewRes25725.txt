I was craving a good sandwich but had to stay home waiting for the cable guy. I ordered the lemongrass tofu banh mi for delivery. My order did not hit the spot. Instead of fresh bread that's slightly crispy filled with yummy ingredients, I got a chewy piece of stale bread stuffed with flavorless tofu. Even adding Siracha didn't help the poor sandwich. Maybe the 1.5 hour delivery time hurt the bread's freshness but nothing could have helped the tofu.
