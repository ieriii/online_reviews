Love at fish sight. The West Coaster in me misses fresh fish. A lot. Glenn's hits the spot with its huge, fresh fish selection, laid-back atmosphere (who says eating fish must always be at a chi-chi place?) and reasonable prices. I had the Columbia River Sturgeon, and it was thick, substantial, and delicious. Clam chowder was great and full of clams (hey, that's pretty uncommon). If you're getting both, like I did, I'd suggest the sturgeon w/o the cream sauce--after two servings of creaminess I felt like a dairy cow). I believe there's some kind of early-bird special for $14.95, but I forget the times--call to check. Best part: when you give your name to the waitress, they take down your cell number so you can go get a coffee or walk around instead of hovering next to the door waiting for your table. Awesomeness.
