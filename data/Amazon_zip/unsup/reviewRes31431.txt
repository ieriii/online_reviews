My go-to spot for an always delicious meal. My partner and I frequent the chi diner about 1-4 times a month and each time is a delight. Wonderful atmosphere and a lovely wait staff.  I have had the cookbook since high school and was so excited to finally eat at the restaurant when I moved to Chicago. Veg foodie bliss. This is also a must on my 'places to bring out of town guests.'  I typically order the the radical reuben with a side of sweet potato fries. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. The swirled rye bread is always toasted to perfection, the vegan thousand island is yum sauce, and the seitan melts in my mouth. The sweet potato fries are sweet and savory, just as they should be. Honestly, one of my favorite meals of all time. Other top notch items are: -kale salad -nachos -hot "wings" -country fried 'steak' -bbq 'ribs' sandwich -vegan shakes
