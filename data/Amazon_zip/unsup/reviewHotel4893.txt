Pros - location, shower (walk-in rain shower), free breakfast, friendly service, comfy bed, modern amedities. Cons - thin walls, hallway noise (doors slamming), WIFI would not fully connect, housekeeping (I arranged for a late checkout, yet they still knocked and asked).I would definitely recommend the Dana hotel and return when I visit Chicago again.
