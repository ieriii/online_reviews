I normally like to put a lot of thought and time into my reviews, but there's not a lot to say about Crisp. The chicken is absolutely wonderful if you're in the mood for Asian-inspired flavorful fried chicken. If you like subtle flavors, this won't be something you enjoy, however.  The Korean dishes are fine and fill a niche needed (quick Korean takeout), but certainly not special.  Go have the chicken. You'll like it.
