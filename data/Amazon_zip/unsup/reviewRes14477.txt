Ok the food is fantastic! Bacon popcorn and the smoke house burger are fucking delicious! The beers are great too. I think I liked the Bottom Up Belgian Wit the best. Though the Coup D'Etat is sort of like La Fin Du Monde, which is also tasty. I'm going back again for sure. What is my complaint that I give it four instead of five? The fucking long wait! I understand it's just beginning but it annoys me, especially with this place because of the gentrification that is happening with Logan Square. I hate to come off as one of the douche bags saying that kind of stuff, but it blows when you've got families from the suburbs, with their little kids, and ass wipes from Lincoln Park or Wrigleyville. The building is perfect for this place, a spot that you're not really going to find anyplace else in the city. As much as I didn't like it when Logan had nothing to do in it, I still just get annoyed that it's going to become the next Bucktown. But still, none the less, the place is great. Really fucking good. Check it out. Deal with the two hour long wait, maybe show up late afternoon. It's worth it to try it once like this.
