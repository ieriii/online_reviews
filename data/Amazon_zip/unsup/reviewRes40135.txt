i appreciate what longman and eagle does - local/seasonal food - but i think it's a little over-rated. i went for lunch and had the pork belly blt. it was pretty fatty tasting - perhaps that's the way it's supposed to be. but i typically love pork belly and felt like this was over the top. i did love the tomato jam though. i just don't really enjoy service that seems to be intentionally too cool. the atmosphere is pretty good but the two times i've been i left smelling like a hamburger. i'm just trying to understand why it l&e got a michelin star. i'll have to go back and try a few other things to really get it i guess. hope this review doesn't end up on a postcard!
