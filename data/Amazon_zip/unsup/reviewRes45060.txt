Not bad. While it was nearly 10PM, the place was packed on a weeknight. The kitchen closed at 10PM so we were cutting it close, but the waitstaff still received us with warm smiles and friendly service. The intimate space was relatively plain inside; stained glass windows and vintagey wood (distressed and faded) made for a rustic Italian feel ... unlike the modern spot across the street with their dim lighting and fire places. This felt like eating in a country kitchen. The crowd must've been there for a while judging by the loudness (e.g. drunkenness) of their conversation. The bar, which seated about 5 comfortably, was empty, but cute in the middle of the room. Ordered small plates: asparagus & ricotta ravioli, butter, parmigiano ($11); grilled octopus, potatoes, red onion, chilis, parsley, lemon, olive oil ($9); marinated olives, garlic, orange, chilis ($4); and the arugula, extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, shaved parmigiano reggiano cheese ($6). The food came quickly and was fresh, not just thrown together as some last meals of the evening can be. The ravioli needed a kick. The rich sauce clung nicely to the pasta (although it could've been more velvety, less buttery -- perhaps it broke and was saved?), but the bland dish offered very little flavor besides cheesy and buttery. The octopus was a little chewy from being a tad over grilled, but still it was flavorful. I just sopped up the extra olive oil with the fresh bread that was brought to the table to start. The greens were crisp, the parm freshly shaved, and the dressing light. The pepper mill gave it a nice crunch. Loved the salad. I ordered a specialty drink, something like basil and vodka with lemon. It was relatively uneventful, though the combination had so much promise. There were others on the list, something with vodka and rosemary, that I really want to try. The prices were good, so I'll return at a more reasonable hour. I might even need reservations.
