Been wanting to check out Purple PIg ever since I saw it on Check Please. The wait...was SO worth it! To spare the time & agony of parking, W & I took the L over there. We arrived around 9:30pm & the place was bumpin. Venue looked much smaller than I expected, and since it was a party of 2, we got seated by chef's table. Didn't mind seating per se, but we asked to be seated a bit farther in a booth. Servers were attentive and accommodating. The chef was working hard along with his father. We started off with a nice glass of Prosecco; light, dry w/a hint of sweetness. Perfect pair to go along with the fatty meals to be consumed. Small plates : * Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg      ---- My fav! I love the fried egg on top and the fried pig's ear...wow. The flavor was incredible. The whole dish had a slight asian feel to it. * Pork neck bone gravy w/Calabro ricotta     ---- Thick oven toasted bread w/creamy, buttery blend of gravy. We asked for more bread & licked the plate clean. Impressed. * Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/Mashed Potatoes    ------ This was the HIGHLIGHT of my night. Reminded me of korean braised short rib. The pork shoulder was so tender, and the gravy that came w/mashed potatoes was superb. Not too heavy, not too salty. We asked for a side of gravy and more bread..and they happily gave us both :) * Morcilla w/Apples, watercress, and apple saba    ----- Like Korean Soondae.      Blood pork sausages with thinly sliced apples w/sauteed watercress. It was ok. Meat wasn't as juicy, and the herbs were a bit overwhelming in this dish. All in all, the small plate concept was brilliant coz it allowed us to enjoy the different parts of pork in small, itty bitty morsels. We chatted w/Chef Jimmy Jr & praised him for delicious meal. Next time, I wanna try Roasted Bone Marrow w/herbs and Pork Saltimbocca w/Rainbow Swiss chard. This place lived up to its hype & I will be back soooner than later. Cheese, Swine, & Wine. Oink!
