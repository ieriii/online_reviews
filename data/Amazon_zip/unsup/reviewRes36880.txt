Kitty-corner from the Edgewater Branch of the Chicago Public Library, this place doesn't seem to have a lot of curb appeal to lure in passersby, but it is well worth the adventure of discovering someplace new. I was hungry for some sushi and I have been curious about this place for several months now, so I made a trip and was delighted with the food. I ordered the spicy tuna rolls as kind of an appetizer and then an entree of chicken, vegetables and rice with a smoked chili sauce over it. Both were better than I was expecting. I'm not sure what I was expecting, exactly, but this was comparable to some of my favorite thai and/or sushi places. I haven't tried anything else off their menu, so I can't say everything is spectacular, but what I ordered was tasty and of good quality. The staff was nice, the seating was a little cramped, but when I was there, only about four other people were there, too. I can see how if it was busy, you might feel like you were sitting with the people at the tables on either side of you. Not such a bad thing, though. It looked like they have another seating area besides the area I was in and it might be a little more spacious.   The spicy tuna rolls were about $5 or $6, the entree was $8 or $9 and I got some thai iced coffee (okay, but nothing to write home about) for another $2. The tax was a couple dollars too and with a tip, I ended up spending about $23. On just me. I ate everything and didn't feel super full...I was able to walk out as opposed to rolling and I'm not that big. (170 lbs, 5'10"). So hopefully that gives you insight into what you might expect to pay if you go there. It's not an "Oh, I'm so hungry and need something cheap to eat right now!" kind of place, but it is relatively inexpensive.  Anyway, the point is: This place is worth going to. There's a lot more on the menu than just sushi. And it's BYOB.  Go check it out.
