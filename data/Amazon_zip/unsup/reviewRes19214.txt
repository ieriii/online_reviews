Food: 2 Decor: 2 Service: 3 I came here with three friends for dinner around 8pm after walking around Grant Park. We made a reservation on Opentable a few earlier beforehand. 1. Octopus http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Disappointing. Octopus was too tough, chewy, and bland, greens were yellow, and the entire dish just failed to come together. 2. Duck http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Not bad. Duck was cooked well, especially the piece of leg confit. However, the apricot sauce was way too sweet, and it didn't complement the dish well at all. Greens were overly bitter. Service was mediocre. Server didn't get our orders after bringing drinks, and he just disappeared. Total was about $65 after tax/tip. Needless to say, it wasn't worth it at all.
