You should: 1) take note of the negative reviews here, which I agree with, and 2) carefully ask your nice waiter exactly which menu items are Vietnamese, French or fusion? Yes, the service and the decor are excellent, but the food seems more Chinese/Thai, and less Vietnamese, and not at all French, and the high prices make you expect something which you're not getting. The conscientious owner should go herself to other Vietnamese and French restaurants to taste what they are preparing for their patrons.
