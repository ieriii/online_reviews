Cafe 28 has GREAT food. The ambiance is very nice. The service is pretty good. But my experience at this restaurant is usually compromised because they don't accept reservations. Almost every damn time I go to Cafe 28 I end up waiting 30-45 minutes in the overcrowded bar area. It's maddening! I highly recommend you try this restaurant for their great food. The ropa vieja and taste of cuba appetizer are particularly good. But I also recommend you avoid it on Friday and Saturday evenings if you don't want to wait.
