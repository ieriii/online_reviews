I wonder if they changed the owner or they've decided they dun care about food quality anymore. I've been a loyal customer for many years and recently found that not only they raised the price (understandable) but at the same time put less food on the bowl. Ok, fine. Economy is tough but please at least keep up with the quality. I never thought I will write a bad review but this time I was so disappointed. I ordered the #40, Beef noodles soup combination w/ sliced beef, well done brisket, well done flank, soft tendon, bible tripe, meat ball. Guess what I found in the bowl. one piece of each ingredient listed. WTF. since when food become so expensive that you can only afford to put one piece per item in the bowl???? that's a total rip off. And they change the noodle too...something thicker and taste "cheaper" than what they used previous. The beef soup used to use excellent but now i'm super thirsty and got a bad headache from it and I knew they put tons of MSG in it. I really hope they changed. I used to LOVE their noodles. please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
