My friends and I were starving in our dorms on a cold winter late night and were desperately trying to find good food to eat, and 7-11 couldn't provide us with that. After searching the interwebs, we found a number for Sushi X and called. The prices were a bit high but we were hungry, they delivered, and they had MOCHI ICE CREAM!!! which all three of us adore. So, we went ahead and told the order to the lady over the phone, and gave her our address. At that moment, she said: "Oh, I'm sorry, you're out of our delivery range". I almost cried! I told my friends and they groaned with exasperation- which the woman must have noted because she then said "hold on, i'll see what I can do" and convinced the delivery guy to deliver to us. We obviously tipped him very generously- an order that totaled to $120 for 3 people! Upon receiving the food, we were already impressed by the fancy translucent, minimalist packaging. The sushi... was amazing. We each ordered the honey roll, and I also ordered a godzilla roll- all of which were decadent, and surprisingly fresh. The coffee mochi ice cream I ordered was also amazing! Alhough I've only ordered from here once (since they can't technically deliver to my area), I plan on going to the restaurant quite a bit!
