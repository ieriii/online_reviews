Before attending a Pixies reunion show at the Aragon Ballroom, I found myself craving food. Imagine my delight when I found Demera, a cozy Ethiopian restaurant with a friendly neighborhood vibe just up the street from the Aragon. Being vegetarian, I asked the server for menu recommendations and she pointed me to the vegetarian messob, which offers a sampling of the vegetarian dishes. I went with the beyanetu for one--for $15, you get a sample of every vegetarian offering on the menu. It's a lot of food, and might be better if shared with someone; but so delicious! The injera bread is so tasty, and I enjoyed the many flavors in the sampler. I also tried the Ethiopian tea, which was spicy and enjoyable. When I mentioned to my server that I was seeing the Pixies, she told me that I'd get $5 off my meal for showing my ticket or ticket stub for any show at the Riv or the Aragon. This apparently applies to all purchases over $10. So keep that in mind if you're going to a show nearby! Close to public transportation (The Lawrence stop on the Red Line), which I would recommend over trying to find street parking, which can be tough to find in the uptown neighborhood.
