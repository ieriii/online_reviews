My wife and I have wanted to try this for a few weeks but it's always TOO DAMN BUSY!!!!!!!!!!! My wife had a burger and I had the fish and chips, after the cheese plate appetizer. The burger came out the wrong temp but was quickly rectified. My fish and chips was perfect. the cheese plate was amazing, lots of unique tastes on the plate for us. We had the Pale ale and the IPA, both were amazing. Great atmosphere and a pleasantly curious selection of artisional flavors, from plate to glass. We like this place. Matt was our server. Tip well, he's worth every penny!
