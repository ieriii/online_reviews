Food was good, but nothing that sets Anteprima apart from the myriad neighborhood Italian places in Chicago.We will not go back. We showed up 10min early for a 9pm reservation. The place was buzzing--always a good sign late on Sunday evening--and as a result they were "running 10-15min behind". No problem--10-15min is a wash--but by the time we got seated it was almost 10pm. Kitchen was winding down so it was 10:30+ before food arrived.Orechiette were nicely al dente but the lamb sausage was lukewarm and very oily. Calamari was also on the cool side and somewhat underdone, although the fregola/peas mix made up for it. OK, let the average food slide but, note to server: please, no attitude when telling me "We don't do fettucine here".
