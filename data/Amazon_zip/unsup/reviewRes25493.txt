I really like how their is an upstairs eating space area. Parking is never really issue for this restaurant. During the day, I am always warmly greeted at the door. My absolute favorite item here is the tequilla pollo chicken sandwich, which is accompanied by a cold, garlic potato salad. I am normally not a fan of potato salads, but theirs makes you think differently. I absolutely love their small, chewy almond cookies! Their collection of desserts is always cut to the right size. I have tried several of their fruit mousse cakes, which are priced reasonably and not too sweet.
