Frontera was good. The food was good. The service was good. The ambiance was good. But that's really all I can say. It was all good. Nothing exceptional or particularly noteworthy. Don't get me wrong, I'll go again to continue sampling the menu, but given all the rave reviews, inability to make reservations and multi-hour long waits to get a table, I thought I'd be peeing my pants with excitement as I ate! Alas, I enjoyed my meal (I had the Pescado en Pipian de Almendra)... but as I left the restaurant, I didn't have that excitement level that I had expected. I do respect what Rick Bayliss can do with a chili, and the presentation and flavors in my dish were very enjoyable. Perhaps I need to go back and sample a wider variety of items to see if my opinion changes. I definitely think Frontera is a worthwhile restaurant, but I would most certainly not waste more than 45 minutes of my time waiting for a table. There are just too many other great restaurants in the area!
