The interior design is very nice, classy looking. Sort of upscale like hidden behind a more so industrial door. Because of it being that type of place, there was a wait to get in. And from what I've heard there's also the idea that you do have to dress at a certain level, wearing collared shirts and no jeans. However I was with a bunch of people who got in dressed as typical bicyclists with a jacket on. That's fine and all but the whole time I was there, the waitress didn't get a single one of my drinks right. She either forgot it or just gave me the wrong thing completely. For paying as much as these drinks cost I feel like they should be done correctly. I also don't really like how you're not supposed to be standing at the bar. At some point I'll probably go back again to see if I like it any better, because it does seem like I just ran into a bad time there.
