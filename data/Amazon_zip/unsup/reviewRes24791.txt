Love this place. I only give it 4 stars because although I've been there close to 10 times, I can't bring myself to order anything besides the Pepito. Great steak sandwich wtih beans, cheese, Lizano sauce and I like to throw an avocado in there. All this for $5 and the place is BYOB as well. Highly recommend this spot for a casual dinner.
