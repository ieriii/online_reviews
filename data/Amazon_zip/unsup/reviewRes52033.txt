Gino's was our second stop for deep dish while visiting Chicago. Comparing it to LM's, I'd have to say their sausage was tastier than Malnati's, but that's about it. When it was cut, it spilled out all over the place, whereas Malnati's kept it's shape and contents. The crust was yellowish, so there's something unique in there, it was thicker, heavier, and thicker, but I'd have to imagine if you took leftovers home and tried to reheat this pie, the crust would be as hard as a brick. The sauce was a little acidic for my taste, and the amount of cheese was perfect. I just like a sweeter sauce and a bit softer crust. The graffiti signatures on the inside from all their visitors was really cool, and I believe upon reading one of the signatures it said "I was stupid enough to pay $3 for a marker to sign this." So, judging by that, I think they sell markers that you can use to mark up the walls with you name and date of visit. Really easy to get to off Michigan Avenue. We arrived about 1130am, and the wait started getting longer and longer. They do have it down pretty good though as far as moving people along, unlike LM's. You wait outside briefly, then inside on the bench, then possibly upstairs and meet another host who will seat you. It's a good flow!
