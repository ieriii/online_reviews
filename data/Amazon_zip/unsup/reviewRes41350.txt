Excellent food at an awesome value. Great place to warm up and get some hot Pho during winter in Chicago. If you are not looking for Pho, there are plenty of other items on the lengthy menu you can try. Pho Xe Tang offers more selection than most Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. The food was lightning quick and the broth was tasty, light and not too sweet. They also came in a pretty big portion. Will have to try other stuff on their menu next time I visit. This is a type of place for getting something quick to eat then get out. It is not a place to enjoy the ambiance because there isn't any. The restaurant is pretty crowd around lunch time but you should not have problem getting seated unless you come in a very big group. If you are looking for authentic comfort food and don't mind hole-in-the-wall restaurant, check out Pho Xe Tang on Argyle.
