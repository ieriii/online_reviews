At the time of the writing of this review there are currently 176 reviews for Alliance. Therefore, I'm keepin' this short.  Great little bakery and coffee shop. I've mostly purchased the cupcakes. Nice, heavy, sweet buttercream frosting. When fresh, the cupcakes are heavy and moist. They are usually delicious but I don't think they are baked fresh everyday.Therefore, sometimes they are a *little* dry. That's what the one star subtraction is for.  Coffee is excellent.
