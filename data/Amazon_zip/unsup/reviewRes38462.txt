I was introduced to this bar 2 years ago and I've been a fan ever since! At first sight the place looks small, but there is a whole other section in back for dining and i think there's a patio, although I've never been back there. And on the weekends, the upstairs is open for a little more space. The place is always packed, whether it's a Friday or a Tuesday! It's a little hard to get through the crowd and there is no room to wait for a table or a barstool so it gets uncomfortable after a few minutes of people constantly bumping into you, but if you can find a spot to stand for a little bit, the wait is worth it. Everytime I go to HopLeaf I like to try something new and it's possible to do so because there are so many options! And the bartenders are great about letting you try something if you're unsure of the description. A lot of times I just describe the kind of beer I want or I'll say I want something like another beer I've had there that I really enjoyed. They always find me a new beer that's great, even if it's after 1 tasting or 5! I finally got talked into a beer from Three Floyd's called Zombie Dust, i guess it's been around for a while, but I never tried it and it's definitely in my top 5 now! The food is also amazing! The last few times I've ordered the Duck Reuben and fries (with the mayo, OmG so good) and also get the mussels to share. I am never disappointed when i'm here!
