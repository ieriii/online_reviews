I have to say I've been to a majority of the steakhouses in chicago. Gibson's, Morton's, Wildfire, Kinze street, lawry's., Ruths Chris...well, you get the idea. I think Mastros is not any better (actually a little less flavorful) than the formentioned restaurants.  It is WAY overpriced. I am not opposed to paying big bucks for a great meal, but there was nothing special here. Pretty pretentious. The music in the bar is very good with a piano player and singer. I would stop in for a drink and listen to the music, but that's all I could probably afford. One drink.
