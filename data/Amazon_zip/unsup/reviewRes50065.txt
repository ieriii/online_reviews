I'm just ok with Fifty/50. It's really quite loud. The food is pretty meh. The crowd can be too. The limited amount of bathroom stalls drive me insane. The overall set up feels very narrow and at times cramped. Redeeming qualities include outdoor tv's on the patio (hello baseball season), strong drinks, and kind/awesome waitstaff.
