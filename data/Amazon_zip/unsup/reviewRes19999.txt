You've seen the line. You've heard the buzz. You've paid the $12 for the sandwich. And... It was good! But not amazing... Really, very tasty sandwiches. I had the bbq goat and my friend had the bbq pork. After all the hype I may have had my expectations a little too high. My friend also had the churros and hot chocolate and said they were very mediocre... Good, but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was great, staff was super friendly, and I would go again if someone invited me, but this is definitely not on my short list of must-eat Chicago restaurants.
