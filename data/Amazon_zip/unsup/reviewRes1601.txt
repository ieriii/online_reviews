Uhm, foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with foie gras mouse, truffle aioli and sel gris? Who has ever heard of this before? No one, really, but man, Doug was smart and brave enough to provide this, and it is good! I mean, really, any foie gras duck is treated better than the best treated battery farmed chicken which many americans eat multiple times a week. As before, coming on a weekday (well Monday-Thursday) outside of prime lunch hours will be wise, but it is very delicious!
