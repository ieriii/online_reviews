This is more like a 3.5 I really love Greek food and there's a great Greek place where I grew up in Santa Cruz, CA called Vasili's (vasili's uses braised lamb in the gyros and they make the best thickest tzatziki I've ever had). I compare all other Greek places to Vasili's and nothing in Chicago's Greek town can even compare to Vasili's. So to be fair, Greek Islands is very tasty but still not as amazing as Vasili's. We have eaten here a few times. I usually order the moussaka or the spanakopita. My husband usually gets an gyro or a braised lamb shank. We usually order the grilled octopus or the tzatziki as a starter. Everything is always tasty. Service is good and pretty fast too. I really have no complaints...it's just not Vasili's.
