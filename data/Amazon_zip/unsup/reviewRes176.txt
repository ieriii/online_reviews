mmmmm.... my favorite course: winter in new hampshire (I want to still be eating that snow) balloon (the greatest piece of candy anyone has ever given me) seafood bites (the mussel, razor clam, and crab were the best bites of those items I have ever had) my complaint: i wish I took my time more. they didn't rush me of course. I just wish I slowed down a bit. haha... there are so many amazing things happening. the only solution is to do it again soon... big surprises: an amazing person to walk us through the wine pairings. truly talented. there is nothing else to say that has not been said. I read every blog I could get my hands on before going. i know how well documented this meal is. still... I was in awe the entire time. talented team. thank you. hope to see you again soon, in a different season.
