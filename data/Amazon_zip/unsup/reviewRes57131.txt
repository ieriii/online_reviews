For a place this pricey I would expect great service. The workers here feel like they are better than everyone.... at least that was my experience. If I'm paying then you shouldn't act all snobby. The second time I went it was for a friends celebration... not by choice and I was hoping I would have a better experience.... nope! The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because they have an awesome mezcal margarita and the food is actually pretty good.
