I have visited Le Colonial several times over the last 15 years. It's a great little restaurant to unwind for a relaxing lunch and drink, for special dinner or for a date. The decor is French Colonial with elegant white table cloths and curtains. The atmosphere always neat and cozy and the food excellent with fantastic flavors without being overpowering or greasy. i started with Pho Oxtail soup which was phenomenal. I loved the raviolis (appetizer) in the light seafood sauce with lemongrass and a slight anise flavor. Wonderful wine selection made my dining experience even better. i can not wait to go back ...
