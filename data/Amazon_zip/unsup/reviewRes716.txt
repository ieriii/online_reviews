This was a highly anticipated meal for us. My aunt loves this place and I was excited that we got a reservation. First, I wanted to take a big party there, but the host who spoke to my wife was rude and belittling. He lectured her and just made her uncomfortable. We had a pretty tight schedule, so he informed us that how can we even consider eating there the same night we arrive in Chicago. You want to bring some children too, not at their place.  This still didn't discourage us from eating here during the only free evening we had and without the kids.  The food was good and the presentation was impressive. There are quite a few tricks that enhanced the eating experience. But just like foam and air, the first few times was impressive, but after a while, I think it just there without adding to the meal. I think it is a good place, but not was impressed. I wished they have a full bar also.
