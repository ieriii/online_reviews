Most of the food I would give 5 stars to but a few things prevented. We made a reservation about 2 months prior & still had to come in at 5:30pm which is a little early for me. We ordered a sampler appetizer platter ($8.50 p/p) that was just average for it's price and to much like any other Mexican restaurant with a few exceptions. Frontera has some of the best Salsa & sold all over the states so why they don't give it to you as included doesn't make sense to me. You can buy it as an appetizer & they give you like 2 Tbsp. The entrees however are are mostly fabulous. I ordered the Leg of lamb that was fall off the bone heaven. The Mole sauce is the best you will ever have. This is not your average Mexican restaurant. If you have not been, than you need to go. I also made my reservation for Topolobampo (another Rick Bayless restaurant) next store that evening.
