My meal here was just short of outstanding. I flew in from L.A. and my flight had landed much earlier than expected and with lighter traffic than usual as well, I arrived to the restaurant almost 2 hours early and they were still able to easily accommodate us. The hostess was one of the friendliest girls I've ever met and our server was a pretty lady rocking some tattoos (awesome). I've been wanting to try this place for so long, I could barely contain myself when I got the menu and ordered 6-7 things for my sister and me. Though none of it was considered forgettable, I actually only remember a few spectacular things. First, the fresh pork rinds were so so so so good. Hot, fresh, crispy and still slightly crackling with that savory powder sprinkled all over it. Perfection.. really. The charcuterie plate had all sorts of goodies and though my sister thought a lot of it looked questionable (as it should!) she still tried a bite of everything and went back for a second serving. The waitress was also very helpful in selecting beers and now we both have a new favorite cherry beer as well as very fond memories of this place. The only complaint I had was the dessert being a little overly sweet and pretty underwhelming but it didn't tarnish my meal at all. I love you Paul Kahan.
