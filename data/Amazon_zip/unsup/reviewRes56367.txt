5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I cannot rate this place highly enough. Simply it has simply won my heart over. After passing this place on the street several times I decided to try it, but not dine-in or delivery. I had a party on Saturday and thought I'd give this place a shot since they advertised that they catered. I called in and Tuan the manager on the phone was more than accommodating in taking my order, got the necessary information and that was it! Less than 10 minutes on the phone to order a huge catering menu for my party.When asked if I have tried the food before I replied no and he asked If I could come in and try a small sampling of everything I ordered. So I did and it was amazing as I imagined. So comes the day of catering and the food came promptly, hot and ready to be served. As for the food? We ordered nearly a little of everything on the menu. Overall, this is a great place with great prices and friendly people. I'll definitely look at working with them again in the future for more of my or my friend's catering needs.
