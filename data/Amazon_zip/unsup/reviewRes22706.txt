Two words - TONY'S CHICKEN! It's also referred to as "Chicken Crack". It's the perfect mix of crispy, fried chicken bites in a spicy-sweet sauce with sauteed garlic and jalapenos. It's so delicious! I have also tried their Ma Po tofu, which was good, but next time I will ask them to add ground pork to it for extra flavor. Their salt-and-pepper green beans are the best. I also recommend their *spicy* pork and squid noodles. Their menu is HUGE, and it's very authentic. Be adventurous and try something from the "very-chinese" portion of the menu :) The service isn't great, but we come here for the fantastic food.
