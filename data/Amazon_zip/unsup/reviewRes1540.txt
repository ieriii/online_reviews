What is left to say that hasn't already been said? Here are the highlights: - $9 duck sausage topped with foie gras and sauternes sauce. Quite frankly, the best sausage I've ever had. - Insanely delicious french fries, duck fat or regular. - A timeline of encased meat "history" on the wall. A true work of art. I planned for a year to get to this place on our recent cross-country road trip and I was not disappointed. We stood on line for 45 minutes and it was worth every second. If you're in Chicago, pay Doug a visit.
