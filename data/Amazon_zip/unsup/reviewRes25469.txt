Went to Pequod's with a group of 15 people. On gay pride day. They seated us immediately and gave us delicious pizzas in a timely fashion. If that isn't magic I don't know what is. And when I say pizzas, I mean six pizzas. Plus beverages. The staff was very accommodating even though our group was loud and obviously unexpected. Oh and did I mention it was cheap. Like $8/person cheap. For large groups, this place is a must-eat.
