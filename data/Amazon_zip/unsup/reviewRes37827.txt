They have mead here. They have Kwak here with the correct glass holder. They have cool art on the walls. They never seem to care that I'm trying to order a drink, and they never seem to have food when I need it. They never seem to have a seat either. They're also really far away from Hyde Park. You see what I'm getting at: 5 star beer. 5 star atmosphere. Everything else - not real great. But you're here for beer anyway. I can live with the rest.
