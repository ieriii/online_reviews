Came in on a Saturday night before catching a show in the loop. The service was great from start to finish. We had about six people servicing us at any given time (one for water, one to bring the dishes, etc.) - they were all good but the main server was spectacular.  The atmosphere is very chill and modern, the music was loud but you could easily carry on a conversation over it. The truffle oil popcorn was ridiculously great, we were actually disappointed when they took it away (unfinished) when our first dish came out. I thought about asking for them to throw it in a bag for us (we could eat it at the theater after) but my wife gave me the look of disapproval after this suggestion. I got asked for a Ketel martini and was told they don't carry popular spirits but their own unique collection.  The waitress recommended some special vodka that was distilled 16 times from corn in Sweden or something and it was AMAZING.  Probably the best vokda martini I've ever had. I wanted a beer afterwards and they had two only on tap - some wheat beer brewed by Goose Island for Graham Elliot (I forget the name) and the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout (drink with caution).  Now to the food: - Caesar salad: The cruton was a delicious brioche "twinkie" (yum) - Bisque: Think Thai curry with tiny squash and tiny marshmallows melting in it (my favorite dish of the night) - Scallop: I'm not a huge scallop but these were cooked perfectly - Wagyu: Foie Gras powder - amazing. - Smores: The homeade graham cracker made it They serve Metropolitan coffee and I needed some espresso after that Bourbon County Stout (which I later found out was 13% alcohol.) Overall, this was a great experience, great food, and great drinks. Needless to say we had a great night and loved this place.  Pro-tip: The website is cool but completely inaccurate on the menu and drinks (which are probably changed on a weekly basis)
