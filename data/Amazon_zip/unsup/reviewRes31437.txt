I saw this featured on the food network and decided to try it. My fiance, a friend, and I went. We had the featured dish the biscuit and duck confit gravy and the shrimp and fried oyster poboy. My friend tried the fried soft shell crab sandwich. All dishes were superb and unique. It has been one of the few restaurants in a long time that tasted as good as it looked. The fresh squeeze orange juice was also great. Service was excellent. Food came out quick. The waitress Trisha was very helpful and nice. The decor was very quaint and clean.  I am definitely bringing others to try the place.
