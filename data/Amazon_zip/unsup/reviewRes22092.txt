Husby and I kicked at old school at the Dawg a couple weekends ago. It was already packed around the time they opened on a Sunday, and we were just able to cruise on into one of the last available spots.  Are the dogs overpriced? You betcha. The service kinda slow? Uh huh. Still, I heart the retro vibe of ordering from a drive up and having someone bring a tray of goodies that attaches to the side of my car. I kinda wish she was on rollerskates, but I got over it.  Oh, and crinkle cut fries! BOOYA!
