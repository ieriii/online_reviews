I couldn't have been happier with my decision to come to Hot Doug's today. I had the Chicken sausage and fries, and it was amazing. I am excited to come back and try one of the special dogs, I figured for my first experience here, I'd try something more original.  I have friends who have raved about the place, and was extremely excited to come. I got there around 2:30 and it was pretty busy, but no line out the door...thankfully!  I'll definitely be back!!!!
