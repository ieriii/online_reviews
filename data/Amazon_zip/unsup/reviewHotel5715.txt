I used the Crowne Plaza as the host hotel for my wedding at Loft on Lake. Location-wise is was great for that venue, although less fun if my guests wanted to explore the more touristy things in Chicago in their free time. It's also right off 90/94, so guests driving in from out of town can find it pretty easily. Despite looking pretty drab from the outside, the interior is actually pretty inviting. Lena in the Sales department did a great job reserving blocks of rooms for the guests and responding quickly to my questions and requests leading up to the big day. The check-in staff were able to hand out welcome bags that we had assembled upon checking in. Pricing was pretty good given their location. Overall the out of towners were very happy with the place. Important things to know - parking is pricey valet only, although there are cheaper pay lots nearby too. Restaurants nearby are the ones in Greek town or the one in the hotel. I had the breakfast buffet in the hotel, which was good, although it was your typical fare at typical hotel price (some of my guests had breakfast vouchers). We had a 2 room suite for the bridal party, which was spacious, comfortable, and modern. Family liked being able to run across the street to Dominicks for snacks and food for the room while everyone was getting ready. Overall I was very happy with the service and accommodations here.
