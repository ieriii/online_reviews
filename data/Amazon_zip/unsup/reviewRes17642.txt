Solid Indian meal; a decent bet, but run-of-the-mill in London terms. Nice naan and vegetable samosas, though the samosas were a bit too oily and certainly not spicy enough. Wasn't impressed with the seasoning of the Mattar Paneer or the Baingan Bharta either. I actually prefer India Grill's (South Loop) Baingan Bharta; the flavor is much more vibrant. I like India Grill's vegetable samosas more, too. Again, much more going on vis-a-vis spice and texture. Did like that Indian House had an unusually wide variety of wines on the menu. Not traditional, but very much appreciated. However, three of the four medium to bold reds were all Cabs, and the 4th a Zinfandel. Defintely limiting after having gone out of the way to offer so many wines. In any event, I'd return, again, but will certainly seek higher caliber options re: flavor. . .provided that they exist in Chicago.
