I wanted to love this place so much. However, I left just feeling "so-so" about my experience at Gilt. The energy of the place is very nice, lowlighting and good music . Our server was awesome, and really knew his drinks (or the bartender he was working with did). We listed types of liquor and styles of drinks we would usually order at a bar, and he was able to bring us new concoctions that were delicious and strong. However, the food left something to be desired. We ordered the bone marrow after seeing Yelp reviews about it, but I just wasnt into the fatty texture of it (I know, I know). My date ordered a pasta with rabbit in it and he seemed to like it, although the portion looked small and he ended up ordering another side. I got the pork belly and it just was okay, not the best but not the worst. Saw curio tucked behind the curtain on my way to the bathroom and it looked like a good place to grab a drink while on a date. May be back to try it out. There's just so many good restaurants in Chicago, so I will probably try those before returning here.
