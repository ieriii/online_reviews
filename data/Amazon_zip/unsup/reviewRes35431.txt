I LOVE YOU! You were MORE than I ever expected from seafood. I mean I've never been a seafood girl, ask my mother, but this experience converted me. We had oysters, shrimp cocktail, sushi, lobster pasta, and crab cake burger. EVERYTHING was YUMMY. Will go there again. Plus...Service and live music was great!
