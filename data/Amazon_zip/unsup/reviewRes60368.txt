LOVE LOVE LOve this place. if you want some amazing sushi, this is the place to go. If you are going for a really laid back dinner, i don't know if this is the place. They play fun upbeat music, fairly loud, but the food is to die for.. They deliver, which i also love! they always tell me an hour, but it's there in 10! i would strongly suggest the godzilla roll and the vegetable gyoza! my boyfriend finally let us get the vegetable one, and now he is hooked too, we get it everytime we go, which is at least once a week.... can't go wrong here, and it's byob! but if you forget your wine, no fear, they have it.
