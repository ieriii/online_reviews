Glenn's has been on my radar for the better part of 4 years now, and after much procrastination, I finally made the trip. The first impression I got from the place was "uh oh, this looks like a douchy hipster place". Wow, a seafood restaurant with cereal boxes on the wall, that's crazy! ... IS IT! Decor aside, I was astounded by the sheer volume of daily specials. There are huge chalkboards on either side of the restaurants that literally fill the walls. The server was delightful, if not a bit scarce. My party ordered the fried calamari. and I have to say nobody was a huge fan. They make a stylistic choice to make Calamari fries,cut in long strips the squid was too big for my taste personally. The crab cakes on the other hand were absolutely THE best I've ever had. The clam chowder was yet another home run, the best I've tasted. For my entree, I tried the lobster roll, it was good, not great. This might be yet another stylistic choice, I prefer the hot buttered lobster roll to Glenn's traditional mayo, celery roll. Out of my party of 4 , two of us really liked Glenn's, 1 was fine with it and 1 didn't really like it. Since I am writing the review, I would recommend Glenn's, but keep in mind there are some choices the chef makes that may or may not agree with you.
