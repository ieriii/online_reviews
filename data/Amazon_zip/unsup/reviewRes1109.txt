Let me just say this.... This is by far, hands down the best freaking hot dog I've ever had. Really, I would stand in line for this for another two hours in 30 degree weather if I had to. I ate my way through Chicago and this hot dog was the highlight!! I got in just before closing and Doug was there to wait on me with a smile and friendly service just like his day had just started. What do I recommend? Go early, order several dogs and sample away. And if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they are serving duck fat fries, get two orders. They are yummy! Hot Doug's is not somewhere you want to miss. Go, Eat, Enjoy...... You won't be sorry!!
