We went for brunch. My app was amazing, but tiny. I had the white corn goat cheese pancakes and was extremely disappointed. They tasted like normal American pancakes, and the goat cheese was sweetened. The chorizo was too bitter and didn't complement it at all. I felt like I was in a Dennys from hell. The atmosphere was tight and crowded, and extremely warm and stuffy. It's getting three stars because everyone else's food seemed great. I'd like to go back eventually and try lunch or dinner...but brunch is out for me.
