My girlfriend took me here two years ago. It was truly a unique experience. I recommend everyone to try this place once in their lifetime. It's science meets culinary art. We had the grand course meal with the wine pairing. I suggesting doing the wine pairing since you're already over budget. What's another $200. I highly recommend this place if you can afford it.
