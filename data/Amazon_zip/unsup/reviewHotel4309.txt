So so nice. The staff was professional and wonderful, room service was prompt and delicious, the lobby was magnificent. The only thing I missed was a coffee maker in the room, but with Starbucks in the lobby, it all worked out. I didn't like having to pay $16 for wifi every day or pay to use the gym. If they weren't nickle and diming me, I would easily give this hotel 5 stars.
