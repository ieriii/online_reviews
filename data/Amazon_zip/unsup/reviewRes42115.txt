Everyone who knows me knows that I love pizza. Therefore it was hard for me to admit to my friends that I didn't have a favorite Chicago style pizza place while on a recent trip to the windy city. The truth is that as many times as I have been in Chicago, I have had very few experiences with the city's pizza. Fortunately we had an extra afternoon on this visit so one of my native Chicago friends offered to take us to his favorite pizza place in the city, The Art of Pizza. This restaurant isn't a fancy sit down place that I had imagined most places serving this type of pizza would be, instead we ordered at the counter and my friend recommended that we just get pizza by the slice. They had three different cases full of varying pizza by the slice to choose from in both deep dish and thin crust. I decided to get one of each, a slice of pepperoni deep dish and a slice of jalapeno and sausage on the thin crust. I first started with the slice of deep dish and it was delicious! The crust was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside with a nice buttery flavor. The cheese and pepperoni were piled high and then smothered in a tasty red sauce. This was exactly what I was expecting from a slice of Chicago style pizza. One slice of this thick pie is probably enough for a decent size lunch. But for the sake of my reviews, I suffered through a slice of thin pizza too. The thin crust was also good, but it is hard to compare with the deep dish. The crust wasn't as crispy on the outside, so the entire slice of pizza was a little more doughy. Other than that the toppings were great and the sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. I would easily order either kind of pizza again, but for me the deep dish is the way to go since it is hard to find something like this in other parts of the country. In the future I will definitely remember The Art of Pizza during any Chicago trips.
