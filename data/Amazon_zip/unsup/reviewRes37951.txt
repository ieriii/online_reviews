Greatest pizza place in Chicago. Seriously - This is not normal deep dish pizza. This is STUFFED pizza. As in it's built like a pie - crust, TONS of cheese and topping, crust, then TONS of sauce. The Cheese is SOOOO flavorful it's like crack. The crust is perfect and the sauce is equally amazing. I've eaten at Lou Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno, and Giordano's within 4 days of each other and Giordano's wins by a LANDSLIDE! You simply MUST try this if you are trying to get a feel for Chicago pizza! It's so good we've had it shipped to our house overnight! I honestly don't know why people like the other places, they are bland and nothing special. Giordano's admittedly keeps changing their recipe to make it better. The other places refuse to change their recipe even though it's gross.
