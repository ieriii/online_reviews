I don't usually think of Shaw's Crab House as a good place for seafood, but I was proven wrong. I went there for lunch and ordered the clam chowder soup (homemade w/ fresh clams) and seafood platter (Maryland crab cake, sea scallops and garlic shrimp). Everything was perfectly cooked. We stayed around for the Oyster party from 4-6pm, everyday. Basically all oyster's are half-off within these two hours. It was fresh and delicious. Definitely worth it and will come back.
