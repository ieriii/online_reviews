Bin 36, what happened to you. I used to go to this place all the time, and would have rated it 4 maybe even 5 stars. Now? 2 stars and that is just because of Nostalgia. There was almost no one else in the place, (first sign that something was wrong). The service was not very attentive, even though the server could not have had more that one other table. The food was merely ok, not as good as it used to be, I once had an Osca Bocca that was to die for, but not anymore. The bathroom was very dirty and dusty with missing tiles and one of the sinks in the ladies room was broken. All the signs of a restaurant that has given up and cannot afford basic upkeep any more. Very sad because I used to love this place.
