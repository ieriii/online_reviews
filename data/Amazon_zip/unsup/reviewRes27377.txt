Ok, I know I'm vegan, but I try real hard not to be high-maintenance. My sister-in-law planned a dinner here for a family birthday, since she liked the chef from all the tv shows. She calls ahead to ask about vegan options. The restaurant says not only can they do it, but that they do it all the time and have repeat customers who are vegan and so on. They were positively ebullient. Originally, I was ready for bland with a side of nothing, but this got my hopes up. I was excited. I was going to get the full Graham Elliot experience. What I got was grilled zucchini. That's what you get when you go to any random place and they aren't prepared and just throw something together. It didn't have any interesting flavor pairings, just couscous and a sauce that was pretty mild. Plus the portion was less than what my co-diners had with their expensive cuts of meat. Similarly, the popcorn in vegan form just was without things. The non-veg popcorn has truffle oil on it. Come on, mushrooms are vegan! The slight uptick was dessert. Frankly, you just have to attempt it and you'll score points. It was berries and bananas with prickly pear sauce and foam, and banana sorbet. It was pretty good and they got a star just for that. My omnivorous co-diners were not very impressed with what they got, and thought the place was over-hyped. I don't think any of us will really go back.
