This review is for Bonsoiree Event Catering. We considered Bonsoiree for catering our wedding reception at a private venue. We wanted a Hawaiian-themed reception centered around quality food. Dozzy Ibekwe provided our proposals. Bonsoiree's pricing was roughly twice the pricing of every other proposal we received for roughly the same food. Extra items that we asked to be removed would mysteriously reappear in revised proposals. It seemed like there was a set price that Bonsoiree quoted, regardless of what food or service was listed. Remove a dish, and the other dishes would go up in price. Remove a server, and an "Event Coordinator Fee" appeared. Dozzy was not very accommodating on menu items. He did try to add a few island-themed dishes, but then added completely unrelated sides that we wanted removed. We understood that we were requesting a Hawaiian theme from a french restaurant, but we REALLY didn't want a cheese display with a fish dish in the middle of July. Dozzy was also very unresponsive by phone or email. We received our first proposal roughly 3 weeks after first contact, and received a revised proposal after another 2 weeks. He sounded drugged/drunk/hung over every time we talked over the phone. Maybe we missed the good party he just came from, but we'll never know. We decided not to go with Bonsoiree Event Catering due to their high prices and lack of response and service. Two stars for at least attempting to provide quality food.
