both 90 mile locations are really good. the beans and rice are so savory, that you could just eat them as a meal, but then you'd miss out on the delicious ropa vieja or bistec and plantains. unlike many cuban places, there are quite a few great vegetarian options, i like the tofu and i love the vegetable empanada. yuca frita is also good and nothing is too heavy or greasy. great food, great prices.
