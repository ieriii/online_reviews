I have recently discovered 3rd Coast and it is now perhaps one of my favorite little places to visit. During the past two weeks I can say that I have visited quite frequently experimenting with different items on the menu. The food is great and the service is also very wonderful. As my fellow yelpers have stated the decor is a little bit off, but nonetheless the atmosphere is not a killer.  They offer a variety of unique local beers as well as a pretty decent wine selection. The nostalgia of the old building couple with pretty decent food makes the night and dining experience complete. Whether you're visiting the Gold Coast area or live nearby, you need to make a point to check out 3rd Coast.
