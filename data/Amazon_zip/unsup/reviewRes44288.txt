Travels extremely well. To my thighs. Not really (well, yeah, actually...), but yes--Alliance Bakery goods travel very well--the tarts and cupcakes provided at the Elite event at Exhale last night were lovely and delicious. I think I should've stuck with the tarts, though, because that pumpkin cupcake was gargantuan--a good thing in a cupcake, to be sure--but maybe not-so-much when the Core Fusion class door opens and little stick women walk out as I shovel in more pumpkin-y goodness and blobs of rich cream cheese frosting.
