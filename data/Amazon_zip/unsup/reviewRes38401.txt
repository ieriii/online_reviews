I am amazed Giordano's Pizza has such great reviews! I didn't have such an awesome experience. My friend and I decided to stop in for some famous Giordano's eats. We were seated rather quickly and the booth was comfortable. The waiter seemed a bit all over the place and frazzled. We ordered drinks, a Hawaiian (they had some other name for it) pizza, a salad, and some lasagna. The salad came out first, it was decent but nothing special. The pizza took around 40 minutes as was expected and my lasagna came out at the same time. I took the first bite of the lasagna and all was good, until I took the second bite and realized it was FROZEN! Yes frozen lasagna. The waiter was so busy it took at least 10 minutes before I had a chance to tell him and by that time I was like screw it... I'll just eat pizza. He didn't even say sorry! He just said "Oh, Okay" took it back to the kitchen and that was the end of it! There were no apologies no discounts, no anything! I was pretty bewildered at the lack of service so on the way out I asked to speak to the manager. He was flirting and groping a employee at least half his age and giggling when I approached. He told me that he indeed was the manager. So I laid out the situation for him and all he said was "thanks for telling me" what the hell? I'm never going back!
