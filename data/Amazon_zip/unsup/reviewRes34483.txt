Had the day off so stopped here for breakfast. It was fine...just average. I had a frittata that was fairly tasty, but tried my husband's cinnamon roll french toast and it wasn't good. I asked for a refill on my water and the watiress forgot. Once she realized her error she apologized and was very attentive after that.
