Went here for lunch and it's one of those places where everything is cooked and prepared very creatively. I had the chorizo stuffed olives, meatball slider, and milk braised pork shoulder. Service was quick and friendly even though the place was very busy. Servings are "tapas style" - perfect place to get in and out while getting high quality and well thought of food.
