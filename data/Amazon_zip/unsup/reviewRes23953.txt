Three things that I love: Free Valet, Flaming Cheese, and Seabass... Greek Isles has them all. This place is huge, we had a bit of a wait, but we had about 20 people but we were accommodated by the staff and provided a large area in the back. Overall it's a very authentic experience, as I grew up around some Greek food and it tastes very good. The service was fast, and everyone had a great time. I need to start placing some of my cheese on fire at home, maybe I'd get a better reaction to my home cooking, tho I lack free valet...
