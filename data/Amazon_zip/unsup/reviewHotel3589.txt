Nice hotel and a great location. However, for the price, I think there are more unique and fun places. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with really nice sheets and cozy pillows, but was pretty generic in decor. Although I was just there for a short time (in at 9pm, out at 11:30am the next), the staff was friendly and helpful. My friend brought some deep dish pizza over, and I called room service to ask for some plates and utensils. They arrived within 10 minutes! Now that's service :) Would recommend it but I'd rather try some other hotels before returning...
