I don't know that I was expecting anything in particular here in terms of selection or service, but I ended up not really being impressed. First off, when order drinks at the bar, I was greeted with a smirk as I was asking about the some of the selections offered. Now the bartenders wasn't trying to work down a line of people or anything - this was mid afternoon after and the place was dead. Isn't one of the big points of this place the selection of beers they offer and being proud of that selection - why be a jackass about it?!  After some time there, the company I was with started to get hungry and I went up to the bar to get a menu. I was given a menu and was told that the kitchen opens at 5PM. Glancing up at the clock, I see that it's 5 till 5 and ask if I can put in an order now and I'm told "no". I asked him if he was serious...come on...five friggin minutes. Anyway, I ordered the onion rings type things and they were really good, but all in all, everything else was not so good.
