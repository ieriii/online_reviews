Meh Coast- Its not on my top 5 sushi spots in the city. But it will do. I like byob but I think coast would be better as an establishment that serves their own stuff. The decor, service, and sushi tend to be really inconsistent and frankly just not worth the hype (i'm allergic to hype anyways). The noise level and the lighting only add to the in-cohesiveness.  I will give them some props for the spicy miso soup...not that i cant boil water, toss in some fermented soy and a couple of slices of jalapenos and have the same thing at home...but i wouldnt have thought of that myself and my stomach thanks you Coast.
