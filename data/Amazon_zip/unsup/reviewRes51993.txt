Gino's Chicago Deep Dish pizza is just OK. I feel sorry for the people, especially tourists that go to Gino's after being told that this is the best Chicago style deep dish around. This is definitely one of the stalwarts in the city, but I much prefer a couple of other pizzerias by light years more than Gino's. I'm not going to name names out of respect for this section which is dedicated to Gino's, but anyone can see my other reviews and easily figure it out. The style of pizza at Gino's is definitely Chicago deep dish, but it really lacks in the most important component of this style of pizza... the dish. Meaning, the crust. It's actually yellow... weird. And it's not crispy... instead of it's soft. I'm sorry, but that just ruins it. The rest of the ingredients are just fine. No complaints. On par with the rest. It just comes down to he all important crust, which is really what makes Chicago deep dish different than pan or stuffed style pizzas. To each his own.
