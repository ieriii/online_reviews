probably the best BYOB sushi in the city. the fish is always fresh and the specials they have always rock it! the atmosphere is great for groups or just a date night. let me tell you though...sadly, the first time i came here, i was super hungover and sushi is not the best thing to eat in that case. we sat at the bar and i hardly could drink my O.B., but my sis proclaimed that the fish was so fresh and she loved it. so i came back a few times after that and always had great service and awesome sushi. this is one of my favorites in the city and it's up there with mirai and japonais. i did hear someone at our table whisper, almost ashamed - maybe b/c it's BYOB, that (gasp!) "this is better than Japonais."
