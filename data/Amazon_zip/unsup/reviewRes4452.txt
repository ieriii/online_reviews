I took a group of friends from out of town to the Green Mill on 1/1/2009 and it was so much fun. They had an 18 piece jazz band that night. The place was packed so luckily (thanks to Yelp) we got there early enough and got a table right in front for our party. We had the best seats in the house and really enjoyed people watching & listening to the band. I think this is the perfect place to take people visiting from out of town. Just a very cool old-school Chicago establishment!
