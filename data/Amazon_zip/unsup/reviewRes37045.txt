I love the Hopleaf. The variety of fantastic beer paired with passionate food. It is hard to find another restaurant that does the gastropub thing any better. This place does get crowded and the wait can be annoying but like any good place they have a bar to tide you over so don't complain. First and foremost I think the beer is what makes this place and everything else is the supporting cast. The rotating tap list always has your favorites and beers you have always wanted to taste from a fresh tapper. The beers in bottle catalog they give you really put this place in another league when it comes to beer. Though mostly concentrated on Belgium style, you can find brews from all over the world. You will be salivating when you read it. Now when I said everything else is the supporting cast, I mean that the food is like having Paul Giamatti playing the comic relief. Oscar nominated for sure. The food seems to change with the seasons and with the beer they have on tap. But the mainstays are there for a reason. The mussels are worth it for an appetizer or entree, comes with expertly fried frites. The duck reuben is really original and tasty to boot. And the brisket pairs well with about every beer.  I have always enjoyed my food and the portions are good. Service is well maintained, they get people in and out pretty fast. If you can get in there early before the bartenders get slammed you will meet some nice people who know beer and especially how it will link to your food.
