Damn you Doug and your Hot Doug's!!! For the first time in my life I thought I had found the way; the Fred's franks way, but noooo - I had to go to Chicago.  Fine. Fred's franks are seasonal and nooo, Fred doesn't offer Fries fried in Duck Fact on Friday & Saturday. Alas, it is true Fred doesn't offer a dozen varieties of mind-blowing, house-ground encased meats. Nor does Fred offer them topped with such things as Fois Gras. And yes, Doug's zen-like calm demeanor in spite of the throngs of barely patient people loosely organized into a line around the corner might provoke you to contemplate the possibility that encased meat IS happiness and therefore we all have happiness within ourselves since each of us might rightly consider ourselves as meats encased.... Less philosophically, what is it about the the chicago-style dawg that makes it so good? The obnoxious condiments? The rich flavor, bright red color, the snappy encasement and the big honking pickle I first thought someone was too lazy to place next to the dawg, not on it?  Hmmm, I wonder what Fred could do with one of Doug's Hot Dawgs or even an ordinary chicago-style one? In any event, kudos to Doug and his Hot Doug's for proving the impossible nearly possible!
