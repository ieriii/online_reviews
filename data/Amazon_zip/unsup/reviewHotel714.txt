Pluses: * Flavored water and cookies in the lobby * The spa was on our floor (4th), just down the hall * A great, very firm mattress * Seriously light blocking shade plus drapes * Fluffy robes in the big closet * Starbucks coffee for the coffeemaker in the room * Recycling can and regular trash can NOTE: Spa Ritual was the BEST part of the pluses!! Manis, pedis, facials, massages, waxing and more in the spa (or in your room!). Ask for Lisa - the awesome esthetician! Minuses: * Small and lumpy pillows on the beds * No fridge * Low water pressure in the shower * Double shower head was stuck so it wouldn't adjust to just one on (and maybe have stronger pressure) This hotel is close to so many things, that even with the negatives it's a great place to stay!
