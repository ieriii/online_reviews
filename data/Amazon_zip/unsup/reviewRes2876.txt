Definitely glad I had the chance to experience dining at Tru, but don't know that I would ever feel the need to go back (unless someone wants to take me??). The service was impeccable - I dropped a wine glass soon after arriving and they quickly took care of it like it was no big deal. They were attentive throughout the meal, although our somewhat rowdy group seemed to irritate them a bit. The standout item on our tasting menu was the lobster in a champagne & mushroom "broth". Phenomenal and a favorite among our entire group. The meat dish was lamb but since I don't eat it, I had the halibut instead. Probably my second favorite part of the meal. Otherwise, the rest of the items on the menu were somewhat forgettable (although the jellied amuse bouche was a bit odd and everyone just sort of picked at it).  And dinner takes awhile.... The restaurant was very quiet and museum-like, but since we sat in the private room upstairs, I didn't experience much of that atmosphere.
