Place was packed, but we immediately got a table. Fun, boisterous vibe, perfect for a chilly night. Food was delicious: jamon serrano with duck egg, pork saltimbocca, octopus (so tender!), neckbone gravy, chicken thigh kabobs, and the sweet fried Iris. Service was top notch, and the wine selection extensive. Will definitely make some repeat visits to finish off the menu!
