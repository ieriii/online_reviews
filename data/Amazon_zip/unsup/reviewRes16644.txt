I love this place. Sure, it might be pretentious in some folks' eyes but I don't want to drink the same thing as everyone else so I don't care if it might seem pretentious. I love the cool dark interior and the fact that you can actually have a conversation with the person next to you without screaming is a big plus for me. It's just... more civilized than regular bars and I like that. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable and put on a nice little show of making our drinks for us. When my husband asked him for their spiciest drink, he brought over something off the menu that was so delicious and perfect and spicy = great stuff. My own drinks were wonderful, too. Well worth a visit!
