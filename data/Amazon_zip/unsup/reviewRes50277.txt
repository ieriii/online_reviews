I've been here multiple times for both brunch and dinner, but more often for brunch. There's nothing wrong with the dinner options, but I feel like the brunch dishes deliver a little more consistently. Most recently I came here for brunch on a Sunday around 11 am. There was no wait (I actually can't remember a time I've ever had to wait here). They bring beignets to start, which are always delicious. I could eat a whole meal of just those! I ordered the cheddar corn cakes, which I've had before and always like. I was not disappointed this time either. In the past, I've ordered the two-egg breakfast and the migas, which are also great. I'm sure I've ordered other things as well. They do change their menu a few times a year. One additional thing to note about Big Jones is that they do Thanksgiving dinner every year. I've come here with my parents for the past two years and we've really enjoyed it both times. The menu changes a bit each year, but it's a basic Southern Thanksgiving. The first year we came, we had turducken and last year we had deep-fried turkey. One recommendation: make a Thanksgiving reservation for earlier in the day. We came around 5 pm last year and they were clearly already running out of food since some of the side dishes were different from what was on the menu. The portion sizes also seemed to vary wildly from table to table. If we come back this year, I plan to do so in the early afternoon.
