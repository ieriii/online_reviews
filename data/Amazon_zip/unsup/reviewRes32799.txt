Food was great. Atmosphere was amazing. I love the set up of this restaurant. Went with about ten friends we sat in the back room and just ordered appetizers all night. It was perfect. Drinks were great. Try the Go Go Berry, not a ton of alcohol, but tastes amazing. Beware: It's pretty feminine looking.
