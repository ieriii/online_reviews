Its just ok. If I were out shopping and wanted a small bite and wine I'd pop in. I will not go out of my way to eat here again. It was perhaps the worst martini I've ever had. I know this place is a wine bar but c'mon! We weren't asked gin or vodka or what kind.  Yes the salted beets are yummy. That was the star. The cheese is good but no fruit! The fried deviled egg is better on paper. We had some cheese rice balls that were good too. Then some potato fish spread that needed S&P or something. It was boring. The staff was just ok. It did get crowded and there were some really rude people there. I'm sure it affected my experience. However there was either the owner or the manager that came to both tables next to us. We didn't get a hello, thanks for coming in, is everything ok or anything. I am Ms. Cellophane but still!! We felt snubbed. Also its very loud in there. Not a great date place.
