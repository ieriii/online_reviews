Rarely do I give 5 stars or rave about a place, but XOCO sealed the deal for me. The churro, ice cream, and torta sandwiches are absolutely delectable. The churro contains the right crisp yet is not overly baked. Unlike churros at most restaurants and stores, XOCO's neither taste bland from too much dough nor tire your mouth with a detestable thickness. And the ice cream? I'd advise sharing this cup of heaven with a friend, family member, or lover if you don't want to wake up the next day with an extra 5 pounds. As for the torta sandwiches, I personally favor the torta bread. XOCO, though, masterfully creates a sandwich, bursting with savory flavors. The only problem is the process could end up being slightly messy.
