Wood fire BBQ. A million banchan. Like, literally, dozens, fanning the table, no space to put your actual eating plates, utensils or drinkware. The BBQ is VERY tasty; not the best I've had but really you're coming for the experience. If you're coming for the best Korean food you'll ever have, don't come here. It's smoky. Like sitting in a chimney. If that's not your idea of fun, don't come here. The waitresses are typical of a lot of korean restaurants. They're bossy. They want to do what they want their way, not your way. That doesn't mean they're mean. But like an overcritical mom, they will tell you what you're doing wrong. If you need to get their attention, do not be shy about standing up physically and waving your arms back and forth until they come over. They will not "be offended," (unless you are snotty and rude when they come over). It's all part of the package. If you're afraid to insist on service, don't come here. Went with a group of five, it was fun, delicious, and we left with a table full of empty giant OB bottles. Good times, in short.
