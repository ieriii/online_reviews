I can't believe the 4 star rating. I seriously question the reviews of anyone who gives this place more than a generous 3. I've been in there on about 4 occasions (yeah, I know, call me a fool.) Greasy, greasy greasy. Who cares how big a burrito is, when the more you eat, the more likely it is to kill you? Maybe it's just me, maybe I just don't like Mexican food. Or maybe I just don't dig having an upset stomach. Four times and never have I had good service. Yes, the waitresses are generally nice and apologetic, but I'd prefer good service over mucho apologies any day.
