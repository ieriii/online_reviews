do they have variety - yes...kinda do they have the ambiance of most Brazilian steakhouses - yes does the food taste as good as Texas de Brazil? no it does not... they seem to just mirror other steakhouses but do not offer the variety at the "salad bar" and the waiter didn't seem to present when you needed him. I went with the family to treat my Father and I didn't think the price matched the experience....
