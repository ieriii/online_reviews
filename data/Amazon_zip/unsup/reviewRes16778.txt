I have been to Carnivale on a few occasions finally had dinner during Restaurant Week. As a Kleiner restaurant, I had high expectations. It did not disappoint. Although it was restaurant week, the waiter gave a 10 minute spiel about the various options. No thanks, I am here for RW! The appetizer started the meal on a high note. Both me and my bestie were excited for entree. Usually a vodka drinker, I opted for mojitos to complete the Latin experience. It was very good! I'm no expert but I feel that mojitos can be hit or miss. Both entrees were delish. (Note: The best part of dining with a bestie is to try each other's meals.) The dessert was good but not as amazing as the rest of the meal. I'm dying to go back already.
