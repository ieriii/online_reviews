A decent enough breakfast joint that is trying to hard to serve her hipster masters. I guess it's not good enough to do bacon and eggs well (which they do ) but they feel they have to throw down a shrimp omlet or a jambalya omlet to keep the yupsters happy. I can't crap on a place because they have too much stuff on their menu so I'll move on to the positive; they do the basics well , your eggs, pancakes and french toast. All score a solid good , nothing to really set them apart though. A shineing light is the home fries which are very good. The servers are also an absolute delight. All in a solid place to do brunch. A word to the warning ,area parking is a bit tough to find.
