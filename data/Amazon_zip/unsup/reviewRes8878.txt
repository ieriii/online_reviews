Oh grilled meat, how i love you and your rice accompaniment. I was taken to this place by my friend who claimed this place was the best ever. I just asked my sister if she had ever been her and her reply was: "Deirdre: no but if one more person tells me how freaking awesome it is im gonna go postal on someone" I told her it was awesome, but she didn't go postal. It is awesome, and you should go there. Now. To get some grilled beef. I mean it.
