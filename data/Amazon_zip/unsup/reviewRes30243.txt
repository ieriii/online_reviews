We tried Frontera on a Friday afternoon. It was super busy but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table in the bar area. The couple we were with are not very adventurous eaters so I was worried they wouldn't like this authentic Mexican food. Luckily we had Raymond as a server and he was able to suggest both drinks and food. We loved the guacamole, it was outstanding. He suggested four different dishes to eat family style. They included the duck, the chicken taquitos, pork pineapple tacos, and the special of the day which was mahi mahi. We loved it all! The chicken dish was our least favorite and is what we all would've probably ordered had we been left to order on our own. My advice is get the opinion of the server here on what to eat. I'm sure they are all very knowledgeable and it make our experience infinitely better. We skipped dessert here and went next door for fresh, hot churros. Definitely the right choice. Eat here you won't be disappointed.
