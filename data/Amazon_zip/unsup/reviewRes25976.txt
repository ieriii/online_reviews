Found ourselves back at Simply It and just wanted to update my review. As I said in my previous review, the place is small and very busy. When we went in (without reservations) there was one couple ahead of us. As we waited, several people came in and were waiting behind us. This cute little older man, who I'm assuming is the owner, gave everyone icewater and then came out with two platters of egg rolls to pass around.  Our meal was great, I decided to go "seasonal" with the pumpkin shrimp dish and Tim got the clay pot catfish again. We were oogling the dessert that was brought to the table next to us and the cute little man told the waitress to bring us one too...on the house! The fried banana fruit and ice cream was seriously delightful. Thank you Simply It, we'll be back!
