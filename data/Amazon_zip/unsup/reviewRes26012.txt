Don't think I will ever find a replacement for Hue, the wonderful little storefront Vietnamese joint I used to frequent on Argyle back in the 80's and early 90's. But my hopeful search took me to Simply It to check out the lunch specials. Located on a stretch of Lincoln Ave, which is really De Paul University's bar and restaurant row, it boasts that casual college vibe, where students, profs and locals abound. There was a respectable crowd here on a Tuesday afternoon. There is an extensive menu with many interesting choices. I had a taste for salmon, so I ordered a salmon on noodle lunch special, which was a little more than the $7.00 lunch special baseline. I did this with slight hesitation, since I usually save my salmon fix for those more fine dining spots I get to try on business lunches. But the salmon was actually fresh and nicely cooked. It was in chunks on top of the noodles, instead of as a whole fillet, but that did not matter. It was clearly fresh. Onions and greens accompanied the salmon. I was a little disappointed that there was a Chinese-type gravy over the dish. I could have done without that.(I can't recall the last time my doctor suggested that I needed more cornstarch in my diet.) But it was good. Neither spicy nor garlicky. Most of the flavor came from the crispy pan-fried vermicelli noodles. Lunch comes with a shy and anemic little salad of greens and chow mein noodles, a bowl of clear soup with tofu and greens, two little veggie egg rolls the size of of cocktail wienies, hot tea and fresh orange quarters for dessert. For under $10.00, it's a good value. Service was the standard Asian: efficient, polite and prompt. I would like to work my way through some of the other offerings like the sandwiches and the Goi Ga salad. Again, just a great value and a good spot in Lincoln Park for a casual lunch. BYOB, and validated parking for $6 available at Children's Memorial parking garage. It was really a 3.5 with a .5 added for the benefit of the doubt.
