Absolutely worth the drive from Evanston. I could live on their vegan muffins and I'm not even vegan. The staff is always nice and really helpful and the food is delicious. There are lots of great vegetarian and vegan options and trust me, by the end of the meal, you'll be too full to realize you didn't eat meat. Worth a stop, carnivore and herbivore alike.
