Top notch pizza paired with top notch people is what makes me a loyal CASH paying customer of Fogo 2Go! For a pinch past 7 bucks your stomach is full, your pallet wet, and your tastes buds trying to pry your mouth open for hope there is more to come. My favs are the margarita and the bbq chicken pizza (best bbq chicken I have ever had. TAKE THAT California Pizza Kitchen). Anyway, don't let the weather keep you in forcing yourself to finish off the left over tacos for the 3rd night in a row when there is food like this just around the corner. -Fogo 2 Go supporter, Nick P.-
