While I was in line, it was hard to reconcile the almost 2-hour wait for a hot dog. Once inside, I got it. The Chicago char dog was easily the best I've had, but not *that* much better than the other places. The real winner was the foie gras dog -- so covered in fatty amazingness I could only eat a few bites. I braved the long Saturday lines so I could try the duck-fat fries, and while they were delicious, I bet the regular weekday fries are just as good. What really surprised me was the relaxed attitude of the staff. For a place that operates on volume, I never felt rushed in my ordering or eating. Hot Doug's really is the premier dog hut in Chicago.
