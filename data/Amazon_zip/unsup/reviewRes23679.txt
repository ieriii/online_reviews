Shall we start with the great feel and decor of the place, the wonderful smell that hits your nose as you enter, or the food? I just ate here for the first time. Loved it! My crepe (the signature crepe, with goat cheese, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, pine nuts, etc) was amazing. I also had the Turkish coffee and split a Nutella / banana dessert crepe with my sister and her boyfriend. Very vegetarian friendly and also perfectly portioned. I feel satisfied, but not super full, and was really pleased with the fresh, tasty ingredients in my crepe. The dessert crepe was DELICIOUS! We split it, but I could probably eat one on my own. My vegetable puree soup was also fresh and tasty. Well seasoned also. I'm basically only giving it four stars because I feel like five stars has to be earned by a totally perfect experience. My only qualms were that my food got real cold, real fast, and I wasn't super crazy about the very herbal and flowery tasting Turkish Coffee. But thats just personal taste, maybe. Also, my waitress was really really sweet! Thanks Icosium cafe! I'll be back for sure!
