The only reason I can't give this place five stars is because of the occasional but remarkably rude hostess here. Our waitresses for the most part are nice. This is a place me and my husband frequent cause it's so close and good. I don't think I've ever gone wrong with their menu. I usually gravitate towards their omelettes. The only thing about their benedicts is that the hollandaise sauce they use is overwhelmingly full of citrus and almost overpowers the other flavors. If you like that I guess it's not a problem. I remember even getting oatmeal here that was great. It's just too bad that the first person you meet at the entrance just puts a sour taste in your mouth when you walk in. Enough to demote this otherwise positive review. O and a bit on the pricier side, but ive come to expect that in the city now.
