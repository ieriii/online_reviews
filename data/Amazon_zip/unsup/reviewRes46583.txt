If I wanted to be cramped, I'd take the Brown Line north from Merchandise Mart at 5:15pm. If I wanted to see lots of kids and families running around, I'd go to LP zoo. While there, I would get Dippin' Dots because those things are just awesome. If I wanted bar food, I'd go to a umm ... what are those bar like things that serve bar food called again?  If I want all 3, I go to RJ Grunts, but not that often ...
