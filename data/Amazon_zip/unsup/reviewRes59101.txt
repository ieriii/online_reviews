Excellent!!! Great food, reasonable price, and always good service. If you go on a weekend you'll need to anticipate about a 30-40 min wait if you arrive after 9:30. They're very good at estimating wait times and are always withing a couple minutes of what they tell you. They also have validated parking next door for $7.
