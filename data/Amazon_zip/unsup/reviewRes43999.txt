The steak here was fantastic. I had a porterhouse, and my Girlfriend had a Kansas City Strip, the sides were incredible. The Service was really good, the server really knew the different cuts of steak, and made it easy to pick something good. It is a bit pricey, but if your looking for really good food its worth it. By the way if youve ever been to the Merchandise Mart Brown Line El you might have smelled the chocolate. Honestly the chocolate cake that we got was so good I wouldn't be surprised if that was the smell you were smelling. Excellent desserts!!
