Was here about 2pm on a Friday and easily got a seat at the bar. Enjoyed a michelada, which is fresh lime juice, house made bloody Mary mix, pacifico beer w a smoked salt rim, delicious. I only had time for a quick bite so I had the ceviche trio, delicious, Served w crunchy tortilla chips, it was a lovely snack that two could share.
