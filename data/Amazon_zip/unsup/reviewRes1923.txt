I LOVE this place! I wish it was open past 4pm...I don't live or work anywhere near the restaurant so going to get Hot Doug's is only possible for me on a Sat...I had the blue cheese pork and gyro dog on my last two trips and they were fabulous! Sweet and Savory! The Really Good: DEEELISH hot dogs, drool-worthy duck fat fries (only offered fri and sat), and friendly staff. The Not So Good: Limited Hours, LONG lines and Pricey (for their daily specials, their regular menu is reasonable $1.50-$4.00), and limited seating. The Verdict: Despite it's limited hours and high price point, you can't beat the unique meat and flavor combos and the fact that Doug himself rings you up!
