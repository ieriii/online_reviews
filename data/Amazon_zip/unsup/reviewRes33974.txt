A couple friends and I made the mistake of coming here at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon thinking we'd get in without much of a wait - but I can't blame our naivete on Yolk. The wait was actually pretty pleasant - there's a large waiting area and the counter staff was happy to get us some coffee and water. The space is actually a lot bigger and more modern than I expected, as is the food. I had a bacon waffle with eggs on top, which was fun and different and also very good. One friend had the banana bread French toast, which tasted good but was a little too soggy for me, and the other had the Iron Man omelette, which was basically egg whites stuffed with meat - I didn't try his, but he certainly seemed to enjoy it. I want to come back to try their cinnamon and pecan rolls - their lunch menu also looked promising.
