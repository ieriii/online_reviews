On my first visit to Chicago, I tried a deep dish pizza and I have to say it wasn't the best and it scarred me until this restaurant! The deep dish pizza was amazing, filled with tons of cheesy mozzarella and amazing sauce. This pizza revived my appetite for deep dish! The carmelized crust was to die for. Overall this was amazing! I would definitely eat here the next time i'm around!
