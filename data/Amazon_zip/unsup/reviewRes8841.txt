Went here last night after finishing a long day of moving and cleaning. My fiance and I didn't want to bother with cooking dinner so we went to the take out area of the restaurant. We ordered our food and walked out with our meals in 10 minutes! The staff was very friendly and offered us some tea while we waited. They give you SO much food I had enough for 2 meals. I got the steak & chicken combo and my fiance got the steak & ground beef combo. We both enjoyed our dinner and we can't wait to try out the restaurant. You must try the feta, it's amazingly creamy!
