Went here during a food tour and had a chesse, tomato, and parmasean thin crust pizza and it was very good. I'm a Chicago deep dish guy and Piece had me wanting some thin stuff. They also brew their own beer and that was very good Golden Arm was the beer I preferred. They also have a live Karaoke band here on Saturday Nights and that sounded pretty cool...I'll be back and update folks.
