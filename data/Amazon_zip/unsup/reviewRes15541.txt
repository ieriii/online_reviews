I have been visiting Calo since I was a little guy of about 4 years old and traveling from Indiana to visit family and dine here for special events. This place has reinvented itself more times than Madonna and some of them for the better and some not so much. Their most recent has brought a new level of yum back to their marinara sauce that had been missing for a while.   Everything I have ever had here from the pizza to the ribs and everything in between has been wonderful. This is secretly one of the best rib joints in town, hidden under the Italian theme. The thin crust pizza here is amazingly good. Even better cold for breakfast the next morning. The sauce on their pizza is usually applied so it squishes out just the right amount with each bite. Never too much, never too little. And for delivery they are usually pretty quick compared to most. Do not be surprised if you have ordered delivery from here forever and go to dine in and find a totally different menu. They are willing to serve off of either menu when you dine in but the price will usually be a little higher. I love their stuffed shells and their Lasagna. OK enough with the food! The atmosphere here is part of the fun. Since the most recent remodel it has a new more up to date feel. They also have a huge additional private party dining room on the south end of the restaurant. We had dinner there for my cousins rehearsal dinner. The Chicken dinner we had was amazing. From what I understand Al Capone had dined here many times back in the day! So it also has a place in the deep Chicago Italian history. All around great Italian Restaurant!
