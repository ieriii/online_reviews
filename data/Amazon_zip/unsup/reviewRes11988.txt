not impressed. and i'm easily impressed. had the red velvet pancakes - they were too dense and the creme was thick, almost like wet flour. my sister had the brioche french toast - ok, that was good but not "OMG this is the best thing ever" good. scanned the crowd, they are too cool for little kids to be in their presence. felt that the waitress was rushing us. i wish the little boy that I was with could scream louder for me.
