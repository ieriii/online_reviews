So the guy and I went here a couple of months back after I convinced him to purchase a really rad Travel Zoo deal. We hardly ever get the chance to go out to a lovely italian meal (they don't serve pasta at Taco Bell, y'all), so we dressed up and went on a date. After driving around for-ev-er we decided to just valet the car. Valet, being, they told us to park the car in the valet spot and leave it there. Uh, okay! No charge, no hassle, but kind of weird. It had just started being consistently warm in Chicago so we asked for an outside table. DON'T. EAT. OUTSIDE, guys. The tables are soooooo tiny and smooshed against each other. I could barely cross my legs with the tiny space I had to fit my body between the chair and the table. Luckily during our meal the people behind the both of us left so we got a bit of breathing room. Our deal was good for a shared appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. We got the mussels to share and they were certainly delicious. For our entrees, he got the lobster ravioli, and me being the lil oinker I am bought the dish on the menu that includes every type of seafood ever. I believe it starts with a Z. After mowwing down the bread and mussels I was already feeling full but then here comes a VAT of pasta and seafood. I didn't really realize (see: read) what was all in this dish. Its pasta, mussels, scallops, etc. etc. etc. all swimming in a thin red sauce. I sat for a while eating what seafood I could before I ultimately quit. Dustin's lobster ravioli was really great, by the way, and of regular human portions. The server was nice enough to let us box up a piece of tiramisu so take home. (I didn't care for the tiramisu...I was trying to pretend it was chocolate cake. Dustin inhaled it though). I'm giving Sapori three stars because of the bad outside experience and my own bad ordering of food. I'd definitely go back to try something else. Since then the owner mailed us a coupon which is a nice touch. We'll see, Sapori....we'll see...
