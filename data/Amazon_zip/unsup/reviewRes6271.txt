Just went here for the fifth time and this place NEVER disappoints. The restaurant is very nice inside but has a very laid back and casual vibe. If you're in a dress you won't stick out. If you're in a t-shirt and jeans you won't either. This time we had fried calamari for an appetizer. Although I'm not a big fan of anything fried, I have to say this is the softest calamari I've ever had. The three of us each had a different cut of steak cooked a different way. All were fabulous. The red skinned mashed were delicious and my goat cheese cranberry salad was excellent. Service is always good, even though they are constantly busy. We got a great bottle of red to compliment a perfect dinner. Last but not least, the banana coconut pie is to DIE for! Get it! Go....NOW!
