The food is as good as I was expecting. I wish the apps were a bit more creative than just simple seafood. Its a place to see and be seen for sure but its just like all the other steakhouses in Chicago. From the pretzel rolls in the breadbasket to the shrimp cocktail(dry ice doesnt make it better), traditional sides and typical cuts of beef Its a place to see and be seen for now but its just like all the other steakhouses in Chicago......but 30% more expensive than the rest. I think if this City wasnt already packed with outstanding steakhouses this would be the place to be but theres nothing at Mastros to bring me back. Also, I like that the steak comes on a 400 degree plate to keep it warm but please dont hand it directly to me......put it down and slide it over.Lobster Mashed Potatos are great, big lobster chunks.Strip Steak was cooked perfectly and had good flavor
