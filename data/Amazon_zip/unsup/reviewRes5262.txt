3.5 stars what we had: - Beets: if all we ordered were the beets, this would have been a 5 star rating. highly recommended - Pig tail: tasty dish, 3.5-4 stars, good to try at least once, but probably wouldn't order again. - Bone Marrow: 3.5 stars, based on all the yelp reviews of the bone marrow here, we had to get it, but i was somewhat disappointed. - Pork Shoulder: 4 stars, this was a solid dish. very hearty and the meat was very tender. what we should've ordered: - after putting in our order, we see the table next to us being served a tasty looking turkey leg. the portion was pretty big and from what i remember of the price, it was a really good deal for the amount of food you get.
