Wife and I went there on a weeknight a couple weeks ago. An encouraging sign to see the place 90% full at 9:15 on a Thursday night. Shortly after we sat down we were personally greeted by Tony himself. I had read about Tony's Chili Chicken in Yelp reviews and after meeting Tony I felt obligated to order it. Started off with String Bean Spicy Black Sauce. Great start! Tony's Chicken is quite good. We made the mistake of ordering another dish that has that sweet and sour/spicy taste. Too much of one style of food. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I would be more adventurous and try new things. ENORMOUS menu with many fun things to try. Place is not that big, so I would expect a wait at peak times, but I haven't experienced that yet. One strange aspect of our experience was how fast they brought the food. Too fast.
