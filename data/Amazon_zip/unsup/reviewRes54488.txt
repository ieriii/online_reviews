i've been there three times and had three disappointing experiences with the service. i heard about the famous chicago diner when i lived across the country, so imagine my excitement to finally try it when i moved to chicago. i anticipated i'd love it and went there with a great attitude. on my first visit, i approached the front door excitedly and was abruptly and rudely told by a sassy little man that there was a wait. a wait? sure, no problem. but the little man stormed off without taking our names or directing us to sit somewhere, etc. my friend and i were left taken aback and confused, so we left and found someplace else. my next vist -- my first real visit--was for my birthday. the food was good--lots of fun, and even my carnivore dad liked his faux meat. we sat outside, which was lovely. my group was all in good spirits, but unfortunately our server was dour and aloof. he was not necessarily impolite, but he acted annoyed when we asked for recommendations or posed questions about the menu, and we barely saw him except for when the food came out. he was really kind of a buzzkill. the third time i went with two girlfriends. again, good food, awesome menu, but the server (this time a female) was aloof and distant at our table, and acted annoyed. i think it would be fun and cool to work at a place like that... i'm not sure if it's just a bad coincidence that i've had these experiences, but there's something really offputting about the whole annoyed, brooding, trendy hipster thing i've now three times encountered there. i've learned my lesson and will not be back. i've since found other delicious, cool, friendly, and fun vegetarian restaurants in the city.
