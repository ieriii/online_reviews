This is the best place ever and they great customer service. I would eat here every night if my girlfriend let me. Also I don't think this place clams to have the worlds greatest margaritas like every other Mexican joint in town but they do, and if you go on Tue or Thurs they are half off. To some it up in three words, THIS PLACE ROCKS!
