I've been here a few times recently and it hasn't disappointed. I've eaten a little of a lot of the food here and I have to say, the winners are the chorizo burrito, the chocolate french toast and the BLT eggs Benedict. Try any of these and you'll leave smiling. The service is always nice and attentive. They have Cholula on the table and my coffee is topped up pretty regularly. The food comes out fast and hot. I really don't know what more you can expect from a place. There's usually a wait in the mornings, but you can't blame a place for being good. Plus, it's totally worth the wait.
