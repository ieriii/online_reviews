I went on a Sunday an hour before they closed, having called first and having asked if that would be a problem and having been told not at all, come right in. My girlfriend and I split a Greek salad with a side of potato salad. The table next to us got flaming cheese as an appetizer, making me jealous. The Diet Coke came in a small glass bottle. They were sold out of the two chicken specials I had my eye on, so I asked the waiter what dishes featured boneless chicken and he recommended the breast. Girlfriend asked what's with the boneless thing, are you a 12 year old now? I got the breast. She got the lamb gyro plate. For dessert we split a baklava custard thingy. It was all really good. I'm going back for the flaming cheese- I bet that's the best and worst part of training new servers. Not sure how many new servers they get though- seems like a tight knit Greek sailor crew.
