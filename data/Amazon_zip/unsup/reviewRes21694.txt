Love love this place. You wouldn't know it from the outside, but this place is much much more than your typical quick mexican food joint. It's not real bright inside, but definitely feels relaxing. The staff is helpful, attentive and very friendly. The menu has a good variety - favorites and unique selections. I got the fiesta chimichanga and it was amazing. Not too crunchy, not too soft - just right. Sangria was great, and so was the passion flower margarita. The prices were moderate, two people can easily get huge meals for a total $25 bucks with no drinks. I can't wait to go back.
