I say this is more like a 4 1/2 stars place. The food was quite good and they have some innovative cocktails. I enjoyed the dinner, but our waiter wass just too busy. It took a while to get service each time. Dishes also took a bit to come out. We ordered three appetizers and three main courses to share. All the dishes are all tasty and the foie gras lollipop with pop rock was fun. I enjoyed the Caesar salad the best, the Twinkie crouton is a bit much though. A big plus was that they opened on Sunday night.
