Disappointed after reading great reviews. Sandwiches had wilted lettuce and the taste just wasn't all there... The papa rellenas were excellent though! Great taste, warm, yummy, and full of flavor, and only about 2 bucks! The beef empanada was okay, but the guava/cheese one was much better... We did get there around closing time...
