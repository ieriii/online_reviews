So worth the trip up north for the Peking Duck. And I guess everyone else thinks so too, judging by the crowd. The restaurant is packed and although there seem to be neighborhood people here, the balance has tipped to the yup side. This won't deter me, though, because this Duck is done right. The kitchen is in view. They prepare the carry out right at the front of the store. For a bit of authenticity, check out the dessicated fowl hanging upside down in the front window!
