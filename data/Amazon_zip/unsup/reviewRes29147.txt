I hate that I missed out on the great experience that everyone else is raving about. I guess I caught Frontera on an off day. My wife really wanted to go because she likes Chef Bayless. We decided to hit Frontera during lunch to save a few bucks. My $6.50 basic margarita was served in what seemed like a shot glass. Ok, it was bigger than that but not much. And I was very disappointed...it was nothing spectacular and was no different than my local Mexican eatery. Worse, actually. I ordered the Cazuela de Borrego al Pasilla, which was lamb simmered in chile sauce. It sounded adverterous and like a good choice. The waiter took our order and forgot about us. Nearly an hour later, we received our food, after many others who got there after us had begun eating. We even sat in the bar so that we did not have to wait. My entre was ok, but certainly not memorable. It was spicy but really lacked any flavor. Our entres were comped so I'll tip my cap in appreciation of them doing the right thing. Since most others love the place, I'll assume that I caught Frontera on a bad day. But my experience was a bad one.
