I was in a crunch, needing to book a Chicago hotel room the night before I arrived without any idea where to go, and the Essex Inn came through for me. Kind of. Located in the South Loop it's within walking distance to the Art Institute and Millennium Park (both a must). However, there is really nothing within the immediate area and you'll have to go at least a mile to get good food. The hotel itself is, well, dated. But, on the upside, you're in Chicago and shouldn't be spending that much time in your hotel anyways. The dcor in the entry and lounge area is very, very, very 80s. Clearly their embracing it because the music was basically Raspberry Beret, Just Died in Your Arms and various Duran Duran songs on loop. Given that you basically have to wait 20 minutes for an elevator (which is already a tiny slice of hell) I think this may constitute a verbal assault. The overall feel of the place is that is maybe trendy at some point 20 to 30 years ago and is clutching to it in a fairly depressing way. Hallways are a bit dim. The breakfast was just sad and pathetic. Nothing can be salvaged; I suggest you go down the street to Yolk. The room itself was decently sized, borderline tight, but I could see it being just too small if you wanted to fit 3 or 4 people in. The bathroom was one of those small ones where opening and closing the door becomes a total production. The shower pressure was pretty abysmal and sometimes the water wouldn't heat up until the second shower (it wasn't winter either), but they had good shampoos and soaps (which I totally didn't take with me...). Wifi was so-so. The heater/AC was possibly from the 50s and was entirely dysfunctional.  The people were friendly in that Mid-Western sort of way. I paid around $160/night with taxes. It was fine since I booked last minute, but you can absolutely find better hotels for better prices in Chicago.
