Tasting menu with refined flavors in a more casual atmosphere. $55 for 4-courses isn't too bad! I was thinking I'd leave hungry though: 1st course salad - good but small 2nd course soup - tasty but also on the smaller side 3rd course entree - lamb so good but could I really pick up the bone and chow down on the extra meat? 4th course dessert - extra LARGE portion! The chocolate bomb was intense and had some lovely spices mixed in to cut the rich chocolate Espresso helped with the digestion process Menu changes seasonally but expect to leave feeling satisfied. The space was smaller and much more intimate than I had expected. There is no menu so the knowledgeable servers tell you about each dish which all sounds good except I cannot concentrate on hearing about what's in a dish when I just want to bite in and try it for myself!
