Thank you, thank you, thank you Purple Pig!  On my recent trip to Chicago I finally had a chance to check out the PP. I took it as a great sign when there was a 20 minute wait around 1:30PM on a Saturday, I had no issues waiting especially after taking a peek of what was on other diner's plates. We went with the heirloom tomatoes tossed with raw corn and pesto. This dish is simple, effective and delicious! Next came the milk braised pork shoulder. Again, very delicious. Finally we got to the pork neck gravy w/ ricotta. The theme continued, all very tasty.  Really good service, great wine list and cool ambiance. The only negative here is if you need to wash your hands or use the restroom, you're going to wait around 15-20 minutes. It's just busy and the bathroom lines reflect that. I'll definitely be back!
