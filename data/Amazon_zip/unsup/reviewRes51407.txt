My 3 favorite things about Garcias 1. their salsa. SOOOOOO GOOD! I'm picky about my salsa and their's is more like pico than salsa. It's slightly hot, super flavorful and delicious with the chip if you put a dash of salt on the chips! 2. Torta!!!!! EVERYTHING i love about mexican food on a bun! I'm also picky about buns (i don't like bread products), but their buns are soft but very well toasted and not too bready. I always get it with melted cheese. 3. speaking of cheese....the quesadillas!!!!!!!! I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use on all their food, but it's probably the most delicious mexican cheese EVERRRR. I'm chinese, but eating their quesadilla with extra salsa and sour cream and a little lettuce and tomato just feeeels like comfort food that i've been eating since a baby.  honorable mentions: their beans are delicious and the burritos are ginormous
