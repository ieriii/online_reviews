I moved to Boystown on the first of July. While this was not a move into the city, it was definitely a day that was completely stressful. I was ever so thankful when my friend texted me to say that she had ordered pizza for everyone that night. What came was The Art of Pizza. Two pizzas, one thin crust and another deep dish, came to the house. I knew that something special had arrived when I saw that the pizza was wrapped in tin foil (just like it should be). While the thin crust was really good (and who doesn't like that every now and again?), the real winner was the deep dish. Fully cooked (sometimes doesn't happen!), crusty cornmeal crust filled with cheesy goodness and topped with a sweet tomato sauce. I wanted to eat the entire thing but was full from one piece the ultimate sign of a good pizza. Definitely only ordering pizza from here to fulfill my deep dish needs. Spinach pizza all the way!
