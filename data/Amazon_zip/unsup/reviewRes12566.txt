Looking forward to returning. At a table with three others, I sampled lamb chops (perfection); scallops (huge and a little spicy); duck (a bit undercooked at first, but when it came back from the kitchen, exquisite); fresh young green salads; and amazing desserts, especially a breathtaking quava cheesecake I'm going to try to make at home. Good wine list and moderately priced bottles - a real plus. The Ben Marco Malbec was dark, intense and perfect with the meal. My only complaint? The service was a little too attentive - as if that were a problem.
