Timewaster. Over-priced. Emotionally disturbed staff. GO ELSEWHERE. When you go to Fox & Obel, you are paying for its location. It is a few blocks away from Navy Pier and across the street from a metropolitan movie theater. Where does all the money you pay for this offensively expensive merchandise go? The rent. And the owners. I am certain the staff barely clear minimum wage. Once, many years ago, this place was a quaint specialty shop with friendly service and a relaxing atmosphere. I suppose the ownership has changed, which is why the restrooms are often foul, the pastry cases are full of gnats, and the staff look and act as though they should be on complimentary anti-depressants. You'd be better off going almost anywhere else.
