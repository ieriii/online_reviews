I had my Birthday dinner here and the staff was more than accommodating! More people showed up than expected and they were quick to rearrange our table. Since we were such a large party (14 people) we had to order off of the party menu. This worked out great! Pick two choices from each course (I did ahead of time) and get all you can eat. The fillet was great considering the number they had to cook at once. I have always enjoyed the food here, and I will continue to come back.
