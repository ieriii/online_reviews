Fast service, great food and Vegetarian friendly makes this place one of my favs!! Is cheap and quick without the guilt of compromising your health! Must eats: -Falafel!!! They are gig enough to feed a small army. I have had them with and without the hot sauce... i like it better without. The hot sauce masks the flavors that this middle eastern food is known for! -Babaganosh. Please excuse the spelling if its off.. But this hummus like dip is hearty, smokey, and a piece of heaven. - Veggie Plate. Even the nonbelievers when it comes to veggies will love this plate. Lentils, rice, falafel, and whatever else you choose seem to all play on each others different spices. Check it out and if you didn't fall in love with this Chicago jem then you are just beyond help!
