I'm glad that Hot Doug continues to do well at his new location, I missed his old Roscoe Village shop for a while, but the California Av. location does have its advantages, such as more street parking! I don't recall that I've ever tried a "regular" hot dog here as I am always intrigued by the specials & "gourmet" offerings. There is ALWAYS a line out the door on saturdays, but the food is worth the wait, you can spend your wait time reviewing the different menu options . The counter is run by Doug himself & the atmosphere is very friendly in spite of being very very busy. The duck fat fries served on Fridays & Saturdays are not to be missed! I only wish Hot Doug's was open on Sundays too!
