Looks like I'm not the first person to discover this place ... still, it's one of the best things that the neighborhood has going. Sultan's has a small menu and sticks to what it knows best. The best part apart from the food itself that you'll get your meal VERY quickly; they do enough volume that everything is ready to go pretty much any time day or night. It's literally got to be quicker than McDonald's. I actually had to flip a coin once to decide between the falafel and the shawarma.
