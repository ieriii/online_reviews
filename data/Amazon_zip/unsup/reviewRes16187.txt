Having written previously about how wonderful Calo is, the only thing I found wonderful last night was the Pizza. My neighbors had the $9.99 baby back ribs and I could see how much smaller the portion has become in the last year or two. The salad has become much smaller, in fact is really skimpy. I am sure both of these cut backs are necessitated because Calo is charged more by their suppliers. This is the only way they can still charge $9.99.
