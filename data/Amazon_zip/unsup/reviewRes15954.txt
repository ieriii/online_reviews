I'm a big fan of Carnivale. Big venue. Big groups are welcome. Big food portions. I guess big is the keyword in this review. Big bill. Hang out at the bar while you're waiting for your table. Love the high ceilings decor. Very colorful and just full of art. Jerry is my brother's client and a real nice guy. Occasionally, he'll stop by your table to chat you up for a bit. Reminds me of Rocky Balboa (the movie).
