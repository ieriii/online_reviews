Been wanting to try it, wanting to try it, wanting to try it... Finally tonight we tried it. Tuesday night after shopping at gesthemene for trees, etc. The plus: the fried chicken was fresh and fried to order and to a perfect doneness, wherein even the breast meat was juicy and hot.  The negative: The chicken, despite all that was good about it lacked in the seasoning department. Also, it was that sort of fried chicken where the coating is that thick hard crunchy corn meal affair. Some people really like that style. I do not.  The sides, well there was no choice in the matter, "grilled" sweet corn and sweet potatoe puree. The corn flavorless if you don't count the burned part and the sweet potato, reminiscent of baby food, room temperature and underseasoned also. good for baby, bad for me. We did order a supplement of mac and cheese, not on the menu, per se. It was ok (small ramekin, $6). The service: It reminded me of what you might get from a part timer at Friday's or Chilis and alot of the time gabbing with co-workers/friends at the back of the dining room when he could have paid attention to me, the paying customer. The price: $90 for chicken dinner for two. I'll happily pay that for chicken dinner and have at West Town Tavern, but there, the food is really flavorful and the service great and the atmosphere wonderful.  Big Jones was a big let down.
