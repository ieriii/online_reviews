I've only ever been to the Oyster Bar. It's a great time in there and more casual than the dining room. More often than not, I sit at the bar with a friend listening to whatever band is playing. If you do it smartly, you can leave the bar with a full stomach, a slight buzz and having spent $25 or so. (Not bad considering that there are some expensive menu items, but I digress.) Sounds expensive, but not truly. Try their lobster bisque soup. That alone should help fill you up and it's good.
