If the economy is good and you have $200+ to spare, this is a must-have indulgence. The service alone is better than Disney World and the food is just amazing. I went with my fiance and we each ordered a separate tasting menu (that way we could share). The staff was intelligent and not stuffy, constantly checking to make sure our wine and water were full, and we got to pick which napkin color we wanted! Know going in this is going to cost A LOT but believe me it is worth it.
