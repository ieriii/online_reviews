Was there this past Saturday for breakfast. They do chilaquiles right! Excellent depth of flavor to all their dishes and an excellent level of heat. They have thee best refried beans in the city! Service is warm and attentive even when busy. Serious good eats for two and we didn't even spend 20 dollars!!!
