Nuevo Leon is pretty good, I always go there with my family when we want to go to a sit down Mexican restaurant. They have your chips & salsa, and the little peppers and carrots in spicy oil or whatever when you sit down. The food is pretty good here, real authentic, I enjoy their Menudo (i.e., tripe--the lining of a cow's belly), this mexican soup with limes and onions as garnish in it. I also have had their steak and chicken fajitas or tacos, and tacos de lengua (tongue)...all pretty solid. It is BYOB, which is a drawback but nice at the same time, you get to save the money on your booze but you gotta bring it and everything. I would definitely recommend it.
