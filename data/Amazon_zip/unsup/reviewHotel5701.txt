It was our first time to Chicago; we didn't know what to expect. I booked this hotel off of the great reviews on Yelp. We were very pleased with this hotel, easy check-in, clean, updated rooms, friendly staff. Added bonuses of free chilled bottled water stations on every floor and free wifi! GREAT location; we walked everywhere. Close to a lot of great restaurants as well. We defiantly recommend this hotel and will stay here for our next Chicago visit!
