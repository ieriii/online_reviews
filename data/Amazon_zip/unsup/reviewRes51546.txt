I work right by here, so I have been going more frequently then I used too. I first went to Garcia's with a group of friends and had a blast and have been introducing other friends to the place ever since. The food is almost always fantastic. In fairness, I do tend to stick the the same few dishes, but I have been making it a point to branch out a little more. (Recommended: enchiladas). I did try their Spinach quesadillas, though, and was disappointed. They were soggy and not what I expected from a place that has such satisfying cheese quesadillas. Oh well. What they lack in spinach they most definitely make up for in Pineapple margaritas. If for no other reason, check out Garcia's for those--they also have mango and the usual strawberry and a few other flavors. They are PHENOMENAL, as in delicious and strong. The service, I have noticed, is something that can improve. The hostess is usually pretty nice, but the wait-staff doesn't have much consistency. Most of the times I have been there it has been OK, one time it was just bad. In talking to other friends who frequent the restaurant I have discovered that they have noticed the same thing, so I guess the service is pretty hit-or-miss. One or two of those margaritas, though, and you probably won't notice.
