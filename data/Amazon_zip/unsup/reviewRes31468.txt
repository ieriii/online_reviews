I was disappointed with the food at Sunda. The decor was beautiful and seemed like a hip place to be but the food was definitely not up to par. We ordered several roles of sushi which was probably the most horrible out of our meal. The rice on the roll was mushy and just not fit for sushi. The garlic noodle had no taste and definitely overpriced for a dish a 5 year old can do. To give them credit, there were 2 dishes that were actually really decent. Their Sea Bass dish and their special brussel sprout salad was really superb.
