Great burger, fries were fantastic, and the beer selection was dynamite!!! Had the hangover with chipotle seasoned fries. Burger was fantastic, over easy egg provided nice contrast for the rest of the burger which sported ham, tomato, lettuce, thin sliced onion, and mustard. Fries were great especially with the chipotle seasoning. I paired the burger and fries with a new Holland brewing el Mole Ocho which enhanced the flavors in my mouth. Unfortunately for me this place is close and I am going to have to add this place to the list of regular stops. If you have complaints about this place look in the mirror and realize your a douche.
