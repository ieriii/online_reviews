Perhaps the most authentic of Chicago's Neapolitan/roman style pizza places. Beware though- this isn't Chicago or New York style pizza. The crust is chewy and soggy and the sauce is minimal and it is not covered with cheese. However, everything is fresh and delicious. The menu is not large but everything is excellent- especially the buffillino pizza (made with buffalo mozzarella, Basil and tasty tomato sauce. This place has a reconstructed wood burning oven from Naples. On a side note- there is usually a long line but the owner is usually passing out slices of cheese, spiced pizza dough, olives and taking orders for spirits. The deserts are good too. There's a gelato ball of chocolate ice cream rolled in cocoa, hazel nuts... and it all surrounds a hazelnut gelato center with a huge hazelnut... mmm.
