I've been here twice because it is close to where I live and I LOVE mexican. This place is very disappointing and I'm sort of surprised that it has survived in this neighborhood. I like simple things like tacos and enchiladas. Frankly, some of the worst mexican food.  You can do much better in terms of food. I guess most people go here for the margaritas and then get so drunk they don't really care how the food tastes!
