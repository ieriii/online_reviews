After my first trip here, I was ready to give this place 5 stars. I had the wild boar sloppy joe, which was excellent, and an Old Fashioned, which was even better. I also tried their Manhattan, which was good, but paled in comparison to the Old Fashioned. Also, I found their much-touted selection of brown liquors to be as good as advertised. The second time I went back I tried the duck rillettes and the seared scallops. The rillettes were quite good, but the scallops left me wanting more. There were two of them. For thirteen dollars. That said, I'm still a big fan, just more of the "pub" than the "gastro". Update: I've been back many times since writing this review, and I have to say, this place really is the standard to which all gastropubs should aspire.
