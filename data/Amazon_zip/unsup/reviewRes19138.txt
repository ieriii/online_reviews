We went to the Bad Apple the second night it was open with a group of friends, and we were pleasantly surprised at how great the service and the food was so soon after opening. It is at the end of my street, so I had very high hopes that this would be my new go-to burger joint since Bowmans has disappointed a few too many times. Out of the group of 6, we each ordered a different burger and everyone loved their choices. I had the Pat LaFrieda (blue cheese and arugula) and it was delish. Hand cut fries were amazing. Best part - each burger is only about $7 or $8 and waaay tastier than any other options in the hood. The game room is a definite bonus - old school Pac Man and Scattergories rounded out our night. My one complaint is the only light beer they have is PBR. Not that I don't love a good PBR, but a little variety would be good. We actually loved it so much that we went back Saturday for a late night dinner after Lolla. I scarfed a plate of the Poutine fries, died and went to heaven.
