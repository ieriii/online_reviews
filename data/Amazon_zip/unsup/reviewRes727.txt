Wonderful experience. Food is unique and I am a big eater and after the 12 course tasting I was plentifully full. If you have the money to spend and you really appreciate culinary expertise at its best, Alinea will be a wonderful experience. Wine pairings are a must even if you aren't big on wine. You get a buzz while eating good food, and the wines are excellent- especially the desert wines. The meal goes by slowly but each dish is presented by the wait staff who explain questions thoroughly. Overall A++ performance and wonderful birthday dinner. Hot Potato, Cold Potato- those who have been already know what I mean... Those who haven't should go to find out!!!
