I'm extremely picky about my tomato pie and after experiencing well over two dozen pizzeria's in Chicago I'm confident with saying that Spacca Napoli is the best. I've had pizza in Italy and strongly feel that the taste and texture at Spacca are spot on authentic. I also read the menu at Spacca and learned that the owner study the art of making pizza in Italy and received a certification. You gotta try it!
