I went here for lunch with friends yesterday. I do like the decor, it's very homey. And the restaurant is set up cafeteria style. I got my meal from the salad bar, and it was pretty decent. The shrimp in the salad bar is super yummy, and the artichokes taste good as well. My friend got some sort of desert, so I tried some and it was really yummy. I think I need to go back and try another dish, because I'm really wanting to give this place 4 stars, and I have faith that Sultan's deserves that.
