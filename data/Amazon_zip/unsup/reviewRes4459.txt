A must if you want to go to an original blues / jazz club in Chicago. This is the place I bring people if they want to see an original Chicago staple. Old Al Capone hang out and if they have a vigil of him behind the bar which includes his picture and a single lit candle. Wednesday is swing night which they perform as an old 1930's or 40's radio broadcast. Drinks are moderately priced as well and they always have specials on PBR. Love this place.
