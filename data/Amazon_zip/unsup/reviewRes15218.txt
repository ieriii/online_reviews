The only times I have been here have been when I've been expensing it. If not, I would be much more broke. I have never waited for a table here, but I'm sure eventually my luck will run out. I know. A-hole alert. The drinks are great. Of course they are. Expert level everything: Austin 75, In the Pines, and the Dark and Stormy. Sweet, interesting, bright, borderline deceptive alcohol content. Service is pretty hands off. Nowhere in Wicker Park that I've been to really had good service, though, and I have a couple theories on why. We ordered food - crispy fries, wonderful onion-y gnocchi, cod croquettes, and crostini. All were good. So why 4? I love craft cocktails and I've accepted this generally makes me sound like a douche extraordinaire. I generally am super easy to please with any well made cocktail - which these so, so are, and they're serious about doing them well. But Violet Hour isn't the number one choice for me when I have $30 to burn on liquor, and it's because... it's more pretentious than I am. Reading the twee-tastic chirpy bizarro reviews of it confirms to me that I'm not nuts, but the irritating patrons are more a matter of Wicker Park being an odd place and aren't the bar's fault. Well worth trying. Dress up a little.
