Great food and atmosphere. Some items are overpriced in my view. Individual press coffee is $7 ?? However, given the quality of ingredients and preparation, most items are fairly priced. It is a great addition to the neighborhood.  I do not recommend this place for certain types of music. If it is a louder type of performance, no problem. If not, it can be very frustrating. We recently saw a Samba band and could barely hear them over the patrons. No attempt was made to deal with the situation. It was very obvious that the performers were also frustrated. I hope that UG management reads these postings and will take this into consideration. I would have e-mailed them directly, but there site does not provide for that.
