OK so when my friend invited me to this restaurant and I heard where it was located, I almost said no way! ( the neighborhood is not the best a little shady if you ask me) however from my passed experiences I knew that some times you can find a diamond in the rough. I decided to give it a try, from the outside it appeared like a hole in the wall. after walking through the small hallway ( entrance), the decor was nice and modern the chairs looked comfortable and if I were a designer I would have wanted these for my loft. I looked through the menu, first at their prices then at the food. I am not one to care for menus that contain pictures, to me this does not look classy and makes the place look cheap; i must admit however that if you never had sushi or are not familiar with the terms a picture helps, which by the way were tastefully photographed. I ordered the traditional Miso soup, which was made quite to my standards (great). Then on to the sushi...we ordered an array of sushi. when they brought our sushi to the table it looked so pretty and tasted very good. I will not get into what I ordered specifically, but the presentation and taste of everything I ordered was perfect. for the desert we had a mango cheesecake which looked oh so pretty and was the best cheese cake I have had up to this day. after ordering the soup, drinks, sushi and desert the price was so reasonable i was in shock when I got the bill ( in a good way). I will go there again very soon as my mouth is watering to have more. The service was good, the waitress was pleasant. I would like to see them in a better area though. That is why I give them 4 stars. If the service would have been just a tinny bit better I would have given the 5. Thank you Indie for the great cuisine, I'll be back soon. P.S. I would definitely bring a date to this place.
