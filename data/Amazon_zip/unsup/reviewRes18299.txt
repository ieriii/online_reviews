I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty crowded. There was a private party going on so we were seated in the back room. It was a little crowded in the restaurant, but we didn't mind the intimate atmosphere. The waiters were very nice and smiled a lot. They seemed sincere about their recommendations and the service was great.  Food: They have very large portions, but the food is pretty tasty. The meatballs were the size of my fist! You can go here and end up splitting with how large the portions are. I had the caprese salad and even had a tough time finishing that. The calamari appetizer was large enough to split among four people without filling us up. A problem was that the large plates did not go well with the small tables they have. There was limited room to move around. Oh well. It was still a delicious time.  Caro Mio is also a BYOB (yay!) and they have not corking fee (double yay!). Funny that they carded me and my boyfriend though as we are way beyond our 21st birthdays. LOL!
