I met XOCO through one of my most-trusted friends in food-reviews: the New York Times. I've heard wonderful things about the chef, Rick Bayless, but have not had the chance to try any of his restaurants. I was walking around the neighborhood and stopped by Xoco around 4pm. Good timing because there was not a line (as I've heard that it can be quite long).  Xoco's decor is simple and modern, bright colors that are well-balanced with black & white photographs. My boyfriend had the mole poblano torta, a Mexican sandwich that shines with the bread, which is made in a wood-burning oven. The smoky flavor of the wood-grilled onions is a perfect contrast with the slow-braised pork. It was the best torta I've ever tasted. I had the "meal-in-a-bowl" wood-roasted chicken pozole caldo, a dish that really resonated with me, a Vietnamese who eats noodle soup as a meal often. The broth is simple but flavorful, the crunchy garnishes are very fresh and made of good quality ingredients. It is a comforting choice for the famous windy city. Recommended by a lady sitting next to us, I went back to the counter and waited in line to order the churros, paired with hot chocolate that is made from fresh-roasted cacao beans on the premises (you can smell the cacao from the streets). It was a decision I'm thankful I made. My favorite Mexican dessert has been flan up to then. Now I also include churros and chocolate from Xoco. What a fun meal that gives a different perspective of the Mexican street food experience! It would be worth the line.
