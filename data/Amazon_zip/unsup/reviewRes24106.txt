Greek Islands has the best Mediterranean Sea Bass anywhere in the city. It is very similar to the fresh sea bass I would get in the small towns in Spain. Nice light white fish with lemon, olive oil, oregano and salt. Simple and delicious. I've heard they fly in the sea bass directly from Greece twice a week and are able to do so because of the volume they sell. Whatever the case may be, it's great. The grilled octopus and cold plate are great also. That's pretty much everything I have had there. This place is a can't miss. It's always great. If you like seafood, check it out.
