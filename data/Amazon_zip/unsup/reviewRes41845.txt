I would either go here or Chinatown whenever I visited Chicago when I used to live in Madison, WI. The Pho was very good, I always got the one with tripes, tendons, and meatballs. Also, the portion was huge. As I remembered, they have pretty good fried rice. It's a perfect eatery stop after shopping for some Asian food supplies at a nearby Asian store.
