It's been a few years since I first ate here (3 maybe?) but I still remember it. Same boy, big group of people. I had a great wine flight (including a sexy spanish red) and funny enough, I think we split another pork belly dish, which I believe is no longer on the menu. It was definitely not as good as the one at Tizi Melloul. We were a large (and somewhat boisterous) group and the wait staff seemed a bit discombobulated in figuring out how to handle it all.  I've been back since then just once, and just for the wine. I recommend getting a flight if you do - they give pretty generous pours!
