My 1-star rating is based entirely on Coast's new, overbearing byob policy. I recently learned the hard way that alcohol will be limited to 1 bottle of wine per 2 people, and you can no longer bring in hard alcohol at all. I understand that they were having people stay too long and get too drunk, but how about a policy of we reserve the right to ask you to leave at any time? Is the sushi still good? Yep. Will Coast still be at the top of my list of sushi joints: Probably not.
