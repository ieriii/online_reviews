Everytime I go there the food and staff are AMAZING!!! and inexpensive-the food that is w/ good size portions. For my boyfriend and I, it cost $22 for an appetizer, entree (Scrambled Tofu Delight Tahini & tamari seasoned tofu with sunflower & sesame seeds, lightly sauteed with vegetable medley. Served with brown rice mix & cornbread. 8.95), 2 coffees and a piece of German chocolate cake for dessert. I mentioned it was my boyfriend's birthday and the entire restaurant sang happy birthday to him! It's a great place to eat becuase you can get vegetarian + vegan food that tastes delicious and as a bonus they serve alcohol and play great music.
