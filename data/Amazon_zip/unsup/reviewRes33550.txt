My husband and I gave a gift certificate from Francesca's to my mother-in-law for Christmas, based on the wonderful food we had at Francesca's Forno in Bucktown, where we went for our anniversary. My mother-in-law decided to come into the city to have dinner at Francesca's with us, so we headed to Mia Francesca, since it was closer. I have to say, I didnt think the service was great. The waiter came for our drink order right away, then waited a long time to take our food order. He finally came over, and we ordered calamari for an appetizer. He didn't even ask if we were ready to order our main meals, and he left. Our calamari came out, and I will admit, it was good. Not at all rubbery, as it can be. it wasn't until our appetizer was long gone that the waiter came back over to get our food order, which I thought was odd. In any case, I ordered the linguine with shrimp and scallops, topped with tomato sauce. When I got the plate, my first thought was, "where is the sauce?" The linguine had a very thin coating of sauce on it, and 3-4 pieces of tomato, that was it. The dish itself wasn't very flavorful. My father-in-law, who had ordered the same thing, was the first to mention in was bland and he also noticed the lack of sauce. I'm pretty picky with my Italian food, so perhaps that's part of the problem. I just didn't think this meal was worth the price. I could have made something better at home. My husband did enjoy his spaghetti with mushrooms, and my mother-in-law said her lasagna was just OK.
