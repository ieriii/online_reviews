Let me cut through the hype of yet another new restaurant quickly overrated by Yelpers. Longman & Eagle has a long way to go before it can be even stand in the same league as other great restaurants and gastropubs. The meatball appetizer was good but nothing fabulous. The short rib I ordered was very fatty and almost raw. The server never asked me how I wanted it done and not only was it difficult to cut through, but also not very tasty to eat. My date's wild boar sloppy joe was spicy, but the best dish out of everything we ordered. Wish I had ordered that. The pudding dessert was not memorable at all. The restaurant itself is small, crowded, and drafty. There were space heaters in a couple of locations, including one by the drafty table by the door, which we got, so my date and I had to huddle together for warmth. This is after we waited an hour and a half for a table because they don't take reservations. I don't understand why some places don't take reservation, it's archaic, stupid, and makes me not want to eat at your restaurant. We ended up having to wait longer because they apparently couldn't find us though we were standing right there by the bar in full view of the host stand the entire time. But the host did bring us two complimentary glasses of prosecco to make up for it, which I appreciated. The only reason I would come back here would be to try other beers on their menu. They have an extensive and unique selection of beers that I haven't seen anywhere else. I tasted three of them--all were terrific. Service was satisfactory. Our server seemed knowledgeable about the food and drink menu and offered suggestions. Helpful tip: there's a public metered lot across the street so parking here is a breeze. Come early or late to avoid the wait.
