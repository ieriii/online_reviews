loved the atmosphere, yes its always packed and a small place but thats not something that bothers me because the service is great and the food is delicious. last night was my second time there, had the vegan gyro with sweet potato fries the first time and the "chicken bacon" ranch with sweet potato fries as well, tried the peanut butter puck and the snickerdoodle, everything is delicious. definitely my new favorite place. The wait kinda sucks but it wasnt too bad, id say 15 minutes. Love this place, definitely worth checking out. Will say it was the only vegan restaurant i have been to though.
