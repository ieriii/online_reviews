I've heard mixed reviews about this place but I'll be a loyal customer here. It is definitely fun to go when its cold outside, you can grab a table close to the fireplace and have good bear and a warm meal. I got the macaroni and cheese last time and it definitely worked. The interior is fun with a warm feeling and they play Irish music. Can't lose.
