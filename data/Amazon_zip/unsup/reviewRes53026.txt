Oh me oh my oh. My expectations were high-oh... after reading the reviews, I couldn't wait to grab a bite here. We pulled into 90 Miles and walked into a quaint restaurant. It was a welcoming environment and the walls were filled with interesting pictures and news articles. Wish we could have stayed to experience the service and soak up the "local" flavor, but alas, the demands of life made that impossible. We placed our order and waited about 10 - 15 minutes for our food to be ready. Upon getting home, we opened our bag of goodies. We ordered Bistec, Ropa Vieja, empanadas (guava and goat cheese), tostones, and bread pudding. My ropa vieja was pretty good, nothing extraordinary, but still savory. The bistec fell short. The black beans were okay and the white rice was... surprising. Usually there is spanish rice, but okay! When I reached for the empanadas, I was deeply saddened as there were none in the bag. I checked to see if we ordered and subsequently paid, and yes, we did. I comforted myself with one of my favorites - tostones =) They were pretty standard which means they were yummy! Overall, the experience was pretty ok - nothing special, but not at all horrible. I will have to return and sample those sandwiches my fellow yelpers rave about!
