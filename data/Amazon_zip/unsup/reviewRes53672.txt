Crisp is fantastic but one word of warning, CASH ONLY. I can't believe how much they give you for the cost. If i had to choose a string of words to describe it I would say quasi-hipster-seoul-food. They have Bimmibop and fried chicken (huge btw), awesome fries, steak bowls and crazy items like korean burritos. It's great food and it's on the cheap, a great spot to swing by. The benches aren't real comfortable and food preparation takes awhile, i recommend ordering ahead
