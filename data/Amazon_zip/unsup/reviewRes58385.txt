Who thought of this place? Mad genius at work! 50 types of Meat on stick brought around to your table so long as your stop light says green!  AND KEEP IT COMING! Huge salad bar is nice but who goes fror the salad? The Garlic steak is my favorite that and the tendlion. They have chicken and sausage and other options too.  If I had to give one negative I'd say they do push the house special ALOT. Special translates to - normally not the best part of the cow - but what can you do?This place just keeps pouring the meat at you. Just as a warning though I would stay away from this place on a date night. The food comma afterwards is more than a little crushing.
