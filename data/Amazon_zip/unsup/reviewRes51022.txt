I guess I should have known that when I was seated under the large chicken pooping out an egg on the wall that this was going to be a doosey. I cannot believe the wonderful reviews on this place! The omelet was greasy, sooooo full of oil and quite bland. Breakfast burritos are you joking. Im sure McDonalds which I loath has a better breakfast burrito for a dollar! This burrito was soggy and filled with 85% percent black beans drenched with a mole sauce. When cut open the few eggs that were in there were indistinguishable and looked unappetizing as they were black from all the sauce. Looked like a poopie mess! Where were the tomatoes and peppers and cheese? It was the most disgusting breakfast burrito ever folks. Southern food at it's worst here. However, I did find one good selection, they have a fresh carrot, beet and ginger juice that was awesome though not completely organic. Needed it to wash all the grease down!
