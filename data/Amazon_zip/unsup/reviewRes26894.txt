One place you have to try once and that's it. The ceaser salad is good. The deconstructed crab cake was great (with the celery gel cubes). While the lamb takes up 1/8 of the plate while it left a lot to be desired for. A little bit of the over use of foam on the chicken. the service was top notch very thoughtful in their descriptions and pairings. A little pretentious though.
