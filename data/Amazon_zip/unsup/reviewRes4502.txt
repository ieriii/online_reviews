I heard this place was must place to visit if you are looking for Jazz. I have to say it was little out of the way for me and didn't know directions too well. I haven't driven here in Chicago so my friend drove but this was mistake we made. Trying to find a parking was very difficult near this area.  There were three options: 1. Pay $25 to have your car parked. 2. Park at this alley where this homeless guy said he would watch your car if you paid him $5. 3. We should been smarter to take a cab. Okay, down to review. We got there around 7pm. Wow, get here early early early!!! if you want to find seating for group of people. Very small place and packed with regulars well as out of towners. My friend and I ended up standing by the bar and couldn't have much conversation without someone telling us to be quiet. I wasn't aware of this etiquette. I guess you are not allowed to talk while music is playing. We were told by numerous people not to do that. Okay, lessen learned, it was my first time.  Bartender was very helpful with drink recommendation and showed us the door on the floor where Al Capone used to make a get away. But now used for liquor/supply storage. I thought piano behind the bar was pretty cool. Stage looked like a movie theater. Keep in mind that I have no Jazz experience so I went here to broaden my knowledge beside Kenny G (not sure he is even Jazz music). Two thumbs up! Live Jazz music was awesome experience!  Looking forward to trying out more Jazz places in the future.
