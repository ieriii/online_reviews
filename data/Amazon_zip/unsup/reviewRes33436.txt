Love the food- falafel, baklava, lamb shwarma dinner, etc. They have a little salad bar space and I generally don't get stuff from there. I did once and was not a huge fan of the stuffed grape leaves or shrimp. Now I stick to the hot entree area, where you are served by the employees.  Good prices, except that I get greedy and order enough for several people, which ends up being more money, naturally. I am working on going there and being disciplined.  CASH ONLY.  Also get a receipt and check your order. Tonight we got to-go for the first time. My husband went in to order and we were in the car driving home when we realized they didn't give us the 4 falafel pieces he had ordered. We do think we were charged for it. We were too hungry and tired, plus had no receipt, so we just said forget it. Next time we will be more careful. We've eaten there about 4 times and this is the only time we've had an issue. I look forward to eating their food again.  Yum!
