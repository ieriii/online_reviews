Table for 8 nestled in the back corner. A little cramped but cozy. The restaurant probably couldn't seat much more than 10 grouped together as it's rather small inside. I enjoy the decor, particularly picking out the fantastic 90's senior portraits and I'm a big fan of the banana (hammock?) painting. Service was decent, our waitress was nice but seemed a bit overworked. Took a bit to be seated despite having reservations. No biggie though. As for the food....not as delicious as I had anticipated, sadly. I had the hickory chicken sandwich and their homemade chips. I quite liked the chips but some were a bit chewy and some were too greasy. My sandwich was loaded with toppings (fried onions, lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, bacon and cheese) and was messy but yummy. Was it as amazing as I had hoped? No but it was good. I heard their fries were terrible, but they are known for their homemade cottage fries (chips) so maybe that's to be expected. I'm very torn between a 3 and a 4 star rating....so consider this a 3.5. Will I willingly make another trip there? No, probably not but if I'm at the zoo and need a place to pop in I may do so for a shake, which sounded good. Oh, and if anyone has any skills and wishes to paint me a giant banana hammock picture, hook me up!
