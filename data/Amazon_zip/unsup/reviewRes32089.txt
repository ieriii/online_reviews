Decor = Good. Service = Good. Food = OK. I went to Sunday because I heard from friends that it has good food. Having been there I can't say that I agree. The food was not terrible but it was nothing to really write home about. My friends and I went for lunch and ordered: Appetizer: Rock Shrimp Tempura - it was good but all it basically was just honey shrimp. Main Dish: I ordered the NY Steak Set Combo, one friend ordered the Kobe Tartare Sunda Signature Sushi and another ordered the Shrimp and Sea Bass Curry. The NY Steak dish had a Korean twist to it - the steak was topped with Kimchi which was good. The negative was that the meat was a bit on the chewy side. The Kobe Tartare was not tartare, it actually was cooked. However, the Shrimp and Sea Bass Curry was good - it had taste similar to that of the Thai green curry dish. Drinks: We ordered a mango tea and a pomegranate tea - the mango was good, it had a sweetness to it; the pomegranate was a bit on the tart side with a taste similar to the POM juice they sell at the grocery stores.
