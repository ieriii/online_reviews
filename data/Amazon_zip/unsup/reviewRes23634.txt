I felt Lao Sze Chuan was actually more authentic than Ken Kee, but it still suffered some of the same problems of hit or miss dishes. Like its name implies, they specialize in dishes from Szechuan province, which is known for its spice. We went on a Mon evening and were promptly seated. A friend brought a bottle of wine not knowing if they had BYOB - the answer was a resounding yes, and only $3.50 for corkage! Being a native Mandarin speaker, I ordered for the table. We ordered a signature Szechuan dish, the beef in boiling chili oil. The beef was extremely tender, and it actually was less spicy (as long as you don't eat the chilis) than some other dishes we had. Anyone who enjoys a little bit of spice would be well served to try it. The siu long bao (pork dumplings) were terrible, and I knew they'd be (not a Szechuan specialty, much less a Chinese restaurant in the USA) but a friend wanted it so we ordered it. Also a bit disappointed by the Chinese peapod veges - they were the small leaf, lot of stalk kind and not the nice leafy variety I had expected (as it wasn't noted on the menu). The garlic shrimp were excellent and an example of something that was extremely spicy. The pork and shredded tofu dish was very ordinary and looked funny. The jewel of the evening though was really the 3 cups chicken. The sauce was heavenly and a sweet reminder of what real Chinese food should taste like. Funny that it wasn't a spicy dish at all - I would highly recommend it, in fact, since there was a picture on the front page of the menu, I think it's one of their specialties. In the end, 6 ppl w/ corkage, $75 after tips. Awesome deal. Can't wait to go back to try the spicy hotpot and be a little more adventurous w/some of the innard dishes!
