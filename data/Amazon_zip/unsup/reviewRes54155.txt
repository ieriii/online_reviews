Had lunch here last week, and loved it. I had the Xoco salad with pork, and my friend had a sandwich. There was a long line, but it moved surprisingly fast considering it was lunch on a Friday afternoon. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was that I would have loved to be able to get their sandwiches as a salad - a great option for those with food allergies.
