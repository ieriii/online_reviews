My first time in Chicago and decided to go to Purple Pig after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. Is all true Purple Pig is the best restaurant in Chicago. JLT pork jowl& fired duck egg, Pig ear with crispy kale Braises baby, artichoke fingerling are amazingly good with great customer services. I highly recommend this place to anyone.
