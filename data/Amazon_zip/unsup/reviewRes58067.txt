I eat at Chinatown eavery Saturday. i have tried just about every restauant til last week. Tried this place- here is why I will not retuen:1. We and a few select others as dinner went on were sent upstairs to a second level which only had three people eating and the staff upstairs kept asking why we were being sent there. The downstairs was NOT busy and I woder how they chose to send us upstairs. 2. The Sweet and Sour Chicken was below average- mostly breading. Every place here has better Sweet and Sour.3. Had to move because of the sun, yet they pasted paper over the windows a while later.4. Very dirty on the outside and very slow service.5. This place is WAY OVERATED!!!!!! Better plce just downstairs.
