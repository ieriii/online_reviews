wow, this place is unique. I loved it as soon as we opened the huge wooden door on the store front that looks like nowhere. Thats cool. Then you go through these huge curtains and into a strange victorian, versailles meets san fran thing and a bouncer who greets you with a smile and welcomes you into some strange land they call Violet Hour. An hour is a good amount there I think two hours is even better though. Im sure everyone knows about the crazy drinks and the big ice cubes, I didnt know that when you sit there you cant really see anyone else other than the people you are sitting with, unless you are at the bar. They have the place designed for secrecy, I like that. Its mysterious. The drinks are not cheap, but they are one of a kind and not as foo foo as I thought, the alcohol flows throughout, trust me. Violet Hour, thank you, thank you for being weird and playing albums in their entirety. The whole White Album was perfect while I was there, and you didnt even skip Revolution #9 when everybody else would have, very nice. I will see you soon.
