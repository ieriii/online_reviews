Hands down the BEST convenient Middle Eastern Food in Chicago!!! The Mediterranean fish, falafel, lentil soup and chicken shawerma are the absolute best. And the meat pies are downright - to DIE for! The prices have increased slightly from last year and so have the portions - but I will still always pick this place. I haven't veered too far from the previously mentioned items on their menu; however, maybe one day I can stop craving them enough to try something else! A MUST HAVE
