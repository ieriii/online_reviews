There were a few things I really liked about this place, but one thing was extremely disappointing: the Kobe brisket sandwich. Beware that this brisket is not sliced as typically. It is cubed in large pieces, which added to its chewiness. The "croissant"-type bun it came with was flaky and buttery but too delicate to be used as a sandwich bun for a large pile of cubed meat! Also, they offer 3 different types of BBQ sauces, and the spicy was my favorite, but they definitely don't leave you with enough sauce on your table, so you have to keep asking for more. The honey cornbread, although a large portion, was a little too dry and crumbly for my preference. I'd try the ribs next time, but I'm not really jumping at the chance. Things I really enjoyed: mac & cheese (nice and gooey with spicy crumbs), the service (our waitress was very friendly), freebies (our bowls of house made chips and butter pickles were never empty), the drinks (the Pimm's cup tastes like iced tea), the milk & cookies for dessert (these are like cake-cookies and fantastic), and the atmosphere (decently priced BBQ in an upscale Southern house feel).
