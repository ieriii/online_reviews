We heard great things about The Gage from our concierge at the Hyatt. It was a short walk from the hotel. We walked in and was seated right away. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant had a nice feel to it. The place was full and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Everything started to go down hill from here. The wine list was lacking in real direction and was very limited. The menu did have some unique items on it to choose from but nothing that screamed out at you. The wait staff offered ok service at best. They were very slow to clear the table and dishes piled up. The zucchini appetizers were the best dish of the night along with the lobster soup. I had the chef special of the night Salmon. It came out very dry and almost without any sauce to speak of. We had a sample of the desserts but the best one was the lemon brulee. It was very tasty. Hopefully this was just a off night for them. I will give them another chance my next trip to Chicago.
