My first impression of nueva leon was excitement. It had a very lively atmosphere and everyone seemed to be enjoying the food. I was a little discouraged about how dirty it was. The floor was very greasy and I almost slipped a few times trying to walk on it. The dishes were not very clean and the table had crumbs on it. The nachos I ordered were presented very nicely but the chips tasted very awkward, like the tortillas had been fried in old oil. The chihuahua cheese dip was very tasty along with the tacos. The meet was a little stringy for my taste and not as tender and char grilled tasting as I am used to having with carne asada. The meal was alright but nothing to absolutely rave about. I got home that night and had stomach cramps, the next day I was not feeling well, low and behold I had food poisoning. The food is cheap and the atmosphere like being in a mexican restaurant south of the border but so is the uncleanliness and the likelihood of food poisoning ravaging your system.
