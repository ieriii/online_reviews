Not sure why it had taken me so long to review this place. Maybe because everything that needs to be said about Sun Wah Bar-B-Que has been said in the Yelpverse (464 and counting reviews). So here is one word: Fantastical-wonder-taste-feast. A word of my own making, but the only word to describes this place. The duck (in its various styles), noodles, rice, fishballs, pork, soup, and egg rolls, all top-notch. You will not be disappointed. It is a ton of food for a cheap price. The first time I came here I thought I had ripped them off, but no just that cheap. The service can be a little strange at times to a 1st time patron, (and if you are a 1st time patron, don't cheap out and not get the Peking duck) don't mind the bit of cold shoulder you may get. . The meal you will dine upon will be remembered for a long time. For straight on Chinese food this may be the best in the city.
