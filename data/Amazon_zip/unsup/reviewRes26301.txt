Before going to Geja's I 'd never been to a fondue place, only ever had fondue at friends and family's homes, I really enjoyed my visit! My husband and I went for an anniversary, and it is a very romantic place. It seemed to be very popular and packed so expect to wait a bit at the bar. But it's worth waiting for. Loved the musician, and the decor. We sat at a small table by the wall, and I think when we go again, we would request a booth with curtains, much more romantic. Still, it was a great experience. A lot of food for what you are paying...coffee, salad, cheese fondue, dinner fondue and dessert fondue. And our server was very attentive and brought us more fruit for our dessert fondue free of charge. Very nice! Also very filling! It's not rocket science but it's really nice that the servers explain things for you, so you don't feel silly if it's your first time there. For vegetarians, you have an option, but just know that you and your party will most likely be dipping in the same oil, I don't worry that much about that, but for some it might be a concern. Overall, very fun and I will be going back again!
