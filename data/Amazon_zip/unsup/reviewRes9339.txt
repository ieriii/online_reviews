Went with another couple and did the tasting menu and the wine pairing to try a large amount of the menu items. The pairing was done well, reasonably priced, good pours, solid matches, enjoyed the full list. Great: Foie Gras, Burrata, Scallop, Soft Shell Good: Veal said escargot but they were small and minimal Skip: Foie Gras... not the right preparation or way to serve Foie... it's great on it's own do not over engineer it, Meat dish wrapped in Nori... overpowering Nori ruined this dish Do not take this listing as negative as overall the experience was excellent. Great service, great cocktails, knowledgeable staff, very good food. I would rate this 3.75... wanted to do a 4 but two of the dishes just dragged it down. I would return, I would suggest the location, I would order off the menu trying new and some of the same dishes skipping the ones that just didn't work. Thing of it this way... I like a classic preparation for Foie... maybe a twist like strawberry and habenero pepper if I want something more modern, flash freezing it and grating is a terrible waste as you lose the texture of the meat and that's part of the selling point with Foie
