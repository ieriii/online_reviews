Food was good...tasty, solid meals. I had the duck with pumpkin "risotto" (made with orzo), bok choy and some type of reduction sauce. Our server didn't ask how I wanted the duck cooked (-1 point), but it came out med-rare. The risotto was delicious, but I wonder if it was made with pumpkin from a can...? He got the bacon-wrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes. Big portion, tasty meat, but nothing stellar. It was something we could have made at home. Drinks were strong -- the Triple Salchow was sweet and syrupy, but delicious. Our table was in the back of the restaurant, butting up against all their music equipment...not exactly nice to look at. Lots of parking nearby, and no wait (although we were the early birds there at 5:30pm on a Friday). Overall, a tasty meal but nothing noteworthy. I do love that I could eat some meat at a restaurant without feeling the inherent guilt that comes with eating non-organic stuff. We'll probably be back, if for nothing else than to try the goat cheese spinach dip...mmmm...goat cheese...
