For starters, the decor is not what you would expect from typical Albany Park eateries, which tend to be taquerias and divey kebab joints. This place is really clean, well decorated and has a handsome dark wood and fully stocked bar and oh yeah, clean bathrooms. Food was very tasty. I don't quite remember what I ordered but my date had the Adass Polo with Koubideh, which was a new dish and one I hope they'll keep. It was fantastic! It had lentils, raisins, caramelized onions, saffron, Persian boison berries... is your mouth watering yet? It was served with yummy dill rice and two skewers of tender beef. Very nice. I had to restrain myself from picking on his food as we had not been dating very long. If he were my boyfriend, we may have switched dishes :) Portions were generous so we were too full to have dessert. Service was friendly and parking easy to find. If you are taking the train in, the place is literally steps away from the Kedzie Brown Line. There are lots of interesting little ethnic shops that are worth a look so I would not just come for dinner and fly. I would maybe walk around and have dessert in one of the many Middle Eastern bakeries on Kedzie.
