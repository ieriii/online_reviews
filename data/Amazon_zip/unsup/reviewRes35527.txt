Sun Wah, HaoChi!  This place is all about the duck. The front window looks like Cantonese BBQ, but I was here for the Beijing style duck because it's all about the skin. I came here on Saturday night. We had 6 people allowing us to order a bunch of food.  Crispy pork came out to start. It was crispy, and tasty, but a little too tough. Granted, we ate every last bite. Clams with black pepper sauce, and oysters with ginger and scallions, were the next items to wash up onto our table. The clams were great, and I'd certainly order them again. The oysters were fine, but a little boring to my non-Chinese palate.  Somehow the gailan (Chinese "broccoli") found its way to our table. It was done right, but if a Chinese restaurant can't figure this one out then you better find a new place. We had two duck combos. One came with fried rice and the other with noodles. The fried rice was boring. The noodles tasted fine but were nothing special, but I count those as extras. Our ducks came out separately, and were carved table side. They had the mandatory crispy skin, but they were cooked inconsistently. I would say the first was cooked perfectly, but the second was overcooked to the point where a couple of pieces were bordering on what I'd consider burnt. The second was also drier, but to this point we had already shared the entire first bird, so we were not too concerned about it.  The duck was served with weird steamed buns, unlike anything they'd ever serve with Beijing Kaoya in the Middle Kingdom. This must be to fill up our fat bellies in the Beautiful Country. The trouble with these bland rice flour buns is that they mask the subtle flavor in the duck skin that comes through better with the traditional paper-thin wraps. Read about the preparation of Beijing Duck in China, and you'll understand why inconsistency in cooking is worth at least a one-star deduction. This place may not be Liqun's, but for Chicago Chinese, this place is tops.
