Everytime I go there I am treated like family! The service is always there when you need them, it is like they can read your mind. For instance, I was thinking, "Man I could really use a refill on my water because I cannot take all of this awesome savory delicious flavor." Then all of a sudden my waitress was there with the pitcher asking if there was anything else I needed with a smile might I add. I everytime I am there I enjoy it. The food is packed with flavor, and filling without making you feel like you over ate which is always a plus. The rice is amazing they offer dill which I love and regular jasmine, but with some butter on the side to make it even more delicious! The pitas go great with the small platter of veggies and goat cheese they give you as well as the meat. I go there with my family a lot "I love them" and we get a type of family platter where the pitas are under the meat giving them flavor and a different texture that makes it even better. I have to say that this establishment is one of my favorite place to eat ever due to the service, the atmosphere and the food. Great for a date and a family night out!
