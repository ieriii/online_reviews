I don't get it- deep dish pizza. It's really a lasagna but has layers of bread instead of noodles. And the bread isn't anything wonderful or distinctive- like a San Francisco sourdough, say. The regulars here know that there's a 40 min wait for the pizza to be delivered to the table from the time the order is placed. That's a looong time. I think it's an annoying affectation. You can go to the finest gourmet restaurant and order an item, and it's brought to the table fresh and hot a lot sooner. Think about it. A leg of lamb, a prime rib, an apple cobbler. The restaurant doesn't start from scratch when you order. Giordano's is a cult and they've got diners believing that the pizza tastes better when they make you wait. The wait only makes you hungrier and you THINK the food is better than it is.
