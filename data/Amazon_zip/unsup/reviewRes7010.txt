My first experience at Sapori was the result of my dear brother and his then-girlfriend-now-wife gifting me a certificate to treat my then-girlfriend-now-wife to a nice dinner. It wasn't our first date but we recall the evening with that level of fondness. I still talk about that sea bass. The atmosphere is busy but romantic. The staff is warm and accommodating. We've been back many times, just the two of us and with groups. Reliably pleasant dining.
