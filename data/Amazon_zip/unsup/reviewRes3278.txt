Ho Shit, these wings are amazing. Seriously. I usually take hyped up places with a grain of salt, and whenever people keep telling me things are awesome I end up being overly critical and they end up sucking (see also: the movie Garden State), But Crisp lives up to the hype and then some. Much like the rest of you, I am convinced there is crack in the Seoul Sassy sauce because hot damn, that stuff's good!  A group of us met up here and we all got some combination of Seoul Sassy or BBQ/spicy wings. Now, look at my nickname on here, you'd think I'd get spicy, but I had to try the sassy sauce. I ended up adding some sriracha on it, perfection. I tried the spicy BBQ with sesame seeds,and while they're good too, SEOUL SASSY 4 LYFE. Usually a chatty bunch, everyone devoured their wings in silence and kept getting more napkins. Then we all had to go wash up, and they even have awesome aloe lotion in the ladies bathroom which made my hands nice and soft. Great touch.
