I would say a 7 out of 10... all these reviews are pretty accurate. My experience: Went there on Friday night around 9:00pm without a res, they said there would be a 1 hour wait for two people, but it was half that. We waited at the tall tables with a few other people, had pork rinds and a few good beers from their extensive selection. We also got the fries with fried egg - really good. Followed that up with the beef tartare, also excellent. We split the ham for our main course, and were somewhat disappointed. It's pretty much a huge ass piece of fatty ham... not super exciting. They definitely oversold it to us. Also, I have to note, we covered everything in Sriracha, so my opinion of the food may be a bit biased... upon leaving we wondered what our opinion would have been had we not had that delicious hot sauce. But I digress. Servers were extremely nice, but we seemed to get overlooked a few times and the waitress actually comped a round of beers. Overall a great looking place, with an interesting menu and a very solid beer selection. Not cheap, but worth checking out. It came to my attention that I failed to mention the sardines I had here. The sardines were also excellent - the best I've ever had - but that's not saying much.
