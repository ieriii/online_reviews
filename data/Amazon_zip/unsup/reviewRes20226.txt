Am I the only one who doesn't see why this place is considered to be so great? Don't get me wrong. The sushi is good but it's so damn dark inside you can barely read the menu. It's just odd to me that there's usually a 2 hour wait for Coast when Blue Fin is right down the street and you can walk right in (and the food is just as good).  I don't think Coast is bad or anything but I'm not quite sure why people just rave and rave about it. Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen in the city, why wait 2 hours at one?
