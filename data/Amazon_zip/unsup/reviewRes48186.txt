Solid Spot. We were able to get a seat outside on a Saturday night at 6p.m. without reservations or a wait (outside tables are walk-in only).  the food is excellent and reasonable prices. - Pickles (as odd as that sounds) were delicious, very fresh tasting - loved the hamachi - The spicy steak tartare was one of my favorite dishes - Pork belly is a must as well Overall every dish we ordered was fantastic, great flavors. Beer list is fantastic as well (no cocktail menu, only beer & wine).
