So I went to this restaurant before my flight out of Chicago, and was absolutely floored by the food. I've been eating at Sze Chuan restaurants since I was 12 with my parents, but the chili chicken here was by far the best item i've ever had at any sze chuan restaurant. It was slightly crispy and salty, and cooked perfectly (not overcooked at all). The dishes were hot and fresh, and filled with chili's. No wonder it has an award winning chef! One downside to this place: the service. I'm not usually a stickler for service, but I wasn't really attended to. The staff seemed much more interested in each other than the customers. In fact, 5-6 of the waiters/waitresses sat around a table and prepared green beans, while only 1 waiter or waitress would get up from the table from time to time and help out 6 tables of guests. It was a little frustrating and probably the only thing preventing a 5 star rating.  Would definitely go back, but the staff might need some serious upgrading.
