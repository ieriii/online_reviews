Sunda has an awesome atmosphere, and service was pretty good. I'm not the biggest fan of contemporary sushi, but I gave it a shot. I ordered this tuna roll, that came out looking like a japanese spin on a taco. I didn't have anything that tasted bad, and the hip vibe or the place makes it entertaining. I would suggest sticking to things on the menu that are traditional. Everything tasted ok, but the presentation was appeasing to the eyes, but just par on the taste buds If you want a hip place to take a date too. fine. If you want to get down on some good sushi, there are much much better spots.
