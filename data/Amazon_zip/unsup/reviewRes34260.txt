cheap delicious food. that's basically what can be said about sultan's market, it kind of is in the style of a deli, our like the soup nazi kitchen, you have to be on your feet to order. things on the menu are marketed vegetarian/vegan/and not which is convenient for those who are caring of such matters. the falafel, can be made spicy in the sandwich, which is ultra delicious, and the lemon lentil soup, is nice on a cold day. that sums it up. they have a salad bar. and it's cash only.
