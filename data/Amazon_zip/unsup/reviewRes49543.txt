Its like a fairytale story of an establishment rising to 4 stars from 1 star. The food is really good. I had the steak and baby octopus platter. It is all carne, baby. With a side of yuca, potato and plantains. I wish I could have just had a side of all plantains instead. Anyway its a nice restaurant. Good flavors. The empanadas were okay. I had forgotten about my review of this place last year (reservation mishap). This time, my friend made the reservations and it was all okay. So, I hope to check out their new spot, Macondo soon.
