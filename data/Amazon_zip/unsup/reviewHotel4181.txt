even for a Hyatt...they could, should and ought to do much better for the non-convention guest. room was wrong -- they changed it to the right size bed but a more depressing view. I asked politely at the Front Desk if I could upgrade to the Regency Club -- everthing has it's price I guess -- and I want to give this place a second chance...but... when you are asking for 299+ a night, I better have a more spectacular view and much, much more!
