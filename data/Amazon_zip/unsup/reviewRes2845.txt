I've only been to two "fine-dining" restaurants so far in Chicago, Tru being the second (MK was the first). I thought the food and service here were truly exceptional. I ended up here for work-related reasons and was served a four course meal, which included an amuse bouche (not sure what it was), a cream of corn soup, a halibut course, a beef tenderloin course with a caramelized onion tart, a raspberry with baked chocolate mousse, and a dessert platter with macarons and mango flavored marshmallows. I found the cream of corn soup and the halibut to be exceptional, while the beef tenderloin was ordinary. Desserts were also great.  I am not too sure of the cost, but I believe the restaurant features prix fixe menus that range from just a regular dinner to a chef's tasting menu. Service and decor were exceptional, and I hope to be back here again for a special occasion.
