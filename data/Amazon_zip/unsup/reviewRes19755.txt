I loved this place because of the menu and the food. Waiting in a long line is not always fun but when the food is really good, what do you expect? It was a bit cramped, but I can deal. I liked the casual atmosphere, but I didn't like having to stare and be stared at by the numerous people crowding through the line out the door. I had the Aztec Mexican Hot Chocolate (chili hot chocolate) and it was rich, not as overwhelming as one may imagine, and delicious. Could have enjoyed a bit more chili, as it seems like they made it very very mild for everyone to be able to handle. But I assume if you are going in for Chili in your hot cocoa, you know you're taking at least a slight risk... Chips and Guac, yum. People say its not enough guac (because its sooo hard to stop!) but unless you plan on making a meal out of it, it was absolutely fine. We split it between the two of us and we were glad to be saving room for the tortas. Had the Pepito torta from the woodburning oven, and this was absolutely the highlight of my meal (not to mention the majority of it). Jesus christ, the shortribs were perfect. Not to mention the cheese.. oh my god the cheese. Just perfect. Would skip out on trying something new to have this again. Also tried the Cubana from the griddle - this was good, it didn't blow me out of the water. But it was standing next to some stiff competition so... Had the churros, how can you go wrong? I'm not a huge fan of sweets, I had half and gave the rest to my friend who finished off the order of 3. But I did see a cute little family that had come for the Mexican Hot Chocolate and Churros as a sweet treat to snack on outside, and it was heart warming.  As for the bill.. I have absolutely nothing to complain about since lunch was on my friend, and I would definitely come back regardless of lunch costing over $40. Everyweek? Probably not, but its definitely worth a trip. If anything, I'm now excited to try Frontera. I loved Xoco!
