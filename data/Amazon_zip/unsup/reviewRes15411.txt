And so the revolution begins! My husband and I have been waiting for this place to open since before we bought our condo in 2007. Nearly three years later, the doors have finally opened. Hubby of course went on opening night, but since I couldn't make it that day, we went again for brunch a week later. The place is just gorgeous inside, they did a really great job with everything. I was pleased to see lots of families and babies in the pub, as I am currently pregnant and am hoping to enjoy the beers this summer after our child is born. For lunch, I had the goat cheese croquette salad with radishes, hericot vert and candied walnuts and I have to say it was one of the best salads I've ever had, but then again I'm a sucker for goat cheese anything. My husband had a burger and the mashed potatoes. I can't wait to go back and try more, although I'm sure I'll go for that salad again! Prices are reasonable, and the Mug Club is a good deal. Logan Square needed this place, and we're happy to have them right in our neighborhood.
