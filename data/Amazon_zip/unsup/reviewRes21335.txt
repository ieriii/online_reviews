I decided to host my girlfriend's birthday dinner here. From the outside, the place looks tiny and could only seat like 20 people. I had not visited the place before but read reviews of it on Yelp. I picked this place because it was Mexican food and it was in walking distance to the bar we were headed to after dinner. When we arrived, the front area seating surprised me. I was thinking to myself, how are we all going to fit in here? When they asked if we had reservations, I told them we did. They directed us to an area in the back which could seat upwards of 50 or more. I was relieved right away. It's funny though, to get to the back you have to go through this narrow corridor. Good luck trying to get 2 people going opposite ways of each other down that corridor hahaha. Anyway we ordered their famous Margaritas and they were good! All their food tasted SO authentic and delicious. I would definitely go to this place again.
