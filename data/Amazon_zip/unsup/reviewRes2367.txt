I am completely smitten with hot doug's. There was a line out the door and down the block, but it moves fairly quickly. and once you order, the wait is super quick. I had a brilliant smoked apple chicken with sweet curry mustard and melty brie. it was probably the second most decadent thing i've ever had in my mouth.
