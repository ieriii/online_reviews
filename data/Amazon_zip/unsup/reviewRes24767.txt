This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city...I've been multiple times, and thought it was about time that I write a review! Try the chef's menu! You will get three courses with about 15-ish small plates...each little taste they bring is absolutely delicious. The lamb chops are the absolute best I have ever eaten...un-freakin-believable! The wine pairings are fantastic too. I have yet to be disappointed. The staff is always super friendly too. One of my favorite things to drink here, is the absinthe. The whole process is festive, from the absinthe fountain to the flaming-sugar dripping into the drink. Love it. {they will even bring you some soda to water down the hard-core flavor of the liquor if you want}.
