A few of my fellow training attendees and I took a quick cab ride to Greektown for a weekday lunch, presumably to get some Greek food. Mmm... gyros. (Is it just me, or do Chicago cabbies view the traffic lane markers as merely theoretical guides, rather than actual lane dividers? I digress.) Once there, two nice fellows on the street recommended Meli, which was packed with hungry people. The menu had too many good things to choose from (pancakes! sandwiches! crepes!) but, alas, no Greek food was to be had unless you counted the feta listed among the ingredients of a few dishes. I guess we should have been more specific than "what's good around here?" I settled on a latte (3.25) and the gouda omelette (10.75). This fantastic three-egg omelette was filled with thick slabs of avocado, sliced tomatoes, bacon, and smoked gouda. I'm sure that it came with red potatoes and toast, but you would have been forgiven for thinking otherwise as I only had eyes for those eggs. One of my companions loved her skillet and fresh-squeezed orange juice, while the other -- who had ordered a really good sandwich -- nonetheless looked on in breakfast-envy. Seating was quick considering how busy the restaurant was and the service was good, albeit a bit scattered. Were it not for the several states that lie between me and Chicago, I would quickly become a regular at this place.
