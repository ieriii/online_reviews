Just went to Mia Francesca again and had my favorite salmon dish (tomatoes, white wine sauce, lemon, etc.) and remembered how it is not just my favorite dish at Mia's, but the best salmon dish I have ever had. The bread is still warm and tasty and the pastas are excellent. We actually just got back from Rome and Venice, and this confirmed the quality and authenticity of Mia Francesca. I love it. And if you want a quieter place, ask to sit upstairs. My previous review gave them 4 stars simply because of the noise levels. The food significantly makes up for this.
