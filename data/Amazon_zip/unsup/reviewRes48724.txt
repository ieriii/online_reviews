if you're looking for an extensive beer listing and some good food, this is the place. Great atmosphere and outdoor seating. The greeting staff was awesome, and the bus boys had great recommendations! Rebeca, our waitress, was HORRIBLE. She did not explain our dishes nor pairings, and had no idea where to even start. The bus boys picked up her slack. They made wonderful recommendations and the beer list hit the spot. Being from Chicago, you have a plethora of bars and restaurants to choose from, with great service. if Rebeca and Kristin were replaced, you might get a full package. The waitress can make or break your experience if you're not familiar with the beer list or menu. Great food and beer, bad waitresses. i wold go back for happy hour.
