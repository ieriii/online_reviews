Maybe I'm old but Violet Hour's door policy is silly. 'Give us your name and number, we'll call you when we're ready.' Huh?! Having read Yelp reviews I knew the policy going in, but I felt silly leaving there to have drinks at another place while waiting for a table so I could have drinks! There was a line, it was a Saturday night (8pm--isn't that early?) and we were a party of five so we begrudgingly went to a sports bar (ugh!) and waited for the call. Needless to say, I happily took my arse right back there when they called to tell us our table was available. In spite of the initial nonsense I was very happy once seated. Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable. The drinks were DELICIOUS! Inventive, tasty, and appropriately strong. The food was simply scrumptious. The shrimp were tasty and well-seasoned. We took a risk and ordered the crispy eggplant which was excellent. It had just the right amount of flavor and crunch. The BLT was truly the best I've ever had. It was a slightly upscale twist on the old classic. I loved it. And the prices were VERY reasonable. Even after ordering multiple appetizers and a couple drinks each, our tab was just $40pp, including a 20% tip. Not bad. In spite of the questionable door policy, my Violet Hour experience was great once I made it past the velvet curtains. It's a great place to chill with friends (in spite of demand and a somewhat small space, I felt like we could have stayed for hours with no pressure to leave), but go EARLY or on a school night.
