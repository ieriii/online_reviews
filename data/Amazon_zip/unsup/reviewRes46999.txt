Sorry, Uncommon Ground. I want to love you because you support sustainable, local fare, with music, and it's a chill place in a good location. But... I have to admit the menu is 'meh'. Brunch there is nice, but there are lots of nice places.  I would expect way more selection for vegetarians, given their expressed commitment to fresh-sourced ingredients (Granted, this does not always mean vegetarian, but really - fancy mac n' cheese or a cheese pizza?? I would expect a little more effort!) Also, I ordered one of their fancy cocktails...which arrived without garnish or any of the advertised special trimmings. When I asked if I could, um, maybe have the things that come with the drink, I was told the bartender didn't make them - too bad. I don't mind paying for a nice drink, and I don't mind drinking a normal beer...it just seemed weird for a place that prides itself on interesting ingredients. *Sigh.* I want to like this place more...I guess we'll see how it goes.
