So tasty! For apps we had the Papas Rellenas and Coconut Shrimp - both so good! We were pretty full after the appetizers so we decided to split the blackened duck which was perfection! The atmosphere is so warm and cozy and the staff is attentive and friendly and overall the experience was a delight!
