I've tried a few but this is still my favorite Vietnamese restaurant on Argyle in Uptown. There is a reason it's packed every time I go. The bubble tea is delish. Green tea and coconut are my favorites. They don't chince on the tapiocas and when you order a fruity flavor, they fill the top with fresh fruit. Their shrimp Spring Rolls are my favorite!! The Vietnamese sandwiches are cheap and flavorful and the pho is outstanding and plentiful.
