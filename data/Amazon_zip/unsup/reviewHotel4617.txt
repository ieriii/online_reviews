Good points: good location, excellent service, modern lobby with couches, free wifi, nice water-pressure in the shower, plenty of outlets for charging your devices, and comfy beds! Bad points: no coffee maker in the room, crappy hair dryer, tiny room, and lots of "hotel noise" throughout the night/early morning. All in all, it's OK but I probably won't stay here again. There are too many other great hotels in the area for the same rate.
