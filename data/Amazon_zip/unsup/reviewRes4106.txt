This place is run by guys you would have seen outside of Supreme on Lafayette Street in '94, gone and grown beards and got chemistry sets to make their food in. I like to think of them as a chefs collective than a "restaurant." I think "restaurant" is too rigid a concept to describe what they're doing here. Maybe it's telling that I think of them more as a performance project than as chefs. Ultimately, they know their stuff. Don't get me wrong. The big menu was $120 a head. Expensive, but you likely won't be coming here more than once or twice a year for specialish occasions. And, yes, they are still listening to the Wu-Tang.
