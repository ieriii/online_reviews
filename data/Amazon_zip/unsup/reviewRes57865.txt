This wasn't my first visit to Demera, but I wanted to share this particular experience with the restaurant. The service was very slow at first - we waited about 25 minutes to place the order - but the food was brought in fairly quickly. The food was delicious as always. We ordered a mix of vegetarian and meat dishes for two and were not disappointed by the taste at all. What we were disappointed with, however, was the size of the meat portions! One of the items (number 40 I believe) came as a little tiny chicken drumstick with a huge hard boiled egg. I like sharing food, but that was barely enough meat for one person to get a taste! The lamb portion was not very big either, as most of the stuff on the plate was bones. I am not sure if this was a random occasion or a change in serving sizes, but in the past the portions were bigger, and this has never been an issue. Finally, what's up with the bathrooms??? The locks on the doors did not work and the water coming out of the faucets was so hot that you could not wash your hands at all!!!
