I've been wanting hot dougs since I landed in chicago! Unfortunately I didn't get to go here till my last day in the city. I woke up still full from my dinner (read my giardino's review) 12 hrs prior and not even thinking about food and actually feeling quite ill. Also I don't normally eat hot dogs or really meat at 1030 in the morning but an exception had to be made! But nothing would of stopped me from trying this famous hot dog spot anyways. We hopped on the metra to get there...we got off and was totally lost and ended up grabbing a cab.. I don't think we would have found the place without it... We got there 30 min prior to them opening so we were hanging out like crazy hot dog fiends at 10am...along with the others that were already in line. I ordered the selma hayak and waited patiently for my "mighty mighty hot" andoullie sausage dog. Normally I am rather impatient when it comes to food and often wish food comes out quicker than it does..but being that I wasn't hungry I hoped it would take while. Unfortunately for me it came out in less than 5 minutes.... What should I have expected? It wasn't like I ordered a pizza.... The hot dog was pretty tasty. Not spicy enough for me but it was still scumptious. Natalie T.'s bf liked it so much he ordered another. I would definately have to say this was my favorite spot we hit upon our visit to the windy city. It was well worth it and totally was everything I anticipated. The only thing I wish was that I wasn't not hungry because then I know I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more! But again, still delicious! Ah I don't think ill look at a hot dog or polish sausage the same way again.... Damn you Hot Dougs!
