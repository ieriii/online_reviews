I often come here, as I live in the building, and its warm, cozy ambiance is irresistible during freezing Chicago winters. While this place is not cutting-edge hip by any means and gets really crowded on weekends, the food is great (especially breakfast and lunch). Among my favorites, grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato, crab cake eggs benedict, and a Caesar salad. Service can be slow on weekend mornings, but still good compared to some other brunch places in the city.
