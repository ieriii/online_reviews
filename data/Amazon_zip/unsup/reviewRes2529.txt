I realize its pointless to write this review, but Im going to pretend like it matters. I have been putting off coming here for 3 years and finally made the plunge. That being said... Doug took our order, nice guy. Loved the ambience inside Doug's, very diversified. The food.... It was inventive and something like I have never had before. That being said I dont think it was amazing and or it didnt sweep me off my feet. There is no other place in the city (maybe country) that puts this type of thought into what was once known as a simple hot dog. That is the only reason why there is always a 1.5 hour wait to order. If there was only one mcdonalds in the city and it was open for only 6 hours a day, it would be jam packed as well.  Hot dougs is different, which why it gets such good buzz.
