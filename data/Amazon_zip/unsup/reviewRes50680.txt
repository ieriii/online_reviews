This review is really 3.5 stars. I've been here a few times for brunch and for dinner. I recently came here on Sunday around 11:15AM. They said it would be 20 minutes, but we only waited 10 minutes. hooray. I ordered the corncakes (pancakes made from corn meal) and cheese grits. The cheese grits are great and the corn cakes are good too. The corncakes taste like cornbread with corn kernels in the batter and a subtle sweetness (like fresh corn on the cob).  It comes with a red pepper sauce that is a bit sweet and adds for a nice taste to the corn cakes. I should've put some syrup on the corncakes to see how that would have tasted but I didn't think of it at the time. They also have sweet tea for all of the southerners that are craving it.
