This is the kind of place you love to come back to over and over again. The decor is great - rustic wood tables, exposed brick walls, some high top tables for up to ten and lots of wine for sale on the back walls. The food however is the main star - Focaccia di Recco - a thin and light dough stuffed with strecchino/crescenza cheese - a masterfully executed dish; Mascarpone Polenta with Pork Ragu - a rich yet ethereal and smooth polenta that would be great eaten on it's own and then it's topped with a hearty and flavorful pork ragu; Truffle and Leek Pizza - a crisp crust with braised leeks, truffle oil and a creamy taleggio - all fabulously earthy flavors; Roasted Corn Salad - it's bright and intense at the same time with the lightly roasted and carmelized corn, crunchy walnuts, peppery arugula and sharp pecorino - tossed in a very light vinaigrette; Crispy Pork Belly - sounds scary but it deliciously crispy and unctuous all at once - served with an apple mostarda to cut the fat, ask for bread and share this one as it it very rich; Cacio e Pepe - a sublimely silky mix of thick spaghetti with pecorino and freshly ground black pepper that makes a creamy sauce that feels likes its loaded with butter but supposedly is not!; Raviolo San Domenico - a giant ravioli with a soft egg yolk inside, with sauted spinach, ricotta and browned butter sauce - don't share this one - you'll want it all for yourself; Tracy's Sottobosco - a rich and smooth cream cheese frosting, on a moist carrot cake with an intensely flavored coconut pineapple compote. Get there early or go late or you will have to wait for a table.
