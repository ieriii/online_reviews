Worth every calorie. As a infrequent carnivore with a gift card for two, I had my doubts, but the filet mignon was delightful and my husband relished the opportunity to taste a variety of meats. The service outstanding! Wonderful on every count. Ask for what you want...enjoy a bit of things you may never have tried including at the salad bar.
