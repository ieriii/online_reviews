The first time I ate here I was 8 weeks pregnant and the smell of meat floating aroudn in the air made me gag and want to throw up. Thus my experience wasn't the greatest. However, it's now 2 years later and this was the best place in the world! We came during lunch and the service was impeccable; the food delicious and our overall experience was incredible. I loved the bottom sirloin and filet mignon..not too mention those cute fluffy tasty rolls they continously bring to the table. Well worth my money and expanded waist line!
