I think this is one of my most favorite places on Earth.  Ate there a few days ago and it was even better than the first. Appetizer of different hams...Virginia, Iowa and Spain...was fantastic. Entree, had the sweetbreads, which came highly recommended by the server. Ummm yeah, glad I listened, b/c it may have been the best thing I've eaten in the past year. Fin amazing! Sides of potato-leek gratin and brussels sprouts were very good too. Washed it down with a brew from Three Floyds as well as a De Dolle Dulle Teve belgian tripel. If only Michigan could procure such nectar... In my two day tour du jour around Chitown, I ate at a lot of highly recommended places of similar caliber. And there's no doubt in my mind, the Publican was the best. Cheers guys...
