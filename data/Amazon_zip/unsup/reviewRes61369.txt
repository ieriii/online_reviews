I love love LOVED 90 Miles! Went there with my boyfriend a few weeks ago without ever hearing anything about it, I just pass it everyday going to work and thought it looked interesting. Such a fun atmosphere...outdoor seating that's always packed, tiki torches, good music, and best of all, BYOB. We weren't aware of this our first trip, but we're determined to go back. Also, the prices are unbeatable. We order 3 appetizers, split their most expensive entree, dessert, coffee, and drinks, all for under $50. Everything was delicious, but I especially recommend the cheese and guava empanada as well as the coconut flan. SO GOOD! I can't wait to go back and try more things off the menu.
