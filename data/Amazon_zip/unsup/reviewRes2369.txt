They have great hot dogs and fries. Oh if only they were closer to my house. It's a great place to go when you are hungover (if you feel like driving)....it's cheap, greasy and good. Oh have I mentioned their fries??? Sooooo good! And the corn dog is pretty yummie. They don't take credit cards....so bring cash.
