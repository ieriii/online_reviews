OK, I went to La Villa with the wife after seeing the positive reviews on Check Please. Wow, Yelpers. I am really beginning to wonder how many of you really know your food. The place is pleasant enough and the staff IS very friendly and welcoming. But, the problem was not with the dining experience, but with the food. I wondered what the positive reviewers on Check Please meant by "home made." If they mean, they opened the can at home, then I guess that is accurate. I can buy canned food at the Jewel for a lot less. Most items on the salad bar were from cans, perhaps dressed up with some sliced onions or something. But, canned. My chicken ala Villa was 2 fried chicken breasts with cheese and canned mushrooms in a sauce that reminded me of Campbells soup. The dominant flavor was salt. Maybe the pizza is better, but this was not good food and Italian in name only.
