Excellent A great meal to end an incredible day. The salsas were excellent-3 in total- (especially the cilantro based- even bought some to go) and the chips were obviously fresh and authentic. It was pretty crowded, but luckily there were just two of us so our wait time was maybe 15 minutes. We ordered the guac (skip it), avocado tostadas, and cheese enchiladas. Best in the city and you can't beat the price. The beans were delicious according to my date as was everything. Byob and cash only. Will be back many times.
