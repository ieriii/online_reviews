Coast is the worst sushi restaurant in the city. First of all, the server came to our table twice in 2 hours and we had to ask other waiters several times to get his attention, then he hast the nerve to give us water glasses for our wine. I order the LARGE sashimi platter and I got a slice of Tako the thickness of a penny! The meal was over and my companion decides to give him a shitty tip, which was rightfully deserved. Before we left the waiter CORNERED us and asked if there was a mistake. He started pulling out the receipt to show us. We let him know that the service sucked and he pretty much forced 5 more dollars out of my friend. I called to complain and left my number for the owner because the whole ordeal was completely uncalled for. I could have just walked to Bob San but I wanted to try something new...VERY DISAPPOINTING.
