I can't remember the last time I waited in line for 2 hours to eat, but with prodding from the son, we did it, and no less in the rain. You would think the rain would hold folks back at 2pm on a Friday, but I guess duck fat fries only on Friday and Sat really draws the crowds. Hot Doug's is a novel and tasty sausage experience, but I have to dock a star for the wait, and its impact on an otherwise 5 star experience. The sausages and toppings were unique and tasty. The infamous duck fat fries were good but somewhat disappointing - they were like good, regular fries today. I actually had to check with server if we got the right fries, as I guess I was expecting more fattiness for $3.50 per serving. We tried 6 sausages - veggie sausage (you almost wouldn't notice), bacon and cheddar elk (interesting gamey taste and firm texture), chicken sausage sante fe style (actually best value at $3.50), shrimp/pork sausage with goat cheese (my favorite), mandarin orange and teriyaki chicken and gouda cheese (least favorite, strong on the cheese and mustard), and fois gras and duck sausage (very rich, but very good!). FYI - Since we finally got to order near the closing time of 4pm, I asked Doug (the friendly guy taking your order and cash) how he handles closings - if you're in line at 4pm, you'll get served; they were still lined up outside at 4:40pm when we left.
