I'm giving this Vietnamese restaurant 5 stars as honestly, good quality and service Vietnamese food is hard to come by. They don't serve MSG or preservatives in their food, at least that was what I was told.Cute place, attentive waiter, way above average Vietnamese food. Only have not had their noodle soups. One thing you should definitely get is the squid salad. Texture and flavors gelled together in a totally unexpected wonderful way.I'm Vietnamese and this restaurant has my approval!
