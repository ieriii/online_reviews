From the moment we stepped into Greek Island we were treated like VIP customers.  Since the weather was gorgeous, we opted for outdoor seating which wasn't a problem even though we arrived during the lunch hour rush. They had a table for us within a matter of minutes.  Everything from the food to the service was delightful. Drinks were refilled without having to ask, food was served in a timely manner and when it was evident I would need a portion of my meal wrapped-up for later , our server made sure to include extra pita bread and tzatziki so I could have another complete meal at home. Without a doubt I will be making a return visit to Greek Island in the future.
