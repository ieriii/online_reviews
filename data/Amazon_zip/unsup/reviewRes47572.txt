The Sunday Brunch at this place is boss! The regular dinner service, hmm I've had better at Brazzaz and Texas de Brazil. So I have to settle on three stars. Sunday Brunch So many choices, I loved the fruit and the personalized service from the wait staff.  Dinner Service Not as many choices on the salad bar as some other churrascarias and the meat selections arent as tasty. The Pichana is my favorite. Don't have much else to say.
