I was prepared to love Burnham Hotel. Being from San Francisco I was well aware of the Kimpton boutique hotel experience but... I walked into the lobby through a rathr ghetto underwhelming awning that needed an update. It revealed none of the glamour that envelops you when you enter the lobby. Glorious red, wood, and marble transport you to another time. I walked into my room using an old fashioned key with a pendant emblazoned with their signature Celtic armor/motif that repeats throughout the hotel... Only to find a woman brushing her teeth in her bras! Clearly I've been assigned the wrong room! Ok a fluke... Not a big deal. My new room was located on the 5th floor with a view of Washington street. No woman in bras but I was greeted by beautiful yellow wallpaper, fancy electronics and striking blue and white room scheme. I nestled into my bed, and cozied with a beer and organic kettle chips from the honor bar. I had a all day meeting starting at 6 a very important that I get good sleep. So far so good Except I was woken up at night constantly by the sound of construction of a new building across the street. It was a jackhammer (are jackhammers allowed at that time of day??!!) what was more perplexing is that a lot of rooms faced Washington. Am I the only one who couldn't sleep through the noise?  Travelers beware. I love this hotel but please ask for a room away from Washington if you want sleep!
