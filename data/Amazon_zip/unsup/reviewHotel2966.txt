I have stayed in this hotel the past two times I have been in Chicago and have had a good experience each visit. The Sheraton's location is great, with rooms overlooking the river and with nice city views as well. Guests can walk almost anywhere and the hotel is conveniently located to a few train stations that take you all the way to Midway and back. The breakfast that they supply for preferred guests is quite good and their fitness center is impressive with its glassed in panoramic views of the city and lake. The staff was cordial and very helpful, although some people at the front office lost a cheesecake of mine (long story, it was from Eli's though!). A great hotel for the business traveler because of the location and amenities offered. The bar and lobby area are very nice but as with all hotel bars, very overpriced ($11 for a well vodka). Good place to stay if you want quick access to Millennium Park, Shedd Aquarium, Art Institute, and Field Museum.
