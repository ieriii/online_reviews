VEGETARIANS BEWARE! There's not much here for you. (Unless you're willing to ignore the lard in your refreid beans and tortillas.) I went with meat eaters and they were super happy with their beef tongue, combination plate and enchiladas. The chips were not extraordinary BUT the peppers were excellent and the service was wonderful and they brought meatballs as an amus bouche.
