I took my husband here for his birthday because he is a huge Iron Chef fan, and the head chef is Jose Garces, the recently designated Iron Chef. The tapas was out of control. The flavors were so good. Everything had so many flavor layers, it was good that they were such small portions because I don't know if I could have finished an entree portion. Our server, Naomi, was excellent, knew her stuff and steered us the right way to some amazing choices. My favorite part of the meal was the dessert (duh). We had, I'm embarassed to say, three desserts. The Croquettes were insane. They were little balls of awesome, filled with chocolate and dipped in caramel-oil...stuff. Clearly, I'm not a chef, so I couldn't even begin to appropriately describe how good it was. We also had a meringue, which was refreshing, as olive oil cake, which had blueberry compote on top and was so good. I highly recommend this place.
