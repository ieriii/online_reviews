I'm not a biggest fan of hot dogs but man is this place awesome! If only I was there when they offer duck fat friess....*mouth watering as i'm typing*.  Went there with mi novia and I just had to order the foie gras just because I have never tried it before. It was pretty good but mi novia's elvis's dog was better in my opinion. The service was awesome. He was very friendly and they even brought the food to the table! Ya gotta love the decor of the restaurant. Who doesn't love eating next to a framed photo of britney spears (the old britney, not the crazy one). It seems to make the food even more delicious. What I disliked was the long line out the door in chilly February. Worth the wait though. I'd definitely come back when I'm in Chicago.
