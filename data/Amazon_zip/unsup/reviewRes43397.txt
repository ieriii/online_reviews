The Milk and Honey Cafe Poem: The Milk and Honey Cafe Has frequently made my day I work at 826 But on the way need a fix A bagel with herb cream cheese A coffee with sugar please I'm happy all morning through So guess where I'm going to When lunch time has rolled around M&H is where I'm found! The salads are quite divine (just check out the Brussel sprout kind!) But even better than that The SOUPS are what makes me fat I can't get enough! I'll eat till it's hard to get back on my feet! On weekdays this place is fly On weekends I wouldn't try to go anytime after 9 Because EVERYONE'S out to dine And rightfully so, because They've heard about all the buzz The Huevos Rancheros? Hot damn! The orange french toast? Grand slam! The breakfast burrito's quite fine and can be accompanied by wine So get off your duff today and head to this super cafe!
