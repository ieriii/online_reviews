This place gets 5 stars for a variety of reasons. Number one- although the place was an absolute madhouse on Friday night, the guy working on seating people remained calm and pleasant. Number two, they only had (maybe only have) one register, but the bartender kept my beers flowing and change coming... This place was very similar to a sauna on Friday night. It was uncomfortably hot, but you new the result would be positive. We waited, probably the longest I have ever waited for a table but I really didn't care. It was shocking that beer were $6 though...annoying too. The pizza was awesome. There was not too much breading, there was not too much sauce and there was a good amount of toppings along with it. Whatever they do with the crust is genius. This definitely sets this place apart from other deep dish places. I will definitely be back, preferably on a slower night; they carry-out as well. The menu is limited, but I don't see why anyone else would go here but for pizza. Be prepared to WAIT, even with a reservation. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable night out, this is not the place. I can't imagine how hot it gets in this place in the summer...
