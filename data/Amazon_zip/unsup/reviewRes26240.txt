I wouldn't get their stuffed yet because I ordered it delivery. And stuffed pizza cannot retain its true form after being stored in a vinyl bag and driven around Chicago. So we got a regular pizza, sausage and pepperoni. The crust was probably the best I've had lately. It's got some kind of braided, buttered thing going on. Very nice. However, the only sauce on the pizza was the single, lonely blob that dripped onto my roommate's jeans. Overall the pizza was mediocre. And I feel that $27.81 was WAY too much for a mediocre pizza. Anecdote: The delivery woman called and said she couldn't find our address. She read the number to us and asked, "Are you sure that's your address?" No, sweetheart, I might be mistaken. Let me go double check my lease, utility bills, and miscellaneous mail that successfully arrives at my apartment on a daily basis.
