Why is every employee at this place a miserable, mush-mouthed, angry, middle-aged woman with permanent stink eye and a creepy smirk???? I gave this place three separate opportunities and got the same awful vibe from 3 different women. Creepy. Not going back. and that's too bad because the food is pretty good.
