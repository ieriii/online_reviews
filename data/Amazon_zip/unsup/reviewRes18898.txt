Went on a Friday night, and was able to get a reservation for a group of 8 who were celebrating a birthday. Had an awesome round table which was ready when we got there! The server was really helpful recommending beers based on taste, etc. Which is awesome considering the beer menu is intense.  The goat cheese fondue was yummy and perfect for sharing. I had the sandwich with gouda and bacon and it was yummy... very basic, but it was only $7... so they definitely know what they are serving. The truffle fries were awesome.  Overall, good times, not super crowded but busy enough to be interesting. I would go back again to try some more beer and a burger!
