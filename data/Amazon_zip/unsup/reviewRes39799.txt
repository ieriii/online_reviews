I was here in December with a friend visiting Chicago from New York. He's quite the foodie and he read all about Longman & Eagle in GQ. It was listed as one of their ten best new restaurants in America. It was crowded when we went here (I think the wait was quoted around an hour), so we wound up sitting at the bar. I am not quite the foodie, but GQ (and Cesar, my friend) were right! I was on a budget that night so I got the cheapest thing on the menu: the wild boar sloppy joe. I am glad I was broke that night! The sloppy joe was better than most burgers I've eaten in my lifetime. It was THAT GOOD. My friend got the pork belly and also had the mallard pat appetizer. While his were good, I LOVED MY SLOPPY JOE! All the waiters were hipsters. A lot of the patrons were hipsters. The bartenders were hipsters (but ours looked like he knew what he was doing). Is Logan Square turning into a hipster neighborhood now? (I'm a full-time student and work almost full-time too, so I don't get out much) On the hipster note, they had PBR for 2 bucks in BOTTLES on the menu. As I mentioned earlier, I was on a budget so this was a good thing (I've seen bars (especially in NYC) charge up to 6 bucks for PBR cans, and have no clue how they sell any that way). I was a little disappointed when my PBR came in a can, but only because I've never seen a PBR bottle before. I will definitely come back here for a Wild Boar Sloppy Joe!
