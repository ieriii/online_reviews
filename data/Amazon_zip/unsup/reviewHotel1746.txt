Let me preface by saying I work for a hotel brand that is not Kimpton. I made last minute plans to head back to Chicago and decided on the Allegro. Great Choice. I used to live in Chicago for many years so I know the layout and CTA well so it was nice to have a hotel which was very accessable so that I wouldn't have to rent a car. Like a few other people who booked there, I was expecting a room that was smaller, I guess I'm used to many historic type hotels rooms in NYC which have basically enough room for the bed and a little walking space, nice molding on the walls but not a whole lot of space to walk lol. I had a premier king room which basically was a king room with a little more space, well, I had plenty of space. Nice amenities (Aveda), housekeeping is fantastic as they cleaned my room somehow when I wasn't there. I was impressed because I was in and out throughout my 3 day stay and never saw them in my room. I was also impressed by the fact that I looked down onto the L tracks but never heard the train. Maybe I was too immersed in my work but it definately wasn't like some street noise I've encountered at many other hotels. Room service, the person answering the phone was very thorough and the food was fast, hot and correct. The hotel is very conveniently located so that if you want to see/go anywhere in the loop you can really walk. If you need to hop on the L, its centrally located to Wells and the Lake st stops.  Points to help out When you first walk in, there is a flight of stairs which you have to go up to get to the main lobby Definately join InTouch before you check in Use the hotels services ie concierge, fitness room
