Okay.. so let's start with the fact that I have never ate at the "Schwa". I have been looking forward to a fantastic nine course experience for about three months now. I say thisbecause I live in the great city of Philadelphia...... So this was a destination restaurant for myself on my birthday. BUMMER.. The only thing that really "Grinded My Gears" was that the phone to the restaurant was not answered after I got the voicemail cancelation. I will still try to dine again when I am back in Chi town. I shoud have gone with my first choice of Alinea!
