Chevere - the ambiance is very nice. I loved the background music and decor. The hostess seated us at the mural of La Africana cutting sugar cane, which reminded me of what life was like many years ago in Loiza, Puerto Rico, where I was born.  The food and service were good. For starters, my aunt and I ordered a bowl of chicken soup. This deserves 10 stars. It was succulent; tender pieces of chicken breast together with spaghetti noodles, celery, onions, potatoes, and carrots; very homemade, very comforting on a cloudy, rainy Saturday afternoon. Each bowl came with toasted Italian bread, a staple of Caribbean cuisine. Then, we ordered sandwiches. My aunt had the Cuban and I had the lechon. She really enjoyed her sandwich, but mine was very dry. The pork was tender and tasty, but they should have used some kind of sandwich spread to make the bread's texture a little more appealing.  I will definately go back to 90 Millas.
