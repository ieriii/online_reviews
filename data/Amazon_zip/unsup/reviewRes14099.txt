The Revolution may start here, but the beginning hasn't come just yet. I was pretty excited to see this place open up. Being a huge fan of craft and micro brews, I was giddy thinking about coming and trying everything out. The groundwork is laid, now let's just see it all start revving up. The beer here is decent, better than average but still working to get there. The Cross of Gold is good, an above average pilsner type beer but not quite "great". I feel like thus far, most of their beers could fall into a similar description. The Wit and the porter are again both above average but not quite great. Perhaps somewhat unfortunately I was more impressed by their guest taps than anything they had in-house. I guess it's the safe move now, start simple, establish a fan base and then hopefully they'll get into some more diverse styles and tastier brews. The food is thankfully pretty good and a notch above your average brewhouse type of food. A variety of veggie dishes are available including the delicious bowl of veggies (that's what I named it, but literally it's an untitled bowl of brussels sprouts, peppers, quinoa, etc). It was a tad pricey ($15) given the size but it was pretty delicious. Some of the sandwiches look interesting so i'll want to give those a whirl.  The space is good and I like the spot but I'm hoping the beers get more interesting. I know brewpubs focus on food pairings with beer in addition to cooking with it but for me, places like this are all about the beer. I think you can draw folks in with an original and diverse beer line, after we're here enough times we'll definitely be open to eating the food. I want to come here and have a better memory of Revolution brews than Bell's Sparkling Ale.
