Honestly not sure what else I can add as a review given that this place has been featured so much it's no longer a local secret! As usual, we had a spectacular meal here - everything from the cocktails (freshly made margarita's, including a summer one with cucumber), to the appetizers (guac, chile tamales) to our meals (an amazing grilled salmon with pumpkin seed mole and slow roasted pig on a bed of ancho beans and fresh tortillas) was typically great! Service is still top-notch after all these years. It is hard to beat a restaurant that is passionate about the ingredients, the prep and the service all at the same time! Frontera Grill deserves all the recognition and is indeed the best mexican restaurant in the United States.
