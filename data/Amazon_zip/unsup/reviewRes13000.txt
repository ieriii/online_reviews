Wow! Please listen to my advice, come hungry and you will leave full. This was a new experience for me, the waiters serve meats on long metal rods right at your table. I mean endless meat, there is a card that's on the table one side red, one side green, when you flip it to the green side those guys bomb rush your table with different types of meat. The food was pretty good, the service was great.
