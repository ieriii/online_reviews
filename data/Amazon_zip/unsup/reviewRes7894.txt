I give Spacca Napoli high marks. Our experience was more than satisfying. I especially appreciated the friendly service and the wonderful specials but the pizza is the star of this show. Fresh ingredients with that great wood burned crust. I like my wood burned pizza with a hint of that wood smoke flavor and crust that is hot, airy and chewy. Toss in a bit of charred wonder from the pizza stone and you are walking on sunshine brother!
