I was disappointed by Big Jones. I got there at 9am on a Sunday for brunch and there were already people waiting at the door to be let in. We got a seat right away. (I refuse to be put on a wait for a place that I don't know is going to be excellent.)  Three out of the four beignets that were brought to us were great. The fourth was crunchy. Potato chip crunchy. That ain't what a beignet should be; it really shouldn't have been served. I had the egg breakfast with grits and the crawfish fritters. The grits were good, but not exceptional. The toast was bland, and no toppings (jam, butter) for it were offered. The crawfish fritters were yummy, though. Had a nice spicy kick to them and good chunks of crawfish. Might have been nice to have a creamy sauce to balance the spice. My friend had an omlette, which he said was good, but not great. The coffee cups are huge and cafe au lait is a nice touch. They also have a good selection of hot teas of all different sorts -- black, white, red, etc. Our server was friendly and chatty, but not overly so. When she made a mistake on my friend's order, she comped his breakfast. All in all, it just seemed a little too bland for my taste. When I think of southern cooking, I think of big flavor, and that seemed to be missing from Big Jones. I might go back to see if dinner is any better, and for the crawfish fritters.
