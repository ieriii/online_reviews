First time here, the menu seemed a bit overwhelming but the waitstaff was very helpful and in helping decide on what to get. Ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura, Pig Sticks, Pancit Canton and Sunda's Signature Crispy Rice. All of these were amazing. The "Ridiculous" Dessert was ridiculously amazing. No joke.
