Went here last Sunday morning with my girlfriend and her sister. The wait was about 45 minutes, but their estimate was very accurate and the food made it more than worthwhile. The menu is dramatically expansive, running the gamut from traditional brunch fare to chicken wings and other finger foods. The "Hey Ricky" spanish omelet was excellent and the eggs blackston similarly delicious. And, unlike other reviewers, we didn't have any strange encounters with the owner or problems with the way our waiter was dressed.
