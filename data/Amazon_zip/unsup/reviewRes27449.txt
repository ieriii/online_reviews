I decided this year to have a Baylexican birthday, and Frontera was my spot of choice. I called for a reservation same-week (because I am not smart sometimes) and was told they couldn't, which I don't hold against them necessarily because I knew they were hugely busy. Luckily, my fiancee got out of work early and saved us a spot. This led to him getting hammered later, because those margaritas are potent and delicious, but it also led to us getting a table and my dude generously treating my fam and me to oysters and chips & guac. Speaking of which, I need more raw oysters in my life. These were exceptional, to boot. Upon sitting, we all had joined my guy in feeling slightly "affected". Again, don't underestimate those margaritas. Those babies are serious business wrapped in a tasty little package. Luckily, we immediately started ordering stuff to eat, stuff like... ...perhaps the most amazing ceviche I ever had (albacore. wow, Rick!)... ...rare grilled swordfish in a creamy sauce... ...tortilla soup with a clear broth and a really interesting, original flavor - perhaps my favorite food item of the night... ...tasty little shredded beef sopes... ...assorted queso fundidos including one with chorizo & peppers and one with shredded carnitas. Yum, baby. The Baylexicans finished off the night with a surprise happy birthday song & cake for me (they even wrote "Happy Birthday" on the plate with chocolate, adorbs!) and my sister had a genius moment in ordering chocolate pecan pie because, seriously, how could that not be amazing? (It lived up to all initial assumptions of crazy-goodness). In summation, difficult to get into? Yep. Totally worth it? Yep. Memorable and amazing birthday spot filled with drink and foodgasmic experiences? Oh yep. Yep yep yep.
