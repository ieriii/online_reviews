Best restaurant in Chicago! Breakfast, lunch, brunch, or dinner, you'll never have to worry about having something non-enjoyable. Awesome atmosphere and set up too! Im a huge brunch eater, so my best recommendation: Crab Benedict! And don't disrespect, whiskey is a must if you're going to Longman and Eagle! Cocktail list changes seasonally, so there is always something new to try! Refreshing! The wait to get in will speak for itself: best restaurant in Chicago.
