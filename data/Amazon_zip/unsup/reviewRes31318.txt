First, let me put this out there. I am not a vegan. Secondly, I'm not even a vegetarian. This should give you an idea of how good this place is. I went to this place after a run, so naturally I had worked up quite the appetite. I decided to go with 2 entrees. Since I was with two friends, I figured they could help me pick up the slack if my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I ordered the Pumpkin Tamales and the BBQ Sloppy Joe with sweet potato fries. I decided on these because I wanted one dish that didn't rely on having a meat substitute and one that did. Seitan being the substitute in the Sloppy Joe. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and able to answer any of the questions we had regarding our orders. The Pumpkin Tamales were very good. I didn't miss the meat at all. The pumpkin was also very subtle. I didn't feel like I was eating pumpkin pie or anything. The Sloppy Joe was fantastic and the whole grain bun and sweet potato fries complimented it nicely. If someone had put it in front of me and told me that it was a regular meat sloppy joe, I don't think I would have been able to tell the difference. I was stuffed afterwards, but there was no guilt involved.
