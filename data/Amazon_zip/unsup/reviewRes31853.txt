I eat at Sunda for the first time last week. I was surprisingly impressed with the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the atmosphere. The food was absolutely fantastic. My friend and I eat at the Sushi bar and the Sushi chef gave us free samples of new sushi to try. The price is a little costly but it is definitely well worth it. I don't think anyone would be disappointed in choosing Sunda as your choice for sushi.
