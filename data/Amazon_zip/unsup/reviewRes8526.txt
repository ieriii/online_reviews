So I was all ready to give this place at least 4 stars because the pizzas my friend and I ordered (margherita for her, prosciutto for me) were pretty damn good. Then...as were drinking our wine, having ordered a BOTTLE, some dude with longer curly hair came up to us and asked us to wrap it up. Excuse me? We just dropped $70 at your restaurant - surely that entitles us to finish our bottle of wine! Apparently it was more important to him to turn our table. By no means were we lingering: we arrived at 6:30 and I was at Sheffield's for post-dinner drinks by 7:45. Needless to say, i will not be returning. At least in the real Naples, Italy, they'd never rush you out the door. Poseurs.
