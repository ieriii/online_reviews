My first visit to this restaurant was OK. Our server was very nice and offered a few specials, but the food for person in our came out about five minutes later than the rest and one appetizer never came at all. Given this is a neighborhood place and BYO, I am willing to look past this point. The food is very average, I challenge someone to point out a dish at this restaurant that is done better than at any other Italian Restaurant in the city save Buca di Beppo. Went back...err...tried to go back for seconds last night and have never been treated so poorly in my life. Our entire party was not there and the host made it a point that we needed all people there to be seated (OK) and informed us that at 6:15 that our reservation would be lost. Mind you the restaurant is half-empty at this point. Upon the arrival of the rest of our party at 6:19, we were told that our reservation was lost and that we were not welcome. The owner/manager needs a serious attitude adjustment, and given the mediocre food, should be more accommodating to his guests. I am simply dumbfounded at what a prick the manager was (an older couple that had an incomplete party and was waiting agreed). Hey asshole - you still only have three other occupied tables in the restaurant and it's well before prime supper time on a Saturday. Ended up at the Cuban restaurant next door where we were treated with good food, great service and respect.
