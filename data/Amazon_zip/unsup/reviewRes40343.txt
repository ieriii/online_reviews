I went here last week with a friend of mine and this place was awesome! It feels laid back and the staff was really nice. I tryed the Seared Maine scallop, braised oxtails, potato gnocchi, fontina fonduta which was great I think one of my favorites out of everything I tryed. I also had Sunnyside-up duck egg, beef tongue hash with black truffle vinaigrette, that was also really good its egg, meat and potatoe so that can never go wrong :) , Smoked sweetbreads, salsify, roasted beet, brown butter applesauce, also Bouillabaisse market shell and finfish, saffron-infused lobster broth, rouille and then the Wild boar sloppy Joe with crispy sage, onion and pickled jalapeo. I also tryed baby veil brain which i must say was interesting but very good, it had the consistency of like a soft cream cheese. I would recommend anyone to go here and perhaps try something new.
