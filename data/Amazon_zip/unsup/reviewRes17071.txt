I wanted to love this place, with it's comfortable decor, spicy aroma and... rude waiter? After two experiences at India House, I can't say that amazing service is one of its strong points. While kind at the beginning of our meal, our waiter grew increasingly frustrated by the time we left, desperately trying to get us to order more food (we already ordered 2 apps, 3 entrees and drinks for 3 people), then pushing the bill on us halfway through the main course. The food is fairly solid as far as the basics (any tikka masala or biryani dish, etc) are concerned. The Lamb Madras (coconut curried lamb) was tender, flavorful and HOT. The naan was buttery and plentiful, and a perfect accompaniment to the black lentils. They also have a reliable tandoori style mixed grill with prawns. Good food but a bit pricey for standards and shaky service. Lunch buffet is probably a better bet.
