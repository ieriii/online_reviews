As you walk in, a hostess asks how many in your party and then gives you a seating number to remember. You then give that number to the man who takes your order. After you've paid, you go back to the hostess and remind her of your number so she can take you to your assigned seat. Unnecessarily redundant and confusing... But that didn't retract from the fact that the food here is THE MOTHER EFFIN BOMB!!!! I came here one night to pick up churros for dessert and saw the amazing tortas being churned out of the tiny kitchen so my boyfriend and I vowed to return the following day for dinner. We started with agua frescas (I can't remember exactly which flavors) and after walking all over Chicago on a warm day, the drinks hit the spot. My boyfriend ordered the ahogada and specified the soup to be mild but he thought it was too spicy! Still delicious. I had the pork belly vermicelli because it looked like an interesting spin on Vietnamese noodles. I usually have a high tolerance for spice but at the end of the meal, my lips were bright red and tingling! Some places use a high level of spice to mask the lack of actual flavor in a dish but that was not the case with my vermicelli. Thick, succulent, fatty slabs of pork belly floating in a bright red soup laced with arugula, onions, zucchini, and avocado. The zucchini and avocado did a wonderful job of soaking up the flavor of the soup while still remaining crisp (for the zucchini) and creamy (for the avocado). A nice refreshing add on for the spicy soup. 3 churros served with a shot of chocolate and vanilla soft serve - perfect ending to a meal. I'm currently 800 miles away from Xoco and suffering separation anxiety....
