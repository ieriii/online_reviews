Wow... this place was absolutely incredible!! We just walked in, the hostesses were very friendly to us, sat us right away at a booth along the wall. We both ordered cocktails (I got the Deaths Door Daisy!! mmmmmm) and our server treated us better than we could have even asked for.My boyfriend and I started off with the shaved salad, which must have been the best salad I've ever had. I especially loved the beets! Who would have thunk? Then we tried a couple different dishes: the blackened cauliflower was great, with the garlic mashed potatoes. Then we tried the purist pasta (simple, but delicious),and the maple bourbon pork roast with lentils was seriously heaven on earth (I could eat that for every meal of every day forever).So when our server asked us if we wanted dessert... what were we going to say, but Hell yes!! We tried the brownies and the vanilla ice cream with fudge. First of all, made in house... need I say more? Secondly, I might just come back for a cocktail and dessert, because I want to try more things on that menu!!Fantastic job Gilt Bar... I'LL BE BACK *says in her best Terminator voice*
