Three stars for the breakfast - only qood for people with major sweettooths (girls). Better options include bin and milk & honey. And I hate the long waits, there is only so much time I can spend at the clothing store next door or circling the same block. However, I give the lunch five stars. Sandwiches are expensive ($12?) but amongst the best I've had anywhere.
