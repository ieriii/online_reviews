OK - how do I say this.....My family doesn't have them most.....adventuresome palates. While I live in the Bay Area and regularly eat sushi, vegetarian/vegan food, other Asian cuisines and whatever else strikes my fancy - they are typically meat and pototatoes folks...and are pretty picky about that. So this weekend, my mom and I had a difficult time finding food that would keep our family happy. The place had to be a good value with lots of options but nothing too outlandish.  Grand Lux pretty much hit the spot, but with a little complaining still from the fam. I used to live down the street from a cheesecake factory - so I knew what was up. I scouted out some options and decided on the mushroom "burger" (one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had - not vegan, but DEEEEELISH. It took my aunt sometime to settle on the fried chicken. Her complaint was that the salads were a litttle too....(thinking, thinking, thinking) exotic (maybe that's the word)....black beans, or anything like that wasn't working for her. That said - the fried chicken is enough for 2 people. It comes with MOUNTAIN of fried chicken tenders on top of a MOUNTAIN of mashed potatoes, surroundied by foothils of mashed sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli, and steamed snap peas (which I got because she didn't like them). The desserts are all great - I split the pineapple upside down cake. Hmmmmmmmmm.....very good. The kid's pizza was a hit. My older cousin liked her burger (the Max burger) a younger cousin was daunted by her order of fried chicken (seriously, she and my aunt should have shared), and my mom was pleased with her Madeira chicken. Bonus points for the waitress who deftly handled substitutions (it's a $1.50 to have a side salad instead fries with your burger) This is a great place to take the family to make sure that pretty much everyone is happy. THere aren't quite as many options as Cheesecake factory. Which is fine -because I get analysis paralysis there.
