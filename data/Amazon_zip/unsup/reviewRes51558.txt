By far my favorite Mexican place to eat! The food is amazing! The service is pretty good. The margaritas are to die for. I've almost tried every margarita and the frozen strawberry are my favorite. Very fulfilling! The burritos are huge!!! Definitely always have something to take home. The chips and salsa are a nice addition to a wonderful meal. Most definitely a good time! I would highly recommend checking this place out if you want some good, reasonably priced, Mexican food!
