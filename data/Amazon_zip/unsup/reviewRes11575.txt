I have such an affinity for breakfast foods. I have become a fan of the Chicago Brunch Blog, I mean when I saw the Facebook ad for the blog it was like a, "Welcome Home, Brian!" moment. Love love love it!  Anyways. A recent review of The Bongo Room talked about a dish that inspired me to immediately hit this place up. And that dish was Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Ohmagoooood. I love pancakes. And ricotta. This is like Heaven! So the day arrives and I awake early in anticipation of eating at The Bongo Room. When I get there I peruse the menu and alas the Pancakes are not there. My hopes and dreams shattered I went on to the more savory dishes because I was in the mood for something on the savory side of life. I knew it was meant to be with the Breakfast Burrito. Holy frijole it was muy delicioso! Eggs: Yum! Guacamole: Yum! Side of Bacon: Yum! And the portions, soooo filling. It was a spectacular dining experience for me and my friend. I will definitely be back to try something sweet. Because I could eat pancakes everyday.
