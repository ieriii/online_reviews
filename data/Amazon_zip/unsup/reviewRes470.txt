Let me just say, I owe you a couple reviews Alinea... Having recently dined here a second time, I must say this is, by far, the best restaurant experience ever. Not only is the food amazing, in an interesting and tantalizing kind of way, the service is impeccable, as is the presentation. This is a place that is completely deserving of the accolades it receives.  Keep up the amazing work Grant! It's a gem in the midst of many sub-par restaurants out there...your hard work shows and you truly have set the standard by which others are judged. DO NOT miss experiencing this place at least once in your lifetime!
