I don't have a bad word to say about Fogo. The meats are all fantastic; my special favorites are the new Ancho Beef and the bacon-wrapped chicken. And the salad bar is INCREDIBLE. The potato salad at the salad bar? Out of this world. Everyone I know who hates regular potato salad loves the Fogo version. Do NOT miss it.
