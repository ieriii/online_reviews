awesome service, and friendly staffs who know their menu well are the higlights. good atmosphere but a bit dark, yet open and quiet enough to stop you from holding mildly private convo. ok food and decent booze & dessert list is avail. yet you do end up paying for all the aforementioned good stuffs. place ain't for authentic asian. it's more re-imagined for adventurous or people who didn't grow up eating the stuff. not that I'm saying they taste no good, but u can save 30 bucks and order the thai food down the street to get a fix. i'd stay away from the sushi - doesn't live up to the cost or the decor... so, take a first date you want to impress but won't be taking home - yes, hungry for some sushi and noodles - no.
