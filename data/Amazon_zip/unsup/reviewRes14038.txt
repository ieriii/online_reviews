I really wish I lived closer to 90 Miles. I think I would be tempted to eat there daily. The Media Noche sandwich is a nice change of pace from a basic Cuban sandwich, and I thought it was damn good. The plantain chips add a nice snack to any sandwich. I loved the small atmosphere of the place, and I really can't wait to come back and dig deeper into their menu.
