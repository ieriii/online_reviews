Hopleaf was one of the main reasons I moved to this neighborhood. It has a fantastic beer selection and the food is perfect. They know exactly what they are doing. Get the mussels for sure. The pommes frites that come with just about everything are so freakin good. They come with this special aioli dipping sauce that I am pretty sure is laced with crack. Yeah, it's busy just about every night and especially the weekends, but it's worth it. So grab a beer and settle in for what always ends up being a great night.
