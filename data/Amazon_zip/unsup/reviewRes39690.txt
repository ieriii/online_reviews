Yum yum! Pork belly was wonderful, and the venison was pretty good as well - I will assume the rest of the menu is just as delish and well-prepared! Nice accompanyments and presentation. It's a little odd to sit in the back room if you were looking for something more social or sceney...it's secluded with fewer tables, quieter, OH and then with the tables being so close, it can be an awkward start for a first date, along with #1 below (ahem). After dinner hours, it is a good barish scene. Two negatives: 1) Crowded space, so if it's busy (as usual) and you have to wait for your seat, the bar can be too crowded to stand at, yet if you don't want to drink you have little other space to go once inside the door.  2) Went once during Summer of 2010 with 3 other girls - was getting about 30 mins from close, we just wanted a cocktail and got no service outside for 15 mintues so we left. Maybe a fluke. Regardless of anything above, it's a must go-to - and it's in the up-and-coming Logan Square, which I love!
