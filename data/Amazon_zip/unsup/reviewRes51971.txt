Yes! I will always love Gino's even though Giordano's comes first even after their bankruptcy! We got there before it got extremely busy and got SPEEDY service. It was seriously so fast, I lost the personal side of it. Oh well; it made the slow wait for a deep dish even faster and I could always count on getting our waiter, if we could catch him moving so fast. Either way, the food delivered and made up for it all, and the manfriend and I enjoyed our authentic deep dish crust pizza afterall!
