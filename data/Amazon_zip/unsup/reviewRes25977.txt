We had $200 in gift certificates, so at least we didn't have to pay for this out of our own pocket. We ordered the seafood deluxe, which to Geja's means two shrimp, two pieces of lobster, two scallops, and a ton of vegetables. Not horrible, but its not very substantial. We ordered the broth so things didn't get greasy. Service was a bit off, the wine list is awful, and everything is WAY overpriced. For what you pay here you can have an innovative, delicious meal at Perennial down the street. This seems to be a destination spot for a lot of people, who I can only assume are from out of town.
