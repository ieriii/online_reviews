When others Yelpers say the courses were 20+, believe therm! I had deep dish pizza at Due for lunch around 2-3p, thought I was gonna be okay for our 9p dinner reservations. Oh boy, was I wrong. 7-9 course I was ready to explode, the whole dinner lasted close to 4 hours. I'll have to come back after starving myself for a day. I'm so sad because I couldn't enjoy the whole meal. Probably the only time I didn't finish the wine pairing! BTW, make reservations ASAP, they start taking them 2 months in advance. The service was impeccable!
