I had to do a review on this place.... best seafood in the city and so many options. Went on a Sunday at about 4pm, brunch was over (the menu that goes only until 3pm is great) and we were told so many reservations that we could not be seated until 8pm!!!!! I was a little shocked a restaurant would reserve the whole place and annoyed, but we sat at the bar to eat.We had a wonderful fish spread for an apptizer, but it was served with Ritz Crackers, yuck. We asked for the basket of crackers and ate it with those instead. For a main course, the fish pot pie was wonderful, warm, great crust but a little small in size for the price, but once I saw how many shirmp were inside, decided it was a good deal. Other meal was pretzel encrusted fish, so good. Only thing the veggies on the side were undercooked and when I mentioned to the server behind the bar he replied, That can't be right, they cook those through all the time What, do you think I was lying? Service was very good except for that comment. Server took the food and its presentation almost too personal and was very excited over the menu, nice guy but gave out weird vibe.Things to know about this place:This was the worst experience I ever had here and still the food was awesome, so in summary, you can't go wrong, even on a bad day its great!Very small, call ahead for reservationsThe all you can eat crab is great, but good luck getting into the restaurant for a seat, outside patio is a good betGreat beer listService is good, sometimes over happy, if possibleTartar sauce is best I have ever hadPo Boy Sanwiches are great, especially the catfishNOT a place for groups, only go with 2/3 peopleA little expensive, but its season in a relaxed enviroment so enjoy
