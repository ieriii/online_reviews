I have been multiple times over the last year, and Davanti never fails to disappoint. Definitely recommend the sea urchin pasta, the burger, polenta, any of the mason jar spreads, and pork belly pizza. The wine is affordable and to my understanding you can always bring your own bottle and pay a small corkage fee. The reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is the restaurant uses a liberal amount of oil on all their food, its especially noticeable on items like the burger and the focaccia. These taste great but they're both soaked in grease.
