I've been here many times over the years, but come here less and less as time goes on simply because it's too crowded. Most recently, I was here for a bachelorette party at 4 pm on a Sat. We had seats in the bar area, but it was still very crowded. We moved into the dining room around 5. This was the first time I've ever managed to eat in the dining room because every other time I've tried the wait has been approximately 2 hours. We started with mussels and frites. We got both kinds of mussels: curry and beer. In my opinion, the beer ones were far superior. The frites were delicious, per usual. For my main course, I opted for the CB&J sandwich, which everyone is always raving about. It came with a side of potato chips and mac n' cheese, which ended up being way too much heavy food for one meal. The sandwich was fine, but I didn't think it was the best thing ever. I was underwhelmed by the mac n' cheese and the potato chips just seemed unnecessary. I think this dish would benefit from a side salad or something a little lighter. Virtually everyone else in our group liked their food but also felt it was too heavy. Several of us needed to take Zantac after the meal just to make it through the rest of the night! I think Hopleaf has its pluses, but for me, the large crowds are the main reason I usually opt to go elsewhere.
