I went here for breakfast and I thought the food was awesome. I ate the duck biscuits and gravy, which was a duck confit with biscuits and eggs (over medium). The gravy was flavorful, the duck was amazing, and the biscuits where just right. The service was great, and it's a decent sized space. I would suggest getting there early though because the place was busy, and there isn't a lot of standing room. This left people waiting outside in the cold.
