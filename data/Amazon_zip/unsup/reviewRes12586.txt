Good, not great. It was a very loud Saturday night. Not the "romantic" date night people suggest it could be.  The drinks were good, but very weak. A $9.00 mojito should have some kick to it. The food was good, but lacking in flavor. Maybe it was an off night, I don't know. It seems to be a nice place and very well liked, but I can think of dozens of other places I'd go to before I went back.
