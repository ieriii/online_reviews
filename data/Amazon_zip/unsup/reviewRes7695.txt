If the rotating display of meat in the window is not enough to get you to come in, I don't know what is...maybe that's why there were so many tourists here. I had the strange feeling I was in Vegas at one of those large hotel buffets, it didn't feel like I was in Chicago anymore. I think my friend and I were the only locals in the whole place. Compared to Brazzaz, I felt that the quality and flavors of the meats were better here. The salad bar was not impressive, but then again it's the meat that matters. My friend and I decided we needed some good protein, so Brazilian steak house it was. He is a huge fan of lamb chops, so the lamb chop goucho got summoned to our table a lot and by default I ended up eating a lot of lamb chops--and they were by far my favorite meat--tender and flavorful. The standouts were the lamb chops and the bacon-wrapped sirloin. Basically, all of the beef choices were great, but I wasn't thrilled with the pork or the chicken. Caipirinhas to wash it all down. I should not have filled up on the sides, but I couldn't help it--the crispy polenta and caramelized bananas were yummy and addicting. Service was beyond attentive, maybe a bit too much, it felt overwhelming at times to have waiters, gouchos, and bus boys all bustling around you and at your table. Desserts on a neighboring table didn't look too appealing so we decided to head elsewhere for dessert and drinks.
