Beautiful hotel with a beautiful staff! I checked in at the odd hour of 4am, granted their computer system was down, but that did not stop them from providing me with my room immediately and making sure i was completely satisfied. The room i was in was perfect! I have never felt so comfortable in a hotel bed. 4 pillows of heaven were surrounding me! After catching up on my sleep I got ready for the day. The concierge gave me 20% off at Macy's, after I told her that i felt like shopping. The hotel doorman got me a cab immediately and soon enough i was knee deep in the shoe department at Macy's! I could go on and on about how wonderful this experience was but its too much to re-cap on! A++ I will return!
