We returned last night with another couple for their all you can eat Alaskan King Crab Legs (for $33.95 per person).  I was slightly worried that we'd be getting some imitation crab meat or some tiny skinny foul smelling crab legs for a deal this good to be true.  And for the first time in my food lovin life I was wrong! They start you off with 1.5 pounds of legs. Along with coleslaw and parmasean corn on the cobb. Oh, and don't forget the butter!!! And boiled potatoes by request!!! They def don't stiff you on the portions here! My advice- wear yer stretchy pants and leave any confining clothing (such as belts) at home. My table had a crab eatin throw down. The guys thought they could out-eat the girls. How wrong they were! Not only did the girls match the guys leg for leg, but us gals also indulged in dessert. The crab legs were huge and succulant. Well worth the 5 battle wounds I now sport on my fingers due to the mechanics of getting that tender meat out of the shell. Ah well, it builds character! They just keep the legs a comin. Need extra butter? Just ask! Want some more corn on the cobb? Right up! We ate so much that we actually got sick of crab! The boys ate so much that their bellys hurt! You MUST come on in for all you can eat night! This place is never ever a miss. It's a homerun every time! If you haven't been, you are truely doing yourself a disservice! TIP: Call a week in advance for reservations for this All You Can Eat night. The reservations book up quickly (as we found out 2 weeks ago when we called day of and couldn't snag a table). They are BYOB so hit up the liquor store next door and save a few bucks!
