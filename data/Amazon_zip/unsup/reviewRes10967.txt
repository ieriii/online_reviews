Soooo... I'm torn about this place. i really enjoy their beer and pizza but its the scene that keeps me away. Go during the day or on a week night when there's less people. Otherwise, its packed full of noisy 20-30 year old professional types that are ready to drink too much and watch sports while cruising each other... and not the gay kind cause that would give this place the points it desperately needs in diversity. Plus, its pricey so expect a big bill for your pizza + beer. If you're looking for good pizza for less. Just go next door to Santullo's. They have beer there too.
