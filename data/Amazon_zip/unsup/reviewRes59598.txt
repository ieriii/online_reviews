i have high expectations for korean food since my bestfriend's mother has spoiled me. great price for allllll the food you get!!!! many ethnic restaurants can be uncomfortable and down right hostile at times, but you dont get that feeling here. i was extremely comfortable with the diverse group of friends i was with! although, our waitress could barely speak english, she smiled and made sure we were satisfied. it truly is authentic food!
