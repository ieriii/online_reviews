4 stars for their sheik babos and chicken tawaa rice, fried chicken. The currys there get only 2-3 stars very watery and not good tasting, the butter chicken is a joke and the lamb curry is horrid. If you go here only order the 3 dishes up top and you will be happy. Place is a dump like every other place on Devon, flys are still hangin on the ceiling with the fly glue trap strings hanging everywhere. Real nice decoration to see when you are eating food. Climp up there and remove the fly traps everyonce in a while.
