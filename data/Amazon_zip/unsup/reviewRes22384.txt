If you want spicy food, this is the place!! I went with 5 other friends and we ate like kings. We ordered about 12 different things to share and the entire bill came to about $118 for everything and we still had food to take home. The place isn't fancy but I like that they bring the food out as it's made so everything is always fresh and not sitting under a heat lamp. The service was so so but the food made up for it. I can't wait to go back.
