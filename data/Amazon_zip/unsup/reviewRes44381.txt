i've been to wakamono numerous times and it never disappoints. the rolls are a little more expensive that some of the other places you can find on halsted or broadway, but it's a trade off for higher quality sushi. menu rotates a little based on seasonality - specialty rolls are unique and delicious. i also like what they did to the place when they renovated. the attached bar looks great and is perfect for anyone waiting for a table. only downer is they don't take reservations and they tend to be a little pesky with people lingering with bottles of wine and no food. never tried delivery.
