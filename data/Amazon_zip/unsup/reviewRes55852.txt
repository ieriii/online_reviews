The table we were seated on was really cramped, we were literally elbowing the people seated next to us. The food was decent but the waiter seemed to have a major attitude problem. He took an obnoxiously long time to come to our table and when he did come he was in a hurry. Food is plausible but service is horrible. I would not recommend this place at all, try Gayloard instead.
