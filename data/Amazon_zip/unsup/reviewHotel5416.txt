On Saturday, July 28th, 2012, my partner, Michael and I held our Civil Union at the Carleton Hotel. Following such a wonderful experience, we wanted to take the time to let everyone know how truly amazing the experience was for us. All of the aspects of the entire event were beyond our expectations. From the hotel itself, to the banquet facilities; from the food, to most especially working with Annie Parker, everything was so delightful.We'd like to note that if you are planning an event, Annie is your girl! From the begining she was a complete pleasure to work with. She and her staff went above and beyond the call of duty while working with us throughout the entire planning process to make sure our weekend was the best that it could have been.We have already been telling everybody we know how great the Carlton is, and how we cannot wait until we can be there, again! Thank you to all who helped us out at the Carleton and please know that we are truly greatful for how wonderful you all made our special day.
