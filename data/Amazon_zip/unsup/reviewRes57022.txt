Sure, this place has good food and beer, but the service is AWFUL! My family was there for a birthday celebration, and when my dad (we're talking nearly 70 yr old man) complained to the manager about their policy of not serving certain beers in pitchers (only served in glasses), the manager said they would no longer serve us anything! Kicked out by the manager for questioning a policy? Come on! Of course this was after we had already paid our nearly $250 bill.
