You want a juiciy and delicious steak? Las Tables is the place to go. The plate came out sizzling and the sides dishes were spot on; tasty, warm, and crunchy. Also had the chicken stuffed with spinach and cheese, yumm! The atmosphere was great, the restuarant was intimate but fun. I would definitely recommend this place!
