My girlfriend and I went to Geja's on Monday night to use our Groupon. When we arrived we told them we had a reservation and we were promptly seated in a cute little corner. It took a little bit long to be greeted at our table but it was understandable because our server was very busy. The server was very helpful and informed us about how the menu works. We ordered the chicken and beef. The cheese fondue was oh so yummy! The beef and chicken were absolutely superb. The veggies were very fresh! And the chocolate fondue was well, its chocolate fondue!!! The service was amazing all night. Our glasses were never more than half empty and the server was always there if we needed her but was not annoying about it. I would definitely recommend this for a date night. We had sooo much fun!
