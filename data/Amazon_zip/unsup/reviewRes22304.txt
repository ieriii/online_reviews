I really wanted to love Superdawg just because of the feeling you get when you are there...it really makes you feel like you are stepping back into your childhood! But I was just not thrilled, at all. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but I would rather go to Portillo's and spend less money on better hot dogs! I mean, I don't know about you but when I go out for hot dogs I usually get 2 and here, everyone seemed to just order one because it came in a cute little box with it's own fries, so we totally felt like fat asses when we ordered a third hot dog to share! The quality of the food is very good and I like the way I felt when I went here, but overall, it was just not great enough to keep me coming back...I think I'm sticking to Portillo's!
