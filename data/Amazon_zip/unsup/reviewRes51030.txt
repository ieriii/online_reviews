Made reservations for Saturday at 11:30 was seated promptly. Service was good however, my date felt like we were being rushed through Brunch and our table was being eyed by the maitre d. We had the migas and the pumpkin pancakes. The eggs were great. The pumpkin pancakes...not so much. The crawfish fritters and beignets were good. The red velvet cake was not really red velvet cake as mentioned b4. However, the cream cheese icecream made this little faux pas inconsequential. Will try again soon. There's too much on the menu to let some "seasonal addition" deter future visits
