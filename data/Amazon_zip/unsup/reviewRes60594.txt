This place can't be beat.You walk in and the atmosphere is awesome. The main entrance is like the foyer of a mansion. The waiting line is often very long but very worth it. Once you get seated, you forget about standing there as soon as the smell of the fresh bread hits your nose. The portions however are very large so order accordingly. They have great food. My favorite thing there is the chop salad which is huge so you should definitely share it. Then for the main course I really enjoy the patty melt. This patty melt is not what you normally think of, it's served on white bread with thousand island dressing. Then to finish it all off I'd go with the chocolate molten cake. Again I'd share this item because it is a very rich dessert.
