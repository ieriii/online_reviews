Parking is plentiful! There are two lots. I went here on a Sunday for a private function and first and foremost, the service was awesome. The lasagna was out of this world. We also had a chicken marsala which I really don't care for, but it was also tasty. The private dining area seated about 60 and was really nice. A good place for a private event with a built in private bar.  I had dinner here a while back and it was very good, but hubby says he wants to take me there again to refresh my memory. He really enjoyed it.
