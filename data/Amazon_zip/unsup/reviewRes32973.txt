I'm always open to new restaurants and cuisines but I was thoroughly disappointed with this restaurant. I should have followed my 1st mind when my husband came from the washroom and was disgusted because it was filthy and filled with gnats. However, against his better judgment we stayed. We started off with samboosa and we should have finished with samboosa. Samboosa is a fried dough filled with a either chicken, greens, lentils or beef and served with several sauces. They were really good. Our entree was presented on their authentic, homemade bread and because I'd done my research I knew exactly what to expect, but my taste buds couldn't adjust. It took everything in me not to ask for a fork or spoon b/c traditional Ethiopian cuisine is eaten with your hands. But after the gnat experience I just couldn't get into it. The meat was tasty but the whole experience was overshadowed by the poor upkeep of that filthy bathroom and the fact that a guy off the street came in and went straight to the kitchen along with a young lady. Apparently they were family of the owners or something but that's too close to my food and I'm sure it's against some type of health code. It's safe to say I'll definitely try Ethiopian food again but I'LL NEVER WASTE MY TIME AT THIS PLACE!
