The wait was a bit too long, but I forgave them because after we ordered, the food came out pretty quickly. We ordered the sweet potato biscuits first. While they were good with the honey butter and jam, I felt they were a bit on the dry side. The beignets were delicious though!  Lauren and I shared the Eggs New Orleans and the Fried Green Tomato Eggs Benedict. Like her, I was not all that impressed with the crab cake from the former dish. The fried green tomato was a good choice. A bit on the tart side but melded perfectly with the poached egg and popover. I would order it again. My bf had the buckwheat pancakes.  Everything was decent enough, but I also thought that the prices seemed a bit on the pricey side. I'm not sure if I would go back -- especially when there are so many other brunch places in Chicago.
