Super discreet place that I would have never known about if it wasn't for my friend. We had no trouble getting in whatsoever, in fact the doorman was very gracious to us. It felt very exclusive and chic with all the velvet curtains and the very dark lighting. This was definitely one of my more unique lounge experiences. The alcohol here is special; our waitress informed us that they have people bring in alcohol from all around the world so she had us try different rums, vodkas, and brandy. We also ordered some food including the waffle fries, the tempura green beans, and the duck meatballs. I didn't care too much for the green beans, they were a little on the bitter side. The duck meatballs were excellent as were the waffle fries.  At midnight, it was my friends birthday so she asked our waitress to bring us surprise shots of whatever. She brought us this special rum from South America. I'm not typically a fan of rum however it went down rather smooth. Between five of us, our bill ran about $130 for some drinks and some appetizers so a little on the pricier side. Like the review below says, the bartenders and waitresses really know their stuff. The service was a little on the slow side but really nice nonetheless. The concept is fun; I'd like to see more places like this in San Francisco!
