going against the grain! I did not like it at all! It's been a while since i went, but there is a reason for that! We went for my friends b day and made sure that our dishes had no nuts, they said of course not, we said are you sure (as certian asian food contains nuts of some sort) they said oh no, not at ALL. We warned that our friend was allergic the waitress clamed us, we ordered, 15 min later my friend is green and running to the bathroom and her face is puffy. I don't need to tell you how the rest of that night went. So yea not my favorite place to go. I blame the waitress mostly so they get an extra star from me....
