The sound of Milk & Honey never really appealed to me until I saw their summer hour's dinner menu which included Chicken & Waffles. Now that's a combo me likey likey. During the summer, they open till 8pm with a limited dinner menu. While I really wanted to have the Chicken & Waffle, I haven't gained the trust of Milk & Honey yet to let them toy with one of my favorite dishes. So I started with something rather basic: the lamb and feta burger. I had to take my food to-go so there are a couple disadvantages about that other than my food not being hot. About the burger: served on a pretzel-ish bun (loved that part) with grilled red peppers (yummy- sweet) a huge hunk of lamb and feta with an olive spread. The bun was moist from the juices from my walk home so you should def. eat it there. My biggest complaint was that the meat was unbearably salty. The burger is served with their chips and a pickle spear for about $8. I didn't like my burger but while I was there, I did check out their menu and would definitely come back to try some of their other sandwiches and maybe even the Chicken & Waffles.
