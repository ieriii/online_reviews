Good beer paired with good food? That's almost sort of revolutionary. Almost. I came here with a group of friends on a Friday night. We showed up early-ish and it was already packed. It's a nice neighborhood bar that's just a little more gastropub-y. We weren't able to get a table right away, so we just sat at the bar the entire time. It really wasn't an issue though. And as the beer kept flowing we completely forgot we wanted a table anyways. The bartenders were attentive and we didn't have to wait very long to get a refill. There is a nice selection of craft beers that are brewed in house and on tap (I really enjoyed the Anti Hero and the Skara Brae), and others that aren't on tap, like Delerium, so there's a whole spectrum of beers to choose from. The chicken wings were decent, but I'm OBSESSED with the bacon fat popcorn. I saw the words bacon and fat and I was already sold on it. But tasting it-oh my. Delish! Definitely worth a try. I also heard that brunch at RevBrew is legit, so I'm looking forward to trying it. Who wants to take me tomorrow?
