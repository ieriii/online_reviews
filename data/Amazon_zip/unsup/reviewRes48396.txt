Great food - the pork rinds are incredible.  But so was most everything.  Great service - our waiter knew his way around the extensive beer menu and served us some real delights and knowledge. Later that night, my car was stolen out of my garage after I used my spare key. The police suspect the valet which, for the record is a owned by a separate company.  As a result, I'm on the fence about The Publican.  Love the food and atmosphere, but one of their contractors came to my house and stole my car!!!!
