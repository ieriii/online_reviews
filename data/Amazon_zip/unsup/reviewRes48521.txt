The cafeteria style dining room is a great place to see and be seen for 20/30 somethings. Very loud but fun. We sat in a booth along the wall, was NOT crazy about the "stall" like booth. Definitely try the strawberry rhubarb coffee cake. The salmon was perfectly smoked with pickled veggies and farmer's cheese and bread. The table's favorite. The bloody mary was great and affordable, only $7 with a small beer accompaniment. The only thing that could have been better was the server, she was more of an order taker. Our table was very well maintained and never needed anything thanks to the bus staff. I will definitely be back to try dinner.
