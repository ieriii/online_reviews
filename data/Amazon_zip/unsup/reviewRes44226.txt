Been a few years since I updated this one. I like to escape the house occasionally for a little variety during the work week and find myself coming down here to jump on line. From the delicious choices in behind the glass, great service and wonderful coffee/teas that they serve it is still my go to in the neighbourhood. Their space next door is set up well for the person looking to jump on line or visit with a friend. Good music in the background hi enough to hear but low enough to talk over and not be heard by the next table and/or to put your headphones in and have to crank it. Thanks to the patrons that understand and respect others personal space.  Ample outlets for laptops that need some juice as well.
