One of the best memories I have of Chicago. People tell you, "duck fat fries will kill you", but guess what, eating the normal processed food we eat will kill us too. So everyone HAS to try real duck fat fries sometime in their life--you can definitely taste the difference. I wouldn't recommend eating this everyday, but that is probably why they only serve it on Fridays and Saturdays. One last night: order the foie gras hot dog. You will absolutely not find this anywhere else. It is incredible, definitely an experience. This place and Weiner Circle, definitely live up to the Chicago hot dog rep. Makes me a proud Chicagoan.
