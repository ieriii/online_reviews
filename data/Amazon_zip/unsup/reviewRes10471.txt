I have been here a couple times and it was a terrifc experience both times. Recently dined with 3 other friends on a Friday evening. We had 9pm reservations and had to wait for a half and hour (a huge pet peeve of mine). Once we were seated we quickly forgot about that part of the visit. Alfredo, our waiter was awesome!! He hooked us up with a great giant bottle of wine, and was very accomodating to our needs. We wanted to each order and entree and split with each other since there were some many delicious options on the menu. He didn't even bat an eyelash and even split the entrees for us!! The black truffle raviloli, amazing!!! The lobster risottoe and white fish were also cooked to perfection!! Love this place and will be back many times!
