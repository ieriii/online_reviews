Was in town hosting an event at McCormick Place so booked some rooms at the Palmer House. This hotel is definitely a bit older but very well maintained. I enjoyed the decor of this location alot...but the rooms were a bit cramped.  There were charges for internet so I just used the computer at the local coffee stop for emails etc. I am looking forward to coming to Chicago again, but I'll give another hotel a try as now I'm addicted to Yelp so I need my free internet.
