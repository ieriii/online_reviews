"I'm not waiting in line for a HOT DOG. That's just ridiculous!!" Oh...sorry, but who made you Jesus? The fact is you CAN wait in line for a stinkin' hot dog like all the other common folk who are just as hungry as you. Boo hoo, you have to stand, converse with your friend(s), listen to your iPod for a mere 20 minutes at the most...poor you! Once you stop whining and realize that these cheap eats are completely worth it, you'll thank me. The Chicago Hot Dog is a staple to this city and if you're going to eat one, this is where you need to go. Plus, the service is great! This is just one of those mandatory experiences that you need to stick in your back pocket, regardless if you are a local or not. Sidenote: definitely get the fries.
