I've given this place too many chances. With all of the Mexican options available in this city, don't waste your money here. The service has been consistently bad. The food, while maybe comes in big portions, is always greasy. Like, I pick up my burrito and a stream of grease pours out. No flavor. No creativity. As some one else noted, a weird barn of a room. Living in the neighborhood though, I have found that it is an ok place to stop for a drink and some chips and guacamole. Otherwise, stay away.
