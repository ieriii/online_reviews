I was at this location a week to a week and a half ago. I was utterly disappointed. I thought the Armitage location was bad. Well, at least the food (for the most part) there is good but service is bad (though my recent staff experience there greatly improved). I ordered the fish special. The fish was not supposed to be fried but it, along with the rice and veggies came standing (literally) in a pool of olive oil. The fish was also very dry, even tough in places.
