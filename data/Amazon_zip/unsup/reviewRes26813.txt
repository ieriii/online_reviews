After what seemed like forever, I think Graham Elliot has finally come into its own. I've eaten there twice this summer and fall, and both times I *finally* received excellent service. The food was all good this time, too, and some of it was excellent. I don't personally think the food is on the same level as, say, Charlie Trotters or RIA, but as an overall dining experience I think Graham Elliot is hitting on all cylinders and now makes for a nice night out. I think that with what is now good service, they're much improved and do deserve five stars.
