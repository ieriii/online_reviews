Let me preface my review by saying I am asian and I LOVE eating every part of the pig. I grew up eating the ears, intestines, and many other parts that my mom still has not told me what they are... On that note, I have to say this place was AMAZING! Even my boyfriend who was not too happy about going here and is extremely picky, loved it here- even the ears and bone marrow. They told us the wait would be 1 hr and 40 min, but ended up only being 1 hr. If you just hang around, most people leave before they call the name so the wait isn't too bad. On to the food... 1. Pig ears: The best appetizer of them all. Crispy and didn't taste like ears at all! So good! I highly recommend this. 2. Bone marrow: I love bone marrow, but this just tasted like spreading butter on bruchetta. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. It was just fun to say I ate "bone marrow." 3. Calamari Saw the other glowing reviews about this and ordered it. It was good, but I wouldn't order it again. This was just marinated with what seemed like lemon and herbs. 4. Jowl Ordered by recommendation from waitress. Basically like a slab of bacon on bread. It was good, but considering the long wait and how much fat was on that meat, I wouldn't order it again. 5. PORK SHOULDER This is a must order! So good!!!! This was the best by far. Moist and tender with a gravy that perfectly complemented. I've never had pork shoulder so tender or yum before... Overall, if you haven't been here I definitely recommend going. The wait is well worth it and once you're seated, there was no wait for the food. It came out fast.
