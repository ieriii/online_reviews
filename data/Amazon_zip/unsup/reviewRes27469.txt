Overall a very good pizza place! Prices are reasonable, wait staff are very friendly and prompt, and food is good! The pizza crust wasn't my favorite in Chicago, but it was a HUGE pizza for the cost and the toppings and all else were great! I'd definitely recommend this place over D'Agostino's or some other family pizzerias.
