Thin crust pizza is to die for! The cheese crust version is basically just like a Pizza Hut pan pizza, still good, but nothing fantastic. Appetizers are classic bar food, not outstanding, seemed like they came from the freezer (which is fine, pretty sure most bars apps do as well). Stick to the thin crust pizza. The place smells phenomenal and the atmosphere is very laid back and great for a pizza and beer night.
