Doughy! That's what I think of when I think of Giordanos. Although the thick crust and thick filling of cheese and fillings is what makes this famous, I feel like they are so busy that they didn't fully cook the pizza. Maybe this is what they are going for but it didn't work for me. Granted- I was full off of one slice of pizza, but I don't think the 2 hour wait was worth it. I would have rather gone to Jake Melnick's down the street which is where I went to grab a drink while waiting. I'm sure you can go to any other Chicago pizza joint and get a good deep dish pizza without the wait.
