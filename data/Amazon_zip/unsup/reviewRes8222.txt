So you think you eat too much meat and want to become a vegetarian eh? Well Fogo de Chao can help you with that! (Kind of like, if you want to quit smoking then smoke an entire carton at once) This churrascaria offers a multitude of meats at the flip of a coaster. Upon sitting down, each patron is provided a coater (red on one side and green the other). Flip to green and you'll be instantaneously swarmed by attentive servers offering to carve you meats from chicken, pork, beef, sausage, and lamb. You're plate will fill so fast you'll be racing to flip to red just to get a breather. Their salad bar is massive and offers the freshest ingredients - my favorites would be their fresh mushrooms and hearts of palm. If you like cheese, you can also partake in their cheese wheels. The wine selection is plentiful and includes delights like ice wine for dessert. Use this place with caution - I made the mistake of going there several times in one week and ended up becoming a vegetarian for a full week.
