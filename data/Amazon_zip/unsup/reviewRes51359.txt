Girls night out needs to happen every once in awhile. And Garcia's is the place to do it.  Especially when half those girls are lesbians and need a game on while sipping margaritas. Pros: -STRONG ritas usually at a $5 special -killer nachos! -Cubs games always on -hardly crowded Cons: -when it does get crowded the two people working there don't know how to handle it -our check usually takes 20 minutes to get to us and then another 15 for the cards to be rung up So just go in expecting that or wave/flag your waitress down! Garcia's knows how to make one mean margarita though!!
