The Palmer House is a pretty spectacular hotel. When I first walked into the lobby, the ceiling made me feel like I was in Las Vegas, but it a good way. My mom stayed on the Executive Level (gotta represent, son), which she loved. They have free cookies and cokes and other snackies. The best part about it is it's not supervised, so I was able to load up on all the free sweets. Made my day. The room she had was quite nice. The interesting thing was that her room had two beds and two bathrooms. I've never had a hotel room with two bathrooms. Very unusual. It turned out to be considerably convenient since her friend shared the room with her. I am told the price of the room was very reasonable. It's right in the heart of downtown. You can't really ask for me. Why my mom loves this hotel so much? It's connected to the Croc Store on State St.
