YES! This place is amazing! My boyfriend lives right around the corner so we decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was great, the service was great, and the food was amazing! We had two of the special items.. so of course I can't remember what they were called. But the beer is very well priced (i think they could price it higher. I worked at an Italian restaurant selling peroni's for like 9 dollars!) but then again, that's one factor making this place great. Just four stars because in my eyes, 5 stars is for something unimaginably amazingly fantastic.. but this place is pretty close! Also, if you don't speak or read italian, be prepared to ask questions! it was a little difficult to decipher the menu. I worked at Buca, so the only italian I remember is Pomodoro, insalate,antipasti.. etc. :)
