I'm a big fan of Wildfire. I always find the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The food is awesome. I really like the dining room. However, I will tell you that if you want to avoid a lot of noise then try to sit in the booths on the upper levels on the sides. I don't think I've had anything other than steaks here. Always a good experience. Highly recommend. Book early for weekend dining.
