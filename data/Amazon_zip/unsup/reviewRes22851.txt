This place is a classic. It has good Chicago hot dogs, decent fries and for an ok price. Sure it is blown out of proportion at times, so dont listen to the TV's exact review of it, but definitely check it out if you have time. Their desserts are also amazing which is good for a hot summer day when you just want to enjoy a good icecream under the shade in your car....
