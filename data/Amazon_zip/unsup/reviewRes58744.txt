My fiance and I went to Graham Elliot Friday for an early Valentine's Day. I didn't quite know what to expect given the mixed reviews lately, but I have to say I was quite satisfied.For starters, we ordered the Duck Confit and Potato Bisque. The duck was simply amazing. The apples and bits of duck fat were delicious, and the duck was cooked to perfection. The potato bisque was very interesting as it came out as a potato skin with cheese and sour cream with some proscioutto in a bowl. They then poured the soup form a teapot at the table. It was very flavorful, but the duck was better.For entree, the lady had the scallops, which were the most perfectly cooked scallops I've ever eaten. She was raving about the brown butter and almonds for the next two days.I had the sturgeon, which I had never had although I love fish. The pumpernickel crust was absolutely amazing, and the cabbage and sauerkraut was great. I don't even like sauerkraut but I scraped every last bit off my plate.For dessert we both had the chocolate ganache. The crushed up malted milkballs and guinness ice cream were great with the ganache, which was actually a generous portion.We actually paid less than we thought we would. We each had a signature cocktail (also good), which were $10-$12. Appetizers were $10-$13, entrees were ~$30, and dessert was $10. Overall, nothing extravagant, but not a place you'd go every week.
