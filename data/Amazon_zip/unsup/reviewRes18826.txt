Good, creative burgers, great beer list and friendly service. My only complaint is, although the service is super friendly, when we were there, it was also very slow service. We were in no hurry, so it wasn't a big deal, but it was just odd that it the place was mostly empty and we found ourselves struggling to get our waitress' attention. That being said, I'm assuming it was an "off" day and I'll definitely go here again.
