Every dish I've had at the Pasta Bowl is super flavorful and delicious. I wouldn't normally frequent this place on the grounds of "I can make pasta at home, and cheap!", but the Pasta Bowl is different. Flavorful is not a strong enough word. Go there and you'll see what I mean. This is fancy Italian restaurant level food at just-a-smidge-above-Noodles-&-Company prices. What's not to love?
