Not only is this location one of the best steakhouses I have ever experienced, it is THE best Wildfire I have ever visited. Every time I leave this establishment, I do not feel one morsel of guilt for the magnificent calories I have just consumed. Everything from their appetizers to their desserts is incredible; especially the blue-cheese crusted filet. The wine selection is above par, and for the price, this is one of the best values in the City. Be sure you make reservations on the weekend, unless you wish to wait hours for a table, or eat at 9:30 in the evening. A 'must-do' recommendation is to acquire one of their U-Shaped, horseshoe style booths - they are great!
