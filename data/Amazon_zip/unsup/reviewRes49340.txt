In my opinion this place is over hyped. The baked goods and coffee are good if you are taking them to go. If on the other hand you want to sit with a friend and have a conversation it is not the place to go. I have stopped in a few times and its always the same scenario, dead silent and the patrons seem pissed if you speak. Is this a coffee shop or a library? I give them 3 points on the service and products but can't do more than that based on the atmosphere.
