This is a great find. Its a small restaurant with big flavors. The chef/owner waits on every table. If you choose to bring in your own wine they can match the wine to the courses. The timing between courses was perfect. I die for heavenly desserts and they did not disappoint they have a trio plate the best was an amazing mango panna cotta topped with hazelnuts....deliciousness.
