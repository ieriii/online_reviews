We've eaten here once and I was with my husband who does not like mussels so I really want to go back and try those. Our food that we did have was pretty good - worth 3 or 4 stars. Going here to drink beer is the best though. It gets crowded but if you hang out for a bit you will get a seat or at least an area to stand near the bar.  I can not remember the name of it but they have this amazing apple beer on tap. It's the perfect way to start the evening. You can't drink it all night because it's too sweet but the "small" serving is just right. From other reviews there have been complaints about the noise. I really don't recall hearing any music at all. I've always been able to have a pleasant convo with those I'm with.  The crowd is usually really friendly too. I even had a girl offer to let me sip her beer when I asked her about it. I do wish they had Hoegarden on tap but really, there's plenty to pick from.
