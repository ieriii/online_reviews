we went there very early and the line is already building up all the way in to another building. It opens at 10:30am. we got there and i odered the Garlic-Rosemary Smoked Chicken Sausage with rosemary garlic mustard and Smoked Cumin Gouda Cheese- the hotdog itself was too much for me. I could taste of all of the ingredients the garlicky put not too much of the taste of garlic and rosemary..if u like this two ingredient combo then this hotdog is for you. If u want the duck fries...1 order is good enough for 2 ppl , but i didn't know how much portion they give out so my husband ordered one for himself. He ordered 3 hotdogs 1. Ribeye Steak Sausage with chimichurri and crispy fried onions=== i like this kind i guess better on what i have chosen... 2. Foie Gras adn Sauteres Duck Sausage with a truffle aioli foie gras mousse and sel gris---- i am not too fond of the taste of truffle bc it brings an after taste to my mouth my husband love this dog..he said it was tooo rich for him 3. The Dog Chicago Style HOt dog with all the trimmings--- he said he loved all of the 3 dogs.. would i go back ....me personally no not really.. I am not obsessed with hotdog's ...One time is good for me.... Maybe if they have specials that i would be interested. the duck fries--- i couldn't tell the difference. their fries were like shoestring kinds ......
