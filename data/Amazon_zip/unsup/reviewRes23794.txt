Party over here! Thats what it felt like when I ate here last week. It was super loud and crowded even though I was there pretty late and on a Tuesday. The wait staff was very friendly and upbeat and also very prompt with getting our drink orders and food out. I had saganaki and it was great. Not too salty as I have had at other greek places. I also had a super large greek salad and a shrimp appetizer both were great. Ill be back and this time I will save room for dessert.
