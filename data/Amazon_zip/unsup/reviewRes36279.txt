I've only ever had their takeout but it's always been quite tasty. My boyfriend used to frequent Indie when he lived nearby and has rave things to say about the dine-in experience, but I'll let him write that review. (I think he just liked all the cute waitresses!) I love the Indie Signature Curry. It's so unique and delicious with squash and avocado...Mmm. I like their Pad Thai too, but I always have to ask for it extra spicy. I'm a spice whore though, so it might be fine for some. Their Japanese basics (Edamame, Miso, etc.) are yummy and the few classic rolls I've had have been fresh and good. I like the various city rolls I've tasted off other people's plates, but my favorite Signature Maki is the La Fiesta. Sushi + Cilantro = Happy Anna. They are a little expensive though, that's the only draw back.
