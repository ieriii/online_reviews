Get: House-made Italian Wedding Cookies Bread Pudding with Marsala & Citrus Mussels with Pancetta, Crme Fraiche & Marjoram Pass: Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive Tapenade panini Prosciutto Bread Balls I personally like the ambiance of this place. It gets really loud too if its crowded, and its pretty much always crowded at night, so if you want a little bit of a quieter setting, brave the cold and eat outside in the tented area and sit near the heater :) The service here is really great - They didn't have any seats open when I called in, and they said they would call me back when one opened. My friends and I decided to walk around and go to a wine bar across the street and when our seat opened, they called us. I explained we were in the middle of a glass of wine and they told me they would hold our seats for up to 15 minutes, which I thought was great, considering how long the waiting list was. The servers were all very knowledgable about the wine they served and what would pair well with what you ordered, and they didn't try to push anything on us. I got the panini, and it was just okay, nothing special. Same goes for the bread balls. For both of those, they are perfectly okay, but I probably wouldn't get them again. I really liked the mussels and the wedding cookies and the bread pudding however. Great place, great atmosphere, and great service.
