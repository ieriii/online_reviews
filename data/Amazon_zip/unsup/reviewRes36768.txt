So today I was thinking about ordering from here through Grub Hub and then found out my neighbors had just had dinner there tonight. Another friend woke up from his NYE hangover and was hungry. When I found out my first choice Tank Noodles was closed I said we should to Indie since I knew it was open. The decor made me think it was going to be more expensive than what I read online. But luckily they just have nice decor and an affordable menu. And the food was really good too! We started with the Santana roll and their special a Blazing Coconut roll, both were inventive and tasty. We each had a soup. He had the Tom Ka Gai which had all the right flavors and I had the Won Ton. The won tons had big pieces of shrimp and was really good. The broth was a bit salty but not enough to not have kept trying to finish the bowl! We shared the Indie Signature Curry(massamun curry). For $10 is was amazing! Massamun is my favorite of the thai curries and this was well done. I only wish it had more pineapple chunks but the beef was really tender and the potatoes were cooked through. Our total bill came to $64(incl tax and tip). We both agreed it was worth it and if I go back and have a similar experience I'll bump it to 5 stars!
