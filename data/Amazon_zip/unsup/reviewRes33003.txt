It's byob and it fit nicely in my giving friends the tour of the loop. But I probably won't be back. The food was fine, but there are way too many places with better brunch options. They also seem to be too busy for their own good, no seats in the Air Conditioned waiting area, and entirely too many 4 tops, which they consistently use for 2 tops. Our waitress was friendly, besides the fact we never quite had the right number of menus/silverware/cups etc on our table. Anyways if you need some byob brunch it's really the only reason to go here.
