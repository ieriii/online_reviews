Possibly one of my favorite places from breakfast in the city. You really can't go wrong with any of the breakfast items, especially the amazing (and rotating menu of) pancakes and the breakfast panini sandwich...eggs, bacon, Cheddar and tomato. AWESOME. It's rather thick...probably about 4 eggs, and is served with baked potato chips. (little less than $7). They serve Intelligentsia "Milk & Honey" blend coffee and make great espresso drinks. Fresh squeezed juice as well. The staff is usually pretty dry, rather down-to-business, except for a tall woman with dark hair and skin, who is ALWAYS smiling and wonderfully friendly. Pretty quick service. You're guaranteed to have to wait in line for a table...sometimes longer in the winter when the outdoor patio is closed. The restaurant is also a pretty tight squeeze, so taking those two aspects into consideration...make sure you're in the mood to deal with it.
