I have stayed in five different hotels in Chicago and this is my favorite. I actually like the fact that it is a few blocks off Michigan Avenue. It is still a really great location. Our room was spacious and clean. The lobby is beautiful and the girl at the front desk gave us free drinks and snacks in the lounge when our room wasn't ready for check-in. We had a great stay, and I would love to stay at the Fairmont again.
