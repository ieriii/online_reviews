My friend actually got emotional eating here after living in India and not having American style pizza for over a year. That pretty much sums up for me the quality experience it is to come to Piece and order one of their giant, fresh, delicious pizzas. Certain special things to note are how big the pizzas end up being. Expect to bring leftovers back home with you. Also, they brew their own interesting beers, too. Perfect accompaniment to pizza. Also, my favorite crust/sauce combo is simply the classic version- The ingredients are so perfect, why mess with success? The several times I've been there, service has been a bit spotty. I always feel a bit like they're trying to rush you out the door. Understandable, considering how overcrowded it gets on the weekends (a wait for a table is almost certain). However, most recently when I was there on Tuesday or Wednesday night and there was plenty of space, the waitress was still really trying to move us along. Patience! We just want to savour your good pizza..
