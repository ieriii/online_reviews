Honestly a 4.5 After all the talking among the cooks I know that have been fortunate enough to dine here, I couldn't take it any longer. Friday night, 10:00 P.M., I find myself in front of this brightly colored mecca (if you will) of great Italian food. Not the "Let's smother pasta in an absurd amount of bland mozzarella and metallic red sauce," but actual simple, honest food. I have always had plenty of reservations about going out to eat at such restaurants for that reason, something I'll have to work on. The interior is wonderful, open kitchen with a wood-fired oven, one single room that isn't that spacious, but you won't feel cramped either. The bar is perfect for one in a restaurant, I'm a sucker for anyplace the takes the time to consider a foot rest and hooks for your belongings. The hostess informed us that we would not be seated for 45 minutes, but after less than two we found our way to said bar. After ordering wine (none in bottle form over $45.00). The chicken liver mousse was spot on fantastic! We also ordered the truffled egg toasts with asparagus... amazing! The seared octopus rounded out dinner and like the two dishes before, there was absolutely nothing bad to say! When our meal was up, our bartender offered a taste of different digestifes on the house! This is one place I'll be visiting again and again !!!! I can't wait!
