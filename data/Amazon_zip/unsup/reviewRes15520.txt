great for kids. don't believe the hype! I was a little hesitant to bring my two kids (1y and 4y) because it says its not good for kids, but its totally great. They have plenty of high chairs, a separate kids menu, crayons, and even a separate family restroom with a changing table so a parent of either gender can comfortably change their kids in a private bathroom. I guess the only ding would be that they don't have small cups with tops or more kid-friendly drinks, but that is a minor point. Just come early because the lines start building after about 6. Despite it being so busy, service was great. we were impressed with the house-made sausages, the bacon popcorn was lots of fun (a little greasy, but its bacon!), and the beef stew was yum! There were also lots of vegetarian options for those who don't enjoy meat. The decor was really nice, the food is great, the beer is awesome, and I am definitely coming back!
