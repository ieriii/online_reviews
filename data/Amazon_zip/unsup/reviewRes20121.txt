I have had multiple friends recommend Coast to me and my only regret is that I waited to go. We ordered 4 different rolls, all fantastic. They serve real wasabi (you must request and pay extra), which now that I have had it, it will be hard to eat the horseradish fake wasabi that usually comes with sushi. The atmosphere and music is relaxing. Our waiter was knowledgeable. It's also BYOB, we brought Saki, they chilled it for us at our table. It was perfect. Verdict, my boyfriend and I will be moving next door so that we will never be without quality, delicious sushi, again.
