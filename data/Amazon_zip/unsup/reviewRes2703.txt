After I was blown away by RIA the previous night, I was expecting Tru to be up there especially since a couple sitting next to me were saying how good Tru is. I did the chefs tasting menu at both places with the wine pairings. The service was great and the food was really good. I do not think it is worth the price tag, but I did have an overall great dining experience. Had I not gone to RIA the night before I think I would've given this place at least a 4 stars. Doubt that I will go back to Tru
