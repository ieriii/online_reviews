Had a wonderful dinner here with my friend who just moved to the neighborhood. We were just walking down the street looking for chow and decided on this. Great decision! Perfect mix of casual and fancy. Nice staff. Delicious food. Comfort food without feeling nasty afterward! I had the shrimp with cheese grits, it was wonderful. My cup of coffee was disappointing (milk is NOT half&half!) but it didn't really matter by then.
