My second experience at Mastro's did not match my first experience. I think overall I give Mastro's 4 stars, so this should average it out. Service was very attentive at first but once we were served our entrees, the server disappeared. I really wanted his attention because my filet arrived Well instead of the Medium Rare I ordered. By the time my filet was replaced my dining companions had already fished their meal and I had filled up on sides.  Overall good experience but I don't think I'll return unless someone else is footing the bill.
