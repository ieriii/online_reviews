One night my friend and I were absolutely drunk off of our asses, and we wanted sushi. I remembered hearing about a Korean BBQ (on Check Please or something) that was open really late, so we decided to try that instead, since there are no 24 hour sushi places here that are decent (as far as I know). So we get in and it's smoky. That's fine, it's a fucking bbq, of course it's going to be smoky. NOBODY is non-Korean inside except us (the Mexican and the Indian) and we are getting nervous and giggly. We sit down and I'd heard the baby octopus was good, so I ordered that. He ordered the beef. They bring this giant, burning FIRE onto our table, and I'm thinking "Oh great, motor skills, etc." Imagine my face when the 67 bowls of condiments and lettuce bundled in a rubber-band showed up on my table. What. I had never been to Korean BBQ and I was terrified but excited. We cooked our meat with no problem. My spicy baby octopus curled up and got all yummy on the grill, and my friend's beef was delish too. It was all delicious. I tried a lot of the condiments but didn't really know what to do with them. I liked the teeny tiny dried fish though. The bitchy waitresses weren't all that mean, and the bit of sass that I did get was funny. She cracked jokes with us a couple of times, and then we saw our waitress and a few of the others eating cake with chopsticks. It was a fun experience, and I got to smell delicious for a while afterwards! mmm!
