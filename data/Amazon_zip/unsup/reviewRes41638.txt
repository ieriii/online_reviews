Such a cute , quaint place that has solid "fancy" food. It would be a great place to go on a date night or with a group of girl friends, which is what I did. We went on a Sunday "no-menu" night, which to me is not ideal since I love planning my menus ahead. But this actually worked out. I notified them of what I don't eat (rabbit and lamb) and they accommodated that in the menu. We got the 4 course meal, which was plenty of food. Everything was presented nicely and tasted great, however there wasn't anything that blew me away. The entree was a duck dish served over risotto that was probably my favorite. The service was also fantastic! And, one of the best things about this place is it is BYOB. How cool is that to have an upscale restaurant be BYOB? What made this visit even more memorable and more awesome was as we were finishing our dinner, Grant Achatz came in to dine and he was dining at the table next to us! That was quite amazing and just made it all the better!!
