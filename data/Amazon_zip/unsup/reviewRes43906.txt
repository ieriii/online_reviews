They introduced a $20 Prix Fix for dinner, which includes a nice offering of salad, entree and dessert. A great deal for a nice place like Kinzie. This offer is April and May only. I wonder when this 'economy friendly' idea will catch on with other upscale restaurants. Kinzie is the only one I have seen to take such steps. Kudos! By the way, lunch on 4/21/09 was great, as usual.
