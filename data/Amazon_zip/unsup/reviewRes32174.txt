Like many others out there, I was excited about the Groupon to this restaurant. My Mum was visiting, and wanted to try Ethiopian food, so I snatched this deal up. Unfortunately, my Mum and I never made it, so I got to bring my boyfriend. This is fun and funny for one reason: injera bread! I think eating with your hands is just about the sexiest thing you can do, but it was also pretty funny until he got the hang of it. I started with the honey wine, and together we ordered the messob for two. Looking back on it, we probably could have just ordered for one, because the food was SO filling! I wrote down the numbers of what we ordered so I would be able to remember it for this review: 33. ye-beg wot (spicy) 58. ye-salmon dulet 46. special kitfo 49. ye-siga tibs 29. quosta 38. ??? I still can't tell you what all of that was, but I can tell you that I especially enjoyed the lamb and the spinach (quosta?). We sat on the patio, and enjoyed a beautiful night. I thought the service was great -- quick, friendly, and very helpful. I'm pleased that it's only a short walk from our apartment, and that it's a fun alternative place to bring vegetarian friends when they visit (once you get tired of waiting in line at the Chicago Diner). We'll be back!
