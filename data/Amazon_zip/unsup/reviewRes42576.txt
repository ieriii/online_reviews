Picasso, Rembrandt, Monet, The Art of Pizza... The list goes on and on. Their stuffed crust pizza is so good your belly will fall asleep on you for days and you'll forget about eating anything else. One slice of the large pizza is about all I need, and man-oh-man can I get my eats on! It is thick, super-cheesy, with a crisp buttery outer crust that is ever-so-slightly flaky and just downright delicious. My only complaint would be when getting delivery the inside crust is just a bit too doughy for me. I always just pop it in the oven for about 5 more minutes, and then it is piping hot and ready to be devoured, just like it came fresh out of their ovens, and I pretend that it didn't sit in the backseat of some dude's car for the last 30 minutes. The thin crust is OK, but not the best. Stick to what this place does the best - the thick stuffed crust. Thick as your skull, numskull! That said, they do have specials every single day for lunch and dinner - and not pizza specials, we're talking ribs and all kinds of other foodstuffs. Amazingly great deals to be found. But I still stick with the pizza. And who wouldn't want a free liter of soda with every pizza purchase? And they deliver.
