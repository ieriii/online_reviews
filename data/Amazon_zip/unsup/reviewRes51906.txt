Everyone and their mom has reviewed this place, but let me just say the following: 1. It's one of the great pizza spots in America. No one can deny that. 2. If you are complaining about the lines you have failed to recognize point 1. 3. It is definitive. This (along with a few other outstanding pies) are the definition of a great style of food. You can not like it the way they do it. That's fine. But this is what Chicago Pizza is about and it's incredible. I don't even like cheese and I think it's incredible. I like Lou Malnati's better, sure... but it's still incredible. It's incredible. Thank God for stuff like Gino's East. It's places like that that make eating in America, uh, incredible.
