Ok Im not going in to specifics because if you read other reviews you will see most of their plates are all thumbs up, heres what I will write, it was my first time there, the owner came up to us asked if it was our first time there, we said "yessshirr" he responded by bringing us a complimentary plate of appetizers for us to try and it was super delicious, those small things go long ways in establishing a good connection with your clientele. Of course to back up that experience the food was on point, price was right, and belly was satisfied. go there a must!
