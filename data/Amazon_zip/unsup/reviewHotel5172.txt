We had our wedding reception at Hotel Allegro on October 1, 2011. Everything was done perfectly - and the food was delicious! The ballroom was beautiful, very classic downtown Chicago. The coordinator was wonderful to deal with and very thorough. I would highly recommend Hotel Allegro for special events such as a wedding. We could not have been more pleased!
