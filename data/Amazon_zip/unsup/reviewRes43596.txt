Everything was amazing. From the food to the service to the ambiance. I guess I'd call myself a newb in the world of meat so the waiter's in depth explanation of the different steak cuts was super educational. Some of the highlights: -Your waiter will ask you to cut into the center of your steak once it arrives to make sure it has been cooked the way you like it. -The mushroom risotto was more than good. If you can't decide on a side, go with this one!! -All sauces are complimentary, so feel free to try more than one! My suggestions: Delmonico with Gorgonzola cream sauce and a side of mushroom risotto.
