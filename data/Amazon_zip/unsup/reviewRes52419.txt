I just got a new job and one of my friends was super nice and wanted to take me out to celebrate my escape from hell. It was magical, i mean there was majesty flying all over the place. The meat was super meaty and the service was like watching a double rainbow. We had Claudio, he found out about my new digs and wrote a congrats on my new job on the dessert plate and was just all around one of the best servers I have ever had. Now go get some Brazzaz.
