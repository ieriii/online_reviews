W-hotel and the Altitude on the 33rd floor arguably the best 280-degree views in town. Sarah Petermann, catering manager, did a great job executing our recent engagement party on the top floor Altitude with 118 people in attendance and they all felt it was the best party they have ever been to. There is still great "buzz".Sarah from the catering department helped with "The Far East Meets the Near South" (Asian and South American) food selection. The presentation of the food will actually be placed in our photo album-montage.  We were very happy with all of her suggestions. She performed extensive relocation of the furniture to ensure the "flow" of the room. Sarah outreached to our incoming out-of-town guests and made sure they were educated on hotel amenities. W-Hotel also provided referrals for a nanny or evening sitter for our esteemed nephew-Mathew. My cousin Sandra is a new mom and this was a concern for the family. The service was wonderful on all aspects and we had a great time. Thank you to all the staff and especially Sarah Petermann.Michael & Janette "MJdragonfly"
