Larger than the lakeview location, same great food. The Chicago and Palace crepes my fav's. I have tried to build my own before, but I'll leave creation up to the chefs. I finally saved room for a dessert crepe, and I'm glad. Pistachio and green tea icecream with the crepe D'Amour a real home run. I didn't have a problems with service, even on a busy Sunday afternoon around lunch time. A must try for breakfast, lunch or dinner!
