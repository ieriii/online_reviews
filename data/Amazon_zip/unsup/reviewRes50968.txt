Siiiiiiiigh. Lovely. Just, lovely. I had such a nice meal here that I am still mooning over it in my memories. I had the special, which turned out to be venison with venison sausage, zucchini pancake, bacon, a blueberry reduction, and a bunch of other deliciousness. Maybe it sounds like a strange combination but It worked deliciously. It was eyes rolled back in head good. I was so thrilled as I love love love venison and only get to eat it rarely. OH! and the cornbread cakes with honey butter were no joke! We topped of the meal with the red velvet cake, and, as an extra bonus, our server announced to my dining companion and I, that the chef had been experimenting, and presented us with two dark dark chocolate truffles. I am officially in love with Big Jones. Surprise truffles? Be still my beating heart.
