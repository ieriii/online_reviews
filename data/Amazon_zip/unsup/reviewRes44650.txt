The specialty Chicago style pizza is so tasty! More cheese than you'll know what to do with... My boyfriend raves about this place like it's going out of style. I thought the flavors were great but I'm just not the biggest fan of deep dish, which is what this place is all about. If you're into Chicago-style pizza, definitely stop in!
