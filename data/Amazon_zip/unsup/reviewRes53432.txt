An experience unmatched. We dined at Trio when Grant was the executive chef there and were blown away. Alinea is somehow even better. We found the staff to be extremely gratious and educational which is necessary if you want to get the most out of this experience. And the food is fantastic. The presentation is entertaining, to say the least. The creativity of the chef and his team is unparalleled. And everything tastes amazing! Even the dishes I was convinced I wouldn't like melted in my mouth. For those without huge expense accounts, it's worth saving up for!
