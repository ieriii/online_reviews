Calamari fritti was awesome! I loved it here. Only other good one I had was at Lou Malnati's and Bucca di Beppo. I got it on a carry-out order and they even said they wanted to fry it just before I come to pick it up so that it'll be fresh. And it was good. I also had their grilled eggplant appetizer which was really just a large slice of eggplant with cheese on top...soaked in marinara sauce. I wasn't too impressed by it though it did taste good. The eggplant wasn't too soggy or anything like that so it was pretty good. I've always gotten friendly service and prompt service here each time I went. And parking is easy to find too during weekday lunch time ..there's like free 2 hour street parking in front I believe. I love their mix of parmesan, garlic, olive oil, and crushed red pepper that they give for your bread. It is genius. *Sad, they don't open during lunch on weekdays anymore. I used to go during my lunch break. Looks like only dinner now... 4pm-10 or 11pm.
