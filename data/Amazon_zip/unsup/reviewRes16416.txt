So worth a trip on the red line to eat at this yummy Indian place! I have been here a few times and always roll out after eating because I do not have an off button when the food is brought out. Besides being overwhelmed by all the choices, I always make sure to try something new because there is so many tasty treats.  The samosas are a safe bet and the dipping sauces?? Just can't get enough! Chicken palak, chicken vindaloo, palak paneer, aloo gobi, kaju curry, dal makhani, channa masala: YES, PLEASE!! Paired with jasmine rice and/or naan?!? Double YES, PLEASE! There are several white wines that pair nicely with the Indian heat in the dishes too. The meals are a bit pricey when compared to other Indian restaurants, but should not be missed if in the area.
