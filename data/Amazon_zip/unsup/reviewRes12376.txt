They give you big portions of food during dinner. I like the Comal with Chicken - very tasty. I had the Plaintain appetizer which was pretty bland. I also had the Pomegranite Mimosa which was just okay. People seem to like the Mojitos. The environment is okay - it can get pretty crowded but still feels somewhat intimate depending on where you are seated. I've been here for lunch and thought it was pricey for what you get and not that great during lunch. Dinner is your best bet. Expect to spend $28 for dinner and drinks per person here.
