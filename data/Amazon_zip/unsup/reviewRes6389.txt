I am ashamed to admit that I haven't ordered steak here. But it's only because I love their salads and their salmon so much that I can't break away from those. The BBQ salmon is delicious and the chopped salad is great too. And the best part- the desserts! They bring you the dessert tray and it's very difficult to just choose one!
