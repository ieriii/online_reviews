AWESOME! My boyfriend and I were visiting for Valentines Day weekend from Pittsburgh. We looked for a good steak house for our Saturday night dinner and through the great reviews on Yelp we decided this place was worth a try. The food was delicious. We started off with the crab stuffed shrimp, it was excellent and not overly buttery like many shrimp dishes can be.  I ordered the Porterhouse (Med rare) w/ a blue cheese crust, broccoli and a baked potato-- the steak was juicy and seasoned perfectly. The sides were a great portion. My partner ordered the beef wellington, I had a bite and I must say it was equally as good as my dish. For dessert we had the black forest chocolate cake (piled high with cherries, sauce and homemade whipped cream) it was decadent to say the least. Oh yea, they have a vast wine selection as well!  This place is a MUST. I know theres a lot "fancier" or more "bougie" places to eat in Chicago, but the atmosphere here is lively, not staunchy and for the price you just cant lose.
