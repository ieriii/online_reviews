My wife and I celebrated a birthday last night at the "Q." My wife made the reservation a few days ahead, thank goodness, and we were seated immediately upon arrival. We were greeted by the waiter, after receiving complimentary BBQ potato chips and bread and butter pickles, as soon as we were settled in. The waiter assisted my wife with her choice of beer and answered questions regarding our food choices. Surprisingly, the waiter suggested the less expensive of the two rib selections, which is not the norm when asking wait staff which food they recommend. Soon after ordering, the food arrived. We had the Kobe Beef Brisket, the St. Louis Ribs, the Kobe Beef Beans, Cole Slaw, and Honey Buttered Corn Bread. The food was awesome and we had plenty to take home afterword. The price for the entire meal and two beers was $60.00, excluding tip. The entire staff were attentive, yet not overbearing. At the end of the meal, the waiter provided a birthday desert, complimentary as well, in a discreet manner. (Much appreciated!) I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to enjoy good BBQ in an upscale atmosphere. The only issue which kept my review at 4 stars was the noise level. Because the restaurant is filled to capacity in the dining room and bar, it tends to be a bit noisy. That being said, I will return to this restaurant and refer others as well. Well done!
