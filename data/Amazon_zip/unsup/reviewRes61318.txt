just ok.. there are better cuban joints to go to.. Rinconcito cuban cafe on Fullerton and saywer is much better so is marianos on milwaukee. you can also get an awesome sandwich at bella cafe near fullerton and spaulding. i just thought with all the hype that i would be amazed but it was just ok lettuce and tomato sandwich on a french bread. a lil greasy and too much vinegar i believe. i'll try another sandwich next time i'm extra hungry and near them.
