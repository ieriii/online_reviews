I have yet to stay here, but my best friend took me here for lunch on my birthday, and I have more than good words to shower this place with. The front desk staff was absolutely lovely and inviting. We got seated right away without any hesitation. As soon as we were sat, our awesomely accomandating waitor came by with our drinks. He was humble and friendly in a very professional way. For my lunch, I ordered a romaine leaf salad whose dressing had just the perfect creaminess, and my friend ordered the steak sandwich which I highly recommend. Portions aren't big but just enough to fill you up. The chef came out to greet us after we were done eating as well. My experience here was nothing less than excellent. I definitely recommend this as a business lunch place or if you just want to grab drinks they have a cozy bar as well.
