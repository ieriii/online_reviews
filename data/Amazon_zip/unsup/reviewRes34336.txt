huge fan of sultan's. after trying a few other mediterranean places in the city i can definitely say now that sultan's is the best mediterranean food in chicago. the lentil soup has a nice lemony zest to it which i've found to prefer over more curry based cumin-y soups. their falafel is perfectly cooked and never greasy. the hummus is amazing and the spinach pie is to die for. did i also mention how good the curry rice is? basmati rice with peas, carrots and a slight sprinkle of curry. topped with your choice of salad. the portions here are very generous as well. i usually hate eggplant but their babaganoush is amazing. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! the salad bar is also great. grape leaves, veggies and fresh cheeses (not the tofu i once accidentally though cubes of feta were. duh!) very, very well priced. falafel sandwiches will run you $4. small soup $2. spinach pie $2 small rice+salad $2. mix and match. you do the math. sultan's rules!
