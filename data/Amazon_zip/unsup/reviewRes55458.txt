5 stars alone for the gorgeous outdoor space. Must visit on a warm summer night and sit outside.Also enjoyed the menu very much. Portion sizes are a little lighter, everything we've tried has been delicious. Love the grilled octopus and also the fava bean pasta.Great service, great food, great wine, and terrific ambiance.
