Gotta love Doug.  He is the nicest cashier ever.  One would never know that this guy runs a place that has become world renowned, is featured on tv shows, magazines, newspapers, etc.  This guy is down to earth and just plain happy.  Regardless of the awesomeness of the dogs and sausages, he makes the place what it is.  So on to the food.....we had the saucisse toulouse with anchovy butter, which was salty (as it should be) and savory.  Then on to the atomic dog.  Whoa that baby is hot but then combined with the cheese and raspberry mustard, it is just a genius combo.  Because we got there at 10:00 on a Tuesday we were in and out in short order and I cannot wait to make the trip out again.
