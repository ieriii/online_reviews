Yes, it's "as good as it gets". Everything we had - grilled calamari, rabbit ravioli, lobster ravioli, gnocchi, short ribs, bread pudding was absolutely excellent. But it was also unique and not something we have ever had elsewhere. The service was very, very good as well. They struck the right balance of helpfulness and leaving you alone to enjoy your dinner. It was clearly all about us and not about them. My daughter brought us their after she got a 15% discount with a birthday greeting from them. Nice! I want to go back. Soon.
