Every bite is rich, thank goodness each course is only a mouthfull. Still it was the most memorable meal I've ever had. Go for the full menu, as I doubt this is the type of place where you become a regular. A lot of people get hung up about price. If you think of it as dinner and a show, it's much more reasonable.
