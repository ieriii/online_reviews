Queue typical intro: I have a great friend of mine who is a strict vegan... Well, you know the rest. It's a cool place even for those who are carnivorous. There's no reason anyone shouldn't appreciate this place. Vegan/vegetarian cooking is a whole different ballgame and obviously requires a good amount of trickery to make the stuff taste good, they clearly understand that trickery here. Most places offer vegan/vegetarian "options", but I always feel like they fall short. Or you'll be like, "Yeah, can I have a chicken caesar hold the chicken and the caesar and the parmesan." And then you just end up with a pile of lettuce. Nuh-uh. Not at the Chicago Diner. And that's what's cool. I usually get the avocado tostadas. Tasty. Filling too. You forget there's no meat in them. Also I've gone here for breakfast, and the coffee and OJ is truly out of this world. I would go there alone for just that. The atmosphere is cool, but bustling. I like that it's your traditional diner but the menu is so reverse from what most diners offer. There's junk food here, no doubt, but maybe there's that one time you just want to try it out...
