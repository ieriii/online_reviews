My fifth visit to the Gage took place tonight and all I can say is that I continue to be more impressed each time. At first glance, it looks like some kind of Irish pub-in-a-box from the street. But it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to forgo this gem based on that mistaken belief. Where to start? How about the bar? It's long, it's beautiful, it's near huge windows and it's stocked. Really stocked. With beers from around the world and around the corner, seasonal cocktails and everything in between. Even the vodka list is respectable and this would seem more of a whiskey spot. The floors are old fashioned tiles and going there somehow feels grown up- almost elegant in some strange, casual way. Also, it's huge- the front restaurant and bar area opens up into a dining room and there is yet more space downstairs, with a second bar. Anyway, onto the menu, which is divided into four sections- Firsts (starters), Seconds, Thirds and Fourths, the fourths being the largest plates. Quite frankly, anything after the Firsts easily makes a satisfying meal but what is most impressive and commendable is the uniquely delicious preparation AND I love the commitment to organic, natural meats and local ingredients. Favorites include the goast cheese tart with escargot, a scallop lunch salad with a citrus vinaigrette, and my favorite thus far, the carmelized lobster with lemon quinoa and fresh basil. Absolutely stunning!!!! I could go on and on (obviously, I already have). The only change they might consider would be to add a simple green side salad to the menu somewhere. All that richness might be better digested with a little roughage! Cheers, Gage. Keep doing what you do.
