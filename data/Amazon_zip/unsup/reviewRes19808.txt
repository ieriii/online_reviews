Interesting to look at, but somewhat lacking... their signature burger (I believe called "the gage" ?) has camembert and an onion marmalade on it. Two of us ordered it; it sounded really scrupmtious but to me it was just too sweet and I wish I would've just gotten the $4 cheaper "regular" cheeseburger. The sweetness of the burger could've been counteracted by something with a little spice or zip and it probably would've made me happier. The fries were crispy yet had remnants of icky tasting oil, and needed salt. Service was lacking... we went during lunch and of course it was busy... but we waited about 15 minutes before anyone even came to our table or gave us a menu, and waited a little long through every step of the process... ESPN on every tv in the place? blah.  The atmosphere is supposed to be pub-like... I guess it is in a very corporate sense. It's very nice inside, well decorated with very modern fixtures. I guess I don't see the connection to it being a pub so much, it could've just as easily been called a sports bar, or not been called a pub at all. The pub feel seems contrived, it doesn't seem any more Irish than the Bennigan's a block away. All that said, I'd say it's just as good of a choice as almost anything in the area so I'd go back for a lunch if in the area.
