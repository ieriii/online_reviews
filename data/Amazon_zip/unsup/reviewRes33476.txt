Sultan's is like a really good friend. That is, always there for you with lentil soup when you need it. The lentil soup alone is reason enough to get me through the door at Sultan's at least twice a month. Other notable additions are the curry rice and (duh) the falafel. Best of all, the prices can't be beat, even by a miser like me. Lots of vegan options, but also satisfied my meat-crazy dad. I think he got the lamb dish just to spite me.
