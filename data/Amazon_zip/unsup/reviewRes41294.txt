Ok so I went out on a limb here and tried the Pho , apparently pronounced "Faaah". This cozy place off the Red Line Argyle stop in "little Vietnam" as my Vietnamese friends like to call it.  Pho Xe Tang definitely has a cafeteria / fastfood feel to it with large tables for groups of 6+ or more personal 1 on 1. Not what you would call big on "atmosphere" Even though this place is predominantly frequented by the locals, the staff is still friendly and helpful for adventuring newcomers. What they specialize is a beef soup called Pho that is composed of beef broth, noodles with beef and "extras". Extras can include, tripe, ox tail, beef tendon....and the list goes on. Its kind of a more refined, big ass bowl of Ramen. I played it safe and got the #47 which is beef strips and other parts of the cow I can safely identify. They also serve a myriad of different sandwiches which are equally good. Overall, you will be looking to spend 8-12 dollars for a good meal. One bit of warning, if you get "super sized" bowl of Pho, its truly an inappropriately large bowl. I am not sure but I don't think you are suppose to actually drink all the broth, or atleast there is no prize if you do.
