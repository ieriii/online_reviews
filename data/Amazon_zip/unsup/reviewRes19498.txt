The few times I've stopped into The Gage for a drink I've been pleasantly surprised. The green glazed subway tiles and spacious dark wood bar is a delightful place to sip a fancy beer (they have Affligem on tap) while watching tourists drool over Millennium Park. I hate to say this-- but it doesn't feel like Chicago, it feels classy and cosmopolitan, despite the TVs behind the bar.
