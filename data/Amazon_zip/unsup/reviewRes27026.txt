This is definitely a must have. Nuevo Leon is one of the best Mexican places there is. The food is very authentic. They always give you chips and salsa as well as an appetizer. I ordered the burrito this time but usually order the carne asada. I love the flour tortillas. They are not like my moms but for a restaurant they are close:)
