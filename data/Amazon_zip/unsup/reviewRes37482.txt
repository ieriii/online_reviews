Market: There are a lot of good foods here but there are perhaps equally as many gimmicks. Lots of fancy packaging everywhere, and there are definitely some good items, but I think the overall the quality does not justify the price and hype. They do have some good cheeses but their selection I think is bested by the Gold Coast Whole Foods. As far as olive oils go, my advice is to avoid that whole game. I've got a great palette, and I don't taste $40 of difference between a bottle of Colavita and the $50 Ligurian DOP. Not to mention that fact that both of these pale in comparison to a 5 euro bottle you can find in any supermarket in Italy. Pastries and baked goods here do look very good, though I've never had them. Cafe: I like this place. You pay a dollar or two more than you should per item ($7 sandwiches, etc), but it is generally quite good, they stay open late, and it's self-service so you don't have to tip.
