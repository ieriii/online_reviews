Although I no longer live in Chicago, in fact, pretty much I live in the furthest state from Hot Doug's, those dogs keep calling me back. I revisited Hot Doug's back in March of 2012, this long-overdue re-review is the result of hearing the call once again. For almost six months, my last visit quelled the beast that is "tummy de Grant". Every Hot Doug's adventure results in the same fantastic experience. Whether it is the dead of winter, sweltering heat of summer or anytime in between, the line is long. Forty five-minutes to an hour and a half, long. For most, this excruciatingly cold, hot, mild wait for "hot dogs" is unacceptable. For those who've "seen the light", this momentary sacrifice is a necessary evil that is eclipsed by good. Courtesy of Yelper Lindley E., I am reminded of the beginning of every journey. Greeted by the ever-cheerful Doug, you're on the button to order to your hearts content. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Always take time to exchange pleasantries and inquire to his general well-being, he feeds hundreds of people daily, thousands weekly. Getting to know the man behind the counter in the precious minutes afforded, is magical. You know you're loved when someone introduces you to Hot Doug's. The nostalgia, the memories, the dogs, the tots, all marinate into your memory forever. Pro tip, you can order tater tots deep fried in the sausage fryer. No need to buy fries anymore, only tots.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Snag a table, sit down with your dogs, your tots, your green rivers, and your friends. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Thanks for the memories, Doug, I hope I never get Alzheimer's so I never forget.
