Well, yeah, it's the best, but it's really in its own category - "encased meats", like they advertise. Who can compare to their selection? And it's good that they have that overwhleming advantage, because there are minuses. Far from el and inconvenient in that sense. Expensive. Shitty building/space (why did he bother to move?), just nothing else really all that good about it. However, like I said, for exotic variants on the standard, it has no competition.
