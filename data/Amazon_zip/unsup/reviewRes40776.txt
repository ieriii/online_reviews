Lobster ice cream. Yes, I said lobster ice cream. For some reason, that's the thing I ate last night that I simply cannot get over. Lobster already has that sweet richness to it, now imagine that flavor sweeter, richer, and with the cold, creaminess of ice cream. Whatever you're thinking, it's better. Trust me. This went alongside a gorgeous, creamy chilled corn and summer squash soup with fresh taragon leaves and poached lobster.  I could sit here and go on like this course by course, because every last one was gorgeous, artful, and full of incredible flavors, but there are only so many ways I can say "delicious", so I will just say this: times the aforementioned amazingness by 8, add in three amazing wines (picked out by rookie sommelier yours truly), and give the staff a fist bump for how they handled a freak accident involving broken glass (Clean it up, replace the tableware, and appease our nonexistent anger with crispy fried duck and asian cauliflower. OKAY!!!) and for their general ability to be both laid back and attentive, and you've got a night out at Bonsoiree. There might even be lobster ice cream. If you're lucky.
