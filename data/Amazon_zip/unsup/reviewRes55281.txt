ok... this place is good but when you compare it to Texas de Brazil it pales in comparison. Texas de Brazil has a bigger and better buffet (if you can believe that) Fogo de Chao does not offer sea food or soups in their buffet. Not a deal breaker but would be nice. The service was good and the servers had personality and flair. Will return but recommend trying Teaxas de Brazil.
