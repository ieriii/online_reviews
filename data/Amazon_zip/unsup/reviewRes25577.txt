Artopolis is a lovely detour from the traditional and archaic restaurants that are plastered along Halsted avenue. I met my companion here for his lunch break, it's conveniently around the corner from his workplace (bastard!). The service was more of a deli style for lunch and I felt flustered with the large array of choices, all of which i had no clue what they were, and the growing line of business men behind me. I stuttered and I stammered. I wanted to know about every sandwich they had. Finally I decided to copy and get what good ol' companion was getting, a chicken and mozzarella artopita. They plopped down this measly little pie on my tray and off we went to find a table to sit at. "What the hell did I just order? " It looked like some kind of freakish pie. I tried to reassure myself that if my companion ordered it and liked it would have to be good, right? So without another moment's hesitation I dug my fork into the light and very phyllo dough crust, my twines puncturing through the hot cheesy and chickeny mess. Into my mouth the food went and wow, what a flavorful dish. I was in hog heaven, could you please get me another serving of this little bite of heaven? Good choice companion, I'm glad I copied. But next time I will have to study up on their menu or go during a time that they have sit down service.
