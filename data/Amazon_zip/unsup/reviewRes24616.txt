All i can say is LOVE. I have been here for not only the full dinner, but also for just the cheese, and just the dessert. The ambiance is so romantic, there is live music, dim lighting and plenty of delicious food for everyone. If you get there a little earlier than your reservation, they have a bar you can sit at and order drinks. The complimentary cheese and crackers at the bar is a delicious way to start the evening, along with a glass of Geja's Cafe wine. Every single time my boyfriend and I have gone, someone we are sitting near has just gotten engaged - this place is so romantic! If you can, request a booth - they are so private and great for a date night!!! Every once in a while Groupon runs a deal with Geja's - I promise, if you buy a groupon, you will be back for more!
