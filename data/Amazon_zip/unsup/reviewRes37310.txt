I know that this is contrary to the common opinion of Hopleaf, but I think this place sucks. I'm giving it 2 stars for the amazing beer selection. I'm deducting three for the pretentious arseholes who sit at the bar drinking it. A story: My wife doesn't like hoppy beers. She really just wants something that she can sip on. She walked up to the bar and tried to order a bottle of a major label light beer and was shocked to have the bartender say, "we don't have that". That wouldn't have been bad, except for the snide tone to his voice. Add to that the fact that I actually saw a guy two seats down do a fist pump when the bartender said it. The patrons at Hopleaf can all get bent. I can almost guarantee that I've forgotten about more beers than most of you have tried. You don't impress me with your faux snobbery. It's beer for Pete's sake.
