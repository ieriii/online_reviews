Talk about a deal. They know how to really make a great steak. One of the best values for steakhouses in Chicago. The chimichurri sauces is to die for. The staff is friendly and they love making suggestions. This is by far one of my favorite places. I would rate it a five star, but the only thing holding me back is the steep corkage fee for BYOB.
