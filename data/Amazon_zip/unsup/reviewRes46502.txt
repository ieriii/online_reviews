2.5 stars. Went before hitting ZooLights and it was insanely crowded. Waited it out in the bar with the 4yo and some Goose XMAS ale. Then we were seated at this crazy table in the middle of the restaurant that was inches away from 3 other tables. It was like communal eating only worse.I got hot wings which were OK. Wife had burger that was also OK. Child had kids chicken fingers that were a basked of fries and 2 little chix fingers for like $6. All-in-all, I wouldn't ever come back here voluntarily.
