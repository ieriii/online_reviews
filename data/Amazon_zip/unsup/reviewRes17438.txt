I travel for work and am in a different city every week. I've been craving Indian food for awhile now, as I haven't had it in years, and finally decided to go get some. I was staying at the Embassy Suites in downtown Chicago and just walked around the corner to India House after reading all the excellent reviews on Yelp. And I'm so glad I did! The servers were incredible, the decor beautiful and relaxing and the food was out of this world. On top of it all, it was very reasonably priced! I would definitely recommend this to anyone staying downtown Chicago and will definitely be back again!!
