The Publican is a carnivore's delight. It offers a broad selection of unusual pork and seafood viands, and some interesting vegetable accompaniments. The beer selection is quite good, and the service is attentive. And the bathrooms are quite clever. My problem with The Publican is the acoustics of the dining area. High ceilings and a lot of exposed plaster wall space turn it into a chatter box. The din on a Saturday night was so piercing that it made dinner a less-than-enjoyable experience. I could barely hear the person across from me at our table for six. Acoustical issues are easily solved, so hopefully The Publican owners take note and make some cosmetic changes. If you don't mind the noise, I think you will enjoy dining here.
