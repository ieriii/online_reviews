Another Brazilian meatfest! I'm giving this place a solid five for the following reasons: 1. A modest and varied "salad bar" - nothing too heavy to kill your appetite for the onslaught of meats to come. 2. A very attentive wait staff - water was never empty, consistent appearance asking if everything was fine and not done annoyingly. 3. The ambiance is very open and airy - high ceiling. 4. Meats cooked well and tasty - the garlic steak was my fave of the evening. 5. Great place to have dinner with a group of friends - noise level was just right that you did not need to raise your voice; tables were far enough from each other that you did not hear the next table's conversations. 6. The rolling/traveling after dinner bar - very nice touch. I enjoyed this place a lot.
