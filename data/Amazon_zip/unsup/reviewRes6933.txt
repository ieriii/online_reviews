Holy smokes. You may end up with meat sweats later on in the evening after a night out here. Its well worth it, trust me. My lovely lady took me out for a birthday dinner and we got our fill of bbq. We couldn't really decide on one entree each so we ordered a few. -Pre-App: Bread and butter pickles + barbeque chips (nice touch) -App: House Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies -Entree: Competition St. Louis style ribs Single cut pork chop Pulled pork and pulled chicken -Sides: Poblano Cheddar Cornbread Bruleed Macaroni and Cheese Cole Slaw -Dessert: Milk & Cookies All the meats had a great smoke flavor accompanied by their four homemade barbeque sauces on the side so not cover up that flavor. The ribs were fall off the bone and I mean no-effort-involved fall off the bone melt in your mouth. The corn bread was curiously spicy, the mac n' cheese had a creamy awesomeness to it and the cole slaw was crisp and tangy. The thought of dessert made want to roll on the floor and take a nap. But I managed to get a few bites in. Warm and gooey paired with the cool milk you just can't go wrong. I really think this was a great barbeque experience for Chicago. The price points were great as well with entrees from $9 to $300 (whole pork shoulder). Best I've had thus far and I have sought out several places in the city. Give it a go you will enjoy!
