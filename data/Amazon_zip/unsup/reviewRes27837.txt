It was an eating event that will be a great memory. I am glad we went and it perfect for a special birthday dinner. Glad I went with friends that are willing to trying new things. Highly recommend this place only for the open minded foodie! I loved the ceasar. Classic flavirs done in a fun delicious way. But the foie gras pop rock lollipops..well, a little to much fun and no substance. But we ordered it ! But I found most dishes to be too salty. Too much focus on the presentation, I mean I still have to eat it. But the wait staff was amazing and helpful. Our waitress, Sarah, was sharp direct and we would of ordered the menu if we hadn't had some constraint. But not much! Graham needs to know he has a great ali in her! She believes in that menu and was fun to go on the food adventure with her. Worth going but may not ever go back. But that is only because I live in NY.
