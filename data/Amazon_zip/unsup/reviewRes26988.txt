I am not to sure what the obsession over Pequods is. Its all right. The crust is ok. The rest of the pizza is ok. The service is ok. Wait time for tables is below average. Parking is just plain awful. I want to be impressed with you Pequods, I do. You are like a really attractive person with a bad personality. I want to love you, but once you get past the face, it just goes downhill. Unfortunate!
