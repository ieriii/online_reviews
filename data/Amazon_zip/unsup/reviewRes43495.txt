What did Mommy always tell you to do when you were about to embark on a 3 mile obstacle course? "Make sure you eat breakfast so you have energy!" So, on the one day of all my twenty-five years of living I felt genuine fear, I joined my fellow Warrior Dash companions for breakfast at Milk & Honey. On the menu with what I was convinced may be my last meal (not to exaggerate but my stomach was really flip flopping too much to eat...I can never not eat!): -Compari + Grapejuice: Fantastic and so refreshing. However, it did nothing to calm my nerves. -Lox & Bagels: Awesome, and I think I clogged one my arteries by eating the entire huge side of home made cream cheese they gave me. (I know...smart, before embarking on a 3 mile run.) I ended up paying around $18ish with a 20% tip. Kind of pricey but I've been back once since and I know I'll be back again. Side note: They won't make you the Lox and Bagels 7 minutes past the time their breakfast ends. I've tried. :(
