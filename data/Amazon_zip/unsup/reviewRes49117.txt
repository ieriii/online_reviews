clean lines, textured walls, rich wood... wow, i really enjoyed the design and the function of the chairs that have a space for your menu and purse! ok, so the decor was great, on to the food. i'm not very knowledgeable in the meat/pork area, so my friend and i weren't sure how to start. the waitress was very helpful so we started with the taste of three hams and the sweet bread. it was very tasty, but once i was told the sweetbread was some type of organ, i just couldn't continue eating it (completely mental i know). the pork country ribs were amazing!! great flavor, perfectly cooked, and i loved the polenta and asparagus (i wanted to ask the waitress if i could just have a plate of that). high marks on the ramps and desserts as well, in particular the waffle, mmmmmm. last but not least, the beer. i had a couple belgian and they were so crisp and fresh, very nice. overall it was a top notch dining experience, a great place to go with a group of friends (definitely not a romantic spot, since it tends to be quite noisy).
