Not that the place needs another review, but this is my reward for taking friends/visitors to O'Hare. Head out on 94, then return on Devon, so I can go to Superdawg. More of an overall unique cultural/retro experience than a culinary one, where else can you get a meal in a cute little box as an adult? And in your vehicle? Makes me recall those summer visits as a kid to "Hamburger Heaven" up in the U.P. of Michigan with Mom, Dad, and my brother and sister. I guarantee if you bring a foreign visitor, or even just an out-of-town guest here for lunch, they will always remember it. I don't even like hot dogs that much, but the novelty watching everyone else in their cars, and of plucking what are pretty decent fries and your dog out of box, even a hot dog tastes good to me. My biggest problem (being a sauce/condiment magnet), is not wearing some of my lunch home! Prices are right: lunch for less than ten bucks, the servers are friendly and helpful, even if they do have 708 hair!* And put this one on your list as a fun summer diversion for your out-of-town friends and family. *708 hair - before there was 847, 708 was the only "suburban" area code for Chicago. 708 hair was that 80's style that stuck up funny in the front, and fell like a flat waterfall in back. My own niece was a poster child for that "do." :-)
