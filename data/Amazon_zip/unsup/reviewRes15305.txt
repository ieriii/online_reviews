I am honestly very bias here in this review. Two decades of dining experience with this restaurant allows me share such feedback without compunction. You see I have been dining at Calo since the room was filled with smoke and the booths were made of vinyl. And to say the least, I have many great memories which stem from many a great dining experience while under the ownership of who I believe to be the father of the current proprietor. After the old man stepped away and passed down the restaurant to who I believe to be his son, (or so what I believe the story to be), the restaurant was subsequently given a complete renovation. Additionally, the menu had expanded and business had increased. However, new faces entered the scene whilst old ones vanished. The new proprietor is a new-money a**hole who, from my opinion, believes that owning a restaurant is all about the "Benjamins", instead of that of fostering relationships with both the restaurant's new and old customers. I have several examples in which I can provide, but in this case I am going to skip the lengthy descriptions and simply go on to say that great food isn't always synonymous with good business practices. Calo has really lost the warmth it once possessed . Whether or not my story about the relationship between the past and present owner is accurate, it does not change the fact that the current owner does not appreciate his customers. A business like so many others that simply views each customer as a spreadsheet, as oppose to the individuals who are responsible for making Calo what it is today. It's sad. I know had the old man still been around my feelings would be totally different. After 20 years of loyalty I think I have finally came to terms with saying good bye.
