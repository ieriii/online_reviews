I used to go to Pequod's in high school, where the lunch special couldn't be beat. I'll always have some nostalgia towards it but on a recent visit, I wasn't as blown away as I remember it. I enjoy it but and it'll be up there pizza wise...maybe I'm just letting my past cloud my opinion of this place but nothing to write home about.
