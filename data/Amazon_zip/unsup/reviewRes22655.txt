Superdawg is the best hot dog place in the world. It is a scientific fact. If there was a hot dog based religion, Superdawg would be Mecca with the monolithic statues of Maurie and Flaurie guiding you there. There really is nothing better than a superdawg laying in its bed of fries and a malt. I would eat them every day if I could. Superdawg is what Chicago is all about and should not be missed by anyone, locals and tourists alike.
