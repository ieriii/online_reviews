The most expensive meal in my life...and somehow one of the best values in my life. How can that be? The drama of merely entering the restaurant is enough to take your breath away, and then the service, calm and sophisticated ambience, little gee-whiz gadgets and tricks, and the food, oh the food.... We were not able to get reservations for the tour, 25 courses or so. But our 12 course tasting was more than plenty at $125 a pop for the food, and I think that once he rotates through some new dishes I will go back for the easier on the wallet 8 course. We did the wine pairing, which they say is around 2/3 the cost of the food. My math says that $90 compared with $125 is more like 3/4ths, but who's counting at a place like this. The wines were just as memorable as the food, and I strongly recommend that you a) go for the wine pairings, or at least some of them, and b) make sure you're taking a cab afterwards. How so much flavor can be packed into single bites, and then how I can get so richly full from these single bites, will always be a mystery. I could go through the highlights, but that would require walking through all 12 dishes. Only one that I'll mention as such a surprise was the Kobe beef with teriyaki reduction, cucumber, and...melon? Who in the world says to themselves, "Hmm...what goes well with Kobe beef? Oh, I know, honeydew melon of course!" Genius. Like many foodies-in-training, I seek value. Alenia is a place that proves that ridiculously, guilt-inducing prices can sometimes still be a value when it buys 3 or 4 hours of food perfection.
