I only waited 10 minutes while sitting at the bar in front of all of the so very busy bartenders and even then had to ask the barback for a glass of wine. He might I add was so very nice and professional. Then, minutes later one of the blond bartenders hands me my glass of wine with my check out and a curt thank you. Seriously, I have been treated better at McDonalds! I really do not think I would have been the courtesy of a hello if it was not for the great bar helper whose name I did not get. I guess must be so busy that it forgets to say hello or ask if you would like something to drink.I don't feel it is that great of place to have to wait or be treated so rudely to come back. I told the manager, Nick of my experience and he listened as they all do and politely ask I come back(for what? poor service?) He then said, thank you for letting me know Hon. Really HON! I am 41 years of age, do you thing this is respectful? HON! I will never go back. River North has way better bars and lounges that do not call their fellow patrons HON!
