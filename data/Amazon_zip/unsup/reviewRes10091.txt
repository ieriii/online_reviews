Deep dish is where it's at. But no true Chicagoan is above some good ol' fashioned thin crust. Piece is a large and raging pizza spot. The get really crowded and it gets really loud. Fortunately me and about 10 friends came from a Bears game, so we were loud and obnoxious already. Fortunately, Piece provided plenty of beer to fuel our fire. As an above average beer consumer (but a low level beer nerd), I enjoyed their beer. The stout was nothing to write home about but their Top Heavy and Fornicator were both fantastic. The pizzas were good, some better than others. The show stealer? Their white pizza. Play around with the toppings, Sausage and basil worked really well for us. Piece is a fun spot to grab some good beers and enjoy good quality pizza before a night out, maybe a low-key celebration, or to catch a game (although I don't remember if they had TVs). Get dat white pizza, it's in a league of its own.
