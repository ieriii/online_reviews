I came here for a 2nd date and it was a great location. Gilt Bar has an amazing ambience with a welcoming and cozy decor. you can be seated at a table or booth. the environment was perfect for conversation and perfect for a date. the service was awesome, our server was very attentive and we got our food very quickly, and it was delicious. i ordered the bone marrow and my date ordered the Port belly. She enjoyed a few glasses of Pinot Noir and I sipped on a Maker's Mark on the rocks. great experience and would definitely go back again.
