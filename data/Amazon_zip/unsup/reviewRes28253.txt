GE delivers, best food i have ever eaten in my life besides Capital Grill Steakhouse. Great ambience, the food is out of this world; it smells, tastes and looks superb, the food is made to delight your senses, and it does, everything on the plate has a purpose and is a conversation piece. The service is outstanding. You wont find regular spirits here (no bud light) but that is part of the experience. Only downfall is food portions. Definitely a must in Chicago if you are a food/culinary junkie (and you are not frugal).
