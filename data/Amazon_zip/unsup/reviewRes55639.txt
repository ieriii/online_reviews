Great food & service. I've returned many times and brought friends. They make their own tortillas that are awesome. Some of the portions can be overwhelmingly large. Top picks for dinner: Duck, Pistachio Chicken . The specials are yummy too. I've been for dinner lunch and brunch... dinner being my preferred menu. The value food quality ratio is very high. This place is a deal for this kind of quality.
