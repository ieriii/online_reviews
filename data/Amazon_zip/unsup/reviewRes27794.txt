Graham Elliot was a great overall dining experience. I went on a Friday night, waited for a bit for my table, but was able to have a drink at the bar. The restaurant was very busy, great vibe, great bar service. Dinner was tremendous, had one of the tasting selections, every dish was prepared perfectly. Bring your appetite. Wait staff was very knowledgable about every dish, service was excellent. Dinner was a little pricey but well worth it. Excellent overall experience, can't wait to return!
