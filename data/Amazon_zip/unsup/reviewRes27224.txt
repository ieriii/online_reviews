It's difficult for me to add much beyond what people have written about Frontera so I won't go into a lot of detail. Our food was excellent! The sauces are so subtle and are truly an adventure for your palate. We had 5:30 reservations and were seated immediately. It was a special birthday celebration and the celebrant chose FG. She was not disappointed and neither were the other diners. Service was efficient yet friendly. The reason they "only" get 4 stars is for the drinks. The Topolo Marguerita is delicious but a small glass for $10. I started with the Raspberry Diablo and it was just OK at $13. I think the drinks are a little steep but this is a minor complaint. This place really is neat for a special occasion.
