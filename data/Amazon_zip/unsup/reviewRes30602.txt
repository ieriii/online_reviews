I'm not a vegetarian, but love trying vegetarian dishes. This place serve some pretty amazing dishes. I don't know how they do it, but their meat-like substances taste just like meat!  Their peanut butter milk shake is to die for! OMG, I didn't have room for another bite after brunch, but somehow found room for their milk shake. If you don't have room, just order one to go and save it for later. A word of warning about the biscuit and gravy - it's a bit dry! I think this problem might be rectifiable with a bit more gravy. I'd definitely still order it again :)
