What can you say about the best hot dog stand in Chicago other than go try it for yourself. I went there today and got a Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Black Truffle Butter, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris and their duck fat fries. It was as good as it can possibly get. The atmosphere is a fun retro style hot dog joint with the music to back it. You will be able to tell you are getting close to the restaurant by the line around the block which is 1 of my 2 complaints is the wait is long for a fast food restaurant but the food more than makes up for it. My second complaint is that they should warn you that the food is so good that you will want more that 1 dog or sausage. If you are craving the duck fat fries make sure you go on a Friday or Saturday as that is the only 2 days they sell them.
