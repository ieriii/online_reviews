Yes yes, very much "Cheesecake Factory-like" but the food is a couple steps up. I dine at Cheesecake Factory frequently so I can say this. The ingredients, flavors and dishes are higher quality.  Everything else is very similar to Cheesecake Factory though, like: large menu, huge desert and cheesecake selection, huge restaurant that's always packed at all times of day, and the way they handle seating is similar. Our food was delicious, from the pastas to vegetables and our waitress was really friendly. It was a little hard to track her down when we needed her though. Sometimes she would disappear for long periods of time.
