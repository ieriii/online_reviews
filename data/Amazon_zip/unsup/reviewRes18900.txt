Bad Apple is quickly becoming my favorite neighborhood spot. Walking distance, great burgers, great cocktails, patio, cool art, good service, and AFFORDABLE!!! Martinis and cocktails (good ones) under $10. Same with the burgers. The use fresh ingredients and the last time I was there, our server informed us that they now make their own ketchup because they are ridding themselves of anything remotely close to high fructose corn syrup. Food is fast. Poutine is awesome. What else can I say? This. Try the cucumbersome cocktail. Cucumber infused vodka, ginger and lemongrass. Perfect ratios. Delicious. That is all.
