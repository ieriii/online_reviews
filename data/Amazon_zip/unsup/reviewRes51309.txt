I'm really trying to figure out the hype with this place. After 36 hours of running a relay from Madison to Chicago, traveling in a van with six other sweaty runners, and only eating popcorn, peanuts, and granola bars, I really wanted some nice, warm, flavorful food. Garcia's was chosen and I was marginally disappointed. First, the margaritas are excellent, which alone are worthy for a return trip. The chips and salsa were good. The salsa a little too spicy for my liking, but not too spicy that I didn't indulge a little.  I did enjoy the guacamole and I would order it again.  I found my entree to be mediocre at best. I ordered the tostada dinner. One tostada with al pastor, the other with steak. The al pastor didn't have much flavor, at all. I ate with gusto only because, as stated earlier, this was the only real food I consumed in several days. The rice was fluffy and not dried or hardened. The refried beans, were refried beans. I didn't eat my steak tostada until the next day. It was good enough for me. Next time, I know to order just the steak and not the al pastor.  The service was slow. It took forever to get refills for chips and salsa, along with our check. I've had better, and I've had worse Mexican food. Garcia's won't be the first or even second on my list, but I also won't put up a stink when it becomes an option.
