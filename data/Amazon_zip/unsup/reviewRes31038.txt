The food was excellent and the service was very friendly. I got the biscuits and gravy with the vegetable hash and paid what seemed appropriate for an organic vegan meal in this part of town. Was it pricey? Somewhat. Did I know that going in? Yes, so it wasn't a big issue for me - I just won't eat here every day. But that would be a delicious thing to do. Some people have mentioned small portion size - I was very full after my meal but could see someone with a larger appetite leaving disappointed.
