I think the fact that I've been looking forward to going here for nearly a year may have been my down fall. And although I'm only giving it three stars this time, I would definitely give it another whirl. I'm thinking I might just have gotten unlucky with what I ordered. The antipasto platter was, in fact, very good, as were the calamari. Of course, both of those are kind of hard to screw up, but still they were both excellent. The calamari was especially tender and lightly breaded. I had the wild boar ragu pasta dish as my main course, and it was just OK. None of the flavors stood out, and I've definitely had much better ragu sauces. My boyfriend's short rib dish was tasty, but not a stand-out. Desert was also good, although evidently not very impact-full because I can't recall what it was. I'll go back in the summer to experience their beautiful patio and try some different dishes. Stay tuned for an update!
