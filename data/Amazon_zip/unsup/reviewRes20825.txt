The best I can say is that Coast is not completely terrible. Let me mention the positives first. Service was fine. The place is BYOB. Location is excellent - about four blocks north of Damen and North. It looks like a place where a good vibe is possible. However, if you are like me and value a sushi bar as a place to get some awesome raw seafood... I won't name names, but you can do a lot better. At Coast, raw fish was rather sub-par.
