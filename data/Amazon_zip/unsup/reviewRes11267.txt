First visit was breakfast this past week, and I loved it. The ambience, the food, everything. My husband had these incredible cranberry pancakes which I kept sharing and I was sorry I did not forget about the calories & go for something more fun than eggs & toast. We would definitely go there again, especially for weekend brunch.
