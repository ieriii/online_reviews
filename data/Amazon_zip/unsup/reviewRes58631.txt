Crappy week for dining out I guess, first the nightmare that is Kuma's then a misguided second (and for the record LAST) date that brought me here.I have reservations at a REAL romantic place That should have been the clue right there - as a general question, if THE selling point of a restaurant is that it is romantic, should one really actually EAT there, or rather should one endeavour to RUCK in a nice romantic motel perhaps and possibly EAT at a restaurant that is known for its FOOD.Let me count the ways here: Sectioned off into little weird subrooms with 1960s decor & art, dimly lit with a real low ceiling. Honestly, the dining room looked like the killer's house from Silence of the Lambs, only minus the big moth.Then I had to boil my own food in gross brownish oil that seemed (smelled like) it had been used since the 70s, then I got to dip the greasy yet unseasoned whateveritwas into any of about 15 random sauces that the waiter didn't even pretend didn't come out of a giant generic 30 gallon bucket somewhere back in the bowels of the kitchen. Another general question might be, if I am cooking my own damn food, what the hell do they need a kitchen for, and if they don't need a kitchen in a restaurant, WHY AM I EATING HERE?!?So now I have escaped the dungeon, reaching & gasping for fresh air outside, far from the little blue chemical jelly-in-a-can that they use to boil the grease that permeates all of my clothes, and I see the menu hanging outside that tells me that my date (inside paying the bill) is coughing up about $120 for the food + 60 bucks for wine + 30 bucks tip meaning our little misadventure here cost over $200 for THE TWO OF US!!!! Holy FHIT is all I can really say. Random coolness: A couple waiting for a cab sees my look of incredulity as I read the menu, takes one whiff of my clothes & points up the stairs to a little cafe with no sign. Trust me, you should try that next time - best pasta in Chicago, romantic & you don't smell like a french fry she says knowingly. Random CRAZY weirdness that left me mumbling to myself in a hot shower scrubbing my skin raw until all traces of the evening faded slowly away: as I was leaving, my cab looped through the alley behind the restaurant & I saw a dude come out of a freaking PORT O POTTY BEHIND THE RESTAURANT, take a dirty white kitchen apron OFF THE DUMPSTER next to the port o potty & stroll toward the building. Is that even legal?? HOW DOES A KITCHEN EMPLOYEE WASH THEIR HANDS IN A PORT O POTTY?!?!
