Hurray for Hot Doug's! I love that you can buy so many different types of hot dogs and sausages, and they have such great weekly specials! I finally got a chance to get over there and ordered a Wild Rice Chicken Sausage with yellow pepper sauce and some sort of cheese (I forgot which kind, but it was FANCY!). DELICIOUS! And there was a bit of a wait, but the line wasn't as long as I expected it to be when we go there. I think if you go earlier in the day on a weekend you'll get in pretty quickly. My only complaint is that it is so small inside so it's better to just get your dogs to go. But that's part of the charm of it being a little hole in the wall place, I guess! The guy behind the counter is so friendly and really seems to enjoy his job. He chatted with the people in front of us about some of the different choices, and I thought it was great that he didn't try to rush them along. I just don't get those places where it's their "thing" to be ultra-rude to you. Give me Hot Doug's anyday!
