Tried Piece out on a whim.was not let down at all.went on a tuesday with my drinkin partner Sam after work.drove from whiting,in hoping that it would be worth it.and it was!!!we ordered a large spinach,cicken,and garlic white.thin crust was perfect.the only beer they didnt have was the moose knuckle but when youve had 7 who needs 8 right?!!!!anyways we stayed from 4ish to well after 7 shootin the breeze and drinkin beer eating some great pizza.sad that we have to travel so far to enjoy a place like this and for that wicker park i envy you!!!
