I needed a slice of pizza and this place had a rather ostentatious store-front (and let's pretend that the name "The Art of Pizza" doesn't sound like a direct-to-video action-comedy) so I went inside. I got two slices of thin-crust pepperoni because I like actual pizza, a category that doesn't include Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza. Chicago style deep dish pizza is great if you hate pizza, but you still want a pizza-flavored cake to sit at the bottom of your stomach like a brick. If they marketed it as Chicago Style Shitty Lasagna, I'd have no problems with it. The pizza was fine. My slices had probably been sitting there for a while, because the cheese was pretty thick and hardened (not disgustingly so, but there certainly wasn't that cheese-pull-effect that you get on fresh slices). The 3.75 per slice price is reasonable, but I imagine that it's a better deal if you pick up a deep-dish slice with piles of toppings. A slice like that could feed a family, probably, with enough crust left over to feed a family of pigeons. Which sounds like the premise of a Pixar short. Actually, now that I think about it, the name "The Art of Pizza" sounds less like a DTV action-comedy and more like a Pixar short. The pepperoni's were a little spicy for my taste, but when it comes to spiciness, my taste cannot be trusted at all. I'm Irish. 400 years of eating potatoes have devolved our taste buds in to sensitive little flowers. Pretty much all that doesn't burn them is whiskey and ice.
