On a sunday night, when most restaurants in Chicago are shut down, Purple Pig is bumping with a wait and full blown service at 11pm. And rightfully so, the food is excellent. Really valuable prices, really great flavours, simple and rich dishes. The menu is tapas style and the plates are not small at all. However, i would recommend carefully picking out your dishes. Many of the plates are extremely rich so you have to plan your dinner items instead of just choosing everything you think sounds amazing.
