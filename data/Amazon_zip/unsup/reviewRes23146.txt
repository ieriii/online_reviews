This place lives up to the hype. Two of my friends and I came here for some veggie burrito action. We were not disappointed. We also split three empanadas - one black bean, one spinach and cheese, and the last sweet plantains - and they were each very flavorful. I think the spinach and cheese really surprised me, and the sweet plantain empanada was almost like a dessert empanada. The veggie burrito is huge - I think it was the size of the plate it came on. Packed with rice, lettuce, black beans, avocado, tomato, onions, cheese, and hot peppers, it's a lot of food compared to the price ($4.95 I believe?). Also, the beans here taste so good. I don't know what they do to the beans, but the beans just melt in your mouth. Of course, we got oatmeal shakes to top it all off. We were drinking beers (this place is BYOB) on top of the shakes so we all left the restaurant in a major food coma. I think we'd all do it again anyway. It just feels so good when you know that the food you are getting is fresh and top quality. It also helped that we went during a crazy 10 minute monsoon/hail period, so everyone was in fun spirits. Our server was a great guy. I really enjoyed the atmosphere here, and the food was excellent. I can't believe it took so long for me to get here, but now that I've been here I never want to go anywhere else.
