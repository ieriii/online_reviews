Starting with the free valet parking outside, to the amazing gourmet market at the front, on to the great cafe in the back and the wonderful wine room in between, Fox & Obel is a winner. Their fresh baked goods and their cheese departments are exceptional as well. What separates Fox & Obel from its competition is the extraordinarily competent and friendly staff. Every person, from the butcher to the cheese-guy to the in-store sommelier (see Mark in the wine department, he's the best) presents themselves as someone that really, truly understands what they're selling and they do it without pretense or attitude. They seem to really care about what they do and it shows in the quality of the food(s) they both prepare and sell. This is not a daily shopping place so when I need paper towels and a frozen pizza I still go to my neighborhood grocery store. However, when ingredients matter Fox & Obel is the best choice in the city.
