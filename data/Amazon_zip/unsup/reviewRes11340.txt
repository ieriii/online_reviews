I've got to say, the raspberry oreo flapjacks are A-MAZING. You can order the full dish (which comes with three pancakes), or you can just order one pancake for cheaper. Finishing a full plate is difficult if not impossible, but leftovers are just fine :) I also tried the chocolate french toast, which was also very tasty.  I went with two other people Saturday morning at 10am. My friend got there before me around 9:50 and put her name down, and they were able to seat us by 10:05. I was amazed because I was expecting a ridiculous wait after reading all the reviews. Anyway, it's a little loud inside, but the service is good, and the food even better! Also, the district is really cute, so if there's a long wait, you can bum around the nearby shops (Crossroads, Buffalo Exchange, etc.).
