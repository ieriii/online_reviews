5-star dinner every time. We have been visiting this restaurant for the past 10 years, and I contend that there are only 2 places in the world I will eat Italian food- #1 my moms, #2 Anthony's Sapori. It never disappoints. We ordered a meal for catering for a familiy party, it was ready on time, the portions were generous and every single person at the party commented on the quality and taste of the food. Great Great Great!
