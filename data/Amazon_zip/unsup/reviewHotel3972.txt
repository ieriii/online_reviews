This is my first review in Yelp, I am usually to lazy to review but i thought it is worth it to warn others agaisnt this hotel. I was looking for good deals online for a 1 week vacation in chicago downtown, i found congress hotel for $90/night, i thought it was great deal for the location and the hotel with the big name... i have walked by congress hotel many times in the passed and i was always impressed by the historical look of the building. i didnt think that anything would be wrong with this hotel so i didnt even bother to read review. some of my issues with the hotel: rude valet personal damaged walls, paint and doors The room smells like mold TV reception was horrible A/C unit is inside the room and was dripping all night the walls between the rooms are soo thin that i heard my neighbor talking on the phone like he was in front of me till i fall asleep. and i heard his TV like it was in my room, it wasnt bc he was too long but bc of extremly thin walls. if you know Motel 6, i would rate it 5 stars and still give 1 star to congress hotel. i booked my 7 nights stay at this hotel thru hotwire so there was no way for me to not get charged if i decided to check out early, but i still checked out the very next day... i lost $600 but at least i enjoyed the rest of my vacation in different hotel. I highly discourage anyone from booking this hotel without visiting it in person first and see the rooms... Dont do it even if you are ok with staying at Motels. i would recommend paying more and stayin somewhere else or stay by the airport and take the blue line if you didnt have another choice in downtown.
