ABOLUTELY OVERRATED. I mean come on....this place is no Chicago Icon. I spent nearly 12$ on 2 people. Lets look at some things that show you how much better other places are1. Superdawg DOES NOT USE VIENNA BEEF, for 90% of people that is a  dealbreaker right there.2. They have ketchup there. need i say more?3. meals for 2 people were almost 13$ Gene & Judes it is closer to 6$This place takes significantly longer to get your food than most places and the cashier lady seemed to hate her job very much. They are scamming you and making you pay for their useless drive in service. Stick to Gene and Judes this place is a joke.
