I got roped into trying this place on a Friday night, and I'm glad that I went along with the group on this foray. I was told that Wilde served gluten-free hamburgers, and hence I was sold. The restaurant itself was gorgeous. It was cozy, at a comfortable noise level, and had great seating options. The five of us loved our nook. We didn't order anything alcoholic, but we thoroughly investigated their other offerings. Three of us had burgers, and the other two ordered some sweet-potato fries to munch on. I was told that the fries were good, and I can personally confirm that the burgers were damn good. They were nothing fancy, but just simple and well-prepared. The gluten-free bun was a great touch. If I'm in the area and hungry, there's a very good chance I'll be stopping by again.
