The restaurant itself was elegantly appointed with mosaics and objet d'art from Persia, but too many tables were crammed into a small space and I felt like I had to hunch over my food and hug the table. Still it was nice to be able to sit and eavesdrop on the Arabic-speaking families at other tables. The waitress kept the hot tea coming and checked on us frequently despite it being a busy night. The food was above average. The meats (we tried chicken skewers, lamb koubedah and boneless lamb shank) were a little dry, and lacked spices. I was expecting succulent and got somewhat chewy. The dill rice was nice, but the broiled tomato was a tasteless pile. The pomegranate mushroom appetizer was very tangy, but lacked a grounding savory taste to keep it from being acidic. The sauce from the appetizer made a good dip for the dry kebab meat however, and complemented the dill rice's mellow savory flavor. Everything was adequate, but sadly, forgettable. I'm going to give it a second try sometime soon.
