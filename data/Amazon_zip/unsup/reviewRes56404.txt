Simply It is simply my favorite restaurant in Chicago. After living in Seattle for a couple of years, I became addicted to pho ga, and haven't been able to find a consistently excellent bowl since I left -- even while I was living in NYC! Now, at long last, I have found that bowl, and let me tell you, it couldn't be more deeply appreciated. Nothing cheers you up, warms you up, and sooths the soul like a bowl of that pho ga. It also helps that the entire staff is delightfully friendly and welcoming, and that they will deliver pretty much anywhere in Chicago. My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week and have become regulars. We've tried several things on the menu by now -- the fresh shrimp spring rolls, the clay pot chicken, the spicy chicken salad, etc ... all delicious. I really encourage you to go in or order delivery. These are good people with a great business and they deserve to thrive.
