We chose to do our annual Christmas Dinner between 2 families here because of the excellent food flavors and service. This time, we added way more! Because we are Filipinos, we came back for the Crispy Pata, Loompya eggrolls, and Pancit Canton and boy we savored these! Also, the General Manager had us try the Adobo Pork Belly and Garlic Rice and these turned out to be the majority's favorites! We also had the Longevity Noodles the Chilean Sea Bass, Shaking Beef, Pan Roasted Duck Breast, Indo Corn Fritters, Duck Bao Buns and the Lemongrass Beef ! Loved them all with their distict flavors. To end the dinner, we had the mochi and Sans Rival (a Filipino pastry). These too were fabulous! To top this memorable and delicious dinner was our picture together with Billy Dec! It was an awesome night and we are definitely thrilled to come back.
