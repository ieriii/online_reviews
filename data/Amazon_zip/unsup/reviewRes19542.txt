DAMN BOY! I love me 'dem fried chicken livers! Shoot 'dem thangs down me throat like dat der goldfish swallowin' contest at the Fayette County Fair back in '92! Hee Haw!!! ok back to reality for a moment. no, i didn't try the chicken livers. but seeing them on the menu provided divine inspiration. for some reason i just imagined someone getting a plate of little slimy things and swallowing them whole. probably not the case at all. i'm sure they're wonderful. as for me. i had the $10 regular burger, 'cause I'm po' that way. and it was a mighty fine burger. added a draft beer, some fries, and yes, ok, my cosmo side dictated that i have spaghetti squash and goat cheese as another side. but F me it was good. dug the decor. dark wood. light table clothes. sorta timeless. hostesses, servers and bartenders seemed like a nice bunch of people. they showered this humble pittsburgher with love. and damn, that's all i can really ask for.
