Like the many many others, I have a crush on this place. I've been about 3-4 times and we always get there early so we can find a seat and get comfortable. It gets pretty busy, but always has great energy. Just a bunch of unpretentious people who like good food and drinks and like to hear themselves talk. I am not a big beer drinker, but this place has turned me. I try something new every time and have yet to be disappointed. The list is so extensive I could go on like that indefinitely (though I will be shying away from the odd $45 bottle). The food is amazing. It is almost more gourmet restaurant than bar. The curry mussels are so incredible, I spoon the juice. The frites are the best fries I have every had. They have a fresh potato-y sweetness and are lightly fried. They are even good cold. The aioli is so good, I have to push it away and ask for ketchup for fear of inducing heart attack. I have also had the duck Reuben and the Ham sandwiches...both are really really good. The portions are generous and the prices are fair. Just a great place to spend a night drinking and eating with friends.
