I had the red eggs...2 scrambled eggs on tortillas with cheese and salsa. It was delicious! They give a ton of food and I was stuffed afterwards. I was in a bit of a hurry that day and so the experience was rushed. I will go back when I am in town again and will take my time to really enjoy the experience.Bathroom report- ehhhhh...not a fan.
