You know in the Girl Next Door when Emile Hirsch asks if the juice is worth the squeeze? Well it doesn't matter if you saw that movie or not, what matters is that if you have to wait for a brunch table at Bongo Room for more than 15 minutes, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. The sweet dishes are good, but a little too much like having candy for breakfast. The savory dishes are also pretty good, but nothing amazing. I'd rather come here for plain lunch instead of wait 40 minutes for plain brunch. Just sayin...
