i'm giving best western river north four stars. not because it's the best hotel on the planet, but because it is the best value. two words: free parking! which is extremely important in chicago if you've brought a car. it is not fancy or exciting at all.  it won't wow you. but it is down to earth, in a central location for tourist activities, did i mention free parking? the prices are unbeatable... roughly a hundred bucks any night. it's the place you want to stay if you aren't going to be in your hotel very much and don't want to spend much.  also, no creepies here [at least not that i'm aware of!] meaning no creepies lurking in the elevator and no creepy bugs. it's definitely old, but it's a nice bang for your buck if you're not looking for anything special. i'll be staying there again next time i visit the city.
