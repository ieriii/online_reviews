The food here is great and I was happy to get in with only a 5 minute wait on a Sunday night. However I was most disappointed to be told that they were 'out of specials' and my server had no idea why I was even given the menu of specials :( Other than that hiccup, I got more than enough tasty food and they were super attentive with the basics like refilling coffee and water which was much appreciated :) And who doesn't love seeing flaming cheese around the restaurant with shouts of ooooopah?!? I give 4 stars for pleasant staff & service, tasty food and never feeling rushed.
