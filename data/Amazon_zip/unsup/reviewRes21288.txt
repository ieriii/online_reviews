Over-rated - Pretty much theres nothing special about this place except that its a drive in, has hot dog people on the roof, and high prices. Trust me, if there was a hot dog taste test, you would not be able to tell the difference. The fries were greasy and overcooked. 2 superdawg specials, plus a large drink - 13.50... are u serious? But i went for the experience, which there was none, except the cashier giving me attitude.
