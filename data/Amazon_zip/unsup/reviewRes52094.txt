Gino's East used to be dark and dingy. The perfect dive. Through a 21st century update, it now has evolved into a more modern pizza parlor or at least restaurant. I was there for my cousin's pre-nuptial/rehearsal dinner. With time about 30 minutes to an hour before the start of dinner, my wife and I sat at the bar downstairs and had a drink. The bar was very nice with a good selection of non so standard beers. You can order food at the bar if you choose. The wait early on a Friday night was insane. The only let us in because we were attending the dinner. When I say line, there was literally a line outside.  The third floor party room (there is an elevator for those that prefer not having to walk up two flights of stairs) was a bit cramped. We were served the standard salad before dinner. The salad was excellent. The Pizza, was disappointing. The crust was soggy and the sauce fairly average. My brother-in-law is kosher and they ran out of the veggie and cheese pizza. He can't have pepperoni, sausage or anything with meat on it.  I would probably go back if I was on the gold coast. Next time I hope to have a better overall experience.
