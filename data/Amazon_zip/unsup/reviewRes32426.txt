When my friend wanted to go to Demera I was proceeding cautiously. My previous experiences with ethiopian food were pretty unsatisfying. Demera has certainly changed that. From the food to the atmosphere to the staff this place is outstanding! As a vegetarian Demera is paradise. My carnivore friends found it to be Eden as well, I believe. (We were 5 for dinner.) We had a communal platter for dinner with the vegetarian options kept well away from the meat options. The injera (spongey bread) came in a generous portion and they even have gluten-free injera which tastes exactly the same much to the pleasure of my GF friend. If you are GF, phone ahead and they will have more options for you, the manager and waitress both informed us. The staff was so wonderfully considerate of me as a vegetarian and my friend who is gluten intolerant. This place is really popular so be sure to make a reservation. We actually got turned away a few weeks ago, when a groupon came out, after waiting over an hour. The manager really made it up to us though on this visit with two complimentary bottles of wine.
