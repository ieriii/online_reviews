So if you like Korean food, I think this is the best Korean restaurant in the city (in the humble opinion of this non-Korean, though I've talked to Koreans who agree with me). Excellent BBQ, perfectly seasoned. I almost always get the Bulgoki and Dakkalbi (not sure I spelled those right, but oh well), which are invariably delicious. I also usually get one of the soups, which are spicy and perfect for cold days in the middle of the winter, or the Chopchae (again, not sure about the spelling), both of which I highly recommend. The service is spotty; I've actually had really great service before, but most of the time, the service is what I'd describe as ruthlessly efficient. But when the food's this good, it's a minor complaint. Also, it's open till 5 am, so if you ever get a craving for grilled meat (and an OB--next time you go, give it a try. not the best beer I've ever had, but it really completes the San Soo experience) after a late night out, think San Soo Gab San.
