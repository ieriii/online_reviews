Ah spring!! Perfect time for snow. Watching the tournament tonight I really felt like a burger. My roommate had been here earlier in the week and said that the food was really good. I didn't want to eat at any particular place but rather preferred a take-out format. Fifty/50 is right around the corner from my place so I decided to give it a try. Walking in this place definitely has a sports bar feel but different. I have been to Boundary two VERY unsuccessful times and have yet to try their food. This place felt more inviting. Yes, there are TVs everywhere. Yes, people were excitedly rooting for their team. But this restaurant/bar definitely is setting the bar in Wicker Park. I grabbed a seat at the bar, was greeted right away, and had my drink in about two minutes. I ordered a burger from a pretty impressive menu and couldn't take my eyes off the high end bourbon on the back of the bar. I believe eventually, if not already, this place is looking to become a bar destination. Fifty/50 gives off a classy vibe and I can understand why they would offer bottle service.  My food came out in about 15 minutes. I had ordered medium-rare. I have not had a burger this good in a while. The fries were excellent. Even the pickle tasted fresh. I will absolutely return here to eat and imbibe. I'm glad Wicker Park has a place like this now.
