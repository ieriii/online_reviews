Authentic, cheap Mexican in a fun, colorful, usually loud atmosphere. One of my favorite places to enjoy Mexican! Huge serving sizes too, so we always have at least one box to bring home to enjoy later. And its BYOB! Can't complain. One time we were there, they turned off ALL the lights in order to sing Happy Birthday to someone. Others might have been annoyed because you literally couldn't see anything, let alone your food, but it was funny and we laughed and sang along. Someone spilled and broke a beer bottle all over the place in the darkness but servers were super quick to clean it all up. Such a carefree, fun atmosphere with delicious food. Love it!
