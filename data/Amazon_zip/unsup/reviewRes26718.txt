this really is not traditional vietnamese cuisine, so when you enter, keep that in mind. just as so much chinese food is usually americanized chinese food, this vietnamese food is similar and very americanized. sure there are dishes inspired by traditional vietnamese with flavors and ingredients a vietnamese person is familiar with they use bizzare ingredients in familiar dishes like banh xeo. because it is foreign to most people, they can probably get away with it because most americans won't know the difference, but to market yourself as vietnamese, a true vietnamese person would be dissappointed. better to call it fusion food i think.
