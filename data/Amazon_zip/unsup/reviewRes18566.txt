DELICIOUS! I rarely go out for Italian because both of my parents are amazing cooks and they both love to cook Italian food. So, i kind of got my fill growing up. But, I never pass up the chance to go out with the girls for a BYOB dinner. Our meals were delicious! The portions are on the large side, so be sure to get a doggy bag (and remember to take it home.) Try the daily special, I don't think you can go wrong.
