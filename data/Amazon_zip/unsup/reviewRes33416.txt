Love this place and it is one of my Chicago favorites! Went here last weekend when my sisters were in town visiting and everyone loved their food. My sister said that it was one of the best meals that she has ever had and when it came time to go out to dinner the following night she said wherever we go she knows she is going to be disappointed and sure enough she loved her dinner at Mia's so much more. It seems to be much less crowded that it was in years past, not sure why that is but I really enjoyed that I was able to get a last minute reservation.
