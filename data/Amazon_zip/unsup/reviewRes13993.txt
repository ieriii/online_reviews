I've been looking for a good, truly Cuban, Cuban place in Chicago for about 10 years. The closest I've come is either Caribbean or Cuban-Mexican - which are nice options, but definitely NOT Cuban. FINALLY, this place opened and happens to be a block from my apartment. I tried what I try first at every Cuban restaurant, the Cubano. It was perfect. There is a great ratio of ham-pork-pickle-mustard-cheese that is often messed up in many places trying to serve a Cuban sandwich. I felt like I was back in Miami. I also had the Yuca con Mojo which is garlic-ey and great and my wife had the Veggie dinner. She is a pretty hard critic but was extremely pleased with the veggies, rice and black beans. She doesn't like bananas so I ate her plantains. They were sweet and delicious. Soft with a bit of crispiness from the caramelizing sugars. It's a really cute place and the owner is very friendly. You can tell he is trying to keep it really authentic. Small and cozy bar stools provide seating inside with plenty of seating outside for nice nights. It feels like a neighborhood Cuban place right out of Miami. I almost expected to see a game of dominoes going - perhaps next time. This is definitely a regular spot now and as the owner says to everyone who comes to the place, "See you tomorrow."
