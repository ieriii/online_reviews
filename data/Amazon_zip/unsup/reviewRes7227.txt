I've been living in Chicago for 6 years and Sapori is the one restaurant I keep returning to. It is the most authentic Italian food I've had in Chicago, and by that I mean - the pasta is house made. And delicious. The rigatoni with fresh mozzarella is amazing. So is the avocado appetizer. The wine selection is varied. I've never had dessert as I am always much too full to keep eating. The atmosphere here is intimate, although the restaurant is surprisingly large when you consider the back room. I do recommend a reservation though - this place is always full! I cannot recommend Sapori more highly. If you're looking for good Italian food, this is your place!
