All I can add is that Doug actually talked me out of buying a Large Coke, told me to "buy the small, you get free refills". He probably said this so we don't linger, but I'm still impressed. Got there on Sat. (1/30/10) morning at 10am, were third in line.  I ordered the Foie Gras duck sausage and duck fat fries and a thuringer. Have to admit being let down a little on the fries. Perhaps too much hype anticipation. Funny thing is, the fries were actually better a few hours later. Not sure why. Anyways, I would of been just fine with the foie gras dog, fries and Mr. Pibb. I bought the other one just 'cause I was there. Next time, just one. Good stuff. Thanks Doug.
