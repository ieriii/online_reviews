My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday and it did not disappoint. In fact, since moving to Chicago, we've never had a better food experience: from taste, friendliness, and overall atmosphere, this place has it!  The food is of course center stage and the flavors were sharp, fresh, and well layered. We had the messob which is a communal dish with a bunch of selections that you can pick from the menu. I can't even remember which ones, but ALL were terrific. We were constantly oooing and ahhing, and laughing like kids at how delicious everything tasted. Even before dinner was complete, we had already planned to come again. One caveat though- since the food was so good, it was difficult to stop eating. We left with heavy tummies, but smiles on our faces. As far as the staff is concerned, they were professional and friendly. I always rate how good service is on how many times I have to ask for water to be refilled. The more times asking, the less attentive the service seems to be. However, at Demera, I never had to ask. Glasses were always full, dishes cleared and delivered right on time.  I'd recommend going on either a Friday or Saturday depending on how spicy food treats you. (You might need a day to recover from all the goodness and fullness before heading back to work.) And of course, coming with an empty stomach with a group of people or as a couple so as to share the food is ideal to sample as many dishes as possible. The place gets busy, so reservations are recommended.  In any event, this is a new favorite spot, if not the reigning favorite at the moment. You'll see me in here again ASAP.
