I signed up for Yelp just to leave this place a good review. I knew it would be a wait and was prepared; although, I was hungry and tempted to go. For a Fri night around 8 it was a 45 minute wait. There was a little mix up with the tables, but the hostess was extremely nice about it and the owner came out and opened a bottle of champagne for us. We were re-seated not more than five minutes later and still were seated before our estimated time.The service was prompt. The waiter took his time to explain dishes and answer questions. He was both knowledgeable, honest, and patient. I appreciated the fact that the owner seemed so involved. He was out talking to the guest waiting, seated, and continually checking in on the kitchen. He made personal recommendations for dishes and had the hostess bring out bread to the people waiting.We ordered the Caprese con bufala, and while it wasn't in the sliced style I prefer and am accustomed to, the mozzarella was probably the best I've had. The cheese tasted so fresh, but I still would prefer to have the sliced roma tomatoes on the side rather than topped with the cherry.Each dish came really fast despite how busy they were. The pizzas were a delight. I ordered the Funghi e. Salsiccia and my friend ordered the Margherita. They seemed to melt in your mouth the crust was perfectly charred in the oven. Throughout our meal the staff was friendly and accommodating. The only thing Ieft to be desired is a wider selection of wine-by-the-glass.
