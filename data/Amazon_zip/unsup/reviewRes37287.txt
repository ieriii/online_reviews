After a Saturday morning at work, I stopped by Fox and Obel's cafe for lunch. I ordered the Fox and Obel Club Sandwich to go and was confused when the cashier didn't punch in my order, instead giving me a sideways glance. After a brief but sufficiently awkward pause, she informed me that it was, in fact, the Fox and oBEL Club Sandwich, and that would be $10.83. Slightly amused and slightly perturbed, I joined a group of friends for lunch on the beach. As soon as I tasted the sandwich, however, I forgave the woman and all that she represents. Since I'm lucky enough to live a block away from F&O, I stop in at least once a week for a little culinary treat for myself, to study in the cafe with a (bottomless) cup of coffee, or just to browse the aisles. Both the store and the cafe are chock-full of delicious treats. The breads and pastries from the bakery are consistently fresh and excellent; I have never had a problem with stale food, unlike another reviewer. The fruits, while expensive, are sublime. The thing that consistently amazes me with this place is the service. Members of the staff are all experts in their own areas, whether it be meats, cheeses, or wines, and go out of their way to satisfy each and every customer who enters the store. One shining example of this can be seen in my interaction with a kind member of the wine section. After just a few brief conversations about my still-developing palate over a few weeks, he was able to pinpoint several exceptional wines from all over the world. Every suggestion of his that I have taken has turned out to be wonderful, be it a $12 Australian sauvignon blanc or a $75 Chateauneuf du Pape.
