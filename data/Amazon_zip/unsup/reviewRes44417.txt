As far as sushi goes, lakeview does it better than anywhere in the city. As far as lakeview goes, Wakamono does it better than anyone else. This place is always busy - which is a perfect sign for sushi (keeps the fish fresh garunteed). Ping Pong is across the street and gets a lot of buzz around the community, but it really doesn't compare both in atmosphere or food. Wakamono has this "peter parker" roll that will blow you away and is a must order everytime. They also take carry out orders which is a great secret if you're looking to eat in but want some real food that isn't burger/fries. Just google Wakamono to get their website. The also have a small bar which is perfect for the 10-15 min wait you sometimes have to endure.
