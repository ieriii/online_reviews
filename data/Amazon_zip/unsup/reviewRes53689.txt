I tried Crisp after reading all the great reviews it recieved. I ordered the Chicken wings in Seoul Sassy, plain and spicy I also ordered the buddah bowl. I didn't like the buddah bowl at all. I thought the chicken was well seasoned and had great flavor, but that it was to dry. I have tried the place twice and both times the chicken was dry, so this is not a place I will go out of my way to go back to. I will say the guy behind the counter was fabulous....very friendly
