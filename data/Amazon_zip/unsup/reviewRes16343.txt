I had dinner here tonight and when I opened the menu, I thought "Good grief. This menu is the size of a novel." It was almost overwhelming. So I asked my waiter what three dishes he liked. Fortunately, he mentioned a lamb dish (lamb boti kabob masala). It doesn't come with rice, so he suggested a half order (since I was eating alone) and the garlic naan.  The lamb dish was slightly spicy and extremely flavorful. When eating it on top of the basmati rice, it was heaven on a dish. Unfortunately, they burnt my naan. Really? That's like a movie theater burning your popcorn. The waiter was willing to get me a new order, but for how long it took to get my dinner, I declined. Also, it was way too many choices for carbs for me. Next time I would just order the rice and eat the naan they provide when you first get there. The service from the busboys was extremely attentive. My waiter showed up for my order and once to see how my meal was. He wasn't unfriendly, but I didn't also get the warm fuzzy feeling from him. But boy, that lamb dish was really, really good!!
