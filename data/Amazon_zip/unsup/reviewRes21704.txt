I went here with my friend who lives in the city- and I have to say- I was so impressed with the menu choices- I had the flautas with chicken- the chicken was so juicy and tender, the spanish rice was wonderful (and usually I'm not a huge fan of spanish rice) they also had wonderful margaritas (which are half off on Tuesdays and Thursdays!) the waitstaff was so friendly and accommodating too! I highly recommend this place- if you want a wonderful mexican feast..
