I've been here a couple of times, one thing for sure, the fish is awesome. Arctic char w/ the shrimp, drooling just thinking about it. Good walleye and delectable mahi mahi. only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5, inconsistent service. It's up in the air whether i'll see my server more than twice. Have experienced awesome service with no complaints. Then i've had a time when beer was spilt all over my feet and shoes, by the server, and it took her about 15minutes to bring me some extra napkins- i went in to get them myself before she brought them out. but always great food!
