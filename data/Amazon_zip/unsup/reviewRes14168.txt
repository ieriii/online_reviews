Call ahead and make reservation if you can because it does get a bit busy. That said we got there at 7PM on a Friday and the 4 of us were able to sit within 30 minutes and were able to try the beer while we waited. The beer was very good and the food was beyond good. We got the bacon fat popcorn because everyone had it on their tables and it was great. We also got the soft pretzel. The pretzel itself was nothing special but the cheese sauce which is actually their cheddar ale soup is soooo good. We actually ordered another side of it to dip our fries in later. For entrees we got the workingman burger which was huge and really good. My friends ordered the anti-hero sandwich which they also liked a lot. I ordered the crispy pork belly and egg sandwich on a whim since I normally wouldn't order something like that. It was one of the best sandwiches from a bar I have ever had!!! The pork was crispy on the edges and the roasted garlic aioli was great! Be sure to find a reason to order the cheddar ale soup even if it's only for dipping!
