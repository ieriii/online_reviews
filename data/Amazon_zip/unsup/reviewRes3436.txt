Finally a Korean fusion restaurant gets it right. Very unassuming place that feels like a college lunch spot but tastes like something that was fired up by my mama's kitchen. Great originality in the Seoul Sassy and the Korean BBQ flavors. I can taste the ethnicity while enjoying the American comfort of the fried chicken. Even the burrito reminds me of the type of fusion I incorporate in my own cooking with the combination of korean bbq, tortilla with rice and fresh veges that give it that "crisp" taste. Crisp is what fusion food is supposed to be. A complement of flavors and styles that are delivered to your mouth in a non traditional way. However, things that Crisp misses are the white radishes that oft accompanies Korean friend chicken (tong dahk). I had to drop it a notch because of that oversight.
