Over-hyped. Over-priced. Nice selection, but that's about it. Very noisey,, took along time to get our food. I had the pretzel coated, pan-fried Walleye - the breading overpowered the subtle fish, which was overcooked and dry. We started with the calamari - they use the filet portion only, which would have been nice if it were tasty - but it was very dull, uninteresting sauce, and small portion for the price. It's so incredibly easy to find better calamari in Chicago. My wife had the cioppinio - nicely spiced, but with no variety of fish - all the same, overcooked stuff, with a few overcooked shrimp thrown in. Simple, decent sides. Bottom line: Red Lobster is as good, and less expensive!!!!
