I've been haunting the streets of this neighborhood for the better park of a decade. It's hard to spend this much time in Wicker Park/Bucktown without stopping at this iconic Chicago brunch/breakfast spot at least a few times. I popped in this past week to satisfy a late afternoon pancake craving with a friend. Pleased to grab an immediate stool at the bar, we posted up and dove into the menu. After looking it over, I went for the cranberry-walnut pancakes with a side of bacon. My partner in crime opted for a chorizo omelet. I'm usually an egg guy, but passed at the 10$ price tag on an omelet. How much can eggs really cost? Our food arrived and I was immediately wide-eyed by the mammoth pancakes. I give the thumbs up to this dish- moist, all of the flavors were there and not overly sweet. The omelet sitting next to me was very run-of-the-mill and confirmed my initial suspicion of "how much can you pay for eggs?" Good, but not a 10$ egg. I had two bigger points of disappointment- 1) The bacon was an absolute joke- fried within an inch of becoming "Bacos" and looking very, very sad on the plate- at 3.50$ for the side.....I'll pass next time. 2) They use basic corn syrup based pancake syrup- at a place that is supposed to be "boutique" and is priced this way, I would at least hope for the option of real syrup. If you specialize in breakfast and market yourself as premium, it should follow suit throughout. The highlight (and reason for a solid 3 star experience) was the staff. Everyone was very nice, attentive and professional. Hats off to that. In the end Bongo Room has a long standing tradition and won't be hurting for crowds on the sidewalks any time soon. For my money, I think I'll pick up breakfast at a place like Cozy Corner- very solid, consistent food at a very fair price, using most of the same ingredients as the kitchy joints when it comes to the breakfast staples.
