The husb and I are big fans of Asian food, especially noodle dishes. We were so excited to try Simply It because we missed the Vietnamese places we used to frequent in Boston. I love the fact that this place is BYOB and pretty cheap. The beef lemon grass appetizer is fantastic. My husband said he would have just liked to order another one of those for his meal. I had the Pho which was flavorrful and warmed me up in the cold weather. Overall the food is consistent and inexpensive. I would give them 3.5 stars if I could. It is not our first choice for a night out but a great stand-by.
