WOW! WOW! WOW!! Amazing! On a absolute gorgeous evening we sat out back on the patio. The service was top notch, the wine was not only selected for us (upon our request of course) but was divine and the food, ooooooh, the food! The food was AMAZING! The lasagna, yeah, often a boring choice, but not this time! As it touched my tongue it seemingly melted in my mouth, literally. It was so good, my friend kept coming back for more tastes after the first one offered. Yes, THAT good! And the value was great! It could have easily been pricey, but wasn't at all. Do yourself a favor and get to this spot while the weather is fantastic!
