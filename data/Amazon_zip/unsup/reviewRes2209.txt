I travel miles and miles for the encased meats and wait in line for what feels like forever and I am not sorry at all. If you think about all the hot dog stands I pass along the way just to get my sausages from here it boggles the mind. Words don't do this place justice, just go! The only downside is parking is street and can potentially suck and the line can try your patience.
