I went here not know what to expect and now wish I could go again and appreciate it more. It's hidden away in the North district, up a discreet place. Pretty nice sized, and all the other diners, except our group, were Japanese when I was there. This place is all about the food, there are no gimmicks as with so many otherseafood places in Chicago. The decor is discrete which makes this place feel very authentic, in addition of course, to the fantastic food.
