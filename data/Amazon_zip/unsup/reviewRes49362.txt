I've only been here once, but I really enjoyed myself and the experience. The wine flights are AWESOME, and there are just so many choices. There is truly something for everyone. I had one of the Riesling flights (yum!). I went with a group and all of us were very happy with the wine. Since we were a larger group, we ordered the largest cheese flight. WOW. Absolutely delicious. And there was so much cheese! Heaven. We all then ordered dessert, which was great as well. Our server accidentally overcharged us on dessert, so she comp'ed one of them to make up for it. She was very knowledgable about the wine, which was also very helpful. I love the way Bin 36 is set up. It feels very spacious and open, and I love that you can purchase the wines that you have just tasted. Overall, it's a bit of a splurge, but worth it in the end.
