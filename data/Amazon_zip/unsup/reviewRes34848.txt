Admittedly, I'm a bit of a sushi novice.  I have only had takeout from Sushi X so I cannot comment on the restaurant itself. Those things said, this place is incredibly tasty. I was introduced to this place from coworkers who order from here pretty regularly. There are probably 70 sushi places between work and Sushi X but we're loyal and know it's the best. I cannot recall the names of the rolls I've had, but the menu is full of interesting, unique combinations and from what I'm told, is updated rather frequently.  I'm now adding Sushi X to my "faves" list - now I just need to convince the boyfriend into trying it.
