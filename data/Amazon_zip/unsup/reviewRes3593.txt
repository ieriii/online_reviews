You will never go wrong with Crisp. Pick one or more from these 3 favorites and you will not regret: 1) Seoul Steak Bowl with their special sauce 2) Crisp BBQ Chicken 3) Buddha Bowl This place has amazing fast food. Really great prices - especially their lunch specials since it's about the same portions as their dinner portion but 2/3 of the price! I'm so glad to be within a short walking distance. Owners Howie, Doug, John are super nice and friendly.
