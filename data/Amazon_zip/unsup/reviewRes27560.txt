Not impressed. So Many people had hyped it up, Mexicanos and non Mexicanos. A few weeks back my boyfriend and I started Taco Tuesdays, every week we try to go some where new, and have found some great places. This week, my pick, Nuevo Leon! The place was packed service was great we didn't wait long at all to be seated. I got chicken enchiladas with mole and my boyfriend got the asda tacos.... HOLY GREASEY BATMAN! The rice was good, the beans were swimming in grease, the mole was... there, lacking the sweet and spice I was craving. The tacos de asda litterally dripped grease when you picked them up, he drained them and wiped them down with a napkin. Normally, my favorite dish, I would have cleaned my plate but I didn't make it half way in.... and I know it might be TMI but this morning I have been sitting on the toilet four times and counting. I hope this review spares you belly ache I got, I just don't understand how people RAVE about this place.
