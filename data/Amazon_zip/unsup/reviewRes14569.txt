The bacon popcorn lured me in and now Revolution is one of those places that I go to time and time again. I never get tired of it. Plenty of food and beverage options (with sassy names which I love). I'm not a huge fan of the pizza, just to throw that out there. But the appetizers and sandwiches are delish! And I have never been disappointed in the beer. The ambiance is perfect - not too hipster, some families, locals - not pretentious at all.
