garcia's has some good mexican food man! their burritos are gy-normous. i can usually tell if i'm going to like a mexican place by the chips and salsa that they serve when you are first seated. the prices are pretty good too, i've had worse mexican for way more expensive :( the ambiance is pretty cool in this place too, unfortunately, i've discovered the world of chipotle's and don't know if i'd ever find my way back to garcia's. it was good while it lasted.
