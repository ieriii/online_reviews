PHENOMENAL!!! It's a slightly hipper version of Avec with similar prices. I love how you can pick between different sizes of wine and several varieties are easy on the pocket. We lucked out and were able to grab some seats by the kitchen without a wait. It was fun to watch all the different dishes come out. It's hot and busy in there, but I have to say Jimmy Bannos Jr. has his sh*t together. We started off with fried deviled eggs. Genius! The octopus was also very good, but I wish there was more octo portion wise. The milk braised pork shoulder? Excellent, comfort-food redefined. Eggplant caponata: Mmmmm.. It tasted like bruschetta and paired nicely with the goat cheese toasted bread. We didn't order the chicken thighs with fried smash potatoes, but it looked really, really good. For dessert, one of the chef's recommended the Sicilian Iris, a fried brioche stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips. If you like fried food, you'll love this. I'd probably get it again even though I'm not big on sweets. If you're looking to impress an out-of-towner without going bankrupt, I'd definitely recommend taking them to Purple Pig. Parking is a challenge, but you can either park in the Nordstrom's lot for $12 or find street parking north of Michigan Ave.
