Yes I am a fan! Good drinks. (loved those mint juleps), Good times (watching the Kentucky Derby), good company (my kids!) and oh yea wonderful service I had the chicken with cornbread and baked beans. Excellent choice. The only thing I would change would be the dipping sauce they provided for the chicken was a bit too sweet for my taste. Needed a little spice to it. The banana split was expensive and it tasted like it was dietetic. Didn't like that at all. But definately a return trip is due here...
