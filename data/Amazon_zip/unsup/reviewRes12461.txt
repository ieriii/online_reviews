LOVE this place! I drive past Cafe 28 regularly, but never stopped. A friend finally recommended it, so we tried it. AMAZING! The food literally melted in your mouth. My dish had this fabulous smokey flavor to it. It was not overwhelming and didn't make your mouth feel like a fire pit, but you could definitely taste it. It was fabulous! I have and will continue to go back!
