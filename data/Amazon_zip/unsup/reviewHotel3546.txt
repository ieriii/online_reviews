Real Impressed!!!! For this place to be the cheapest hotel package in downtown is a little insane! We were really just looking for a place to crash over the weekend, but we instead got a pretty posh room and outstanding location to Michigan Ave/Rush St/Division St. The beds and pillows are heavenly, so I woke up refreshed (despite the hangover headache). The bathroom has decent shampoo/conditioner/lotions and a nice shower head, but the best part was the actual full-sized blow dryer (none of these travel-sized junkers). The hotel bar had an interesting array of tap beers. Splash - the pool is on the roof with an amazing view! The concierge was awesome - we emailed him a few questions before we arrived and he answered them promptly. The service when we checked in was so-so. Overall, it's it definitely a hotel I would recommend and stay at again.
