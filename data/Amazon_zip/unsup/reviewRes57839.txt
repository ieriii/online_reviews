From making our reservation to paying the check, this place is amazing! The staff is wonderful, cheery and hard working. The decor is so welcoming and warm. The food is delicious AND great for you. My Vegetarian sister-in-law and I went with my 3 picky young children and all of us loved our food! I live an hour and a half away and cannot wait to get back here!
