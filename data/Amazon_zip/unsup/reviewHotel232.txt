Really liked the pineapple stools at the bar in the lobby and the saltwater taffy. Beautiful decor, but the nautical theme didn't fit the location. Parking garage is conveniently next door. Smoking. Can smell it in the hallway. Would I go back? No. 1. Booked a king, but got a queen 2. Price of parking was absurd. 3. Size of room is pretty outrageous, expected in NY, but not Chicago. The windows looked out into the back of the building next door. 4. Overpriced 5. Lobby doesn't offer coffee.
