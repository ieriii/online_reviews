Love love love this place. My favorite thing by far here are the flour tortillas. Which is odd given tortillas aren't typically the memorable part of my meals. They are pillows of pancakey splendor. Love them. I have always had great friendly service. Everything is very reasonably priced. They provide great salsa, accompaniments and a free app taste. Never had a bad meal - always exceptional. Okay, it isn't perfect... The floors are slippery, so watch out. Especially if you have taken advantage of the BYOB offering by bringing in some mexican beer from a few doors down. Also, it's cash only. But it is still a 5 star spot for me!
