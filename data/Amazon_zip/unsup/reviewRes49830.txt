Umm...YES PLEASE! I continue to reflect on how happy I am with the advent of Groupon. Myself and a friend went here on a Bro-mantic Groupon date and walked away full, happy and plenty of meat for lunch the following day. We shared a pitcher of sangria, which is GREAT! So much flavor and not in the sense of, "Wow is this full of sprite, juice, etc?". We also shared the Picada Colombiana. If you are in the mood for some perfectly cooked/grilled meats and tasty starches, then this is your dish! We got our steak cooked to a perfect medium temperature. That coupled with the chorizo, ribs, pork chicken, etc. a vegetarian would be in hell, but it was my heaven. Regarding the starches, most were tasty; however, the potato was a bit much in size and the crunchy green plantain was a bit dry and not really my speed. The arepa, fried sweet plantain and yucca were Perfect! My only regret is that this was a bro-mantic date. This place is cozy. The bathroom is downstairs which seems like negative - especially after a pitcher of sangria - but when you get down there you won't want to leave. This is the perfect date spot and will definitely take my partner soon.
