This boutique hotel is in an excellent location and the staff (both restaurant and housekeeping) are absolutely wonderful. It's easy to catch a cab or to walk along the river or lakefront. The restaurant serves good, reasonably priced food. You can get great salads, delicious breakfasts and appetizers and can sit outside or inside. I found the microwave, coffee machine and fridge very useful in the suite and liked the separate seating area with additional TV. Our room was on the back side of the hotel and was very quiet and extremely clean. I highly recommend this hotel.
