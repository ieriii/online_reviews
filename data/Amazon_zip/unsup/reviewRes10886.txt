I've loved Piece for a long time. Last weekend I reserved the "pit" for my b-day party, and they exceeded my already-high expectations. The manager helped me find a date when there were no other reservations, so my party could stay from dinner time until closing. The staff was attentive and friendly the entire time we were there. Reserving the "pit" is a great way to enjoy all that's awesome about Piece while avoiding the long waits and the crowds. You still feel like you're part of the scene, but your group gets its own space. It doesn't even cost extra-- all you need is a large enough group and a reservation made a few weeks ahead of time. Now for the requisite gushing about the pizza and beer: New Haven style pizza is definitely worth a try. It's its own thing-- they didn't try for authentic Italian pizza and miss the mark like some reviewers seem to think. The crust is the defining feature here: chewy yet fluffy and SO GOOD. It's not as dense or stretchy as Italian pizza's crust, but it has the "brick oven" taste. The toppings are fresh and delicious, too, and I love creating my own pizza. The beer is out of this world. I fantasize about their Top-Heavy Hefeweizen. There's a reason it wins so many prizes!
