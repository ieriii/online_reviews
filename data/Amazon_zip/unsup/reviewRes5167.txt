If you look at their menu on their website, the prices there are lower than when you go to the actual restaurant - not cool. Not a big deal, it's still fairly priced, but update your website to show accurate pricing!  I digress...anyways, we had a wonderful little dinner at the Pig last night. My fave was the milk braised pork shoulder and the mortadella smear w/balsamico and pistachio. We also had the butternut squash w/pumpkin seeds/brown butter and the prosciutto bread balls. Loved the squash, wouldn't recommend the balls - too salty, small and just tastes like bread crumbs. That was the only item I would not order again. Our waitress was good, hostesses even nicer, and even Jimmy Bannos Jr. himself came by to check on how we liked the food (that was nice). I liked all the smiling faces...I live just across the river from here, so the Pig will be a new regular spot. I'm excited for the summer to come so we can eat on the Pig patio!! One suggestion...improve the dessert menu please. :-) I really wanted dessert last night after din but there was just nothing enticing on the menu (and for me, that's saying a lot).
