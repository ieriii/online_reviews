Please, someone post pictures of the signs for each of the three restaurants. This yelp is for the one with the black sign -- the biggest of the three and the one with the biggest menu, and yes, the salsa negra! Black sign, black salsa, that's all you need to remember. God I miss Chicago, and being within walking distance of La Pasadita. In November when the wind comes off the lake, the smell of all that good meat cooking would waft over my house and pull me down the street to get some, just like one of those Tom & Jerry cartoons. I'm a taco guy myself and go for the babaracoa with lots of salsa negra. There may be better babaracoa somewhere in Pilsen or Little Village, but I'll take mine right in the hood with all the indie kids at 3am, or with the firefighters and cops at noon on a Tuesday.
