I wrote a review about this restaurant just a couple of days ago and it has been removed . I find this to be sadder than anything . It wasn't a flattering review but it wasn't a flattering experience so I wrote what happened. All I want to say is good luck purple pig . I hope other people have a better experience there than I did but removing reviews to put up the facade that you are a perfect restaurant is ridiculous . You can still read my review if you check my profile to those yelpers interested . I can see why they wouldn't want the review read because the whole thing was an embarrassment . I eat at restaurants all over the world , and great ones at that . I heard great things about this place but they all turned out to be untrue in so many more aspects than I care to examine . I will never go back to the purple pig . It is about as classless as I have ever seen .
