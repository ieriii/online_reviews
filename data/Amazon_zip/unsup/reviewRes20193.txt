My cousin owns a firm right next to this place and has a tab there, so while I was in town I got treated so I can't comment on the price here. We had some lunch and I enjoyed the vibe. I also met the owner who was a super Irish fella. All I know is, they have a good selection of beers and literally the best Fish & Chips I've ever had in my life. My cousin told me to put curry on the fish & chips and before I could respond (cuz apparently I gave him a crazy look) he said "trust me". I did, wow.
