Longman & Eagle: How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... I love thee for thou Mac and Cheese with Cherry Tomato Confit, Arugula, Market Mushrooms Mornay Sauce and other delectable bits I love thee for thou Wild Boar Sloppy Joe perfectly, surprisingly and intriguingly seasoned with sage I love thee for thou Whole Hog Crepinette over Cheese Grits, which my sister ordered and as soon as I tasted I wish I had ordered and which reminded me of Mexican carnitas, which is a good comparison in case you're wondering I love thee for thou amazing (and local) Intelligentsia coffee I especially love thee for warming up our hearts and souls on a frigid Sunday afternoon with the fantastic selection in your flight of single malt scotches I love thee for Phillip the bartender who unprompted came to our table and schooled us on the casking and peating process of whiskeys as well as the differences and histories of bourbon and scotch. My sister and I heart you Phillip Longman & Eagle...Your ampersand makes my heart skip a beat. I long for the day when we meet again...
