Me & Karen G. walked over here after babysitting last night (I know...I hadn't been a babysitter since I was 14, either). She got a strawberry daiquiri, which was really really good. In fact, I'm not sure they put any alcohol in it. Of course, my Dos Equis was adorned with a fresh lime. Yum. For dinner I got Combo #6: 1/2 order of skirt steak, chile relleno, cheese enchilada, rice, and beans. The skirt steak was tender and not tough or gritty. the chile relleno was amazing...it was really spicy and had just enough cheese (not too much). The rest was just fine, though not spectacular. Karen G. got the Terra Y Mar: skirt steak and shrimp, with rice and beans. I tasted a shrimp, and it was *perfect.* Sooo good. The wait staff was also attentive, friendly, and even a bit humorous. Overall, great stuff. The prices were fair and it was a great experience. I'd like to go back.
