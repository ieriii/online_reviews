As a regular patron of the Bongo Room I am always excited to eat a nice breakfast there. However I have to say the last time I went I was treated so unkindy that I will never go back. A friend and I were sitting at the bar for about 20 minutes all together, as we were finishing our breakfast I asked the bartender if I could have some tea, he told me he had to "ask his boss" He came back and said my boss wanted me to let you know that there is a 45 minute wait so just keep that it mind as you drink your tea. I chose not to order the tea and leave instead because of the attitude. I mean I payed $15 for a plate of average eggs that I could make at home and I cant sit and have a cup of tea. WOW
