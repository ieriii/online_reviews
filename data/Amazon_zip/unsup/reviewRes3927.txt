That first bite...when your Crisp korean fried chicken cherry is popped...is a sensation unlike any other. If you've never had Korean style fried chicken, like us on our first visit, no words (certainly not by this author) will be articulate enough to describe the crunchy, saucy, moist, spicy, sweet, salty absolutely contradictory combination of flavors dancing some sort of Korean pop dance (a la Hyori, Se7en, etc) on your tongue. It's simply fantastic. Get their Seoul Sassy chicken, get a whole chicken, bring lots of friends and lots of alcohol, and your night will be off to a great start...guaranteed. Their Buddha Bowls (Korean Bi Bim Bop with a twist) is decent, only because if you've had Bi Bim Bop, you expect meat and rice in a sizzling hot stone bowl and the cold veggies in a cold metal bowl that show up, no matter how well marinated and flavored, just don't quite meet those expectations. Have yet to try the other stuff as the Seoul Sassy is just so good, but will definitely be back for more. Take heed, they are closed on Mondays. You don't want to be knocking on a dark storefront at 8PM on a Monday starving and craving Crisp, only left to feel like Harold and Kumar when they realized that their White Castle was replaced by some cheap burger joint.
