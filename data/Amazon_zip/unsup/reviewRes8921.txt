We were just too tired to cook tonight so we decided to give delivery from Noon O Kabab. James took our order and was so nice and friendly-it really started the experience off right. The fact that the food arrived in just under 30 minutes and a busy Saturday night was impressive.  We tried the baba ghannouj and the hummus-both great! Luckily James had given me directions on how to keep the left overs fresh because the large size is HUGE. We also had a Persian salad which would be great on a hot day. For entrees we had the Salmon plate and the Rib Eye/Ground Beef Combo. Everything was cooked perfectly-moist and tender with lots of flavor. Both kinds of rice were wonderful.  The place isn't cheap but the quality of food and service is high.
