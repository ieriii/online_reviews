A "classic" in the true sense of the word. The bar is dark, just how it should be. The drinks are strong, also how they should be. The decor is, well, it's perfect. This is a bar that everyone can enjoy. Let me put it this way... Have you been turned off to live music by all those crappy bands in all those crappy bars? Are you tired of dealing with the bullshit of going out when all you want is a few drinks and some good company? I know you're sick and tired of paying an arm and a leg just to get in the door, let alone for spirited beverages you'd like to enjoy... Then stop complaining already and go to the Green Mill. Does a place even count as touristy when most of the people there are locals? Well... who gives a crap? Green Mill doesn't. Go. Drink. Listen. Enjoy. Be happy.
