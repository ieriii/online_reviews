At first I would just get take out from Irazu and I always thought it was pretty good. Last summer it must have been a slow day, so I decided to just eat in the restaurant. Wow what a difference, I liked the food before, but to really get the whole experience of what Irazu has to offer try eating there. My favorite thing to get is the casado w/steak, I've had this in Costa Rica many times and Irazu's is the best! I've had great luck with the service there as well, the guy working the register has always been cool no matter how busy they are. I wrote this review about a week ago and I got a response from the owner thanking me for my review...........When does that happen? This place has wonderful food, in a Chicago/urban setting. Go here, bring the whole family, your friends, and enjoy!
