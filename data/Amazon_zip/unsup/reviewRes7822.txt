This afternoon was my first time gaucho all-you-can-eat experience. First thing I notice was the spinning skewer of meat on an open fire in the front window upon entering the restaurant. First thing first.....order yourself their Brazilian lemonade. You will not be disappointed. To start off I attacked the cold salad bar which had 30 different items to choose from. At the table you have a two sided disk (red/green) that will indicate the flow of meal traffic you would want to consume. Obviously the green side will bring out the Gaucho chefs with a variety of fire roasted meats ranging from Fillet Mignon, Sirloin, Beef Ribs, Lamb Chops, Pork Loin, Tender Chicken and Pork Sausages. Then when you think you had too much and are full, simply flip the disk to red to stop. During the duration of the meal drink are always filled with the quickness and plates and crumbs are cleaned up just as often. You almost feel like royalty with the top style service you are treated with. Let's not forget the side dishes that come out just as often if you keep asking for more such as the warm cheese bread, mash potatoes, rice and crispy polenta. I highly suggest trying this place out, the level of service is one to experience.
