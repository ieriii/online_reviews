Due to its desperately touristy vibe, I wasn't entirely looking forward to this restaurant. My family was in town from France and I wanted to take them somewhere "American" (i.e. burgers, buffalo wings, copious amounts of food) while visiting Lincoln Park and R.J. Grunts seemed to fit the bill. But damn, do I love that salad bar! It's certainly not exotic, classic ingredients and fresh fruit, but they give you lots of options. You can order it alone for $12 bucks, with an appetizer for $8, or with a meal for $7, and it's all you can eat no matter what. PLUS, they have two soups with the salad bar which are also all you can eat. NEAT! Everyone ordered a meal and the salad bar, but I was content with the bar. I can't personally vouch for the rest of the menu, but my father-in-law loved the ribs. The service was pretty attentive and the prices are low/fair. All in all, I'll probably be back for the salad bar...with family and friends on holiday or without.
