Probably the longest meal of my life, yet I'm not complaining. I think it's time to talk about the finer meals in life because I don't want people to think all I do is go eat Chinatown Ice Cream Factory and go to Public Libraries every day of my life. I had the pleasure to go to Alinea with 5 of my best friends last year on our first trip to Chicago. The stars were aligned when we rented a duplex which was literally 5 blocks away. We were there for a week long film festival, and there was indeed no better way to kick it off than scoring a table at Alinea! We had the 24 course tasting menu that started at 915p and lasted until 2 in the morning. I'm not going to go into each and every dish, but I will let you know that when the meal was over and we were walking home from the restaurant, I can still remember the joy that within each and every one of us, and the smiles on our faces. Alinea is ranked top 5 in America and top 10 restaurants in the WORLD, so know that this does not fall in the category of "cheap eats". What it will fall under is "most memorable meal ever" and "best eats". When they said life is too short to drink cheap wine (and eat cheap food), Alinea was one of the those restaurants they had in mind. If you love food, and have money to throw around or are celebrating a life changing event, this is the place to spend it. Best of luck getting a reservation! Definitely plan as far ahead as possible!
