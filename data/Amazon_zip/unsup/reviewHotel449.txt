This hotel is decent, and certainly cheap, with the bare necessities. I stayed for 4 nights splitting a room w/2 beds with 3 other people. There is no continental breakfast, but "Awake with pearl" sells amazing breakfast sandwiches. The rooms don't have a coffee maker, microwave, or refrigerator. The neighborhood is kind of desolate, and there are not many restaurants or shops around, but it's very close to the McCormick Place convention center. They lose a star because they messed up my bill, and some staff members were a bit ornery at times. A good place to stay if you can do without the works.
