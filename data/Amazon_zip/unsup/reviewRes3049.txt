Crisp had been on my radar for quite some time and I finally managed to make it over there a few weeks ago. As with most restaurants I visit, I usually have my order in mind before I arrive. While I obviously knew I was getting chicken wings, I could not decide between the seoul sassy or the crisp BBQ. I ordered the 5 jumbo wings and luckily the girl was able to give me half of each. I actually got 6 wings for the same price of 5 which was nice. I started off with the seoul sassy and thought how could it get any better than this. Then I tried the BBQ and thought the same. These wavering thoughts continued to go through my mind until I had managed to demolish all of my wings leaving a nice saucy smile on my face.  The bottom line: Go.
