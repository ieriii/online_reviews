Alliance produced three cakes for our wedding in August. Wow! They were show stoppers. We wanted unconventional cakes, with a kooky theme, but they worked with us and came up with the most amazing designs and then executed them flawlessly. Just as cool as anything you might see on one of those Food Network shows. I have a picture of them that I framed, really, great job.
