I Loooovvveee wishbone! it's thee best! I've been here countless amounts of times and it still remains great. Try the blackened chicken and gumbo when they have it. They also have a great variety of vegetarian things on the menu so that's definitely a plus. Not to mention the atmosphere....eccentric farm art? Drinks are good as well. Not pricey at all the only bad thing about coming here is the parking...you'll be lucky if you can get parking. Highly recommended!!
