I am really disappointed.....I just called them from NYC and told them my story....that I lived in Chicago and thought their pizza was awesome and that I really hoped they would be able to make me a few pizzas and freeze them so that I could bring them back to NYC and feed ALL my friends....because basically...the pizza here is nothing like Chicago pizza!!! And....they said NO!!! No hesitation or anything....just an, 'I don't think that'll work.' Sounding like they haven't even tried it before! : (  To a manager/owner/whatever this person was....don't you think that you'd be impressed that someone wanted to bring the pizza to a different state to feed their friends REAL pizza? I know I would be impressed!!! Come on! I've been promising my friends the best pizza EVER for weeks! Now what am I gonna do?
