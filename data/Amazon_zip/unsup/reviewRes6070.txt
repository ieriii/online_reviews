This place is pretty good.  My sister and I decided to eat her while I was visiting, and it was a good choice. It was pretty expensive, but the gift certificate my sister had came in handy. The ambiance was nice...lights everywhere and just pretty warm. It was jam packed though, so it was kind of annoying to wait, but worth it. Food was pretty tasty...we had the special, which was three pieces of steak with different toppings on each which you could pick. The mushroom topping was great. We also treated ourselves to the key lime pie, which was also pretty dang good. The only thing I would complain about was our bus boy...he kept cleaning our stuff away before we were even done. He even sprayed some cleaning chemicals on the table while we were still eating...pretty strange...hopefully it was just this guy.
