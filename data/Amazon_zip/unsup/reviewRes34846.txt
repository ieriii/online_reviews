Sultan's Market serves some of the best falafel sandwiches you can get in Chicago, at very reasonable prices that don't punish you for eating out. I'll try not to simply echo everyone else's ample praises, but there is one great thing about Sultan's that many people seem to overlook: ...THE SALAD BAR. Now wait, hear me out. When I first started going to Sultan's, I would always go straight for the falafel sandwiches, which (as everyone else already pointed out) are de-lish. However, one time I brought my sister, and she grabbed a little tin for the salad bar and started filling it up with stuff. Now she's got me absolutely hooked on the grilled cauliflower, dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves) and dolmeh felfel (stuffed bell peppers). I didn't even have any clue what they were at first, but after tasting them, I had to ask for their names! So, if you're feeling a bit adventurous and looking to mix it up a bit on your next trip to Sultan's, they are HIGHLY recommended!
