I took 12 business guests to The Kinzie Chop House during a trade show stay in Chicago. The restauant is a short cab ride or a comfy 10 block walk from the Hyatt near the river.Serving 12 people is not always easy yet the food and service was oustanding.I had the bone in Delmonico and it was very good. Members of our party has various steaks and fresh fish and the aroma and presentaion and flavor of everything was outstanding.We were seated in a back room that had space for large parties.....the staff took very good care of us.The scallops and calamari that we had for starters were fantastic.The wine list is very good.I often worry when I'm taking a large party to a restaurant (it's not easy to take care of 12 people or more) yet the Kinzie Chop House exceeded my every expectation. Everyone in our party had a great evening.I met Susan Frasca at the door as we left and I thanked her for the outstanding evening.A+  I'll be back.
