I stayed here in 2006 for a conference. It's a historic hotel, that looks like it's seen better days. It was a swank place back in the 30's, but it's outlived its usefulness. The rooms are old and dated. Standard cable TV. Bathrooms weren't anything special either. Parking was a bit steep at $40 a night. The bar wasn't impressive either. Since I was staying on someone else's dime, the room was charged to a corporate credit card, and I put my personal card down for incidentals. 3-4 months after I checked out, I found a charge for $86 on my credit card from Congress Plaza. I tried calling the business office to see why I'd been charged. I never got a call back. Finally, I got my credit card company to intervene, and we placed a 3 way call to the hotel, which gave us nothing but attitude. I wound up getting the charge reversed, but it was a major pain in the ass. Also, there's picketers outside, and they've been on strike for several years over the hotel's low pay and working conditions. http://www.congresshotel and http://www.congresshotel has more on the shithole you'll be staying in (regardless of whether you're pro-union or not, it's still an abortion of a hotel) There's no way in hell I'd stay here again.
