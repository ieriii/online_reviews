UGH. AMAZING. everything about this place and my dining experience was fucking spectacular (besides the condescension the waitress showed to my visiting small-town mother. how rather disappointing that an employee succumbs to her elitist snobbery.) but what's not to love? open, clean, spacious dining room. the farm-to-table green ethos. the wine/beer list. the ever-changing menu. shut itttt. squid - tasty enough but it lacked a memorable note. farm chicken (half) - holy proportions! summer sausage was great. sablefish - OH MY GOD. SO GOOD IN MY MOUTH. the beets! the egg! NNNGH the thing that stood out the most for me: the homemade LAMBIC. i could and should have drank this all day. i definitely want to come here once a month.
