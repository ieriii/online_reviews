We arrived after a long day of travel from California and had an amazing meal. Everything was fantastic- service, food, wine, decor and atmosphere.  We are still talking about several of the dishes- the sweet salt balance was spot on, prices were utterly reasonable, or possibly too low, for what they were. The pig ear salad & smears will be in our memory for a long time.  We opted to have dinner outside, which was quieter and slightly more chill, but then moved inside for dessert. All 3 servers were excellent and attentive, we even got to meet the chef and tell him how wonderful our meal was.  They gave us pointers on where else to eat, and we were so taken with the restaurant, that part of our party came back the next day for lunch. We can't wait to come back to Chicago and are telling all our friends to put this on their "must do" list.
