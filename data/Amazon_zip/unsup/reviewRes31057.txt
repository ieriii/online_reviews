Come hungry.... Eat like a King... Leave Poor Mastro's is probably my favorite steakhouse in Chicago but it's pretty cost prohibitive to go there too frequently. I will caution you to be picky on your seating if they will let you... it gets very loud everywhere in the restaurant and many of their tables are close together. Here are some tips on what we have had.. keep in mind everything at Mastro's is huge! Bread Basket: Control yourself there warm pretzel bread is to die for. French Onion: Not a super creamy version but tasty Lobster Bisque: Good but not Great Salads: Not on the menu but they do offer half salads which are enough for two people. Mastros salad is very seafood heavy Entrees: BONE IN FILET..... BONE IN FILET... spend the money get the bone in... you won't regret it.. i'm a big fan of their peppercorn sauce as well.. all steaks are served on hot buttery plates. Sides: The side dishes are HUGE but you still have to get more than one. Creamy Corn is amazing as is the Mac and Cheese. Brussel Sprouts were pretty delicious as well Desserts: BUTTER CAKE--- i don't care if you think you like Chocolate you like Butter Cake too.... We have been here for two celebreations recently and both times they accomodated us with free desert. Food is all delish and you won't leave hungry... Last thing... I find the Wine List to be good but the markup to be pretty high. If you are a wine snob like us and have obscure wines at home they do offer a $25 corkage fee per bottle. Deal Tip: Don't go here looking for a deal.... go here to spend cash!
