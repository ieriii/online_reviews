5 star service on a budget. http://Hotels.com was offering rooms for $125 on a saturday night. Amazing views from our room featuring floor to ceiling windows. Flat screen tv, luxury bath, ultra hip decor, and much more. Roof top lounge is a must. They have heat lamps and a fire pit for cooler nights. I'd recommend this hotel over any other.
