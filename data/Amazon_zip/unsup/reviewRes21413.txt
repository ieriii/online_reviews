Wow, I've been here a few times, and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. Maybe I forget because I always go on a Tuesday or Thursday and indulge the half price tasty-ever-so-delicious margaritas. And I don't just stop at one. :) The chips and salsa, which are free :), are great. The salsa has a kick to it, but that is where the previously stated margarita comes into play! Get the "i forget the name of it, but it has the word flower in it" margarita. It's like a sangria flavored margarita, if that makes sense. It will knock your socks off. in a good way. :) I've tried a bunch of dishes. The veggie tostada is my go-to. It's so delish. The carne asada was pretty tasty too. The rice and beans is a very nice touch. Beef enchiladas are top notch. Get the Margaritas. Have I mentioned those? hehe. Onto the staff. They are great. Speedy Gonzales and super friendly, whether it's 2 of you, or a big group, they take super great care of you. And they are pretty funny too! Split checks? Not a problem here. Although I know it is super annoying. nom nom nom... :)
