This is where the locals go. Tank has an enormous dining room that is invariably packed with native Vietnamese--always a good sign. The soup and stirfries are great here, and full of exotic ingredients. Despite this, the menu remains quite inexpensive. Service is very friendly and accommodating, and this is a great place to bring children. Every time I eat their soup, I feel a restored sense of well-being and health. I think it might have magical powers.
