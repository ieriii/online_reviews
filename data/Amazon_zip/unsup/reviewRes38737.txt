Never again. The Hopleaf has been a favorite of mine for years, and I've always expected and have been willing to endure the wait for a table. A recent visit there though has me crying uncle. We arrived at 6:30 and were told the wait was an hour. That was to be expected, so we got some beers and waited. We were seated nearly two hours later. The waiter took our order pretty quickly after that, and then the next wait began. About a half-hour later one of our party was (oddly) delivered his single serving of mussels while the rest of us continued to wait. We asked the waiter if there was a problem in the kitchen, and he basically said: "What problem?" Our wait continued for about another half-hour, and then our food finally arrived. And, of course, it wasn't very warm or very good. I used to love the experience of dining at the Hopleaf. But we've noticed the waits getting longer and longer, and after this debacle, our Hopleaf days are over. A four-hour dinner in which the first 3 1/2 hours are spent waiting for the food is not my idea of a fun night out.
