You can tell by the rest of the reviews on here that this place is a top notch Italian restaurant with great food, service and atmosphere.. So i won't waste your time with that. What you do need to know is how unbelievably delicious the milk and honey ribs are. I went into the evening imagining a big plate of tasty pasta or ravioli but when the waiter told us about the ribs, I was sold. I am so glad i listened because i can't imagine ribs tasting any better than these did. The meat was so delicious and just fell off the bones.. Not messy at all and easy to eat with your fork. Served with a side of shoe string sweet potatos bathing in the milk and honey sauce. Not sure if they're always on the menu because it was a special the night I had them, but don't discount them just because your at an Italian restaurant..You won't be sorry!
