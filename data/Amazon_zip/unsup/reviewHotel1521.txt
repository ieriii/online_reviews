I don't like giving bad reviews. So i made sure I called back everyday for almost a week. I did finally get the charger back.  Everyday I called back the front desk would always without fail transfer me to an extension that wasn't setup. After the first or second day you would think someone would send out a memo. The effort it took to get the lost laptop charger back still earns Hotel 71 a low rating.
