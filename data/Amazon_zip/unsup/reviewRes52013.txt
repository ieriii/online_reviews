We were so excited about coming here for Chicago pan pizza. The place is pretty cool, with all the brick and graffiti. The staff were super friendly and we got great service. Unfortunately, the pizza was not the best. The cornmeal crust was soggy. There was so much mushrooms & bell peppers on the pizza that it turned into soup, so my pizza was swimming in mushroom juice..Yuck.
