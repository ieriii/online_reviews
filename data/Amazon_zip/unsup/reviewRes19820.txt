After hearing from friends and reading very favorable comments online about Coast Sushi, my boyfriend and I decided to place a delivery order (we are huge sushi nuts and love trying new places). During the initial phone call I had to repeat things several times- my name, number, and the order three times. I understand this happens in busy places and with the volume in a crowded establishment it is sometimes hard to hear and understand, so fine. I ordered the UNAGI DON and the SASHIMI PLATE- I was told it would take an hour to get it to Logan Square. After ten minutes I checked my phone and noticed several missed calls from your restaurant. I called back and was informed that my order had been taken wrong and that it would be an extra couple of bucks. Again, fine, that sort of thing happens. An hour from that point, I received another call from a number I did not recognize- this time it was the delivery person asking me to meet them at the gate- four floors down and through the courtyard. Now, I know I gave the person on the phone the exact apartment number and I also know for a fact that the buzzer works. At this point I was beginning to get annoyed. When I finally reached the delivery driver I was informed that normally Logan Square was out of delivery zone (which was never mentioned during my phone conversations with the restaurant) and informed that in the future an additional charge would be added. It felt like he was doing me some huge favor and really I have no problem paying extra- I just wanted my order correct and promptly delivered. Not to mention that was ridiculous because the driving distance between the Coast and the apartment is less than three miles! Finally, we had the food and were set to enjoy. As soon as we dug in, we could not help but admit to ourselves that it was awful. It tasted rubbery and flavorless. Luckily the rice was great, so we had that to fill ourselves on, but no rice is worth $55.
