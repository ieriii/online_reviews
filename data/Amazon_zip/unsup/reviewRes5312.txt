2nd visit to PP (Note to self - schedule angioplasty). Restraint was on the menu tonight. Instead of blowing it out like last times' 10+ entree order, I settled in for a lighter meal: Salad with Mint, Feta and those cool looking watermellon radishes - pretty good, this was my conciliation to veggies at the Pig Octopus with Beans - really good, tasty, and perfectly cooked Greek Sausage - good, but too much salt forces a demerit Dessert: Sicilian Iris - soo good - it could easily serve 2 people. must order Service: excellent! I always eat at the bar, All of the bar staff are professionals, friendly, engaging but not obtrusive and when I asked for a side dish of chocolate/nutella for the Iris, it was happily included (i also heard someone say "I'm ordering that next time too!" My rating is upgraded to 4 stars. I will overlook the excessive Salt demerit for the Greek Sausage, becuase the PP is such GOOD VALUE, GOOD Service and Good Food. When you coming to NYC???? (or Brooklyn!)
