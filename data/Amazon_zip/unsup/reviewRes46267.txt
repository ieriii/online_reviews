I could probably not tell the difference between this place and the cheesecake factory. Which fine, I like both places. Came here for a little lunch rendezvous and definitely will come back sometime. It's a good thing that I love to share food because the portions are huge. There is no way I could finish everything on my plate. Great view of the mag mile, nice place to rest your tootsies after a long day of shopping.
