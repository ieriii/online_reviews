Wow. I mean... wow. I love Doug's. And I love Doug. This is such a great place to come for a truly Chicago experience. They serve the only veggie dog I've ever had that I think is worth eating. And of course, who doesn't want to try a nice rattlesnake or wild boar hot dog?  Doug is always amiable and fun, the atmosphere is great, and the value is unbeatable. Some may be turned off by the wait, but I think given that the line is usually around the block, it tends to move pretty quickly.
