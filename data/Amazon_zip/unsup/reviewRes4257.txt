The bartender at MK said this place was where locals went for live jazz, so of course I had to go. He also said it was a dive bar... Not so much. Lots of yuppie looking folk peppered the crowd, but maybe that's because it was a game weekend? Oh, and they only take AMEX or cash... In LA it's usually just Visa/MC or cash... Does Amex give discounted rates to Businesses in Chicago?! Music was excellent! Found a cozy booth to sit and drink a perfect martini and listen to the live jazz sounds of Chicago.... Couldn't have asked for a better night.
