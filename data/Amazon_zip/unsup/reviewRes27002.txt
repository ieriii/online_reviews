My friend and I went here for pizza this past Sunday. We ordered a large deep dish with sausage and it was super delicious. The only thing about this place was that the hostess was horrible! She was super rude. We walked in and she asked us how many seats we needed. I told her "two", she grabbed a couple menus asked us to follow her, literally threw them on the table and then walked away. I would have told her off but I didn't want to risk our pizza being spit on. Anyway, watch out for her. She's a tall average looking Caucasian girl with dark blond her. If it wasn't for her I would have given this place 4 stars.
