This is my wife and my favorite Italian place in Chicago. I always want to try something new but I'm always drawn back to the gnocchi, which is incredible. In fact, I even liked it better than the gnocchi at Cafe Spiaggia, which I've been told is the best gnocchi in Chicago. The restaurant has a great ambiance, very good food, a good wine selection, and best of all, they mail out discount coupons all the time.
