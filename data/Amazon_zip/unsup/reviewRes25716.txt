I went to Mercat a la Planxa on a Sunday evening. We got a great table inside. Overall, I'm very positive on this place. A few major points are as follows: - Food was excellent -- everything we ordered was great. (Don't miss the bacon wrapped dates.) - Service was very good, friendly, and helpful.  - The space (i.e., the dining room) sets a great mood. It's large, open, and warm, and still fairly dramatic with high ceilings and big windows looking onto Michigan Avenue and the park.  The only negative: It's a bit pricey. There were four of us, and we paid about $68 per person which included tax and tip. This is not something I want to pay for every weekend, but definitely worth going from time to time.
