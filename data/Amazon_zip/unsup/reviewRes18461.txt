We love having this great neighborhood spot just down the block from us. Since we don't get out to dinner as much as we once did we started ordering carryout too. Of course we miss the comfortable atmosphere and the friendly servers, but at least I still get my ricotta stuffed gnocchi fix. I could seriously eat these 3 meals a day, 7 days a week. The last time we dined in the server suggested these for our 2-year old. I must admit I doubted he would like them (plus then I felt like I was ordering from the kid's menu), but he LOVED them. Add the bruschetta with fresh mozzarella and I'm a happy camper.
