First time at this Persian restaurant. Must be a great restaurant to have patrons waiting outside the restaurant for an entrance. We only waited about 10 minutes and were seated at the back near the beautiful mosaic. We were served by the owner of the restaurant and she was very cordial. She told us that some reviewers (believe she said the Tribune??) thought she was "surly, sour, unsmiling, not happy"... and she felt bad. Her main concern is making sure the food was cooked properly, all of the patrons were served appropriately and as quickly as possible. She smiled when we told her she was fine.... I told her some of the reviewers need to get a life criticizing someone who is doing everything necessary to make our dining experiences as pleasant as possible.  We had the lamb shank/dill rice and aash soup along with a fine wine she recommended. For dessert she suggested a lovely Persian sponge cake filled with a delicate creme surrounded by chocolate swirls. Just enough for the two of us. Nice restaurant with pleasant surroundings and plenty of street parking.
