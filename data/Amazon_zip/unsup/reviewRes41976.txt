because i was hungry, just finished watching check please and have a car at my disposal, i hiked it to the north side to see what all this "pho" was about.  it was delicious "pho"-sho! i had shrimp spring rolls, pork egg rolls, and a vermicelli noodle bowl with beef and shrimp. the beef was tender and seasoned well and the shrimp cooked to perfection. it was incredibly busy there, but they take reservations and they have quick table turn-arounds because of their numerous and efficient waitstaff.  now that i know it's good, i will be more adventurous next time. i recommend to all, especially if you're going with a group.
