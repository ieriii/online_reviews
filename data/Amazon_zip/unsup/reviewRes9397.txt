I had a lovely time here this week and everything was perfect! I was completely impressed with the service at the host desk, cocktail servers, and waitstaff,  The service style was extremely helpful, yet unobtrusive. Everything was delicious, from the cocktails to the dessert; I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu. Maybe even head to try their Pho some afternoon after a day of shopping? Downstairs was perfect for a date, upstairs had more of a cocktail lounge vibe, perfect for apps and cocktails. I'll be back for another date night or birthday sometime soon. ***update 11/3/10: Went for lunch today and was delicious! Best Pho I've ever had. light, clean, and great value at 6.50 ***
