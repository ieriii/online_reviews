Hot Dog Heaven... this humble place is one of my absolute favorite spots in Chicago AND in the country. Before ever coming here, I was never a huge hot dog person... but after my first visit here during one my many trips to the Chi, my view on hot dogs changed forever. I always have to get a Foie Gras dog, or two... every dog is absolutely awesome, but none quite measure up to this one. What's great about this place is that the menu is always changing, but everything is always delicious. It's no wonder that this place remains a Chicago favorite and extremely popular with a line out the door day-in and day-out. The staff is great and Doug, himself, takes your order. Inexpensive and amazing... definitely a must-go spot for all foodies and out-of-towners. Among my friends I'm the foodie that travels a lot for work and whenever I'm asked where to eat in Chicago, Hot Doug's is always the first place I suggest. I can't wait til my next trip to the Windy City, just so I can come here.
