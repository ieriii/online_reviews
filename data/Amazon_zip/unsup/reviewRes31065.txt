Three solid stars. For a meat-eater reviewing a vegetarian restaurant, I'd say that's pretty good. I tried the polenta fiesta, which was fantastic, and the malbec was good too. I've never been into the whole fake meat scene but the seitan (sp?) on my friend's "rueben" was actually really good. I wasnt crazy about the atmosphere but it's fine for a chill, casual dinner. I'll definitely be back.
