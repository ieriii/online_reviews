I needed a hotel that was a little less spendy than the $200+ rack rate of the conference hotel (and yes, that was with the conference "deal."). Luckily for me, my travel agent (aka the bf) found Hotel Allegro, which was a mile away, for less than 50% of what I would have spent if I had stayed at the conference hotel. Yes, this is less than their advertised rack rate. I have a great travel agent. Hotel Allegro is a Kimpton hotel and after my experience, I must say I'm a fan. A complimentary wine hour (5-6 pm) every day? Don't mind if I do. In the afternoon, chilled water with slices of lemon and lime and either lemonade or a tea spritzer are available for you to quaff after walking around under the blistering sun. In the morning, coffee (hot and iced) and tea, along with a myriad of newspapers (by the way, you can get a paper delivered to your door gratuit), are awaiting you. Hotel lobbies are usually such dead spaces, but here, they're a lively and yet tranquil place for hotel guests to sit and relax. The only drawback is that the morning coffee is of Yale Club quality* (http://www.yelp.com/user). The room was sumptuous and comfortable. After joining some hotel program, I had all the free wifi I wanted. The maid was scrupulously honest. I left some money as a tip for her (labeled in an envelope "for the maid"), and when I came back, the money was left untouched because I guess she couldn't read English (I read somewhere that this was not uncommon). So the next day, I left the envelope on the bed where it was clear that the money was intended for her. The rest of the staff was also very courteous and accommodating. I had a lovely stay at Hotel Allegro and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. *If you can't be bothered to read my review, it means that the coffee is extremely weak and watered down.
