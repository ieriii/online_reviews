the food was good - creative and great presentation. with a tasting menu like this, it is likely you are not going to enjoy at least 1 of the courses. that being said we came on a tuesday at 5pm and we totally felt like we were rushed! yes, we used a groupon, but we were prompt for our reservation although the restaurant had just opened and there was only 1 other table seated. we felt like through each course we were rushed and they were ready to kick us out. NOT the kind of experience you want at this type of place that is supposed to be focused on the eating experience. thumbs up for food thumbs down for service. oh and i forgot to mention the male server had NO idea how to describe the food, the female server was much better. another important aspect of this type of experience (and any tasting menu for that matter) is to be explained the food ingredients and concept, especially since you dont even have a menu to look at!
