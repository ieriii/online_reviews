I have stayed here 4 times in the past 90 days and I have been thoroughly impressed with the property and staff. Everyone is friendly, professional, and helpful. Yes, things can and do wrong from time to time - it would be foolish to think otherwise. However, it is how the staff handle the situation or problem is what counts, and this staff always step up to the plate, apologize (even if it is not their fault) and immediately begin to resolve it. The hotel is in a GREAT location, about a block from Michigan Ave (major shopping) and very easy walks to subway/metro, as well as State Street, Rush St, and other sights. The rooms are immaculate, clean, and well maintained. I never had a problem at all in their area and have always been happy sleeping on these amazing beds! The WiFi is reasonably priced, but there are plenty of free hot spots within walking distance.  I am a little sad that they do not have a pool - probably, my single downside with this Hyatt. Prices fluctuate a lot so check often. I have scored rooms between $149-$199. The area is safe, walkable, and family friendly!
