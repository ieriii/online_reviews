This was serious service. After taking a sip of water, I was assured to have a waiter there waiting for me to put down my glass so that he could fill it up. Excellent calamari. The Greek salad with potato salad was not outstanding, not like the stuff I am used to in Tarpon Springs, FL (largest population of Greeks outside of Greece). The vegetable mousaka was amazing. It melted in your mouth. Again, outstanding service, excellent food, so so Greek salad.
