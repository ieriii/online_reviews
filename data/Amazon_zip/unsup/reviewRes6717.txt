This place was so good the first time I went I thought it was a fluke. So I went back 2 weeks later and realized it wasn't a fluke...it was just that good. After spending 2 solid weeks in Italy this fall I came back somewhat tarnished from the American version of Italian food. This put me back in my place. The food here is delicious and the atmosphere is great. It's a cozy little house like place that has a kick ass wine cellar/selection in the back. As others have mentioned, it's a wine boutique so you buy off the shelf and they charge you a 7 dollar corkage fee. You can get great bottles of wine for great prices..like at cost, not restaurant wine prices. If you want to get some of the higher end stuff, they even have a secret wine list (shh...you didn't hear it from me). I think the key is going with people who are willing to share anything and everything. Four seemed to be the perfect number. They don't take resos and the wait can be long so make sure to go with people you want to spend time with. Some highlights for me: Truffle Toast: You MUST order this and each take a bite...AMAZING! Pizza: Loved the Prosciutto Arugula, not the biggest fan of the mushroom/truffle/leek pizza. Pasta: Rigatoni with Sausage was great, Ragu of the day, didn't love. Can't go wrong with any of the meats or cheeses or small mason jars. So grab some good friends and head to this place to enjoy some awesome wine and awesome food at really reasonable prices.
