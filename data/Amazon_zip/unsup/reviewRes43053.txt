We've been here a total of two times. The first was the first week they opened. So we let the long wait slide and we also loved that the owner chatted with us and seemed like a really nice guy. Hey. New business. Little kinks to hammer out. Got it. When we saw that they were offering a Groupon, we decided it was a great reason to go back. Enough time had passed to allow for a more refined experience. This time service was even worse than the first. How is that possible? We ate in, and saw in full force how poorly the cashier reacted to customers and fielding basic questions and call in orders. It. Was. A. Mess. We waited about 40 minutes to get a pizza and half chicken meal. That was actually not as bad as the couple that ordered well ahead of us and got their order as we were walking out. Easily and hour and fifteen later. Easy. There was chaos and disorganization behind the counter and at one point the cashier just started blaming the guy that closed the night prior for not stocking properly. (Why do I get the feeling that he was the "guy" that closed?) People that just wanted to grab and go had literally one choice of pizza and it was cold. Even the people that were getting delivery were getting the short end as we witnessed them make the food and THEN call a delivery service that would make their way there and then go to delivery the food. I can't imagine that order keeping piping hot at delivery. Also. No highchairs or a changer in the bathroom. Not very kid friendly at all. So overall the food is good. Tasty pizza and chicken if you're not in a rush or don't mind a bit of an adventure. Just keep in mind it's not so much a Fogo 2 go place as a Fogo Waiting room.
