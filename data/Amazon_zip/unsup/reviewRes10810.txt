One of my friends came here for brunch once and highly recommended it. We had to wait for an hour for a table since they don't take reservations. After the wait, we were super hungry. My friend said all of their Eggs Benedict dishes were delicious and a 'must have'. Here's what we ordered: CHOCOLATE TOWER FRENCH TOAST bittersweet chocolate chunk bread stuffed with maple mascarpone, banana crme brulee sauce, bananas & shaved chocolate SPINACH, ROASTED RED PEPPER AND FETA BENEDICT two toasted english muffins topped with poached eggs, fresh spinach, roasted red peppers, feta & classic hollandaise sauce served with hash browns EGGS BENEDICT two toasted english muffins topped with poached eggs, grilled canadian bacon and classic hollandaise sauce served with hash browns ITALIAN SAUSAGE BURRITO tomato tortilla stuffed with crumbled italian sausage, guacamole & scrambled eggs topped with provolone cheese served with tomato-basil salsa & hash browns The Eggs Benedicts were scrumptious. Each bite melts in your mouth. Normally I'm okay with eggs benedicts because they can have too much lemon flavor but these were excellent. The hash browns were also cooked nicely and not too dry. The Chocolate tower was good but a bit too sweet for me. The Italian Sausage was good too but didn't match up to the egg benedicts. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice! Verdict: Might have to wait for a table so get there early. Even if you are not a fan of egg benedicts, you should give one a try, it was so delicious. Service was right on. I will definitely be back.
