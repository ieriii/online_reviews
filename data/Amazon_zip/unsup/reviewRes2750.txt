Drum Roll please..... for my 100th review I found it most fitting to review my favorite restaurant in Chicago, Tru. Technically this isn't even a review.... the menu is ever-changing so I'm not going to drone on about food that will likely no longer be featured by the time you get there. What you do need to know about is the impeccable level of service demanded of the staff at Tru. You will not feel more important or pampered ANYWHERE... the staff times everything in carefully orchestrated maneuvers to create a seamless experience of culinary and visual delight. Be prepared to have Tru be the only thing you do in an evening... there will be no bars, movies or anything after this meal. It will take several hours and you'll be in such a state of food ecstasy that the thought of putting one more thing in your belly will be unbearable. Rick Tramonto does such an amazing job with the food, it's not only artistic and beautiful but even more delicious than it is aesthetically pleasing (ding! ding! ding! this is how food should be done people). Be sure to choose a prix fixe option as dining a la carte here is for amateurs... you don't come here to compromise on quality or selection. The Gale Gand dessert cart will really drive the point home with tons of hand crafted goodies and lavender lollipops... Gale is also known to pre-package little desert cakes that they send you home with. I can not think of anything else I would rather pair my morning coffee with....  Tru is my one and only choice for special occasions and milestone dinners - anyone who knows me knows that this is my answer to treating myself or my friends to something decadent and extremely fabulous. As a Chicagoan or someone traveling in our fair city, you owe it to yourself to sample a Tru caviar staircase at least once. And to dine among the fine art original Warhols, Ruschas, and Kleins... tres chic!!
