After walking around downtown Chicago for an eternity searching for this place, we finally found it. It was to be my first taste of Chicago style pizza. We had to wait for a table but we got to pre-order the pizza so we wouldn't have to wait long. or so we thought. After about 15 minutes we were seated. It was almost another hour before the pizza finally came out. I was not that impressed with the pizza. It was ok. I thought the crust was aiiiite. We asked for ranch and the waitress asked "For your crust?" No biatch, its for the whole damn pizza cause thats how us Californians roll! Pizza like this is not worth waiting an hour for, even if the company was okat best. JK, Bella!
