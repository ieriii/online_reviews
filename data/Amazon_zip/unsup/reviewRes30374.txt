I love this place. It's the perfect little cafe that you can just go to anytime. Try the scones, they're great. They have an interesting beer selection, and the menu is always interesting. Breakfast all the time- you can't beat that right? The servers are always cool, it's never too loud and they have ever changing artwork on the walls. However, I had one experience that really put this place over the top for me. I was meeting someone there and I showed up a little bit early. He was stuck at work. So I ordered a drink and waited. My server is super attentive and I tell her that I'm waiting on someone so I'll order when he arrives. She is totally cool about it, even though it was a bit late. A half hour passes, then forty-five minutes. She offers me a refill on my beer. My dinner companion is still stuck at work, 20 more minutes he says apologetically. I had grabbed a red eye earlier and pulled out the crossword puzzle but I couldn't find my pen. My server gave me hers and never once did she try to shoo me out, rush me, or make me feel like I was bothering her in any way. Finally, when he came, we ordered our food and she was just as attentive and friendly as she had been the entire time.
