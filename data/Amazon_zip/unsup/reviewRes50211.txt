I love southern food and was excited to try Big Jones!  I had the crawfish etouffe which was delicious. The service was somewhat slow. I was not expecting this place to be so expensive. $14 for a hamburger!  I thought Big Jones was all in all pretentious and didn't really fit in with the Andersonville vibe that I know.
