Ok, so the Publican is cool. To be honest, if it had not been the most amazing food of my life, I would have hated this place. I will say that the family style seating is great for a date. So much less pressure. There is one thing that will always sell me on a place: The Beer list. The Publican has an amazing beer list. I didn't get to try that many because I went there for Sunday Brunch and was not in the mood to get wasted. What I DID have was the Bloody Mary that, like all good Bloody Mary's, came with a poor of a good stout (which you had your choice of).  The best part is that the Brunch menu is affordable - nothing over 20 bucks - and everything was so tasty. I did feel under dressed in here, in my jeans but maybe that' because I wasn't wearing a v-neck t-shirt and a vest or a sundress and a quirky cardigan. I've gotten used that feeling these days, isn't every place with good beer and quirky food a hipster mecca?
