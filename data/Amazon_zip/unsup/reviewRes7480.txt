I have been coming here since it opened (at least since 2002 when I think it opened) when my roommate used to host and wait tables here. It has never failed me in what I have ordered.  Now 8 years later, it is my favorite place to go with my husband and we try to go about every 2 months. Many of the staff and manager know us and are always pleased to see us again. We went almost a year without going there and when we came back they had no problem remembering us and were so eager to congratulate us on my obvious pregnancy. The staff is great, the food is wonderful, and varied for all tastes and dining preferences. The lobster ravioli is wonderful, my husband loves the veal chop, their seafood pasta is amazing and their salmon is wonderful too. And don't forget dessert, i've tried them all and they are all fantastic. There is a reason why this place has been around for so long. It isn't in tourist land so if you're an out of towner it may not be convenient but if you make the trek to Lincoln park i can assure that you won't be disappointed. oh and the prices are very reasonable Enjoy!
