Have some beer. Hopleaf has an awesome array of deliciously rich belgian ales. The main floor, admittedly a bit hectic, is first-come first-serve seating. They also have a mezzanine where groups can comfortably wait for a table, on the second floor. The menu, which can be viewed from their website, offers indulgent, and very detailed, appetizers and entrees. I favor chicken, seafood, and gamefowl so I usually do pretty damn well here. ****Note to beer lovers abroad, picture an ale selection like San Francisco's Toronado, with the added option of indulgent eats. Yeah, nice.
