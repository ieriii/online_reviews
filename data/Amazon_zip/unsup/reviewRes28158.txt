Already plotting to get back to Frontera so I can try more stuff. Im mad at myself for getting a little too drunk prior to showing up for our reservation. Everyone says the guac is to die for and I don't really remember what it tasted like :( We ordered the appetizer sampler, which was pretty big. A good idea for a group if you want to try a bunch of the apps. I liked the little taquito thing on the platter the best. The quesadilla didnt look like what we are all used to, like a tortilla sandwich, more like a little turnover. It was only ok IMO. I did also enjoy the ceviche bites on the platter, though I liked one of the other ceviche flavors (the hamachi) better that a friend got in the ceviche sampler. I had the grilled skirt steak for my entree and it was delicious. Perfect medium rare, tasty tomato based sauce that comes with it.  Pricey though- $600 for 8 people, though we were not holding back at all. We were set to enjoy all the food and drinks we could consume.
