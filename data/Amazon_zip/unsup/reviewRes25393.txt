I visited Geja's when my sister was visiting, since she's a foodie and neither of us have ever been to a fondue restaurant. What a fun night! We were seated about 30 minutes late (we had a reservation), but the manager was very good about keeping us informed, which I really appreciate. The drinks were fantastic, and that kept us busy before dinner. We ordered one of the premier dinners, which includes salad, cheese, meat and chocolate fondues, and coffee. It was all delicious, and really fun to try a new dining style. A word to the wise, however: make sure to allow plenty of time for dinner; this visit was at least 3 hours, and subsequent visits (with fewer people) were almost as long. Also, the "romantic" feeling may be in part because of the dining spaces that feel private, but also the fairly dim lighting. The live music is a great touch, too.
