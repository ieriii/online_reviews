I've only been here once. I came with 2 friends around 10 pm on a saturday. We waited inside, in line for approximately 20 minutes, which is not that bad. I've heard from friends who have been there who waited much, much longer. Their drinks are interesting, different, and tasty. Beer is not served here. We were seated at the bar, which was fine, however we would've preferred a table. We got a ravioli appetizer, which was good, but nothing special. The decor is very different and cool. It's definitely not the type of place where you meet new people. It's a good place to come with one other person or a small group. Overall I enjoyed my time there.
