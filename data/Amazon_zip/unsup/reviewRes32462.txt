Review summary: it is what it is. It's vegetarian, vegan, and Celiac-friendly. I see multiple complaints about the entrees being expensive, but what do you expect for premium organic vegetarian food? The Reuben was frackin' fantastic. Atmosphere indeed feels like a diner in the middle of Boys' Town. Experience was as expected. Four stars, dude.
