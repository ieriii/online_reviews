So, it is "Leap Year Day". What is the best way to celebrate?!? Bring home some Brazilian chicken with all the fixin's!! If there was a camera in our place, many would witness pieces of chicken flying and and chicken juices spray everywhere, as we tore through the amazing meal. I have received several recommendations in the past, but this is crazy, ridiculous! I am dreaming about the chicken now. As for the prices?!? Super cheap! I was able to purchase two different dinners that included pita and two sides for each, along with a full size salad for under $30. If that is not a deal, I do not know what is!! Hello, tiny jewel on Diversey!
