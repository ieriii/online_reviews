My husband took me to Ruth Chris for my Bday last month and it was delicious. I had the sauteed shrimp and my husband had the filet mignon with potatoes and mushrooms. OMG!!!! I would def go back. the staff were polite and catered to our every needs. The valet parking attendant were quick, the host was nice and greeted us with Mr.& Mrs.thumbs up
