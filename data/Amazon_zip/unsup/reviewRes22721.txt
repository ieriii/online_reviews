took me an hour to get here from o'hare because i kept on driving past it, with no good way to turn around!! ugh. but, it was totally worth the stresses of driving to get that perfect no-frills chicago-style dog i'd been craving ever since moving to nyc. i've tried recreating at crif dog, but just got a soggy mess -- key is the whole pickle spear as opposed to chopped and dripping with brine.  add a thick chocolate shake and crunchy fries, you get an artery-busting meal. and the pickled green tomato was the cherry-on-top! yum! prices (and calories) are high, so this is a once-every-couple-years visit for me.
