Came here couple hours before they were closed, and man, the service was great. They did not rush us nor kick us out near closing. Thumbs up for that. The menu was extensive. I didn't know where to start. But after a long look at it, my friends and I ordered some oysters as appetizers. For my entree, I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Yellow Fin tuna. I was nervous that it would be overly seared, but it was good. They cooked it perfectly! The sauce was delicious but super greasy. The "crispy" noodle that came with it was not very crispy...they were chewy and drenched in oil. But other than that, OMG, the tuna tasted great with the sauce. I also had a couple spoonful of my friend's lobster bisque. It was delish! Very rich in flavor and contains chunks of lobster. The King crab was also very sweet. We ended the meal with large slice of key lime pie. OMGGGG, it was so smoooooth and silky. Best slice ever! Highly recommend it, and should definitely save room for it!
