My husband and I were honored to be invited to preview Sunda before it opened to the public during their "tasting" weekend. The decor is elegant and luxe upscale yet inviting and the food is truly exceptional. They had amazing vegetarian options as well. It was a culinary treat and the environment was beautiful. If you like sushi, the caterpillar roll and the "number 10" are outstanding. Highly recommend!
