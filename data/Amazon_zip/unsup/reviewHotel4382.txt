One of the most beautiful hotel's in the city. The atmosphere is wonderful the way the hotel is laid out with the main floor a cozy bar and restaurant. LOVE to stay here. The staff is very helpful and the food is wonderful.  We had a suite and the bed was so comfortable I had NO trouble falling asleep! The bathroom was small, but the room was a decent size. I thought the entire staff was courteous and the check out line even though long we rather quick.  I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling with family or for business or just looking for a weekend away with your hunny!
