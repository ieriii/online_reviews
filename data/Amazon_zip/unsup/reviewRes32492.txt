It was March since we were in last and we will never return. After 4 returned plates we simply gave up, i finished my plate of horribly cooked overpriced frozen ravioli and walked out. The manager followed us out the door apologizing for everything but to no avail. I wanted to talk to the chef but it was her night off (a Saturday!!!). We tried their new menu at the green festival and bland, bland, bland. Followed by: excuse me could I get this hot sandwich hot? Nope, didn't think so- room temperature bland. Wonderful. Good luck guys, I hope you learn how to cook soon, or at least learn to half-ass care about what you do. Reputation of the good ol' days won't last long.
