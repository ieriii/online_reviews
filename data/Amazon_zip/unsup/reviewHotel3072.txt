I attended an event at the W this week. The catering was not great. The staff was friendly but the passed apps were sub par. Everything that was supposed to be warm was cold and vice versa. The crab cakes were so bad I had to run to the bar so I could get something to wash the taste out of my mouth.  The hotel itself is geared to the trendy so if that's not your speed this probably isn't your hotel. I have enjoyed the Wave restaurant for dinner however, which has a great atmosphere and nice views of the lake. The food was good but not memorable.
