i'm sorry but i think the vegetarians here have lost their sense of taste. i've eaten here on four seperate occasions trying to find the appeal (i do applaud their approach to creating veggie/vegan comfort foods) but the overall flavor is really quite bland. i mean, even the cornbread tasted dull (and dry). how do you screw up CORNBREAD? its serviceable for the vegetarian/vegan community but there are better options out there that will better please your palate (victory's banner for instance).
