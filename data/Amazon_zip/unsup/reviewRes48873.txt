Best. Chicken. Ever. I made this statement after two Pere Jacques, however my husband concurred the next morning when he ate the rest for breakfast. Again...slowly with meaning...best. chicken. ever. I am not a fan of ordering chicken at a restaurant. That's why you have a stove at home. However, the roast chicken at Publican is really unbeatable. Succulent, bursting with flavor and perched above a nest of heavenly fries. Also, do embrace your inner beet - the beets and house made ricotta were also a standout. Reservations recommended, unless you make friends with the folks standing waiting for seat around round stand up tables.
