Brought 3 guests from out of town who wanted to be "blown away" by a great place, and all were 100% impressed and happy with the experience. We had a great time, enjoyed delicious flights, our server was VERY knowledgeable about the wine, the food was incredible, we sat there for 3 hours and thought only 1 hour had gone by. Perfect night.  Special was a huge noodle with lamb ragu folded in -- DELICIOUS! Steak was great, fish was great, quiche was wonderful - we were all passing bites around to taste each others dishes. Dessert was lovely and they have a great selection of ice wines and ports and sherries and the whole works.
