I don't know what the hype is about this place. I found the pizza to be OK at best. Maybe it's because I'm not a thin crust fan or maybe it's because I LOVE Metro Pizza. We ordered the traditional sauce with garlic, basil, tomatoes and italian sausage. Their toppings are fresh, but if you ask me, I think their toppings are a bit pricey. I personally think toppings should be priced according to the size of the pizza. To put it in perspective, if you wanted to make a small supreme pizza, it would cost you over 20 bucks!!! No thanks! The crust wasn't even enjoyable, I ended up tossing mine to the side. I also found it annoying that our table could barely fit the pan they bring ALL their pizzas in. We had a tiny round table and everytime we seasoned our pizza we almost knocked the rest of our pizza over. Good thing they only have a few of these tiny round tables...  I'm giving Piece 3 stars bc their service was good and bc of their amaaaaaaaaaaaazing carrot cake! It was so moist and yummy! I usually don't like coconut, but I loved the toasted slivers on this cake. I would be open to trying this place again if we were out of places to watch a game.
