I eat here about once a month and love that the menu is constantly changing based on what is fresh and in season. There are a few things on the menu that remain throughout the year and are consistently good including the Prairie Pure Mac 'n' Cheese and the Korean Chili-Spiced Calamari are always an excellent choice. I've also always enjoyed their polenta dishes, usually with chicken or pork, but I have a sometimes freakish adoration for polenta, so I may be slightly biased. They also have fantastic brunch options, if you are so inclined. Uncommon Ground does its best to use locally produced, family farmed and organic produce as much as possible. I love that they are thinking local, which in addition to their amazing food, causes me continue to frequent the restaurant.
