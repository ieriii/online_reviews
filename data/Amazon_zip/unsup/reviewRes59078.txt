Great place! My favorite breakfast spot! The Staff is always friendly & nice! LOVEEE their Banana Blue Crunch Cakes.... Yummm so good!!Their egg white skillets are also delish!! Always get the same thing every time I go... Someday I will venture out & try more delish stuff! ;) go early or you will probably wait... But def worth the wait!!!
