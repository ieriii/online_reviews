After a number of visits, I have to say this is my favorite brunch spot in Chicago!! I live nearby, the West Loop, so it's not too far of a walk and just a short drive. Every time I have been here, I have had such a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounds so good!! The French toast and pancakes are excellent and a friend had the omelet last time which also looked good. All the ingredients are fresh, the prices are reasonable and the food delicious! They have excellent fresh squeezed juice, also. There is typically a wait on weekends but trust me, it is worth it!
