The first time I came was for my birthday and I totally loved it. The food was great, however the hospitality has always been just a-ok. This second time is why I'm even commenting. Like I said the first time was great, but this time we were kept waiting 45 minutes past the reservation. I really hate that, we wouldn't have bothered to make a reservation if we were just going to wait when we got there. The worst part was that I felt that they didn't address it or apologize. We were stupid for staying that long but were so hungry we felt we might as well just stay. The food was just as great as the first time and I have to say the bussers are absolutely on top of their game.
