nice red interior, good service, i loved the bread and the mushroom risotto!! they have nice salad bar. cheese was great but, oyester wasn't that fresh. we've waited for the filet for such a long time, so i had to ask server several times for the specific meat that i wanted to eat.. other than that, i think it's a good deal to go btw mon.~ thur. cus it's only $34.99 a person.
