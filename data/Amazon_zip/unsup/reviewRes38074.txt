So with almost 500 reviews, you know that this place has to be good. Well all I can say is MY FAVORITE PLACE in the city. The staff is a little on the pretentious side, but the beer and the amazing food are so worth it. On Friday and Saturday head upstairs to the mezzanine bar for a smaller crowd and a place to sit. (The upstairs bar is cash only though with a smaller selection.) I have yet to try a dish off the menu that I did not enjoy. The mussels Belgian style are my favorite, but don't forget to try the mac and cheese or the beef stew. The menu is seasonal, so not all dishes are available all the time. I find myself here several times a month and I always have a great time. Hopleaf... I love you!
