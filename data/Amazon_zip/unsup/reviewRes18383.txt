Had a hefty dose of XOCO today making significant inroads to their menu.  I tried the chicharones, pigs feet, goat barbocoa, Cochinita Pibil, and of coarse the much celebrated Ahogada. Throw in some hot chocolate, horchata, and the tastiest churros I've ever sampled anywhere and I had to loosen the belt a notch. Everything was well executed and mostly tasty (except the chicharones which were universally loathed by everyone at our table).  All that said, I don't think I could bring myself to return unless there's a day when I don't have to stand in line for a Caldo or Torta. Can't see that happening anytime soon...
