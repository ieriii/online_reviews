I thought that when Spacca Napoli opened its doors (replacing a hole-in-the-wall diner) I would be a frequent customer as I lived just down the street. OK - it deserves high marks for efforts at authenticity of Neopolitan pizza. However, the menu is very limited - you can pay a lot not to be filled up (very un-Chicago, so it should also be true to its local roots!) It suffers from its success - they just don't know how to handle excess flow of customers. Lack of restaurant experience from the proprietors bring it down. To paraphrase Yogi Berra, "no one goes there anymore, it's too busy."
