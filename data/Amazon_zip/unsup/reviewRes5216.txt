Oink oink! I dig the cheese, wine, and swine! I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Although the pig themed marketing may drown out everything you hear, Purple Pig is actually more like an Italian wine & cheese bar/restaurant. It's elegant, it's unique, it's fun. Oh yeah, it's crowded too (like all the good restaurants). The menu is set up similar to Quartino or Avec, with a variety of smaller plates in addition to larger plates. The dishes are intended to be shared. They are on the small side, so plan on ordering a lot. I love this, because I can try many dishes! :) We went the adventurous route. Here's what I remember: - Sardines with Lemon Vinaigrette - Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Marinated Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - Pork Liver Pat - Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Octopus with acini di pepe & Swiss Chard - Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette - Special shad roe salad - Sicilian Iris Our favorites were the pate (how can you go wrong with pate, and it's cheaper than even the deli!) and bone marrow. Mmm bone.... All the dishes were great actually. They have good seafood too, so don't think it's all pork. To top it off, the chef stopped by to ask us about the shad special, since we were the first ones to have ordered it that evening. I really enjoy unique concepts, daring ingredients, and food influenced by other cultures. Purple Pig has all of these. I'm definitely going back to oink some more :)
