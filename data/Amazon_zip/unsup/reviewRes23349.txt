What, did I order wrong? 'Cause I hate when that happens. Besides the flaming cheese (which every single table orders, as they should), I can't really think of a great reason to return to this place. Don't get me wrong, the food was decent, good at best, but it was pretty ordinary. I should know not to order Calamari at most restaurants and ordering it here was an immediate reminder. I had the Mediterranean Chicken for dinner and while it was well seasoned and cooked properly, it was still just a chicken breast next to some rice. The prices didn't shock me. The service was ok. It seems like a good place for families! Opaa!!
