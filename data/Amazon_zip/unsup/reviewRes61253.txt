My wife and I stumbled across this place nine years ago and have yet to find it's equal. Great portions, quality, and price.   The burritos are (quite literally) my favorite. I've had them all, and the best are marinated steak, and the pork. If you're really in the mood, get them Suizo. Their cheese blend is amazing.   When eating in, I almost always order the Tampiguena. Wow! and the steak is cooked to a perfect medium rare (when asked).   Their table salsa is never the same spiciness, which I love because it means there is no standard recipe and it's always fresh. Bonus: When we order a pitcher of margaritas, they not only bring a full pitcher but give you already full glasses. And they're strong. (the only place I've EVER known to do this!)Note: I sort of miss the "dive" aspect to it since it's renovation, because now it seems that the secret is out. However, the food and service is still awesome.
