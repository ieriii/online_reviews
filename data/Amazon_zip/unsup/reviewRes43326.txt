I love Milk & Honey because it's open & bright, which makes it a nice place to read a book and get breakfast.  They have good oatmeal, not that oatmeal's that tough to do. I like their fruit salad. But I don't think I really loved Milk & Honey until I got the huevos rancheros a few weekends ago. Sososogood.  The odd thing is that one out of three times I'm in Milk & Honey (which is sort of a lot, since my job doesn't start until noon), there are two "girlfriends" "catching up," and invariably their talk turns to one of their engagement rings, and how the fiance found the diamond, and how Tiffany's isn't original enough, blah blah. It's never the same woman telling the story of her diamond, which makes me wonder if once I'm engaged, all my thoughts will turn to shiny stuff-diamonds, handles for my faucets, new windows in the condo, etc. It's icky to have to listen to, and you can tell the other person involved in the conversation is single and silently seething with jealousy.
