A dawg is $5 but comes with fries. Cant get it without. Dogs are top notch, my wife's cheeseburger was only OK. Fries were decent, nothing special though. I really liked the dog though. Chicago dog exactly as you would imagine. Kind of fun to eat in the car, just glad I didn't get mustard on my shirt. I guess I could have bought one from them if I had though. Chocolate shake was phenomenal as well.
