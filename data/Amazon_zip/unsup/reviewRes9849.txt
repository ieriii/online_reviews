Excellent. Words cannot begin to describe my experience at this restaurant. l am a very difficult customer to please and l must say l haven't felt like a princess since i arrived in chicago 2yrs ago until l dined at Le colonial with a friend of mine,the service was impeccable,both waiters were extremely attentive,polite,they served our food on time; and talking about the food,l had the red snapper and steamed rice as my main course,it was soooo good. At the end of dinner,we had a chat with the manager and l could see why he had an excellent staff,he was humble,charming,kind and polite. lf you haven't been to this restaturant, i think you would be missing out on the best of chicagos finest. Le colonial is far superior both in service as well as their menu than most restaurants in the gold coast area.l am definitely going back to celebrate my wedding anniversary this year.
