So the first think you need to know about 90 Miles is a little Chicago geography. Clybourn ends at Belmont, so if you are taking the Belmont #77 bus, get off at Western! Otherwise you miss it, as I have done. I have been once and I got a Cuban sandwich and two empinadas, the chorizo and a goat cheese one. I thought the empinada was to die for. I loved the goat cheese one! It had a wonderful flaky crust and creamy inside. Yum! The chorizo one was very interesting. It had a strong smokey taste, but I liked it in the end. I only wondered if they were made fresh or frozen? Hmmm ...frozen is a no-no. The cuban sandwich was HUGE! It was the classic cuban and nothing extraordinary about it. I once had a cuban with mayo on it (i know i know), but it worked. I sort of wished this one had some mayo on it. It was toasty and warm and everything you want in a pressed sandwich. The prices were fair ..sandwich was around $6 and empinadas were $2 each. Good prices in a down economy (I tend to blame the economy for everything because it is trendy...so in reality it is a good price regardless!) Whats nice is that they have their own parking lot and some limited seating inside. ...When I go back next time I would get one of their Cuban meals. Those look delish!
