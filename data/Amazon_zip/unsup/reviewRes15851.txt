This place was good really good! I had the RAVIOLI DI ARAGOSTA - Tri colored pasta squares filled with lobster and ricotta in a creamy garlic sauce w/ sundried tomatoes, asparagus and mushrooms! Totally licked my fingers! It is a nice size portion for two very filling. I don't recommend ordering their crab, it is not their specialty. Their gnocchi gargonzola is delicious-very rich flavor and a pretty big portion. Tiramisu is good but nothing outstanding, maybe if they put a little more rum I would totally become a fan. This is a nice place for a date, dimmed lights, nice Italian music in the background, sometimes and piano player is around, and of course exceptional customer service. Parking, not so bad-street parking but if you do go too late say after 9pm, you will not find parking my dear. I am a fan of this place just disappointed in the tiramisu...other than that it was delicious. Love the atmosphere, very romantic. There is a bar so this is not only for couples, caters to both. Will be going there again.
