I would always walk by this place going to and leaving the gym (Bally's) on Diversey/Clark. Every time walking by it, it seems to be crowded. Then, just last week, my friend invited me to eat dinner there as she was in the area. Unfortunately, I was not available. However, leaving the gym yesterday, I decided to give it a try. I had the 5 piece chicken wings with a Sassy Sauce. Very good and very large wings. In addition to that, I also had the Vegas Vegetarian burrito. Tasty!!!! My partner had the Chi-town Chicken bowl. He enjoyed it as well. The total came to $21. Great deal for all of the food you get served.  The service was good, the place was very clean, and you cannot beat the location and the prices. Cannot believe it has taken me so long to get to this place. Will definitely go back!!!!
