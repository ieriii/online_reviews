It's a fun, wacky restaurant. Decor reminds me of the set of (the 1st) Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Asian nachos (despite how wrong the name sounds were actually decent). The fruit smoothies, while nothing earth shattering, were also ok. Salad was ok as well. In other words, everything about this experience was A-OK.
