Had a lovely time at Carnivale last night for restaurant week; however, the loveliness was attributed to the company and dcor - not the food. We walked in on Fat Tuesday and it was definitely all abuzz with scantily clad women, circus-like performers, and people on stilts. The place is enormous and classic Jerry Kleiner. We were seated upstairs (sadly not by the balcony), and we greeted by two waiters who were fine. It felt like they did their jobs because they had to and were getting paid, and not because they enjoyed it. We immediately ordered drinks (getting drinks at the bar took forever), which were average (despite its drink reputation). We tried the coconut mojito (the winner), juniper blossom, blood orange margarita, and a mojito with cava. For food, we all did the restaurant week menu and were quite disappointed. The arugula salad was overdressed with a sparing amount of the promised goat cheese (that being said, the candied pepitas were tasty), the vegetable paella was bland (where was the saffron?), overdone (no crispiness anywhere), and had a small amount of vegetables. It was more like a bad fried rice. Then, the worst dish of the night - the cookie sandwich. When the dishes were brought to our table, the ice cream was already melted, the cookies were hard and stale, and just generally the flavors did not work. So although I had a great time catching up with my girlfriends, I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to Carnivale.
