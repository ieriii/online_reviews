This review is written for its lunch. The service at Sunda was very attentive. We had a couple of rolls and some fried rice. It was prepared perfectly.  We also treated ourselves to the molten lava cake. It completely hit my sweet spot. We got there early for lunch so there was absolutely no wait.  I can't speak to the scene, as we arrived early. I would imagine that my experience would have been different had I arrived at dinner time to a crowded restaurant. As it turned out, I enjoyed my experience and never once felt rushed.
