What a great meal. The NY strip is the best, and I can't tell you how good the mashed potatoes were. So tasty!! Our waiter Eoghan was great, and really gave us top quality service. Definitely the best steaks around. My only complaint, and the reason I'm not giving it five stars is because when we first arrived, we were brought upstairs to our table. On our way up I was thinking 'ooo upstairs table, it must be nice up there.' but unfortunately I was wrong. We were brought to a room with no decoration, no atmosphere, simply a bunch of two-seater tables in a small blah room with chairs that looked like they belonged in a banquet hall. It was not the atmosphere you would look for when you know you are going to pay $40 for your steak and it annoyed me, especially considering I had reservations. Maybe i'm a snob, but I in places like that I expect everything to be stellar. BUT! I immediately asked for a table downstairs, and the obliged with no problems at all (and it was very busy), so it ended up being totally fine! So, to make a long story short, if you get seated up there, just ask to be moved!
