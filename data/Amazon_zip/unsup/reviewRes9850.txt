Friday lunch at 12:30pm. Had a reservation and was seated right away at a lovely table outside. My friend and I were waited on with the utmost of high quality service. Cocktails, Mojitos, were amazing-we could have drank 8 of them, but restrained. We ordered two salads and a regular size pasta portion to share. The Panzanella salad was UH-MAZING! and we also had the peach salad which was good. The pasta was the black spaghetti which was unique but extremely tasty. All in all, a great lazy late afternoon lunch. We were left to talk and enjoy the beautiful outdoo patio as long as we desired. But, it got a little humid, so we paid our bill and moved to the bar inside for drinks and dessert. The bar tender suggested a nice drink he concocted that day and it was excellent and refreshing, perfect for a warm summer day. We enjoyed dessert (which I cannot remember, maybe the cocktails?) and enjoyed great conversation at the bar as well as with the friendly but non-intrusive bartender. I left thinking when was I going to plan my evening dinner here as this place needs to be experienced again.
