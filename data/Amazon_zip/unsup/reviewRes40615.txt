I really like the pho broth here. It has a very rich meat flavor and well balanced spices. The tendon was meltingly tender and the tripe was clean and crisp. We also got the simmered pork in a clay pot. When it came out I was a little surprised that the pork in the dish was bacon. I expected pork belly but the smokey bacon combined with the salty caramelized sauce made the whole dish a bit too salty and rich for me. At least it was served with sour cabbage and pickled mustard green to offset the richness of the pork and sauce. The prices were a little higher than I expected but I feel that the food was well worth it. The seating in the restaurant is mostly large tables so you may end up sharing a big table with other diners. They were really busy when we arrived but we were still seated within 10 minutes. It is BYOB and if I weren't a bit hung over today I might have taken advantage of it. Maybe next time...
