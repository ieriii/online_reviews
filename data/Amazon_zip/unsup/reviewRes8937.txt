Excellent food at a decent price, with a nice ambiance. The place: It is pretty easy to find street parking nearby, and I was seated immediately upon arrival. The tablecloths coverings are now fresh white paper, and the mosaic in the back is of amazing detail. There is even a relaxing wall fountain on the way to the restrooms - which are as spotless as the whole place. Service was friendly and prompt. The food: Simply delicious. Among three people, we tried a wide range of the menu, and were all satisfied. They serve a lot more than kababs; a true stand-out is the zuchini, sliced thin and grilled. Even the rice is outstanding and well presented. But the best part is when you get the check - I happily paid for a party of three, with wine.
