You would not think this place would be veggie friendly but the staff is very aware of what is in its foods. I frequently order the avocado burrito suizo, with verde sauce instead of red.  The avocado burrito is stuffed so heavily with avocados, it would make any avocado lover cry with delight. They are always busy, and sometimes it gets a little slow on service, but worth trip for food. Just leave your expectations of super fast service at home. :)
