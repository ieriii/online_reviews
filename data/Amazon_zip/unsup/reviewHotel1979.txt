I was here for a wedding over the weekend and could not be more impressed. The lobby is stunning, the hotel has free internet (which is rare for nice hotels), the pool is to die for and the food I got from room service was great and timely - even at all hours of the night. The event space where the wedding took place was stunning and the rate we got for the group, $190, is pretty much unheard of in the area. I would definitely stay here again for special occasions.
