I don't know why this place isn't more crowded for their brunch buffet. It's $10 and it's really good. It's really meat heavy...a low carb lover's dream come true. I'm not a flan girl, but I really liked it. I've never come for dinner, only the bruch buffet, but it's a really good option and never a wait. It's open till 3 for the buffet on Sat. and Sun. I came one time and only had sangria and it was good. IMO, one of the bests in the city. I think they have half price pitchers one night.
