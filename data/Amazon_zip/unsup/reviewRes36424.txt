I like this place a lot. I held a party here with some friends and they were able to accommodate us very well. There were 10 of us and the only problem occurred when a friend who isn't good with "ethnic" food ordered a tuna dish and was surprised when it came raw. I just laughed at her. The waitress was very attentive and asked what the problem was with her meal... I was proud of the waitress for not laughing at her like I did. They were even kind enough to take that off the bill. The rest of us all loved what we ordered and agreed we'd definitely be back again. The prices were also very reasonable.
