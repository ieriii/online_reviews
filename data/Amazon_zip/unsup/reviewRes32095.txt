First let me say it's beautiful inside. Normally the decor exceeds the food expectations and this is not the case. This place is stunning and so is the grub! I am a sea bass lover and when I say it literally melted in my mouth...oh gosh..I am thinking about it now. It came with a cauliflower mash that was outstanding, I could barely tell it was cauliflower. This place has the best sea bass EVER. I have eaten at many restaurants in many different places and none of them compare to this rich buttery lemon flare Sunda provides. Please go here and try the food. Simply amazing! We didn't have a reservation and I thought it would be a problem as it gets pretty crowed, not to the point of overwhelming but this is pretty popular, and they still seated us when we walked in. Toward the end of our evening we decided to order dessert. We shared the "ridiculous" which I cannot rave about enough! If you go to Sunda you MUST try this dessert. Overall, Sunda did not disappoint and I will return the next time I am in Chicago. Thank you for making our last night in town a pleasurable one!!
