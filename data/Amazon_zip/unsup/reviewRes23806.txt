Flavor-full food, BYOB, and Costa Rican vibe - what else can you ask for out of a place! Love the location, not in the midst of all the action on Milwaukee - but definitely an easy-to-get-to place. There is a phenomenal corner store with an extensive wine selection and a small assortment of beer (they do have Costa Rican beer though - Imperial). Food was delicious - the real plantains that aren't sweet and made from the green plantains - which are DELICIOUS and how they serve them in the Dominican too. The grilled steak with the black beans/rice combo was delicious - along with the empanadas.  In all honesty though, I wasn't UBER impressed with the empanadas, but that would NOT stop me from visiting again and just trying another flavor. Definitely must go at least once to experience the great vibe and if its a nice night, patio preferred.
