Once you step into the restaurant, you will wonder if you were in Chicago. The decor was arranged so beautifully, I felt like I was in southeast Asia. Bamboo wood, Palm Trees, the whole nine. The atmosphere is best described as mellow... low lighting and giving you an almost romantic feel. The food itself isn't true Vietnamese, but more of a French fusion. I ordered the Goi Cuon *shrimp spring rolls*. Perfectly made.. The rice wrap is soft with the vermicelli made fresh. The dipping sauce was excellent. Not too much peanut, but complimented the shrimp inside the spring roll. The Goi Bo *beef salad* was elegantly made. The beef was so tender. I could taste the lemon grass and the vinaigrette that they added soaking inside the beef.  For my meal I had the Ca Nuaong * salmon*.. A bit plain.. no taste to it, but the lime garlic sauce that was spread on the vermicelli made up for it. This place is a must go if you are in the gold coast area for lunch. Don't be fooled by the name... it's not french, but a fusion of asian cuisine. And also get the Vietnamese Coffee... it's too good to pass up.
