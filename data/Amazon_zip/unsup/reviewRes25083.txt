1/2 price wine bottles on Mondays? Fantastic! And how can you go wrong with melted cheese for din-din? I really liked the service, from the friendly and welcoming bartender to our patient and knowledgeable server. Loved the atmosphere, which is dark and loungy.  They serve a lot of food, so come hungry. The salad wasnt anything to write home about, but I appreciated the attempt at healthiness. The shrimp, chicken and beef were plentiful, as well as the eight or so dipping sauces that came with. We couldnt manage to finish the fruit, cake and chocolate dessert, which saddened me. But we got a really good meal. Best of all, I got to use my OpenTable coupon, which paid for one of the bottles of wine and essentially meant we drank for free!
