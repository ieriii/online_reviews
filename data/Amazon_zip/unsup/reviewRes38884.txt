Check Please adherant that I am, I thought this place looked great on TV. In person it's even better. Sooooooo old school Chicago. Sooooo classic Italian in its decor, soooo far from the average Northside gentrified neighborhood restaurant experience- the smells of garlicy sauce greets you athe door as your eyes adjust to the glow of christmas lights reflecting off of woody booths with fake leather seats. Ronnie and Gina and their boys were eating next to us with their grandma with the mile high white hair. Real Chicago toughies were chowing down in a group after a hard day of construction and cutting in front of me at the salad bar. Herds of respectable big girls were going in and out of the baby/wedding shower extravaganza going on next door in the banquet hall. The service was solid, my water glass was never less than a quarter empty. The food was not what I expected because the flavors were not surprising i.e its not gourmeted up or fusioned or authentic Marcella Hazan style Italian. It's grade A classic American Italian, and if that's what you're after you won't be disappointed. We got a ton for the money, but it wasn't a superb ton. (As noted elswhere the salad bar was like an experiment in showing how many different ingredients can be prepared to be equally flavorless. However they had creamy garlic dressing - can I get an Amen? I can never find that delicious mayonaisey goodness anywhere in this high falootin town.) Our entrees were a different story. My veal parmesagne was perfectly prepared with a crispness to the breading I envied, and my partner's lasagna was something to write home about . You'll enjoy it depending on how spoiled you are in your normal Italian eating, but that classic Klassy ambiance of a family run restaurant is even more delicious.
