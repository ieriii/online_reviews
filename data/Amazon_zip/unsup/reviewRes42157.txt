Love, love, love. I came in this past Friday night to meet for a spur of the moment, light dinner. Unfortunately, we came in at 9 and the place was so packed they did not have any space to seat us - I'd definitely go with reservations for the dinner on the weekend. Luckily, were able to snag a few seats after hanging by the bar for a bit. I tried the tenderloin steak tartare and the fries with the aioli. The tartare was a standout - as good as all the previous reviews. I loved the fries as well, partly because the aioli it came with.  Atmosphere is beautiful with the vintage light bulbs, although it was so dark it was a bit of a struggle to read the menu. I think Gilt has five star potential, but I have to say that the bar was understaffed and it took forever to order anything. Ok for us, since we were in a lingering mood, but it was to the point the bartenders were struggling to keep up and their frustration came out a bit at the wait staff.  Can't wait to come back and try some more of their dishes.
