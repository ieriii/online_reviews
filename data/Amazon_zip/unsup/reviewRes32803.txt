Went to Demera on a Groupon with a group of friends. The waitstaff was very attentive and helpful. The food was delicious and I loved that they gave you plenty of bread and some tastes on the side of things you didn't order, but could try. My only argument is price. We had the groupon, but otherwise, the prices were kind of high.
