My first visit to Meli brought forth promises of a quick return. Outstanding. They understand how to build flavors - my Gouda Omlette (oven baked and done so with cage-free eggs) was bacon, avocado, gouda and tomato - wow. The smoothie was all all really great foods delicious. Beautiful place too. I can't even think of a restaurant in Chicago that stacks up for breakfast.
