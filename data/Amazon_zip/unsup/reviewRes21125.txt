I cannot believe that I have never reviewed this place yet! I will try to keep it short and sweet... This is my go-to Mexican Restaurant. I have had a variety of dishes here, and each has been great. The margaritas are so delicious, and they are half-price on Tuesday and Thursday! Also, the servers and busboys are super nice and friendly.  If you are looking to get good service, a margarita and some awesome enchiladas, check Mayan Palcae out. You won't be sorry!
