3.5 stars dear gougeres, I love you! MmM I'm a sucker for these cheesy little bread puffs that came with honey and TRUFFLE oil. So good. A lot of the wineries in France have these to serve with their wine tastings. So I was really excited to see it on the menu! They came out toasty and soft on the inside. Love it. Also tried the Italian cheese plate which was a great variety of 4 different cheeses with a spectrum of flavor- recommend! I was less impressed with the wine flights unfortunately :( None of the choices of my wine flight were particularly stellar individually. But rather it seemed like they all had like a particular overpowering flavor that distinguished them. I had this particular wine that was like described as "peppery" and it straight up tasted like pepper. I enjoyed trying the different kinds of wine though, and it was great that they give you the paper description when serving you. We also had the olives which were like 1. super hard to even shovel onto your plate (awkward.) and 2. way overpowered with anise The ambiance is bustling- lots of dates or girls night out type people. The only complaint is that the tables are kinda uncomfortably close to each other. I would definitely go back to try some of the other flights.
