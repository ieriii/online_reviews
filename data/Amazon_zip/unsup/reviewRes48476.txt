As a New Yorker visiting Chicago I went to The Publican as a suggestion from a friend. I am so happy we went because I have a reason to now come and visit again. The hostess was very sweet and escorted us to a table by the bar to have a beer while our table was getting ready. The beer menu was great and very different. When we sat we had a great waiter who really knew his stuff. We went for the mussels and halibut appetizer. We had the beets as a side dish and the ribs!!! OMG they were amazing. We finished things off with the waffle. I loved every dish and can't wait to come back. I also want to add that I loved the decor of the place. I really think I found my new favorite restaurant.
