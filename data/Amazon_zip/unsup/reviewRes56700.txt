We stopped in here this past week....1. Staff isn't friendly, nor do they seem to try to fake it.2. Saw the owner(Pics in ads),,nice guy it seems, didn't   stop by to say hello,,but thats ok.3. Food..Okay,, just overpriced, portions good, but   nothing I haven't eating a million times before.4. Decor..forgettable5. Service...Thats why they get a 1...   Just bad...screwed up 1 of our entrees, and both drinks.   Next time, repeat back the order to the customer..Just too many places that we can to a get a similar meal, cheaper, andbetter service..Will not be back....
