Must say, I was not impressed by the actual hot dog.The menu is awesome and ever changing. The service is great. The owner dude is extremely friendly and personal with you. But the hot dogs were just not that impressive. There are many places out there that will taste EXACTLY the same. Also, they only take cash!
