I'm going to bump them up a star after giving the pizza a second chance. My best gal and I were craving deep-dish and for some reason my memory of the aesthetic here called me like a siren. It just seemed like the right kind of place from which to escape the summer Sunday heat. Maybe because of the semi-darkness and blue light? Anyway, I still think that the pizza is strangely bland, but I tracked the problem to the sauce, so it makes more sense to me now. It just needs more seasoning, I think. Otherwise the pizza is pretty great, especially the crust, which manages to be crispy on the bottom and edges but bready in the middle. The pizza reheats really well in a conventional oven, which is a rarity. We had an egregiously sullen (and often absentee) waitress. However, they seemed to do a shift change while we were there, and all of the evening people seemed pleasant enough. So maybe we just got a bad apple. Oh, and the upstairs men's room has a four-foot Gandalf head painted on the wall. You don't see that every day...or actually, ever.
