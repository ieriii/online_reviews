Wait times: Monday late afternoon = 30min wait; Saturday afternoon = 2hr wait. The wait times are a harsh reality, so make the most of it and come with some buddies. With all the exposure it's gotten, this place has become a food destination for locals and out of towners alike, so it's kinda like the popular ride at an amusement park. The duck sausage and foie gras one is insanely good. At first bite, you're shocked that something this good is eaten hot dog style. The rich duck sausage, creamy foie gras, and earthy truffle aioli make each $2 bite worthwhile. How awesome would it be to be next door neighbors with this place, just sayin`. Five stars for affordable gourmet despite hourly wait times and big ups to Doug for working the register.
