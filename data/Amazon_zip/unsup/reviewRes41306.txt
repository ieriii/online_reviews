My rating is actually 3.75, and here's why.  After seeing RC's ranked by every airline magazine to be the best steakhouse in Chicago, my man and i went for a very special occasion to check it out, and had to average our varying experiences: 5 star: I got the $40 prix fixe with the crab and corn chowder, 6 oz filet and shrimp, and chocolate cake. The chowder was savory and peppery. My filet and shrimp were excellent, succulent, and hot.  3 star: My man got the $50 with lobster bisque, ribeye, and key lime pie. He burned his tongue on the steak, and as a true steak lover, he was underwhelmed by the ribeye, and preferred Kinzie Chophouse. The key lime pie was yummy, and yellow (as a proper key lime pie should be).  5 star: The service was excellent, considerate, and friendly. We asked for a few accommodations, and I truly appreciated their efforts to make our night special.  2 star: The ambiance was charming yet casual, but here's my gripe: how is it that RC attracts the most obnoxious, foul-mouthed, drunken people on a Saturday night? These were the conversations we overheard from 3 different tables: "Do you want some f-ing bacon on your potato?" "My wife was easy when I first met her..." "I give blow jobs for free!" (this was shouted just as the music faded, and the "f-ing bacon" table next to them started cheering). I felt like we spent hundreds just to dine at a Cubs game. What the heck?
