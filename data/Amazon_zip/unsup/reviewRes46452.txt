Delicious food and a lovely interior with a relaxing atmosphere. The staff is knowledgeable and competent. The menu is huge so it has something for everyone. It's not too pricey at all and the food is absolutely awesome for the price. If something doesn't exactly look perfect on the menu, the staff is knowledgeable to know their sauces and you can order it as a modification. Definitely a place to check out.
