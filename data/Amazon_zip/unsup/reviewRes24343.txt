Came here one hot summer night for an anniversary dinner. We got some fantastic sangria-love that they offer several unique kinds. The small plates are super small and pretty pricey, but we really enjoyed what we ordered. The dessert was out of this world, house-made lemon cheesecake with blueberry ice cream. Service was friendly and attentive and the restaurant has great ambiance.
