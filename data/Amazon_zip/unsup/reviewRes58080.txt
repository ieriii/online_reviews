11/23/2011. I am compelled to leave this review because I have been a customer to this establishment and I even invited my colleagues to sample some sze chuan cuisine which he liked very much but the service was so horrendous, discourteous and lousy. Even after reminded the staff that we have completed one dish without the rice; the second dish did not come out until 20 to 25 minutes later after a few reminders to the staff. The second dish came about 40 minutes from the first dish; so you can imagine our disappointment. The rice only came when we were about half way through the second dish. What upsets us was that the staff does not even show any urgency or apologize for the service. As for one that would normally not leave a tip; we are leaving this review to the owner as our tip. I will no longer invite or recommend any of my friends or colleagues to your establishment to be disappointed with such horrible service.
