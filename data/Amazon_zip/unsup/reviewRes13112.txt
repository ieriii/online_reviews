WOW! Can you say BRAVO and ENCORE!!! Texas de Brazil is a true dining experience...Filled with Variety, Flavor, and Richness! Every BITE excites the taste buds to no END! The Service was impeccable! They remembered the cuts of meat we liked and served PERFECTION with each and every slice! Every time we would leave our seat, we would come back with our napkins folded and table rearranged to perfection. We loved the Fried Bananas that came to the table and must have had 5 servings! They even told us how we can make them! LOVE THAT! There is not one complaint that we can say! Moments like this, we just wish we could EAT, and EAT, and EAT!
