This place is an amazing and well deserving of their Michelin star. I've had the great pleasure of experiencing their eats, whiskey, and being able to stay in one of their guest rooms. The staff has always been nice and very accomodating. First off their dinner menu is tasty, the Artisanal Cheese Selection, Fruit Mostarda, and Crostini have never let me down and is always a great selection. Their Slagel Family Farms Burger is tasty, although I feel as if there were way too many fries on my plate. If your looking for one of their more pricier plates I'd have to recommend the Pan Roasted Wild Alaskan Coho Salmon. Their brunch is always super delicious, from the PBR breakfast, to the special and the coffee has never let me down. The room me and my guy had was comfy, cozy, and had a simple luxury to it. They warn you ahead of time that they are a very hands-off sort of place (no concierge/room service available), and they also warn you about the noise (the rooms are located above the bar and busy avenue) and other things ahead of time. I appreciated the forewarning, but I found that their style of doing things was a lot simpler and straightforward than most places and was something that I liked.  Over all the eat, sleep, & whiskey is amazing and everyone should give this place a chance.
