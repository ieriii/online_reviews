This W staff here is 100x more approachable and friendlier than the W on Lakeshore. The lounge/lobby is beautiful and inviting. Concierge very helpful and accessible. Even though the rooms were small, the bed and shower were very comfortable and made our hotel stay very enjoyable. The fitness center is very well maintained, they provide water, towels, cold wet towels, apples, headphones, aerobic machines with tvs on them, free weights, mats to stretch. I would highly recommend checking it out. The individual rooms did not have their own coffee pots, but they provide complimentary coffee til 10am every morning in the lobby. Yes the walls are very thin but I've noticed this in most hotels (i.e. The James, and the W on Lakeshore). I would recommend rooms far from the elevators. I would have preferred to stay at a more prime location, but its very close to the mag mile and millenium park.
