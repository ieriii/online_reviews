I feel like I was missing something here. I ordered the forest burger which had high reviews from fellow yelpers and thought the gorgonzola was way too overwhelming. I like to taste my meat and all I tasted was cheese. My pal got the pulled pork sandwich which was good. It's aiming for fancier bar food and ingredient wise it seemed to apply but it just didn't taste that great. The beers however were great.
