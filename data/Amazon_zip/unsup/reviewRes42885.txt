As a southsider I wouldn't pass up Giordano's, Uno's or Beggars to go here but it was good pizza. We got the stuffed cheese. Everything was hot and fresh. I've seen quite a few magazines and blogs rave over this pizza so the wife and I tried it. What we got was really good again, but nothing to write home to mom about.
