How to make four dinners without cooking? Order one large deep-dish pizza with extra pizza sauce. Choose whatever fillings you'd like, they're all good. Then, get full after once slice each. Freeze remaining pieces, two to a ziploc. Nights later, when you don't want to cook, preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Insert two frozen pieces on a cookie sheet. Heat for 20 minutes. Be impressed at how crispy the crust remains, how warm and gooey the cheese is, and be grateful you got the extra sauce so that the pizza doesn't dry out. I love this place!
