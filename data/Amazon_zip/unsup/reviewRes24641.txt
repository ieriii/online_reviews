Howwww have I not reviewed this place yet?!? I'll get to the point, since I'm sure others have said it all: - GREAT veggie burritos and tacos. Half a burrito or two tacos are more than enough food for one person. I always ask for my hot peppers on the side, though, as they can overpower the taste of the whole thing. I'm usually a huge fan of hot peppers, but theirs are different than what I'm used to. They're kinda growing on me, though. - The oatmeal shakes are a must in the summer. A must. I like mine just plain, but the oatmeal-banana one is also great. My boyfriend had a non-oatmeal mango smoothie once that was also really good. They are HUGE (if you get them in the take out container) and very filling (duh, it's oatmeal) so I would reccomend splitting one with another person. - I was kinda drunk when I had my first actual dinner here (love that no corking fee), but I do remember being astounded by how much colorful, flavorful food was piled onto my plate. I loved the cabbage salad that the tilapia tacos came with. It was a little tart and super refreshing. I'd always get it as a side if I could! *hint hint, guys?* - Very attentive, hospitable and unpretentious wait staff that makes you feel like your business is truly appreciated. I come here alot. I always leave happy. Also, despite the fact that the wait can be long, they have a HUGE bench out front that you can hang out and pregame on while waiting to be seated. This only applies to the warmer months, though, so go on weekdays when you can.
