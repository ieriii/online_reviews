Who has two thumbs and love Las Tablas? (Pointing at self with both thumbs) THIS GAL!!!! Let me set the stage: Valentine's Day 2012. We made reservations and the only time that they could fit us in is at 6PM. My boyfriend decided to meet me there. As I was driving in traffic on LSD, I was thinking that i really hope that I will like this place or else it will set the whole night off wrong. Located in the Lakeview area, it was a breeze to get to. I arrived a touch early and checked in for my reservation. I went to go use my washroom and it was a bit of a journey to get to. I was seated early and waited for my man to meet me. The place was dimly lit, candles on the table, light music playing in the background. There is plenty of seating available and a dance floor installed but there was no dancing on the night that I went. It would be cool to see some dancing one day. (note to self: go back to Las Tablas when they have dancing) We ordered the empandas to start and I got a Mojito. The mojitos was made fresh and made me feel REfreshed. The Empanadas came out and we had the chicken, cheese, and beef ones. All of them were spectacular! The salad in the middle of the empanada was "eh". I could have gone without it or they could have replaced it with a dipping sauce, something other than that salad. We ordered our entrees and had our cocktails in the meantime. The food came out on wooden planks with a metal plate on them, how cool! I ordered the steak and pork combo. My BF had the Churrasco. Wows. The steak was seasoned just right and my pork was cooked perfectly. Pork can be over cooked and they did it just right. My BF loved his entree just as much as I did. The service was great and it was an amazing start to our very first Valentine's Day.
