went to tru for vday this year using a LEY gift certificate and had a wonderful experience. the service was great and perfectly timed. every one of the 9 courses was excellent. some were more playful than others but nothing was pretentious or unnecessary. they handled the vegetable dishes really well too. all of them really brought out the flavors of each ingredient. it was a great amount of food. everything was well executed. i really loved it and so did my vegetarian husband. i would also highly recommend the wine pairing... they choose really interesting wines that you'd never know to try on your own and all of them brought something new to each course. the strange thing is that after going there for dessert only before, i thought dessert would be my favorite part of the meal this time. but everything else was so good, that i can hardly remember what it was. favorite courses: white sturgeon "caviar" with avocado and hazelnut crackers, potato gnocchi with white veal glaze and fragile lace tuile
