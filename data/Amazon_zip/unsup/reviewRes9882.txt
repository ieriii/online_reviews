Serving two masters quite successfully, this place has been pleasing conoisseurs of both pizza and beer since 2001. In my most recent visit, I concentrated on the latter, though I have pleasant memories of the former from visits over the last couple of years, I tried four of the rotating items which were new to me: Victoria: an English-style pale ale (not IPA), dead-on to style. (And, of course, nothing to do with the flabby, hop-deficient Mexican lager of the same name.) A Lil' Strange: An unfiltered Belgian strong ale, at about 8% ABV; floral/fruity hop nose, a bit tart, with some clove and pepper notes. Top Heavy Hefeweizen: Very much in the Bavarian manner, with strong clove and banana notes. The Weight: Odd name, great hyper-hopped version of a pilsner; I'd guess that it's up about 80 IBU. Why, you ask, did I have to "guess" at the IBU? It's an odd story. Apparently, according to one of the bartenders, the brewer is a bit secretive in sharing technical information with staff. Hey, we geeks like to kinow that sort of thing. Good public transit access, one block from the Damen station on the Blue Line. For pub crawlers, about 5/8 of a mile from the Map Room, and within two miles of Quenchers, Revolution, Moonshine, Local Option, and Goose Island Clybourn
