The location is super, just a quick walk to Millenium Park and a few blocks to an El that brought us right back to Oak Park for $2.25 each. We had scored a great deal on an Orbitz-type site so we decided to take a mini-trip with two kids (ages 10,12) to The Palmer House. Everyone here mentioned the "wow" factor of the lobby, which was lovely. But, the room, the view and the bathrooms were surprisingly ho-hum. Our 10th floor room overlooked a fire escape and the metal sides and roof of the pool. We couldn't see the street at all. The bathroom-aside from a posh sink-was similar to my grandma's. (No offense, grandma) Very old-school 1950's with old tile that needed a good scrubbing, old tub, very small. The indoor pool is small but it has a deep end that went to 8 feet and a hot tub, which the kids loved. We basically had it to ourselves at 5 pm, but by 9:00 in the morning it was near capacity. The only other thing we didn't like was the maid knocking on our door at 8:00 a.m. to ask if we were leaving yet. We said, "No, check out isn't until noon so we planned to stay until then." And she said, "No, check-out is at 10:30. 11:00 at the latest." We called the desk who said that it was actually noon.
