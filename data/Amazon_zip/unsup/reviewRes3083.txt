I freaking love fried chicken. Like I could eat fried chicken for breakfast, brunch, lunch, linner, dinner, and dessert. When I heard this place had epic fried chicken, and that it was KOREAN style fried chicken, I obviously had to check it out. Crisp....you did not disappoint. This $#*&% was bomb. We got the Seoul Sassy and the classic BBQ style chicken and it was insanely good. The Seoul had the perfect mix of sweet and ginger spices and the BBQ was sweet and smoky perfection. Basically, the chicken was cooked like a G6. If you like fried chicken or if you like food in general, try this freaking place. Boom!
