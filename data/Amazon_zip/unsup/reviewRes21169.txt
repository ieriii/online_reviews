What great dawgs they have! I love their grilled cheese too. Their shakes are thick and delicious. I also love the friendly car-hop service. This is a place I have been going to since I was a child, and it has had the same quality food my whole life. It's not the cheapest fare, however, what great food is cheap?? Superdawg is a Chicago icon, and thus, worth a visit.
