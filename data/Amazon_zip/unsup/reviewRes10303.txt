If you like thin crust pizza, this is the place to be. There are some interesting topping options available, like mash potatoes + bacon! It's worth trying, for sure. It's open kinda late, a good amount of TV's, full bar, friendly staff, and in a great location. I'm also impressed with their branding. Their logo is simple, but reminds me of a peace sign. Clever.
