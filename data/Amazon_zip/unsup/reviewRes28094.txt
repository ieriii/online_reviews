My meal at Frontera was definitely one of my favorites since I've lived in Chicago. My husband and I dined here last week to commemorate 2 years of living in Chicago. We had always heard good things and had been wanting to try it forever. We arrived at 5:30p and were told it would be an hour and half wait (?!!) We were prepared for this and since that would put us in at 7pm, headed to the bar to grab one of their mouth watering margaritas.  We both loved the Blue Agave. 45 minutes later (about half the quoted wait time) our buzzer went off and we were seated at a table.  We ordered a starter of chips and salsa. The salsas were definitely some of the best I've had and the chips were perfect! It tasted like they were flavored with a hint of lime or citrus. For our main courses hubby had a steak dish and I had the seasonal fish with rice and covered in garden salsa. and OMG was that AMAZING! The fish was perfectly grilled, the salsa was both light and flavorful, even the rice and beans were seasoned to perfection. I can't picture a more perfectly balanced, high class mexican meal. This meal makes up for the lack of good, cheap tacquerias in the city. (yes lots of cheap ones, many mediocre, hardly any good) But I won't get started on that.... Rick Bayless - you're my hero.
