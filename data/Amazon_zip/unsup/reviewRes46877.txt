If I'm ever in one of my in-between moods where I don't necessarily want to commute from Evanston to the city, but don't want to stay in Evanston, I go to Uncommon Ground. There's a lot that I like about it - their menu is extensive and has lots of more creative dishes; they have great martinis with infused vodkas, and they always have a great musician playing in the back - I've listened to two great artists here while eating dinner. It's nice to hang out in the bar area, with lounge seating and a fireplace. Also a good place to have dinner. I've always had good service - never been disappointed.
