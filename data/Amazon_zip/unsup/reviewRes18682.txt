This place is so darling that I often do not even notice how sub-par my pasta selection is. The staff is warm and helpful, the decor bright and uplifting but tame and intimate. I have been here a few times and must admit that I have some bad luck choosing a dish. The first time I went with the Risotto con Porcini, quite literally, it tasted like a salt lick. The manager was very apologetic and tried the dish himself and assured me it was very off that night. After the ptsd has subsided, I may give it another shot. The last time I went I tried a beef tenderloin dish and though it was good I was not totally wowed by it, if you are looking for something more home-style this will be a good bet, but I like to take risks myself. Here is what I discovered, my boyfriend always, without fail, orders the Paperdelle con Porcini and it really, truly is heaven on earth. Their anti pastas are wonderful (the mozzarella is fresh and delicious) and their ravioli specials look very interesting. Though I have not had the best of luck, I would highly recommend this place for the following reasons; A) The Paperdelle B) Its A-freaking-dorable C) BYOB and D) In Ravenswood (which speaks for itself). Just don't be afraid to protest if you aren't finding your meal to meet your expectations, they are very eager to please and willing to accommodate.
