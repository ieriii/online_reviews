Perhaps my favorite takeout\delivery in the neighborhood, and definitely my GFs. I have had so many different things from this place and they have always been affordable and delicious. They don't take Credit so bring cash! (They also have an ATM in the store if you forget like I do every time). The staff is always nice and they answer my questions. They have plenty of seating inside if you dine in. I have never actually eaten from the buffet, but it looks great. The only reason I am rating this as 4 instead of 5 is that the Hummus is always a little bland and the lentil soup could use a little more flavor.
