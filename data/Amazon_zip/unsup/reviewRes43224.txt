This place is great! I came here on a Friday night. It was busy, so lucky we had a reservation. My friend and I went a little early, had a glass of wine at the bar. Lots of specialty drinks and good wines by the glass. The food was soooo good, too! I've never had rabbit before and it was delicious. The place was really inviting, we hung around for a while and closed the place. Never felt rushed or pressured to leave. Great service!
