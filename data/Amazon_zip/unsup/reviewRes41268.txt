Okay, I am confused. Based on the photo, this is the restaurant I just went to. But the business card I took says Restaurant Tank. Not Pho Xe Tank Restaurant. AND the card says 4953-55 N. Broadway Street, not the Argyle address...PHO should not be this complicated!!! Anyways, I'm sure this is the place so lets get cracking! First, excellent location. A few steps away from the Red line Argyle stop. Second, excellent service. Third, the people here speak English! I'm not too used to this since in San Francisco not many of the servers did.... The pho and the papaya salad were delicious! It reminded me of back home (SF). In addition, their bathrooms were clean. Now that says A LOT when it comes to asian restaurants. You can pretty much guess how clean your food is based on how clean the bathrooms are. To prove this theory, I have not gotten a stomach ache yet and it has been almost 3 hours since I had my meal. ( I have a very sensitive stomach). YAY!
