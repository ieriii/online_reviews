Tapas. They were good. Nothing that made me say WOW! I would have given a 4 star because the staff was efficient and the food a touch above average but... $300 for two people. We did the tasting menu and three drinks (total not each). If I am going to pay $300 for a dinner it should really wow me. I don't just want a series of plates dropped in front of me of less that exciting composition. For $300 I want it to be spectacular. Go if you have to see it. Be excited if you have never had tapas but don't expect something special if you are familiar with this type of dinner.
