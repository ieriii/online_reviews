After trying unsuccessfully to make a reservation, we showed up 10 minutes after opening time on a Tuesday night. We were virtually ignored by the front desk, except for being told it was a three-hour wait. While standing around trying to decide where else to go, the manager told us he'd had a cancellation and we got a table. The margaritas are excellent, and the cranberry-sour cream ice cream was really good, but that's about it. We ordered the mixed appetizer platter for the table, and found the "quesadillas" to be unrecognizable puffed dough things with a little cheese in the middle. The rest of the apps were good, not great. We had children with us, and asked our waiter if they could make a plain bean burrito. We were told "we don't have burritos". Ok, but you have beans and you have tortillas, so do you need me to show how to turn those into a burrito? For the prices we paid, I would have expected a little more accommodating attitude. Two of us ordered the chicken mole poblano enchiladas. When they came, they had clearly been sitting under the heat lamp way too long. My friend's was cold, and mine was lukewarm, with tough tortillas and solidified beans. None of the other diners were particularly blown away by the food either. I'd say go for the margaritas, but be prepared to wait hours. I was really looking forward to eating here, but I won't go again.
