Yummy Yummy pasta in my tummy. And bruschetta. and some bread dosed in garlic and oil and cheese. In reverse order. I was here on Friday with a large group and have frequently heard rave reviews from my sister about this pace. I had the paperdelle con porchini, and i totally agree with everyone else here. So very tasty. Mushroom goodness. Amazing. Our waiter was a funny guy too. Don't remember what his name was, but funny. Fun atmosphere, great food, fun times.
