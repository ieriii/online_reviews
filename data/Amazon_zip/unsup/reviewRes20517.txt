I probably can't add much more than is already here in these 600 reviews (!), but I can say that the food was incredibly tasty, but I can't say that I'll be back anytime soon. Why? The whole set-up of the order-taking/seat-finding process is incredibly time-consuming, opaque, and frustrating. We came in the off-hours (2:30 pm on a weekday) because we've heard it's a huge headache to come at peak lunch hours. There was hardly a line but it was still a huge headache. It took forever to even take your order and then there was nowhere to sit except for outside in the 90+ degree heat. Sometimes long waits and tricky seating can be one of those things that you just deal with since the food is worth the frustration. While the food was very good here, I don't think the chaos of their system is worth it. So, please, try to streamline your process. It can't be THAT hard when you're Rick Bayliss.
