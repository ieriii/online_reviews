This is part 1 of my tentatively titled two-part series, "Mediocre Duck Tales" (haha, lol, rofl, steamlollers) I had high hopes for this joint and I'd been wanting to try it for awhile. Sadly, it was just ok. We went on a busy Friday night and had to wait for a table. No biggie, we'll saddle up to the bar. Guess what? The bartender makes some strong drinks, heavy on the alcohol. Just the way it should be. Now onto the meal. I went with the duck (blackened duck to be exact), and it was mediocre. It was served over a portobello mushroom sauce, but for a dish that should've been bursting with flavor it was somewhat lacking. The jalapeno mashed potatoes had a great spice to it, and that amplified the lack of taste in the duck. This issue, however, did not prevent me from polishing off the entire plate.  We started with the grilled calamari for our app and it was the highlight. Served with roasted red pepper sauce and goat cheese, it was superb. I wish they'd make a bigger plate of this for us savages! It was loud. Not to the point of screaming, but definitely loud. I will visit again and try other things on the menu, as they looked very promising. In the end, you dashed my hopes for duck success, Cafe 28. Launchpad McQuack is off to his next duck destination for part 2...
