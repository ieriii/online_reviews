Update-I wanted to let the readers know, that I received a sincere apology from the waitress and the manager regarding the incident. This is greatly appreciated. Sometimes its not what you have done, but how you react to it... and Hopleaf has acted with extreme class. Mistakes do happen, and I am willing to give Hopleaf another try.
