I had booked a hotel on Priceline for the Cardinals/Cubs series and managed to get the Hotel Felix, while I wasnt looking forward to my stay based on the reviews on Tripadvisor I have to admit I was impressed. While many of the reviewers on TripAdvisor were right, yes the rooms are on the small side, however the bathroom was large but lacking much counterspace. The staff was extremely courteous and the hotel offers free wi-fi, which is usually unheard of at a hotel like this. The location isnt the best, its a safe area however you are a few blocks away from Michigan Ave, so if you are expecting to be in the middle of the shopping district you may want to reconsider. However the hotel is only about 3-4 blocks to the Red Line, and about the same distance to Michgan Ave so it is a fairly quick walk.
