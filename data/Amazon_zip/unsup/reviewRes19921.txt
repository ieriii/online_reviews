I don't really get the hype that surrounds this place. Yes, it is tasty and fresh. Yes, it comes out pretty. Yes, it's BYOB - with a corkage fee. But the service is slow and you always have to wait so be sure to make a reservation. Normally a wait on any given day would strike me as a good thing, but I honestly think it's just b/c they are slow. I dunno... Don't get me wrong, it's def good, but if I remember correctly, it's on the pricier side. I have been here multiple times, especially for bday celebrations so I guess that would make it a sorta "special occasion spot"?  Well, whatever the case, it's good stuff - it just doesn't necessarily pop into mind when I'm needin my sushi fix. With that said, I'd prob be back for another occasion should someone decide to have it there.
