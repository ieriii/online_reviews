Simply great pizza, lots of variety, and the bst chicken(grilled too) that I have ever eaten in my life!!! Place is small, normally do take out, but sometimes I stop and eat-in and watch a game there. This is one of those family businesses that ill be talking about to "my kids" when I'm older. Awesome..Awesome..
