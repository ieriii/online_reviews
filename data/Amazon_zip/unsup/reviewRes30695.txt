Love this place. Reservations were fairly difficult to secure, they were packed everyday. The music was great, it catered to all tastes. I'm not really a steak person so I ordered scallops as my entree, it's not on the menu as an entree, but they were more than happy to oblige. My boyfriend did the same only with crab cakes, these were real crab cakes with no breading, just lump crab. Everything was sooooo good. But pricey as hell! Since my scallops were a pumped up appetizer they charged us $6 for each additional scallop. The sides? They don't play fair with sides, the sides are so good. The gnocchi with lobster, the huge baked potato, mac and cheese, the asparagus, everything was above standard. The breads are also very good and fresh baked. Also this place is dark as hell, so dark that the waiters walk around with flashlights LOL stupidest thing I've ever seen. Why not just turn the lights up rather than having the staff walk around with those awkward little flashlights? The food and atmosphere definitely justify the price, it was worth every penny. Ready to go back as soon as possible.
