This place is amazing. My husband and I are very picky when it comes to Pho . This place is it! Good idea having both names in English and Vietnamese. So easy to remember - Tank Noodles. Reasons why this half Vietnamese chick says it was delicious: - Nice meaty dark rich aromatic broth! The broth wasn't too oily and you can smell the cinnamon and star anise. And no taste of bouillon! Perfect balance for both the olfactory and gustatory!  - Great quality of meat and plenty of it! Most places use cheap cuts but Tank Noodles meats were like thinly sliced steak! It adds more flavor to the broth. - Noodles, were nice and firm - not at all too salty or mushy. - Condiment plate has a variety of fresh herb garnishes and LIMES! I hate it when some places give you lemons and only two sprigs of herbs with lots of bean sprouts. There you have it! Go there! Oh yeah the MENU IS HUGE! Don't waste your calories on mushy noodles or bouillon based broth at other places. Tank Noodles was fresh and you can smell it before you walk in.
