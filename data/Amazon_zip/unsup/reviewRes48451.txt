I thought I knew enough about beer, but scanning their beer list was quite humbling. Took me about 20 minutes and a few Google searches on my iPhone to pick out my first drink. But really, it's more fun to go to a place where you don't recognize a good 2/3 of the beer list. Also worth noting that while there isn't really anything vegan-friendly on the menu (the delicious frites are fried in a beef fat/vegetable oil combo), the server offered to us a special sharing platter of assorted veggies tailored to dietary restrictions. Roasted plantains, spring onions and fancy mushrooms, among other things. Nice!
