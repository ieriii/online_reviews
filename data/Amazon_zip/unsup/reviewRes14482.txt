went here today with my sisters and we left very happy! the people working there were very friendly and helpful. the young lady recommended my sister a sandwich and it was delicious!!! i ordered a cuban sandwich and we all shared fries which was also very yummy. also the young man working there was very sweet and attentive. he offered us an ice coffee that he happened to have extra of and was nice enough to split it an extra cups for us! so we all agreed that we were completely satisfied with our experience :)
