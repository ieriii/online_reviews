First, you have to wonder why there are no other 1-star reviews for Piccolo Sogno on Yelp. I wonder if they were removed because the restaurant is an advertiser, as seems to be the common way of doing business for Yelp. Anyway, on to the review. I went to Piccolo Sogno for restaurant week and the quality of the service was SO POOR that I have no choice but to give it 1-star. Despite reservations made 2 months in advance, we had to wait 45 minutes for a seat. The hostess was unapologetic and simply encouraged us to wait at the bar. She could have at least offered us a free drink. After finally being seated, we were presented with the regular menu, not the restaurant week menu. When we asked about see the special discounted menu the waiter acted like he was surprised. When the food did arrive, the busboys had no idea whose dish was whose. The service can just be summed up as mass-confusion with an attitude. While the food was quite good, the inexperienced wait staff working there ruins the experience.
