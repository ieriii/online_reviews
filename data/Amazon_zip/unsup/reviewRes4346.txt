This place takes you back to the days of Al Capone. It's a great spot if you want to go on a creative date. It's dark and a little divey, but the staff is excellent and the music is the best jazz in the city. They don't serve food, but the Mexican restaurant next door is really good if you need a bite to eat. You better be ready to actually listen to music because the staff will tell you to be quiet if you are disrupting the atmosphere.
