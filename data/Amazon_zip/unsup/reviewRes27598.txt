I'm not a fan of the caramelized (burned and rubbery) cheese on the crust. The sauce was plentiful, without being too acidic and making me regret eating one piece too many. But, overall, the meal was forgettable. I think I'd try every other deep dish place in Chicago before looping back to this one.
