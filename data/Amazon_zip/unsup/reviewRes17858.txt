Are you kidding me? I just got back to my hotel from this place. What a joke. I mean its at the level of pathetic. I am here visiting from LA and I never wait in lines anywhere, not in LA not in Vegas or New York...this place I had to wait. My friend asked me too and I said fine I will wait. We get in and I am shocked at how anti social and pretentious this place is. I was blown away....and not in a good way. The manager was rude telling me everyone waits which isn't true since other people walked in and that this is how it is here. He didnt ever once try to make it right with us. If you go to a club/bar in LA they will make it right. He actually had the nerve to brag that he was Ushers road manager and even he had to wait in line in bars all over Chicago. Hello? What are you doing wrong that you WERE Ushers road manager and now you manage a less than mediocre bar? And that you wait in line if you are a manager? Total idiot. I will NEVER go back here and I will continue to bash it any time I hear someone is either coming here or is from here. Lame puts it mildly.
