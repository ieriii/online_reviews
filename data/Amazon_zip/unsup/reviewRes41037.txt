When I moved to the area, people kept telling me about La Pasadita. The first time I went to try it out, I walked into the first store at 1141 N Ashland and asked for a vegetarian burrito. They instructed me to go across the street. I went to the second location, and ordered the same thing. When I offered to pay with a credit card, they directed me to this third location within a block. This location is still my favorite It has a large dine in section, and obviously it takes credit. I eat here all the time, and everything is always great. The horchatas are huge. This is one of my favorite burrito places in town. They're open late which is awesome, but I will warn you, you'll get a bigger burrito (ie more for your money) if you come in during the day, especially Sunday around lunch. It seems like when they get busy, towards the end of the night, the portions go down. Perhaps it's because they are running out of prepared ingredients, or just so damn busy, but this is worth note.
