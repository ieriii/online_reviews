Gino's East gets one star because they are pretentious and deserve to be taken down a peg or two. There is nothing spectacular about the pizza at Gino's East.  Far better pizza can be found at several other pizza joints, they are however the only pizzeria in Chicago, as far as I am aware, that thinks they are a night club.  Not only do they not take reservations, which is to be expected at a pizza joint, but they won't even be so kind as to take your name down and let you wait by the bar. No the good folks over at Gino's East expect you to wait in a corral outside like cattle, waiting for the privilege of eating their pizza.  This Yelper refuses to degrade himself by waiting in line, especially in the cold, for a mediocre pizza. I'd rather take my business elsewhere and I suggest you do the same. If you head over to Pizza Uno or Due they'll be more than happy to take your order and let you wait by the bar for a seat. Giordano's and Lou Malnati's will also be more than happy to accommodate you, and if you feel like taking a trip out of the loop I would head to Pequod's or Bacino's
