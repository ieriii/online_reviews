If you want fantastic traditional Mexican food at a great price, this is definitely the place to go. If you're in a rush, however, don't try it, because you will wait in line for a while before you even get seated. Also don't go here if you're looking for a really healthy meal, because everything is covered in greasy goodness. 5 stars because it's reliably amazing :)
