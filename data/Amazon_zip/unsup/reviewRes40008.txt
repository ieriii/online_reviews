Not a whole lot of food. Tasted great but didnt fill anyone up at the table. The side dishes were good, we got the marinated beef and marinated beef short ribs. Tasted good, but 1 star for the value, 4/5 for flavor/cut of meat. Which means 1 star overall. If portions were more I would have been content.
