Such a great restaurant in the neighborhood, nothing can beat it, WOOOOW!!! Wonderful pick for families as well as dates looking for a lovely experience. I went on a monday evening with my friend, we were really excited, it has a nice ambiance and decor. We got grilled chicken salad, fried chicken and parmesan fish with rice, nothing went wrong in that, fresh, hot and cooked for perfection,, so scrumptious.
