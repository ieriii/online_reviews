Why do people like this place? Try Pho Xe Lua (for the pho) or New Saigon (for other dishes). Trust me, you'll pay half the price and have twice more flavor. Go eat where all the Viets are, we're hanging out down the street :). And you can stop by and say hi at my real estate office. 1004 W. Argyle. shameless plug. :P
