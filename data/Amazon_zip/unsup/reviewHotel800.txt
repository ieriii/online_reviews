The Westin on Michigan Avenue enjoys one of the prime locations in the city. It is just north of the John Hancock Center, which has a plaza that is the unofficial outdoor porch of the hotel. The rooms are very nice but not top-notch, suffering only in comparison to the competing five-star hotels in the area. The front desk area can be very busy, but the beds are "heavenly".
