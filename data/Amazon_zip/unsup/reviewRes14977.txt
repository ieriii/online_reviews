Great time. Also went with a large group (10 total) and we were quoted 90 minutes, but were seated in about 45. Food was great, beers were fantastic, and we loved the hipster-but-toney vibe. Our server, Nate, was very accommodating and patient with our large and increasingly intoxicated crew. Split a burger, which was delicious and perfectly cooked. LOVED the IPA. The final bill was not out of control, and everyone had a great time. Go check it out!
