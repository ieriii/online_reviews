One of the most affordable and quality Italian restaurants in Chicago. I did not know what to expect, but was a tad underwhelmed when walking in. The tables were practically on top of one another. However, the service and meal outdid itself. The gnocchi were perfect, the tiramisu was classically perfect. I hope to be back!
