I've only had the Farfalle Pollo here so I can't remark about anything besides that, but it's UNBELIEVABLE and it's a great price! The restaurant is very small and not the most comfortable place to sit and eat, but the pasta comes out quick and it's just so incredibly delicious and such a good price that it's more than worth it!
