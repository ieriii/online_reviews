This place is amazing! I fell in love with the ahogada torta and wish I had one right now as I write this. The mushroom torta and Gunthorp chicken were good as well but nothing like the ahogada in my opinion. For dessert, we tried the ice cream...the bits of bacon were so yum...and the iced mint hot chocolate was really refreshing. We came at noon on a Saturday and I believe it was about a half an hour wait in line to order. As I was prepared for this, I wasn't bothered by it.
