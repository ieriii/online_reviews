My boyfriend and I go here pretty regularly since it's within walking distance and the prices are reasonable. The service is always friendly and the place is nice and big with large comfy booths. The reason I only give it 3 stars is because the food is inconsistent. It's almost like they have two chefs, a good one and a bad one, who alternate shifts! The first time I came here I got the tilapia and my little cousin got mac and cheese for her side, and the tilapia had no flavor and the mac and cheese just tasted WEIRD. The second time I came here I went for breakfast and it was DELICIOUS. So so so yummy. A few visits later I got the same omelet I had ordered the first time, but this time it hardly had any flavor! Same goes for their special potatoes, the ones sauteed with onions. Sometimes they are super delicious, and other times they are too greasy with not enough flavor. After the tilapia debacle I decided to give the fish a go again, so I ordered the blackened salmon. IT WAS AMAZING. Oh my god. I have dreams about it. It was just perfect. I could go on with examples, but you get the gist. I would easily give it 5 stars if the food was always amazing and flavorful every single time.
