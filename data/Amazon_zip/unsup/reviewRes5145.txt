I went to The Purple Pig late last Saturday night, well technically it was Sunday morning, and we had a great time there. Our reservations were at midnight because most of us work the late shift at restaurants as cooks,chefs or waitstaff. Midnight worked best for us night-owls. The overall experience was wonderful and I'd definitely come back again. We all ordered drinks and they came out promptly. We drank everything from their sparkling Cava to pints of Reissdorf Klsch beer. Then we started with and shared their antipasti dishes. We enjoyed dishes like the Farro with Roasted Rutebega & Feta, Marinated Olives, Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic and all were succulent and delicious. Second course was the Fried Items and Smears. We had the Winter Squash & Goat Cheese Arancini with Sage Pesto, Prosciutto (fried) Bread Balls and the Pork Liver Pat and Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs which we smeared on crusty crostini. Being late at night we didn't want too much food with our drinks. We had just the right amount and chef Jimmy Bannos Sr. (Chef/Partner at The Purple Pig; Chef/Owner at Heaven On Seven) served us many of our dishes and stuck around chatted with our table. The food was great, servers and chefs were top notch and the overall experience was quite amazing. See you very soon Purple Pig and definitely try the Smears.
