The first time I came here, I paid $47.99 for the whole she-bang, and I'm sad to report that I could barely savor any of the meats since I was so friggin full from that awesome "salad" bar. Money down the drain. ::Drying my eyes:: Lesson learned. This time, I returned wiser. I paid $24.99 for the disguise they call "salad" bar which I like to call my personal Willy Wonka factory. Sure, they offer salad, but so much more -- strips of bacon (real bacon -- no Bacon Bits, friends!), caramelized onions, sushi, supermodel thin strips of proscuitto ham that remind you of Pauly cutting that garlic with a razor in Goodfellas, potato salad, sauteed green beans, pepporoni strips, artichoke hearts, grilled salmon with mustard sauce, grilled provolone cheese triangles......and more. As far as soups, I can't tell you much about the variety except it exists, because lobster bisque is the first one in line and that's what I usually go for. I'm not sure what everyone is talking about as far as chunks of lobster -- I've never encountered this at TdB. The lobster bisque is still good, however, but it doesn't hold a candle to Ditka's. The wine fairy was a nice touch. The service has always been fantastic and unpretentious. Will definitely come here again, and again, and again........
