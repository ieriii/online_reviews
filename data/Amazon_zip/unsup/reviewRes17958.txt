I have found my Italian -go-to finally! Homemade pasta is outstanding. Never realized how much of a difference it makes, but holy canolli, I don't ever want boxed pasta again! To me, it's the pasta that made the experience but there were other rewarding aspects as well. *bruscetta made with the freshest most mouthwatering mozzarella ever *extensive menu with so many specials that sounded delightful and made decision-making challenging *BYOB with no corkage fee *friendly, informative (cute with Italian accent) servers that gave us lots of recommendations (he also was nice enough to explain that the portabello appetizer might not be the best option to split between 3 people) *the bread and olive oil that began the meal was also accompanied by crushed garlic and red pepper *the portions were large enough for all of us to take home leftovers The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was merely because they did not have BYOB advertised outside therefore we had no idea and also I don't think the prices are outrageous by any means, but I personally can't afford a $24 plate of pasta every time I crave Italian. Although, saving money on wine probably evens it out in the end. So let's call this 4.5 stars!
