Had room reservations. Arrived at 11pm to be told that they are oversold and I needed to be put in a room with a pull out bed. NO other rooms in the hotel, I ask. Nope, the reply. As if I had a choice at 11pm after 6hrs of flight tugging 60lbs of luggage. Got to the room, and I use this term loosely. The pull out mattress (use that loosely as well), was about 60 yrs old and 3 inches thick. Would have woke up with wire marks permanently gouged into my back. Called down and asked to be moved to a new hotel... Oh, suddenly the manager found a room with a king bed. Well that's nice. Pretty sure I asked that 30 minutes before. Then was told that I would need to move rooms tomorrow. Going to claim squatters rights. Will give it 2 stars for the nice lady at the front desk who was very apologetic and understanding of my grief.
