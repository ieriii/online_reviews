I stayed at the Chicago Hard Rock Hotel recently when attending IML; the excellent rate I found encouraged me to stay here rather than the host hotel. The decor in the hotel is very modernist with clean, simple lines and lots of photo-art featuring rock stars (David Bowie was above our toilet!). Attractive design, by and large. I stayed with my partner in a King Deluxe room. While not huge, the room was comfortable and the bed made for a restful sleep. My only complaint was that the sheets had an awful lot of starch. I just slept under the very soft down comforter: problem solved. The bathroom was spacious and came with an assortment of Aveda bath products. Mmm...minty. The customer service was really excellent. From check-in to check-out we were made to feel very welcome and comfortable. I had a minor complaint about the squeaky door in the bathroom and they sent a repair man up within ten minutes. The maids were quick and thorough and regularly maintained the room's amenities. While lacking a pool or hot tub, there is a nice gym with cardio equipment and free weights on the lower level. The same area is used for spa treatments offered through the hotel. I definitely plan on staying here again.
