I've tried almost every single torta here and I have to say most of them are pretty darn tasty. My faves are the chicken tinga, the ahogada and the cochinita pibil. Each of these sandwiches have a bit of heat to them, to varying degrees. The cochinita pibil has habenero as a component of the sammy rather than infused in a sauce, so tell your tastebuds to be prepared for a whoopin'!! Definitely get the tortas from the wood burning oven over the griddled tortas as the tortas from the wood burning oven creates bread with a super satisfying crunch. The griddled tortas leaves you with bread that is kinda cracker-like, dry but brittle. I have yet to try the caldos or any dessert other than the churros. These churros are fantastic, they are hot, dipped in a coarse sugar/cinnamon/ vanilla bean mixture and are served with an optional chocolate sauce. Get the chocolate sauce, it's freaking delicious!  I've also tried the hot chocolate and it's decadent and rich but it's too hot in the summer to get this. A definite recommend if the wait isn't too long. I'd have to say the average waiting time is a good 30-40 minutes, but once you pay you get seated fairly quickly and they serve you within a couple minutes. Next time I am definitely getting a caldo!!
