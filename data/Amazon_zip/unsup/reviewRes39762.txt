This place is rad. Take the Publican and mix it with the Empty Bottle - and I think you get the picture of this place. For all those yelpers who go on about how much they hate "hipsters" for their dingy hangouts and apathetic service: Longman & Eagle proudly tells you to eat your heart out. Or, better yet - some Duck Egg w/ Beef Cheek Hash and truffle vinaigrette.
