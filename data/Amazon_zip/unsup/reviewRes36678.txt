They have super sushi and super Thai, and they deliver. Indie is perfect for those nights you don't want to cook but want to eat something relatively healthy. When eating out (say, your TV trays are in the shop) Indie's BYO status means you can have a civilized dinner for a relatively low price. The new dining room is a different but welcome addition to the former shotgun restaurant. My favorites (keep in mind I'm vegetarian) include the sweet potato tempura maki, any of the Thai curries (esp green and signature), inari nigiri, cucumber salad, and the lunch bento special. They're nothing unusual, but they're solid.
