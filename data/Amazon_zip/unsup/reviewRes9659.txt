everything i've had here, i've liked. with one exception...the duck was good, but too much for me after i had dined on apps in the bar area waiting for our table. the atmosphere upstairs transports you to vietnam...(no, i've never been there, but it reminded me of the "movie-vietnam" that i know) with plants all over, dark lighting, cozy seating, bamboo everywhere and asian deco throughout. the upstairs is a great place to grab drinks and some apps and if you can snag a spot outside, it's one of the best spots for people-watching. loved the: Banh Uot, Ca Song, Tom Cuon Ram - and the sides we got were awesome - grilled japanese eggplant and sticky rice.
