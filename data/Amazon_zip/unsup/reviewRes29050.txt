We were lucky enough to get a reservation, so we didnt have to wait at all. Both of us had a drink and both were very good. The guacomole was the best I've ever had. The flautas were incredible. I had some duck thing and it was well prepared and delicious. Yes this place is expensive. Yes, you have to wait. But, its worth it. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is that our server, who was very nice, would ask us a question, and then look away. It was very strange. It was like someone kept calling her name right after she would ask a question. Bizarre.
