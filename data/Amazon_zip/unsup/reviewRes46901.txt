Went there for brunch the other day. Got the breakfast burrito. Have had a better breakfast burrito. Lady got the Montana omelette. Pretty good. Wasn't blown away, but this place has a really great beer selection and makes a solid bloody mary. That, combined with the decor, atmosphere, and a few of the lunch items I've tried before get this place 4 stars. Breakfast/brunch alone get two and a half.
