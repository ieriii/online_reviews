Took my kids, aged 9 and 13, after spending a day at the Zoo. We ordered the Tofu Spring Rolls, Chicken Pho, Lemongrass Chicken, and the Simply It fried rice in the clay pot. Neither of my kids have had Vietnamese before and they both absolutely loved the food here.The staff was attentive and and the complimentary lemonade and fresh fruit dessert are a nice touch as well as being very refreshing on a hot summer day. I really enjoyed their Tofu spring rolls and the Pho. My son loved the Lemongrass Chicken, and my daughter preferred the Fried Rice and the Pho. The Pho wasn't the largest bowl I've ever had for the price but the flavor was excellent and the noodles were perfect. The Lemongrass chicken wasn't quite spicy enough for my sons liking so he spiced it a bit with the spice for the Pho. Giving it 5 Stars on the recommendation of both the kids! :)
