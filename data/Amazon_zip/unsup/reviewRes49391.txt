Nice space and convenient [for me]. I usually visit for lunch, though, when it can be a little quiet and I'm less likely to partake in the bin36 wine festival. Maybe it's a function of my choices, but lunch food seems okay/average - nothing to knock my socks off. I will say that the service is good, though - pleasant and attentive without being over the top. I'll have to come for dinner and update my review once I've had the chance to have the more complete bin36 experience. @@@@@ For more of my reviews, see http://travelcasserole.b
