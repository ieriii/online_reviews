If I lived in Chicago, this would be my spot (more so on a week day). I do happen to have an obsession with Al Capone, so being that this is his old stomping ground adds value. Perhaps it's a tourist trap, but I usually pick up on that right away and stay clear. The place does get packed. I thought the crowd was cool and laid back. The place is full of charm, large green leather booths, amazing woodwork and great music.
