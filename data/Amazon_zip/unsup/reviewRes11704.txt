Piece has some pretty tasty thin crust pizza. Its a little on the expensive side though. They have some really good microbrews too. The worryin Ale is one of my favorites. You can also pick up a growler of the stuff for about $15. Also they've got Karaoke on Thursdays, its a pretty fun time - if you like that kind of thing.
