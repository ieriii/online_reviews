My boyfriend and I live right down the street from Nuevo Leon, and we try to go there as much as we can. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. We always end up getting chilequiles. The red sauce or the verde sauce is the best! The ice tea is so good especially when your mouth is getting hot. Their enchiladas are amaz, too! I also love the fact that they are BYO. We sometimes bring a bottle of rose to drink with our delic meal.
