Bar was packed, but drinks were excellent. Table service was outstanding, honest, and real. Food was delicious. It was loud and busy, but the Chef's tasting dishes were well paced and we left stuffed - which isn't always the case with Tapas Bars. Excellent party atmosphere and feel free to dress to impress or not. It's a good sized room with a little bit of everything going on.
