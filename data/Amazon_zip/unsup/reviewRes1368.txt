Love, love, love. Worth the wait, but definitely try to get there around opening if at all possible. You see the line stretching on forever and yet once you get inside you seem to always be able to get a seat. Owner is the nicest guy around, duck fat fries made my life better, and dogs were phenomenal. Everyone should try Doug's foie gras dog before they die. Tube-shaped heaven in your mouth. *ahem* Seriously, beyond amazing.
