I have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse so I wasn't sure what to expect, it's overwhelming but awesome! The salad bar selection is tremendous and definitely offers you a little bit of everything! There is also a large variety of meat, the only downfall was we didn't know all the different kinds of meat and we were just guessing as they walked by and some walked by so fast we didn't even have a chance to see what it was :( Luckily, we had a great waiter who gave us recommendations and made sure certain meats were brought to us. He was very helpful and definitely navigated us through the experience. If you go, make sure to ask to try the house specialties, both drink and meat, you won't be disappointed! Also if you are a dessert person, try the banana foster pie. I am not a pie person but this dessert was unbelievably good. I actually went back there just to get a piece of the pie to-go! :)TIP: It's pricey, but you can look online for special deals and/or signup for their emails - they will send you a buy 1, get 1 free dinner on birthday and anniversary!
