We went to dine at Wishbone this past weekend, and It was my first time there and I liked it. There menu is mainly fish and seafood items but there was a nice NY Strip Steak and dinner that I decided to go for it was $14.95 and included two side dishes of my choice. I chose to have mashpopatoes and Hoppin Jack which is this side of black eye peas with brown rice green onions and cheese, it was very tasty and I really enjoyed the meal. I would recommend it anyone looking for a good meal for under $20.00. The waiter was very friendly and I didn't have any complaints about the service or the food.
