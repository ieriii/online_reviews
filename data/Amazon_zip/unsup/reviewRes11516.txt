Given the hundreds of reviews for this place, I'll keep mine relatively short and sweet (pun intended). The food here is fantastic. I am more of a savory person but had read reviews prior to going and was quite intrigued by all the sweets worshippers touting the specialty pancakes. So what did I do - I ordered both! I got the spinach, feta, and red pepper eggs benedict dish - amazingly tasty. And a single (yes, they let you order just 1!) banana crunch pancake. I just wanted a taste of the sweet to see what all the fuss was about, but I ended up devouring both dishes. I just couldn't stop myself. The food was so good that after eating I had to go home and lay on my couch for two hours until my stomach stopped hurting from being so full. But I'll be back, and I'll continue to order more then I should because at the end of the day, its worth every delicous bite.
