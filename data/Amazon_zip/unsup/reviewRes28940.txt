Recently moved back to Chicago from Los Angeles & was craving PIZZA!! Had heard good things from friends so decided to give this place a try! Was not let down;) I ordered a pepperoni, mushroom, & onion pizza with thin braided crust..........DELICIOUS! Staff was friendly with the exception of Ms. Grouchy, the manager. Will definitely order take out next time.
