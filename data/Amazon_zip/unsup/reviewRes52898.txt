Had my friend's birthday dinner party here and it was wonderful. Our party was huge, 24 people to be exact, and there was no degradation in service. In fact, they were probably more accommodating because we had so many people. We brought tons of alcohol with us and they had several ice buckets for our beer, wine, liquor. The food was soooo good and it came out without delay. Teddy, our waiter, did an amazing job juggling all the orders. It's so refreshing going to a restaurant like this in Chicago. The owners are hands on and genuinely want to see you having a great time. The outdoor seating area practically transplants you to another time, another place. Why would not want to support a local business like this?
