Not really that impressed, and not sure why so many people rave about this place: - Huevos Rancheros overdoes it on the picante; making it impossible to enjoy with a runny nose. -The coffee was alright, but nothing to write home about. - Seating arrangements are confusing.  -They take your name only when your full party is there, so you can't actually stand in line to order your food. You just have to kind of stand off to the side and constantly answer "no, we're not in line."  -After you order your food at the counter, you have to stand off to the side (again) and wait for a table to open up.  -When you finally get seated, a waitress brings out your drinks and then your food.  -You can't sit too long after you finish eating because you get constant glares from the waitstaff and people waiting for a table. -Finally, nobody smiles there! Why not make it a sit down place already with a real wait staff? -You could sit down at your leisure rather than wait in line. -Wait staff would make more money off of tips.
