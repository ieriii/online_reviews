Ya gotta love Sultans.Why you ask?Falafel balls. Chicken schwarma. warm pitas and smooth hummus. Cucumber salad I forget the name of but is the perfect cool compliment to the warm spicy chicken. All very affordable. We split the above and it's like $11 total. And the guy at the cash register is just so nice. Gotta love Sultans. And saying falafel balls is fun too.
