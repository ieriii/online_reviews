Parked the car and my experience started.  You can smell the alluring aroma of this restaurant across the street. Like in the cartoons, when the aroma lifts and carries the cartoon character in...its just like that. I was floating towards the restaurant.  On a double date with a fun couple, we decided to attack the menu. We ordered the Grouper Soup, Guava and Cheese, Beef, Goat Cheese and Chorizo empanadas, the Cubano, Bistec and Media Noche sandwiches and Chuletas Frita. We had several rounds of the Passion Iced tea and the staff was happy to serve us our wine (its BYOB).  Each bite of the items mentioned made your mouth water more and more. We came to a point, that even though we were full, we just kept eating because we couldn't stop. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful summer breeze. It was loud (but we didn't mind, we were loud too). The service was a little slow, because it was so busy but it that "hiccup" was made up by a waitress who was so friendly and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. Perfect conditions brewed this awesome experience but the food sealed the deal. I would drive 90 miles to eat here. I would drive 900 miles to eat here....its just that good.
