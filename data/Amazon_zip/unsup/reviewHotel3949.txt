The Congress Plaza was one of the finest hotels in Chicago, about a hundred years ago. It is not far from the Buckingham Fountain, but if you have the money there are plenty of better and newer hotels to stay at. The rooms are adequate, and may be desirable for backpackers who prefer not to stay at the nearby youth hostel. Hotel employees have been on a picket line at the front entrance for over two years, a very sad sight to see.
