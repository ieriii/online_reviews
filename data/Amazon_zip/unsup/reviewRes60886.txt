Wow. First, I can't say enough nice things about the staff. Every single person I had any interaction with at Zed 451 was extremely nice. My wife and I went here for my birthday dinner and we were treated like royalty. Warning: be prepared to eat like there's no tomorrow. I was unable to make it through all 12 courses AFTER going to the extremely posh buffet for charcuterie and appetizers. The poke (pronounced poh-kay) sticks out in my mind as being fantastic. So does the cured duck, apricots in a vanilla cinnamon sauce, and the boursin cheese soup. (the truffle butter and tangerine butter was tasty too)The main course food is served in a Brazilian manner, but that is pretty much all it has to do with Brazil. The menu is eclectic and creative. The in-house cured meats are great. All the sauces were outstanding. The main courses that stick out in my mind were the delicious rump roast and pork belly. Great place for a date as the ambiance is amazing.
