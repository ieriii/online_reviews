I have been looking for good wings in Chicago and kept hearing about this place. So this weekend I finally decided to try it out and all I can say is really, really? I say that because I can't believe how good these wings are and how long it has taken me to try them. Where to start, the sauce is amazing, the wings are gigantic and they are cooked to perfection. I love the fact you can order a full size but go half and half on the sauce. This is perfect for sharing and did I mention these wings are quite large. I guess my only complaint would be the fact the wings are so good I'm not sure I will ever try the other dishes on the menu. lol
