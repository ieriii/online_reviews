Maybe I just don't trust places with flat televisions and sports fans but for a place like this, which has received a lot of hype, I was looking forward to checking it out with a friend. Thanks to my navigation, my friend and I were walking for twenty or thirty minutes in the opposite direction of Revolution Brewing Co. and by the time we decided to consult a map, walked back, finally arriving, we were both starving. The atmosphere quickly reminded me of my distaste for Wrigleyville shit. The place was loud, super loud. My friend and I had a table next to some dude who kept yelling everything he said, dominating his group's conversation, talking about this week's horoscopes. Since I could not hear anything my friend said from across the table, she moved her chair to my side, and most of our meal was spent reluctantly overhearing the obnoxious dude next to us. Sometimes we mocked him, but that didn't make us feel any better. The beer was good, the food was good, but the size of this place lacks comfort and warmth for sure. It is an appropriate place for hanging out with large groups of friends or something, I suppose. A place to go to if you are prepared to yell or if you are in the mood to act silly with little consequences or if you don't give a damn about conversation and you just want to feel buzzed by the tremendous chatter of the space.
