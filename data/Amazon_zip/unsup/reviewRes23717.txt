I'd heard great things about this place, and have some savvy friends who consider it the best spot in Chinatown, but sadly, I was not a fan. The service was ambivalent, and we had to practically beg to get a server to come our table on several occasions. We tried a large amount of dishes, and nothing was that good, and all of it kind of had a 'dirty' taste to it. Maybe worth another shot, but probably not.
