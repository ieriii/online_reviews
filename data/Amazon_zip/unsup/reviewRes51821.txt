I went to Gino's East for a rehearsal dinner for my best friends wedding. The dinner only had about 35 people there and the parents of the bride rented the room on the top floor that had a balcony. I'm not sure why but the staff ay Gino's did not open the balcony for people to go out on. The weather was beautiful and to be honest, the room was rather small for everyone. THey had 5 long tables lined up and you had to crawl over everyone to get to a seat, which was uncomfortable. The food was just Okay. There wasn't anything spectacular about any of the dishes to me. We had our choice of 5 different kinda of pizza, one salad and a few different appetizers: fried calamari, fried cheese sticks, fried cheese sticks with spinach and bread sticks. Everything tasted frozen, except the pizza which was fresh, but a little too sloppy. I would recommend this place ONly if you are visiting Chicago for the first time and want to try a true Chicago style deep dish pizza. The interior is very seedy and just feels grimy.
