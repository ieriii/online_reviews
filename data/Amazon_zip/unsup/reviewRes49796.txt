Bin 36 is just not trying anymore and has become a robotic/tired mess. The service staff were so superficial and my server kept rushing our table with "are you ready to order dinner" after our first flight/cheeses had not even yet arrived. Speaking of tables...what is the cafeteria style, crappy tables and chair space in "restaurant" section all about?  Our flights and cheeses arrived with the incorrect paper descriptors they routinely provide. The flight tasting of wine was basically mediocre at best (we had 3 people in our party and yes, I sipped several to confirm). Cheeses were good, not excellent.  To compliment, I just finally decided to order a nice red after the flight totally disappointed. Finally, yet importantly,the bathroom was filthy. I hope that doesn't translate to the kitchen.  Bin 36 has gone south. "Owner doesn't care" is written all over the place. I won't be back.
