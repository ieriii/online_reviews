When I first moved to the city, I lived right next to Las Tablas, and this was the first resteraunt I went to. I love this place. The empanadas are some of the tastiest in the city. The steaks are great, and cooked to juicy perfection. And the prices are incredibly reasonable and the portions are great. This place is a can't miss in my book. It gets crowded weekend evenings so plan ahead.
