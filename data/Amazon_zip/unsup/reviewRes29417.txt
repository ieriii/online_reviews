My family and I have been going to Opart for 10 years. It's funny to see how as the neighborhood has changed, so has the restaurant. It used to be a hole in the wall, where nobody ever went. Now it's always crowded whenever we go and they expanded/changed the decor. That's not to say that the quality of the food diminished, it is still excellent. I guess I just liked going better while it was relatively undiscovered. Anyways, as a seasoned Opart goer lol, I recommend the Tom Yam Kung, which is like a sour and spicy soup and their green curry. mmmmm. also, their thai iced coffee is so delish Also, I have to be an asshole and say that it bothers me when people eat with chopsticks. Thai cuisine is not eaten with chopsticks, but to each his own.
