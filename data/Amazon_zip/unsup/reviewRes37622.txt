This is NOT the place for mussels in Chicago. Everyone raves about the beers here. That's right. But don't go for the food. We'd asked numerous people about where to get good mussels in Chicago. This "Belgian" restaurant was recommended several times, so we tried it. Mussels should not be served in a tall deep pot. How are you suppose to get to the juice if the mussels are stacked 8 deep? When we asked the waitress, she had no idea what we were talking about, and finally suggested she could bring a bowl for us to drain the juice into!!!  Nothing else was special about the place. It's not bad, just not good if you're going for a meal. To drink Belgian beers - great place.
