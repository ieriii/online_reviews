For anyone who has ever said "i dont like sushi", place your unfortunate judgement to the side and just try sushi x. i have converted 2 sushi haters!! really!! nobody in the city of chicago (from what i know) makes their spicy scallops the way they do. their shrimp tempura roll is AMAZING. you MUST try their honey roll, and their spicy tuna is pretty good too! all in all, this is my favorite sushi dive.  affordable, unbelievably tasty, trendy, open late, and they deliver!! check your pretentions at the door and prepare to have a delicious meal.
