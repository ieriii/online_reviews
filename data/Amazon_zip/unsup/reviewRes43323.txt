I heard so much about this place and never had a chance to try it. Well I stopped in to try some of their pizza. Now I tried the pizza by the slice and it really wasn't that great, good but not the best in the city. Giordano's I think is better and they're maybe the third best pizza in town. I'm gonna try and order a whole pizza next time
