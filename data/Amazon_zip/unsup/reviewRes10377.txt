I loved it here, but I learned a good lesson for next time...get there early on weekends or risk not getting to eat. That's what happened to us. We went on a Saturday night and got there a little before 9:00pm. Our intention was to get a table, order some pizza and watch the karaoke. That's not exactly what happened. When we got there, the place was filled to the brim with people so it was hard to even walk in. I approached the man at the door to put our name down for a table. He was pretty direct when he said "that's not going to happen." At least we knew where we stood, but I thought the delivery could use a bit of tweaking. So we stood around and watched as all the pizzas came out of the kitchen. They looked and smelled amazing. We gathered around the bar, hoping to slide into a sliver of a spot to order but we were told they couldn't serve us food unless we were seated somewhere. So instead we all ordered a round of the in house brewed beer. Each of the four of us had a different one, but I tasted them all and they were absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back now that I know the drill - get there early to order, but I believe it will be worth it since the food looked incredible. In the meantime, the live band karaoke was really entertaining and the beer was worth the trip even if we had to grab a quick slice from the quick service pizza joint next door.
