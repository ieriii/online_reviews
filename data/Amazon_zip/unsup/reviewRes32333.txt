Great spot to grab food before a show at the Riviera theater. The food was really good and flavorful (note: we picked the spicy options). Service was slow, but understandable since it was so busy for a Monday night (and since the waitress was lovely and super nice). Wine and beer were reasonably priced, but not the best we've had (however, maybe we made bad selections). If you have two people, get the messob for ONE - plenty of food!!!
