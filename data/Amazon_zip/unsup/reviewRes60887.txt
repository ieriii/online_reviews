I have been to Zed 451 several times for drinks and the rooftop however this time I was really disappointed and I don't think I would go back or recommend it. I went to dinner with Bachelorette Party (9 girls) and once the server realized that we were not interested in the "Zed Experience" since most didn't want such a large meal, he started treating us so rudely! On top of that we waited over an 1h and 20m for hour food and between that time never came by to check on us on drinks nor update us. We order simple items off the menu like salad and flat breads. When the food finally arrived it was half wrong, some were so cold we had to send them back and he forgot one dish completely. One of the girls got her food after everyone was done. We did speak to a manager during the meal because of how frustrating it was and for the bride to be on her special day and they comped a lot of food however, it was very apparent that he was given a talking to he was even more upset. After the manager spoke to him he became over nice and sarcastic purposely forgetting drinks of some girls on the table and then making comments such as "I'm sorry I must have gotten busy and forgot your drink" showing his frustration and how upset he was. By the time we left it was just over 3 hours later!!!
