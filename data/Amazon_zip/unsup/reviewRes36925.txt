I'm sure most people know by now but if you don't... the expansion has finally happened and it is GLORIOUS!! Space is not Hopleaf's only new frontier, the menu has become vast as well. Don't worry, of course they kept the mussels but I now have a new fav... CB&J -sourdough bread; house-made cashew butter, fig jam & raclette cheese, pan-fried; with stilton macaroni-and-cheese & house-made potato chips... HOLYF*CKSTOCKINGS! I may hold some sort of record for ordering the same thing every time I go. A good shout out to the Duck Reuben which is what every else orders every time. Staff wasn't so bad before but now they are super friendly and quick too.
