Since the hostess & our waitress were incapable of handling the crowd (at least when we were there), we practically had to beg for their attention the entire time. It took awhile to even get our name down for a table. The server was so overwhelmed, she walked away while I was mid-sentence talking to her at one point. When she finally decided to quit chatting and running around empty-handed after we'd waited an hour and a half for our food, we were rewarded with a dried-up room temperature pizza. Because we have eaten there many times before, we know that when more adequate employees are scheduled the dining experience can be amazing. Not this time, though. :/
