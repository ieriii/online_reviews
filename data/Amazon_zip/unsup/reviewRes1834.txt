If you've never been, you need to eat here once. This is not just a "hot dog place" like I've heard many tell me they think it is. Take a chance, and order something unique that you may not eat otherwise as well. Do what I did, bring some friends, each pick a different dog, and then cut them up share the encased gourmet goodness that is Hot Dougs. Beware you'll need to expect to be in line for at least two hours on a weekend. But this has never been hard as everyone in line is super friendly in my experience.
