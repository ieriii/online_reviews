Went here the other night with a couple of friends for an early dinner (6:45). We made a reservation, but when we got there the restaurant was almost empty, so I doubt we would have had to wait, even if we hadn't made one.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly and attentive, and gave us some great suggestions on what to order. The sushi was fantastic, some of the best I've had (in Chicago, at least). The hashimi carpaccio was absolutely FANTASTIC, as were all of the maki rolls we ordered.  Because it's BYOB (and pretty reasonably priced), we all left very satisfied for under 25 bucks. Works for me. However, I would definitely recommend making this an early dinner destination, because by the time we left, it was getting super busy, and I was starting to see where some of the other yelpers were coming from with their complaints about this place. The tables are so close together that when I got up to leave, the guy next to us was treated to my ass in his face. On the house, buddy. Also, the noise factor got to be overwhelming towards the end. And I couldn't help but notice all the people standing around waiting for tables as we were walking out the door. Bottom line: I would definitely come back here, but probably would want to save it for weeknights when I want to eat early... and in relative peace!
