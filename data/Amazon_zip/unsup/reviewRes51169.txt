I was in town with co-workers and we hit Big Jones for dinner. The atmosphere was great and the food was fantastic. I would definitely recommend the barbecue shrimp appetizer...and don't forget to mop up the extra sauce with the homemade bread! I had the Tallgrass Beef Burger, which was thick, juicy, and satisfying. Also, I want to note that the serving staff was helpful in explaining the dishes and very knowledgeable about the ingredients and preparation of the items on the menu.
