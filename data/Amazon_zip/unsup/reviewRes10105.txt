Well, after giving Piece a chance on two different occasions w/in a 30 day timeframe, it's time to move on to.....still searchin' for an out of this world thin, not deep; that is, according "to my taste buds". 1st chance - Hmmm, tasty, A-OK, BUT - the bottom and edge of the pizza was somehwat burnt, cracker-like 2nd chance - Leftover pizza is always better, but, not the leftover pieces from Piece, BLAH this second time around. And I don't partake in microwaved leftover pizza, must be reheated in the oven. 3rd chance - N/A
