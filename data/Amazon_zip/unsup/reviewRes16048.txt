I really appreciated the experience here. I gave it four stars only because I am judging it from the perspective of expecting more privacy. I went there for dinner celebrating my 5-year wedding anniversary so privacy would've been nice, my fault, should've reserved the private rooms. Suggestion fellas, if you plan to take your ladie(s) to such a place on such occasion, make sure you reserve ahead of time and get the private rooms. I heard from the waitress that they are really personal and romantic. Otherwise you will be stuck eating GREAT delicious food while elbowing your neighbor. Nevertheless, I'm a guy I really don't care how or where I eat (depending on the price), but to see my wife smiling like so, it was worth it. Next time I'll reserve for some privacy. Food is good and the place is relaxing. Five stars after the next visit.
