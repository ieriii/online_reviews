This restaurant is excellent. It has a large menu of both Japanese and Thai cuisine. The sushi is quite good and the Thai food is excellent (the Green Curry and Pad Thai are my particular favorites). The price is reasonable and the presentation is beautiful. The lunch Thai and Japanese specials are great. The restaurant is small and can get crowded, so get there early. They also deliver, usually w/in 45 minutes. This place has been a regular haunt since I moved to Edgewater in late 2004. Highly recommended!
