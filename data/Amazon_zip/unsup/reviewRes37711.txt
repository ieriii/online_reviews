Every time I come to this store I ask myself why I don't shop here more often. Their prices are fairly comparable--in some cases, better--than Whole Foods and my local butcher, and the staff really cares about providing good customer service. Plus, you can find pretty much any specialty item you need here ... duckfat, the ingredients for cassoulet, fresh rabbit, live lobster. Fantastic! The expanded hours (6 a.m. to midnight) also really help those of us for whom leisure time is scarce.
