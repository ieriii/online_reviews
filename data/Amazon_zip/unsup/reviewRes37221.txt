I've been to several beer tastings here, including a St. Martin Belgian beer tasting! Awesome beer! And now the St. Martin Brun's on tap. Awesome food as well! Only problem (for the customers) is both the bar and the restaurant get pretty crowded, pretty quickly, but the expansion space they are building out just south of the current site should hopefully help.
