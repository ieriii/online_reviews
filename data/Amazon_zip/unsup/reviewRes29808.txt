This place is amazing. It's a dream come true for a picky vegetarian such as myself. So far I've had the BBQ "Bacon" Cheezeburger and the Country Fried "Steak". My husband has gotten the "Chicken" Italiano and the "Turkey Bacon" Avocado Deli Sandwich (both were limited time "featured items"). All of the above were delicious. The country fried 'steak', especially. I was surprised by what a HUGE portion they give you, and amazed by how good the gravy was. It's so super awesome to find a place that serves veg versions of comfort foods like that. It had to have been at least 12 years since I had eaten any kind of gravy. I was seriously bouncing around in my seat because I was so damn happy. The milkshakes are also amazing. It's truly hard to believe they're dairy-free. I highly recommend the Vanilla Chai milkshake :D My only complaint is that it's a fairly small place, so it gets pretty cramped and noisy. The food is totally worth it, however :D
