Of all the Brazilian steakhouse, Brazzaz is by far the best one. Great selection of steaks, love the salad bar (especially the risotto) and the cheese bread. Service is great and friendly. I haven't had any dessert but the pineapple is ample enough for me. I like that fact that I receive coupons in the mail BOGO for dinner. I will continue to come again.
