Soooo, I stumbled upon this place via yelp, as usual, when I don't know where to go. There was nothing on the menu that I particularly cared for, so my server (Matt), made me something to order off the menu!!! It was de-lish!!!! I don't typically write reviews of anywhere, but this one is definitely worth it. The staff and service were wonderful as well as the food and ambiance of the restaurant. I'll definitely be back!!!!!!! Ask for Matt! :D
