Malnati's Pizza, Vienna Beef hot dogs... to me, Greek Islands is part of the quintessential Chicago experience. Normally I talk about a single amazing experience at a restaurant but at this one there are too many great ones to even recall them all. First thing to note? The free valet parking. Yes, free. Pull up your car, hand the fine man your keys, and enter a world of baby blue and white; stuccoed walls and stone tiled floors; jovial people eating enormous, delicious meals. Any great meal at Greek Islands begins with a basket of Italian and Greek bread (the latter is sprinkled with sesame seeds) doused with their phenomenal olive oil. Follow that with an appetizer of saganaki, that Greek grilling cheese doused with liquor, set on fire, and topped with lemon juice. Tangy, crispy on the inside and melty within, it's the perfect (and theatrical! And impressive!) way to start off an awesome meal at this West Loop classic. Menu highlights include their seafood dishes-- I love the grilled octopus-- and classic Greek specialties. In particular, I adore their rendition of gyros and the moussaka, the Greek nod to eggplant parmesan with layers of roasted eggplant and potatoes sandwiched between subtly spiced ground beef, sweet tomato sauce, salty cheese, and creamy bechemel. Finish your meal with a strong cup of Greek coffee and the Greek Islands Special, a sinfully delicious concoction of phyllo topped with nuts and soaked in honey and rosewater, scredded phyllo, citrusy custard, and whipped cream. Affordable and quick but completely delicious, Greek Islands is an outstanding place for a work lunch, date, or even huge party.
