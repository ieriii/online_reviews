The fun decore couldnt make up for the average food, and the horrible wait we experienced. Had a reservation for 8 people on a Saturday night, arrived about 20 minutes early for a 9:00 res and werent seated until 9:35. After seeing our painfully hungy/angry faces the hostess offered to get a couple of apps started before we sat down free of charge... bought them an extra star.
