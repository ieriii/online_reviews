Hands down this is the ultimate brunch experience!  Saturday and Sunday mornings be prepared to wait about an hour to eat... but you can kill time doing some shopping in the nearby Wicker Park stores. The Lump Crab Benedict is so delicious!  Also, order the Chocolate Tower French Toast with a friend and split the two meals. Perfection!!  I always get a Bloody Mary, which I love, but my friends have enjoyed the different flavored Mimosas as well.
