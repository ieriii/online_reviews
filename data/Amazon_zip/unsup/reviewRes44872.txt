Everyone remembers their first time. No, I'm not referring to your first sexual encounter. I mean, we ALL remember our first sexual encounter - good or bad. Mine was typical, I guess. At the conclusion, she was sobbing uncontrollably, followed by occasional dry-heaves with a frequent, "I can't believe that something could be so small," thrown in. Ahhhh, to be 26 again. Anyway, I was in Chicago in Sept. of '06 visiting some relatives of The Woman That I'm Currently Married To. After a full day of exploring the city and at the same time avoiding getting stabbed in the head with a screwdriver (I don't drink), we were pretty hungry. We came upon this establishment when TWTICMT mentioned to me that I would like it. The place was pretty empty (it was in the late-afternoon during the week) so we were seated immediately. We ordered a stuffed pizza and I was amazed by how HUGE it was. This was actually my first time seeing and eating stuffed pizza. After my first bite, I was hooked - baked crack had finally become a reality. I could not believe how amazing this was (it was sort of like watching a Richard Simmons exercise tape for the first time) but I started to get full fast. We couldn't finish all of it so we took it with us and ate the rest the following day. I'm sure a lot people crap on this place because it's a chain, so I might look around for a good mom-and-pop shop the next time I'm in town. For those of you that are reading this in Chicago, if you ever come out to San Diego, check out a place called Lefty's Pizzeria. It will definitely remind you of home without the 10 feet of snow.
