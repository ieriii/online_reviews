Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Give me garlic, cilantro, and plantains and i am a happy lady. The server Joe is pretty fine to look at too. . Really, theres nothing bad on the menu, but it can be filling and a little heavy. I'm happy they've expanded their patio. I plan to stop by more often this summer! YAY.
