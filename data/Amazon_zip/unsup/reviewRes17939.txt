I told a friend a long time ago this would be my first review. So here it is. I really like the HUGE HUGE fancy cocktail selection. I love going here together with a few girls. It is NOT GOOD for large parties or for people who have friends who aren't always the best at arriving on time. It's dark and extremely difficult to find people inside, so it makes for a terrible meet-up place, but I love all the drinks, the food, and the ambience in general.
