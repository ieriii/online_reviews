Absolutely THE BEST Indian lunch buffet in the city! There are several others that are good, but Indian House remains my undisputed favorite in terms of ambiance, service, quality of food and variety of dishes. There's a little bit of everything offering something for every appetite...soup, samoas, great rice, vegetarian dishes, lamb, chicken, and sometimes a fish dish , and 3 kinds of dessert.  Not to mention lots of glorious TANDORI CHICKEN and NAAN that's served upon arrival. The service is very attentive and spot-ON....and I mean ON! New plate...drink refills...more food...whateva....they GOT YOU! I've been here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. It's perfect for a week day lunch and especially nice for Sunday brunch.   Over the years, India House has become my "go-to" spot for impressing out-of- town visitors with a hankering for Indian delights.  Each and every visit to Chicago, my mom asks to be taken here...and if you knew my Mama, you'd know that keeping her happy is priority #1! Glad to say that at India House, there's absolutely no asking to see "the SUPA-VISOR". Thanks India House!  Overall, the experience is sweeter than the Gulab Jamun that's served for dessert... and that my friends, is pretty darn SWEET!
