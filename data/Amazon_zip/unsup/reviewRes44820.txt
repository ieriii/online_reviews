Hour wait to get in and it was.... well, sort of worth it. I tend to think this place is a bit overrated, and their are other pizza shops with better pies. I was born in Chicago and grew up eating pizza in the Chi. The pie is deep dish and overloaded with cheese in the middle, tomato sauce, and minimal toppings (bummer) on the top of the stuffed pie. Customer service was not good at all. Not once did the waiter checkup on us once the pizza was out. I was without beverage for the 2nd half of my meal... I like to consider Giordanos as a parallel to Jim's Steaks in Philly. You go to Giordanos if you don't know anything about Chicago-style pizza and you are a visiting tourist. But this is a good place for people to get acquainted with deep dish pies (UNOs doesn't count!) in the Windy City.
