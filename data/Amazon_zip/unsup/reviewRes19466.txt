A perfect day downtown. Lunch at The Gage and a viewing of the new Modern Wing at AIC.  I was impressed by The Gage. The service was outstanding. I arrived a bit early and the hostess was very courteous in asking if I would like to be seated or wait for my companion. I opted to go ahead to the table. While waiting, I perused the drink menu. Champagne at lunch on a Monday? Of course, why not? I had the Champagne Charlie which was beautiful and crisp. But, back to the service... Little touches like a napkin placed on the lap by the server, or listening to the server at the next table explain the notes and flavors of different wines, it just makes the experience. I'm thinking a date night is in order, who wants to take me? For a starter we had the Scotch Egg. A hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage and panko, then fried. Amazing. I had a chicken sandwich which was covered in blue cheese, hot sauce and fresh basil. Absolutely decadent.  The decor had me swooning a bit as well. Dark woods, light green tiles and lovely lighting. Again, perfect for a date. Must go back.
