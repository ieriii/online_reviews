There is no doubt about it; they have some excellent cuts of meat here. These tender morsels of juicy meat are delivered right to your plate by gauchos. Filet mignon, top sirloin, and other premium meats- all nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. The problem? If you are as obsessed with meat quality as I am...or maybe if you are not, much of your time at the table is spent figuring out which cuts are good, waiting around for them, and refusing the meats that aren't worth your $50. The "bad" meats are the typical boring fillers - pot roast (given a fancy name), chicken, chicken wrapped in bacon, and some only marginally tasty lamb and pork cuts. Between discerning what you want to eat, there is little room for conversation. There are also lots of non-meat filler items to distract you from chowing on filet mignon. The salad bar was filled with some nice juicy veggies, but nothing special. I found the side dishes, like the popover-like cheesy bread, fried polenta, and mashed potatoes to be only slightly tempting. The bottom line: the good meat is really really good and it's an interesting experience. Just avoid the fillers and don't plan on lots of conversation.
