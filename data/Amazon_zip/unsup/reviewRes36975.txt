This is a fun place to go when you're in the mood for a little Asian fix. The sushi here includes your usuals (the rainbow rolls, dragons, californias, etc.), but also has some more creative rolls - I think we had one with mango that was pretty good. My one complaint about their sushi, was they use BBQ sauce in A LOT of their rolls. In one or two it was a fun touch, but A) it's kinda weird, and B) it got old kinda fast, so beware the BBQ sauce rolls. I really like their pad thai. Their sauce has the right amount of sweet/spicy.
