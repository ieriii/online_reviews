Bin 36 is a destination for wine lovers or even occasional wine drinkers. It's located at the base of Marina City towers, accessible on Dearborn, just north of the river. If you're visiting downtown and want a classy place to have some good wine, this is an excellent choice. I've never eaten dinner here, so don't know about the dinner menu, but the appetizers are good and cheese is excellent. The wine selection is formidable, and you can try the flights, which change occasionally. The cheese selection is extensive and the servers can help you match a variety cheese plate with the wines you are drinking. Our company had a Christmas party here a few years ago, and they arranged a wine tasting and several appetizers for us to try. They were very accommodating and the food was delicious. By the way, I love the bread sticks. You can sit at the cheese bar or the wine bar, upstairs or downstairs. The high ceilings and modern design make it a fun place to sit and sip wine for a while and people watch. They have classes, too, and a small wine shop in front.
