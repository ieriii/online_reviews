i'm a big fan. i live right across the street and have eaten b-fast, lunch, and dinner there. they never seem to disappoint. some key dishes: breakfast - chilaquiles (my husband's favorite place to get them), southwestern eggs benedict, raul's egg blt, and the honey jalapeno pork chops, which are hugenor-ridonkculous. lunch - half sammy (ropa vieja)/half salad (their cobb salad).  dinner - ropa vieja. SO tender. juicy. nothing like old clothes. more like tender, juicy clothing. oh, the plantains. the plantains!!! however, MY FAVORITE THING AT CAFE 28 IS THE BREAD AND BUTTER. the butter is a sweet and spicy mix of awesomeness. like, so damn good. the best part is, it's complimentary. that's right, folks. my 2nd favorite thing are the mojitos and the bartender who makes the mojitos (you know who i'm talking about).  they are SUPER friendly, in the most sincere form. last wk we ate breakfast there and ALL of the staff said hello when we entered and thank you when we left. and not in an annoying sense.
