As one other reviewer noted, the delivery was very quick (so I can't speak to the restaurant experience). The fresh, fresh, fresh vegetable rolls were pretty good. The clay pot chicken was quite good. The chicken was tender (not dry) and flavorful and the dish was not greasy - a big plus for me. The asian vegetables and crispy noodles were not that good - I would avoid it. So...overall ok...I would stick to the menu items that people have recommended on Yelp
