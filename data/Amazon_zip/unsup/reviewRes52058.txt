Eh. This place may be part of the famed Chicago deep dish trade but the pizza is only OK and generally forgettable. The first strike was that the place was plastered in signs for a beer--I think it was Longboard Ale--that they didn't even carry. What the hell? My friend and I selected another brew, ordered the house salad (shouldn't lettuce be green?) and the bacon cheeseburger pizza. It was all marginal at best. Service was generally competent, although on the slow side. Skip it!
