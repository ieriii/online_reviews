I have been here twice. First time: We came here for the peking duck one time last year and it was very tasty. They roll a cart to your table and carve the duck. The skin was very crispy and I was a fan. Second time: We came here for dinner this past weekend. There was quite a line but it moved quickly. We had the baby bok choy tips which were cooked perfectly. We also had the bbq combo rice plate (a little bit of duck and pork). Then we had the shrimp dumpling soup and my husband had the beef tendons. I really enjoyed the baby bok choy and the bbq combo rice plate. This place specializes in bbq so as long as you order something that is bbq related you are set! I did not love the shrimp dumpling soup, but that is my own fault. I should have ordered the shrimp wonton soup probably. Overall, this place is good and you should come here if you are in the mood for bbq. If you are in the mood for just some good Chinese food though, I'd say head to Chinatown and go to Ken Kee!
