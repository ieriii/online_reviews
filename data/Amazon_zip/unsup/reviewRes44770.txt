The Best Stuffed Pizza in Chicago. It just is. Gino's, Uno and Due, Lou Malnati's? Please. You guys "coulda been a contender", but ended up being mere pretenders to the title.  Giordano's wins. Can be slow, of course it takes a long time to bake the deep-dish pizzas, but the service itself is also sometimes slow. Giordano's is a fairly large chain of restaurants with about 40 locations in the greater metropolitan area, and some other places as well.  So it's somewhat formulaic, if you have seen one then basically you have seen them all. However the uniform quality also means that you know in advance that it's going to be really good.
