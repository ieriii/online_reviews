Best. Churro. EVAR! This was my last breakfast in Chicago and it was a real treat. I got here early (7:30 am) expecting a line, as some other reviews said, but I was pleasantly surprised to see only a few other customers inside. (I guess the line is a lunch/dinner thing)  The workers were nice and pointed me in the direction of what was good. I got a Poblano-Scrambled Egg Empanada, a churro, and an Aztec hot chocolate. The cost was a reasonable $7.50 after tax. The Empanada was very good, the taste was subtle and refreshing. They give a chipotle sauce on the side to spice it up if you need that wake up jolt. The hot chocolate was not like your normal swiss miss. I was expecting sweet but it was more like semi-sweet chocolate with a slight spice to it. I found that it balanced well with the super-sweet churro. Oh, that churro. Bayless you've really outdone yourself this time. Pictures do not describe how perfect it was. It was warm, moist and crunchy all at the same time. It has large sugar granules and cinnamon, but what tops it off is the bits of chocolate on it as well. So good. I would come back just to taste churro perfection once again.
