Top notch, very fast and efficient customer service by the whole staff(except for the restaurant). By the time we put the phone down for a request there was a knock at the door accommodating our needs. Staff was very eager to please. The room we had had maintenance problems. Shower adjuster fell off when I tried to turn it for some much needed water pressure. Phones did not work and the bathroom walls were in need of serious cleaning. Enjoyed the stay and felt that our business was appreciated.
