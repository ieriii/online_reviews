Awesome burgers, superb mac and cheese, and great service pretty much sum up my experience at Lockdown. We called about an hour prior to getting there to inquire about how long we should expect to wait because we were a party of six. Immediately, the girl who answered the phone told us that she would hold a table for us. I have never experienced that at a bar and it really set the stage for a great experience. Our server was friendly, efficient, and truly seemed to be passionate about the food. I got the Fat Elvis, a burger topped with bacon, bananas, and peanut butter; it was quite possibly the best burger I have ever eaten. The only complaint I had was the draft beer list. Although I appreciate Schlitz on draft, the rest of the list left a bit to be desired. In short, Lockdown is a fantastic place with wonderful food and fun, friendly service.
