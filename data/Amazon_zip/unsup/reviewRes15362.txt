No suspense necessary with this review, I loved the Violet Hour. By far one of coolest spots to grab a cocktail I have run into in a while. The cocktails were amazing! I have seen a lot of reviews citing the Violet Hour as a "pretentious" and there could be some truth to that but I found the staff to be attentive and highly educated on the cocktails. After I had their Old Fashion, which was easily top 5 Old Fashions I have had lifetime, I asked for a suggestion for my next cocktail and the staff did not steer me wrong. I went a little earlier in the night and did not have a wait, but honestly this place is at the level that I wouldn't mind waiting to get in. If you enjoy artisan cocktails in one of the coolest spots in Chicago, you got to make a visit to the Violet hour.
