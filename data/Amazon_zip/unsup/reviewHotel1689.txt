We loved the Allegro Hotel. The staff was absolutely wonderful, from house keeping, to the front desk staff, the happy hour staff and door service. They took care of us on many levels: took our picture in the LR all dressed up before we headed to a wedding, kindly obliged at the happy hour to pour a glass of wine that they weren't serving and got it from the kitchen for us, happily steamed my suit after having traveled from the west coast with it in my suit case. And if that wasn't enough, it was btw, prior to our visit a couple of days, the hotel guest relations head emailed me a personal note welcoming us and offering up whatever it was that we might want and/or need for our upcoming stay. A very nice touch and great staff at this Kimpton location.
