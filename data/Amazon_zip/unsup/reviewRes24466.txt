This restaurant had me at a Catalan name! When I saw that there had been a Yelp event here I was: 1.  Jealous and mad that I hadn't been included, didn't they know I spent my Jr. year of college in Barcelona?  2. Bound and determined to come here myself! After reading the reviews we decided to make it our second Brunch Adventure Sunday. Our only problem was the parking - there wasn't any signage to indicate that the valet was around the corner at the Blackstone Hotel so we had parked at the Hilton across the street, hoping for validation, alas, there was not. Once we were in the restaurant, we liked the airy look and feel of the place. We had a great table and started with the Roasted Suckling pig buffet, yes and yum! We enjoyed that with cheese plus juice and coffee. We then had the melon and almond first course, both fabulous. The second course of shrimp and eggs was even better - best Eggs Benedict of my life. The third course wasn't my fave but my husband really liked the duck confit croissant french toast and the brussel sprouts. I made up for it by tasting all the sweets on the buffet and the mini dark chocolate tarts were worth the trip alone. Our waiter was very earnest and we liked the laid back vibe. Jody Weis came in and no one bothered him at all. That must be such a relief to him after all the shouting, protesting and picketing he used to get, and that was from the police officers! Everyone was very cool and interested in their own table companions. If Brunch is this fantastic, what must the other meals be like? We shall come and find out.
