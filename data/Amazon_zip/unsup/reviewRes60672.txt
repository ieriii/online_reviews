One of my favorite restaurants because it is so consistently good. Just like the Cheesecake factory, the portions are huge and great for leftovers. I really like the crispy caramel chicken and the buffalo chicken sandwich, and you cannot leave without getting dessert (just get the cookies as soon as you sit down) The breakfast here is OK, but not as good as the lunch and entrees. It does tend to get extremely crowded (particularly with tourists) on the weekends, but they do move people in and out fairly fast, so I have never had a ridiculous wait for a table.
