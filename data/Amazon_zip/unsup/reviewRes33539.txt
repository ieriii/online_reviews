Sultan's is one of my go to places when I am showing friends from out of town the joys of Chicago. When you go with friends don't all get the same thing, experiment and share. As has been said previously the food is very inexpensive but very good. If you are in the mood for something sweet and have a few people to split it with, get their baklava... most of the time I avoid it because it is a little pricey but man is it good! That after a filling falafel and vegetable salad thing that comes on the side makes for a great evening. A word of advice for the guys out there, I find that I even though I leave this place full I inevitably get hungry again before I go to bed so you might want to make sure you have a midnight snack handy back at home. CASH ONLY... they are jerks about it if you forget.
