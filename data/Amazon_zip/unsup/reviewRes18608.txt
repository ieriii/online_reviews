Never had a torta before but daaaaang am I glad to have finally met one! Poor little Pepito is now settled deep within the belly, nice and cozy. My BF and I came here randomly after we got out of class early since we had heard such great things about it. We figured oh, we'll get a quick bite to eat. Apparently half of the Chicago metropolitan area had the same idea, too. The line was kind of daunting... but the turnaround was surprisingly quick! By the time we got through the line and ordered, they had a seat waiting for us in the dining area! As previously mentioned, I got the Pepito torta. Delish. My BF ventured out into the Gunthorp chicken and he would also recommend it. The real prize-winner, though, were the chips and guac! We had ordered chips and salsa but they serendipitously gave us an order of the salsa + guacamole and WOW were we glad for that! It was rich, creamy, avocado heaven. It was so fresh and perfect. I can't recommend it enough!!! Overall, a little pricey for lunchy but perhaps an impressive quick lunch date. I'd go again just for that guacamole....
