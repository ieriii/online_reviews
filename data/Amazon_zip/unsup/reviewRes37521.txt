In the words of Spinal Tap "This one goes to 11" I can't give enough stars to this place. Do you know why its crowded? Because everyone and their mother knows this is the all around best establishment in the entire city. The beer: The most unique menu in the city, maybe in the country in terms of American and Belgian brews. Craft beer standards and rare gems are par for the course here. The food: Flat out f@*#ing amazing. This is listed as my last meal in my Yelp profile. I stand by this and can point to numerous things on the menu I would gladly devour before my death/execution The servers: Awesome folks. They know their stuff and can put up with tight squeezes in the corridors with smiles and quick wit. My dream would be to date a Hopleaf waitress. The people: The NY Times and Lonely Planet recommendations of this place bring in the best kinds of tourist. The neighborhood, food, and atmosphere bring the rest of the great crowd. Considering how packed it gets, everyone is still in a great mood. It has to be the beer, or maybe its the frites. A Chicago life without the Hopleaf is a life incomplete
