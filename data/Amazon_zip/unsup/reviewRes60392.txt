From the the first step in doors, until the last scrumptious bite of gooey mozzarella melts in your mouth, this experience is one to fulfill all of your senses, especially those found on your pallet.Just being in this Establishment makes you feel like you might be a little bit Italian, even if you have no idea what ciao means. The staff is polite and professional. The service is right on. The food is................well, the food is the best part. When I visited Giordano's, I had a purpose. Friends had roared about their Chicago style deep dish pizza. Of course, I had to try it for myself. I had never had deep dish pizza before, so this was a brand new experience. What?! Sauce goes on top of the pizza?Let me tell you, it may take an extra 10 to 15 minutes for the deep dish to arrive, but it is well worth the wait and one that has had me paying $46.00 on line to have one over nighted to my Northern Wisconsin home.I can not wait until my next trip to Chicago. Giordano's is absolutely the best pizza I have ever tasted!
