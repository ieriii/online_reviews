I went to San Soo with a large group of friends. I had a fun time. The food was just OK but the service was beyond awful. I know some Korean places have a reputation for grumpy staff but this lady was a complete bi***. And I have to say, I've been to several other Korean BBQ's and was treated with courtesy and basic manners, etc. so lets just stop excusing rudeness. We ordered several plates of meat, both marinated and not. Beef, pork, chicken. We ordered duplicates of a few items and I didn't like that the kitchen put the duplicates on one plate. It was hard to tell which meat plates were double orders and which were single orders. To do over, I would have ordered one plate of each meat and then asked for another later. I felt like we got a little bit cheated on the portion size. The meat was of good quality and I liked the marinade used on the beef and pork. Side dishes were OK. Nothing exceptional. Waitress never came around so it was hard to get more food. I asked for more kim chee and for a table of 10 she brought out one dish. Gee, thanks. Also, the waitress forgot out soups and rice, didn't turn on the overhead fans until asked about halfway through the meal, never brought the sesame oil for my friend's bim bim bop despite being asked 3 times and proceeded to add gratuity to the tab, which we adjusted to an acceptable amount. Overall, I feel like this place has a better star rating on yelp than it deserves. I think I might have loved it if I showed up at 3am drunk; sober, not so much. FYI, several of the seating areas require that patrons remove their shoes so be prepared. I wore strappy heels with buckles and there is no bench or anything to sit on while removing your shoes. I have no reason to go back to this place. Thumbs down.
