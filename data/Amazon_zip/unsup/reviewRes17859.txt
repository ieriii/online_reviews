Great food, great burgers, great beer list, nice atmosphere, nice outdoor patio on a quiet side street, what's not to like? I've been to Bad Apple a few times and have always left quite pleased. I've had both hamburgers (including the one topped with goat chili - delish!) and vegetarian dishes (including a wrap stuffed with curried cauliflower, lentils, cheese, and other stuff). The food has always been tasty, well portioned, and well cooked. Their focus is on burgers, but they have a number of other sandwiches, salads, and lighter fare as well. They also have a great beer list to select from at reasonable prices. When the weather is nice, enjoy the nice outdoor patio. Having the patio on the side on Cullom St as opposed to out front on Lincoln means that its quieter and you don't have to deal with buses passing right by, idling cars, etc... Overall a great spot for some great tasty and filling food.
