I ate here once when I was in town visiting friends. I had the "when in rome..." omelet, needless to say it was delicious and they omelet itself was huge! The coffee was good and they serve the little packets of international delight creamer which is awesome. The service was good, and I would definitely come here again when I'm in town! It does tend to get packed so expect to wait a minimum of 15-20 minutes before getting seated. Small price to pay for good food! 5 Stars
