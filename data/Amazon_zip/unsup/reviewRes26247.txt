I love pho. I've probably reviewed like 15 pho places because you can't beat the msg goodness that is pho. After trying Pho & I, I was a little disappointed at the pho Lakeview had to offer. I have tried a few places in Argyle which are delightful but are also super far away. I was in the Lincoln Park neighborhood so I tried out Simply It and the place was legit. First of all, they give you extras like a salad, complimentary drink, and watermelon for dessert. I am a sucker for these tiny little perks because they make me feel special. The pho was delicious. I literally slurped up all the soup too, which I don't usually do because of the salt/msg factor but yum! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the soup was steaming hot. Some of the downsides: they don't provide the sriracha sauce at the table and I eat an embarrassing amount of sriracha, the meat is a little on the sparse side. This place is pretty authentic (coming from a chinese chick so maybe not that legitimate of a case) but it's definitely affordable and worth a try!
