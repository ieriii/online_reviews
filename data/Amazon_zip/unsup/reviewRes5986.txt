Okay, I hate to burst the bubble of rave reviews for Davanti, but unfortunately I thought it was just mediocre. The food just didn't wow me, and at the end of the day, I would think a 4.5 star restaurant on Yelp would have wow worthy food. I will first off start with the good: * The dcor rocks. All the details that went into this place really come together beautifully. From the hardwood floors, to the unique lighting, to the interior furniture and to the bar. It's really lovely, cozy and just wonderful. * Great wine list--and the prices per glass are pretty reasonable. The mediocre: * The food was just mediocre. We started off w/a platter of two cheeses and one meat. It was good, but nothing to jump up and down over. We then ordered the linguine w/the sea urchin. It definitely DID NOT live up to the hype of all the Yelpers- unfortunately. I liked the dish, but my date was not a fan of it and thought it was blah. To his credit, I can say there were barely any sea urchins in our dish. We then wanted to get the calamari that I read rave reviews about....but unfortunately they didn't have it on the menu. So our waiter advised us to get the grilled octopus. It was very blah and I only took a few bites of it. The sweet corn salad we got was probably the best thing that we ordered. We finished off the dinner w/some sherbet. That was fine, but again, nothing that was out of the ordinary. The bad: * No valet parking. This is annoying- especially when there is a huge storm brewing! Fortunately, last night I was able to score a spot right in front of the restaurant literally 1 minute before it started to come down like it was Armageddon. * No reservations. I know a lot of restaurants do this, but it's just annoying!
