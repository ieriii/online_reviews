I went to India House on a Saturday afternoon. My best friend and I ate at their buffet. It was absolutely delicious and the staff was very courteous. I honestly don't remember what I had, but I believe it was everything. I do remember having the mango ice cream. I am not a huge ice fan but this was absolutely delicious.
