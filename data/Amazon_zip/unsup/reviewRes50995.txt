I've been to Wishbone several times but most recently met a friend here for a weekday brunch. Their menu is loaded with both traditional and eclectic dishes with a Southern theme. You really can't go wrong with any of their breakfast dishes. My staple is the Denver omelette, which is huge even by my standards. Lots of fresh chunks of ham, diced veggies, fluffy eggs. Combine that with home fries cooked in sweet onions and a corn muffin or toast, I could eat it every day. It gets quite busy, but it's usually worth the wait.
