ok so i've completed the trifecta of heart disease otherwise known as texas de brazil, brazazz, and fogo de chao....and i have to say that getting a 50% discount off dinner is a pretty sweet deal that i got on 2 out of the 3, fogo didn't give me anything and was full price but somehow was the best of the 3 and i love free or highly discounted food. the ambiance at texas de brazil was the best hands down mostly because of the nice contemporary decor and the acrobatic girl in the box and because the service was very good....now on to the meat, which is always the highlight at places like this: overall it was perfectly seasoned, there was nothing that i didn't like when my card was on green and the service was amazing. the gauchos didn't miss a beat and the meat kept coming the whole time. now, on to the bad. i thought the salad bar was a little too gourmet, sometimes you just need some lettuce and some good old sliced veggies to toss on your salad and i felt that's what was lacking. now, i know some people are reading this and are cursing me because this is a meat house but i like salads too. to add insult to injury, the fried bananas and mashed potatoes that they give as sides were pretty mediocre. if i hadn't paid half price i would have been happy with the meat but pretty pissed at the overall meal. i honestly believe that fogo is the superior restaurant but the fact that they don't send coupons will keep me going to TDB.
