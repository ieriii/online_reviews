A solid 4 rating. Wings were great (split an order between the BBQ and the Seoul Sassy). The BBQ had a nice spice to them. Incredibly, the Seoul Sassy were best cold the next day. Bowls were excellent. I would have liked a bit more spice but that may just be solved by asking for more of a kick when ordered. Delivery was a wee bit slow, but they get double points for riding their bike down to Lincoln Park on a cold Friday night. We will be back and highly recommend to others.
