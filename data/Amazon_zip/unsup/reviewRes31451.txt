Inventive Asian cuisine with swanky atmosphere and staff that are really on top of it - it's a winning combination. I checked out Sunda for lunch with some work mates and enjoyed everything we had. I highly recommend eating family style since there are lots of things you'll want to try on the menu and the portions are designed for everyone to have a bite. While I've heard it can be crowded at dinner according to other reviews, at lunch you can get a table, enjoy the same awesome food and relax. That being said, we were on a tight schedule and let our waitress know up front and the kitchen was able to accommodate five-star style. While probably a little pricey for an everyday lunch, it's a perfect spot for a business lunch or special occasion. Definitely will be going back again.
