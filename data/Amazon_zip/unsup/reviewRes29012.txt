As a new Chicago resident I relied on Yelp for my craving for pizza. (I am pregnant) I ordered a pan pizza for pick up. They said it would take 30 min. It was ready when I got there. I live less than a half-mile away and waited about 15 minutes before I left my residence. The pizza was great. I love the sauce, cheese, crust and the pepperoni!! I added jalepenos (to encourage labor :)) and it was delicious! My husband loved it too.  * Next time I think we will stay and eat it there, the atmosphere was good and they weren't very busy (its was mothers day). I cant wait to try the beers on tap!
