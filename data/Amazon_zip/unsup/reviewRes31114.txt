Overall Experience: Went there for dinner on a Saturday night. Made a reservation for 8pm but didn't need it, as the place was not packed at all. This is one of those establishments that seems out of place in terms of location, and thus undiscovered by the masses. We live in the Pilsen area, so going to nice restaurants that serve this type of food is always a trek for us. Luckily we have Nightwood nearby, and Nana is just a short bus ride away (it is right beside a Halsted bus stop - so accessible!). Details aside, dining experience as a whole was wonderful. My boyfriend and I will be definitely be returning - a regular, go-to for good food has been born. Service: Service was decent. The server was slow on wine refills and did not check back to see how the entree was after it was served, but I'm nitpicking, whatever. Food: So good. So, so worth the price. The food is fresh, creative, and perfectly executed. Exactly what you expect and hope to receive from a new American food establishment that is locally sourced. From our appetizer to our dessert and coffee, everything was excellent. Atmosphere/Ambiance: Bright, warm, comfy, spacious about describes it. Exposed kitchen so you can watch the chefs as they work. We were in the front room - there was a back room that we did not see.
