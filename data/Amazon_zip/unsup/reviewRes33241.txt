This is such a good place to eat and party. We've danced through the night and the food is sooo tasty. A bunch of us sat at the bar and ordered dozens of drinks and appetizers. The bartenders are sweet and polite. Its a nice place if you want to eat Romanian food. The managers are very personable and the host and staff are very friendly, presentable, and appreiciative. The romanin sausage is light and milder than italian sausage in salt and flavor. Its texture is tender and soft almost melting in you mouth here. It reminded of when my sisters bf brought over his mothers homemade hungarian sausage steamed so little moist and bland but satiating.
