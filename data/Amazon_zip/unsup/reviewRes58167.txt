This restaurant was awful!!!!!!!! Service was TERRIBLE and RUDE.Food was so so and extremely expensive for what it was.Very noisy and our server was so cold and even nasty to us.Our food was plopped down on the table at various times with no explanations as to what it was. My niece who was the birthday girl fnally got her order when we all had finished!Very disappointed in Mercat.
