Oh my. Gilt is definitely worth the hype. The ambiance here is just like I like my fellas - dark, cool, and sexy. The food is here is just like I like my fellas - rich and sexy. The deserts here are just like I like my fellas - sweet and sexy. The drinks here are just like I like my fellas - strong and sexy. Okay. For serious. Finally got the chance to dine here when my fellas birthday rolled around. We started with the steak tartare. It was deliciously buttery, topped with a slow poached egg yolk. Served with cornichons, a citrus aioli, and toast - it was perfect. Also, our server brought us sriracha - genius! We split the beat salad. A simple salad of beets, mixed greens, hazelnuts, and whipped goat cheese. Perfect. For dinner, I had the truffle pasta. OH. MY. GOD. The pasta is made in house, cooked to al dente, and served in this amazingly rich truffled cream sauce. The fella went with the pork belly. It was like buttah. Finally, desert. The pie was as light as a cloud. Coconut cream pie, topped with mocha whipped cream. It was to die for! This place has date night written all over it. Seriously worth braving the scarce parking sitch that is River North.
