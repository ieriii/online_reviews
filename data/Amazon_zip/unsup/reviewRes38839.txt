This is my regular delivery place, and for me this place is freakishly fast. Maybe I order at odd times or something, but the food's always fast and hot.  The inside of the place is old school, 1970s old school. They have a salad bar, and on weekends a creepy clown guy walks around making balloon animals for the kiddies! So I have 'em deliver. Because the food's awesome. Try the lasagna with meat sauce- this sauce is absolutely the best red sauce I've ever had. It's sweet, it's salty, it's sooo good. Can't get enough. The Pizza is the best I've found to order that will deliver to Portage Park (although Pete's is good too).
