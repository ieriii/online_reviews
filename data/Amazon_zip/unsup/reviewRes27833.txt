the good: food. intensely flavored to the exact point so that it's not overpowering...very creative combinations. I never order caesar salad, but saw a lot of 'raves' about it, so we got it.. turned out to be one of our favorite dishes -- SOOO delicious. It was so visually appealing the table next to us was jealous. regardless of what I'm about to say, I'd go back just because of the food. the bad: it's still too loud in there. I can barely have a conversation. tables are also way too close to each other...I am there to eat with my companion of choice, not strangers. I didn't like the popcorn -- it was stale and very greasy. I wanted to give it another chance (maybe we had a bad batch), so when the waiter offered more popcorn, I said "yes". however, that never came. the drinks (specials) weren't that great, I'd definitely stick to typical favorites (ie. grey goose martini up, or even local beers).
