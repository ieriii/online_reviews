Best deep dish in Chicago, seriously. Everyone always talks about Lou's, Uno, and Giordano's, but Pequod's is the sleeper pizza of the city. I must admit I liked the actual restaurant before it burnt down years ago, but the pizza never skips a beat. Caramelized crust deep dish loaded with fresh sausage, oh yeah. Before the fire, the dining room always had some metal/rock chosen by the bartenders playing. Now they just play boring vanilla classic rock, and there's a mural of some lord of the rings BS is the bathroom. Just miss the old rocker vibe of this place. Aside from that gripe, this place is the best. The owner is always there making sure everybody is happy and it's run like a well oiled machine. Plus they play all the Hawks games during hockey season!
