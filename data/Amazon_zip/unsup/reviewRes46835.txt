I have been an uncommon ground fan since it opened the devon location a while ago. Overall its a great place with true socially responsible values that i respect (even if some of those meant taking some of my favorite dishes like their tuna melt and their original burger off the menu). I have only had a bad experience here once and it was during a transition in the menu when some dishes were still being experimented with. We were glad we could give our opinions :) I had not been to UG in almost a year and in the last month I went twice for lunch. I was really underwhelmed with the food selection and both dishes I had were just "OK" (uncommon huevos and chicken sandwich) they weren't bad by any means but these folks had already got me used to really outstanding food. I am hoping to make it over for a dinner int he winter a I am a big fan of their Gorgonzola squash ravioli and hoping its still on the menu this season. Hopefully they won't disappoint. I would normally give them 3 starts based on my culinary experience of late but their service, adherence to socially responsible principles and their food iN COMPARISON TO what is close by is above average.
