Forget the 70+ calls to get the reservation experience. You walk in, the chef and his crew will take care of you. Nicest, most unpretentious staff I've ever encountered. Food was beautifully presented and frankly, I felt like I took advantage of the restaurant when they serve us a gazillion courses of amazing food for $110pp. Most memorable dishes were the Thai curry soup pudding in a petri dish and the salmon and grapefruit strewn all over my plate with all the condiments. Would definitely go back anytime. Try to get some nice beers ahead of time for the staff as the only liquor store we found there was a Hispanic grocery store. Not good choices.
