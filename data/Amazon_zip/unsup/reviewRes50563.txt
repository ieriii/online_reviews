Of course, if you come here, this is the most important thing for you to know, because I have had some really undelicious stuff here and you have to watch out for that junk, but the very best thing is [ahem]: Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Shrimp grits. Etc. But that is also $8.95 on the breakfast menu which is pretty rough on my budget right now (but if you get the appetizer of the same thing in the evening, it's two dollars less for the exact same thing and amount and is enough for a meal).  Alas, yesterday I went shrimp grittless, but cashed in on Wishbone's awesome early bird special - either pancakes and eggs, or eggs, potatoes/grits(just the regular ones-boo), sausage/bacon and biscuit/toast for $3.69! And their home fries are good. Perfect pricing for taking a teenager out to eat before school to talk about that one cute boy and that one stupid girl and the one thing with the other stuff and colleges and how much that one job makes and ACT vocabulary and butt sizes and all of the other wonders of the universe.
