Now one of my favorite spots for breakfast. My fiancee and I are in the process of getting over quite the bronchitis and fever and we got our taste buds back just in time. I had the blue crab eggs benedict which came with a potato pancake. The benedict was so good, probably the best crab benedict I've ever had. The crab was so tasty. I'm not sure what it was about the potato pancake but it was so creamy and delicious I wanted to slap someone. My fiancee had the chocolate cherry french toast and I gotta say goddamn that was incredible! I was eying the chocolate chip pancakes early on in my menu perusing but decided against it. I'm glad she got this french toast cuz as she put it, it was "the bomb." yes, she brought back "the bomb." And, well, it was warranted. I've been here before for the all you can eat king crab leg dinner which is a great deal and I highly recommend. Fresh fish on the menu every day and hoosier mama pie slices for desert! Don't sleep!
