I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Most recently, I had a great lunch with friends. The food and service were great. Everything we had was amazing, in particular the beets with goat cheese (hate beets usually) and the nutella & banana panini. The specials were top notch. The only downside is that it could be bigger.  The patio adds a lot of extra dining - and waiting space - but it's a nightmare to wait for a table in the winter.  That said, definitely the best place in the neighborhood and one of my favorites in the city.
