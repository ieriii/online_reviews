I don't know what authentic Costa Rican food is but this seems like it might be... I love their potato tacos, which are more like flautas. They are delish but nothing too special, really like mashed potatoes in a corn tortilla then fried to a delish crispiness. I likey. The mole sauce is good stuff. And they serve things with a little cabbage salad and a slice or two of beets. I am so glad you don't see the ubiquitous iceberg nightmare as your side salad.  And their shakes are yum city. I had one that our waitress recommended, it was chocolate with strawberry and soy. We loved it.  The staff and the food are both so special at this place.
