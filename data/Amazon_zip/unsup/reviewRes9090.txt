I'm giving Le Colonial a 4 stars because of the service, quality of the food and overall ambiance. However, this would not be a restaurant I visit again because it is simply overpriced Vietnamese food...ok ok...not quite authentic Vietnamese food as there is a western twist to some of the dishes but none the less, I feel I can have very similar dishes that are just as good if not better, at the fraction of the cost. Yes, the ambiance will not be the same but as a foodie, most of the time i'm looking for great food and great ambiance is just a added bonus. Either way, great food, great service and great ambiance.
