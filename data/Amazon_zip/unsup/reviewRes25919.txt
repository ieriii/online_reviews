We had a reservation for noon on Saturday but didn't need it, as only a few tables were in use. The sangria-of-the-day was terrific, filled with fruit. All four of us opted for the $35 "chef's choice" tapas. If we had been any less gluttonous we could not have finished the dishes; I think a couple onions may have been left on one plate. Nobody left hungry. The food was spectacular. None of us had any complaints, except perhaps for our own lack of self-control. We also went with the "Chef's Luxury Tasting Menu Flight" which included three remarkably tasty glasses of wine. I don't recall the price but might call it steep except for the top-notch quality. Service was friendly and efficient. We had a window table but the rain and fog kept us from enjoying the view of the park, in those few moments when we had emptied the plates and lifted our heads. We probably spent a ridiculous amount of money on lunch but I've spent that much on lunch for two in Paris and left no happier. After writing this I'll start planning my next visit to Chicago...
