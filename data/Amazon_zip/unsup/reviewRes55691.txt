I was so excited to go here all summer. Me and my girlfriend got sat right away which was nice. We ordered drinks and the cargo shrimp appetizer which was delicous but it stopped there. First i had to request a new app. plate TWICE because they were both dirty. I ordered the mahi mahi the sesame sauce had NO FLAVOR , and my fish was extremly over cooked , not to mention the 2 pieces of asparagus were so hard i could have cracked a tooth. I asked my girlfriend how her artic char was and she say BLAH! I was extremly disapointed especially cuz everyone i know has liked it.
