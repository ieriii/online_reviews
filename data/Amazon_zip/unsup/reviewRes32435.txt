Friend brought me here while I was visiting, since I'm a vegetarian. Loved the food here. Real comfort and tasty vegetarian food that could potentially pass for the real thing, lots of options as well. The rest of my group were meat eaters, but everyone LOVED the food. No joke.  I was tempted to buy their cookbook.
