Stopped by for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised. I went with the pulled pork sandwich and a side of hoppin' john and both were excellent. It didn't make me think I was down south but, then again, nothing ever does. The pork was moist and flavorful, the sauce added a nice sweet/spicy punch and the slaw was good, cool and crisp. My hoppin' john was fantastic, loaded with beans, tomatoes, scallions and cheesey-melty goodness. Definitely recommend checking 'em out if you're in the area.
