Really liked the place when it first opened a few years ago, but have been really disappointed with the food the last two times I had dinner there. On both occasions, whoever was on the line had a heavy hand with the salt. Every dish we ordered was laden with salt, really masking the natural flavors of the various foods. Had it happened only one time, I would have chalked it up to " a bad night in the kitchen". But twice in a row appears to be " a trend".  I won't go back again. Mediocre.
