I went on a Friday night with four non-vegetarian friends and we all enjoyed our meals. There was no wait for a table when we arrived around six. There is also a parking to the left of the building. I had the Philly Cheez Steak with a side of vegan mashed potatoes and gravy. The seitan was amazing and tasted very realistic. The Cheez sauce was good, but nothing to rave about. I found the mashed potatoes to be a bit dry. I also took home a piece of mixed berry raw cheesecake, which was good, but I wouldn't get it again. Overall the food was delicious and the service was very good.
