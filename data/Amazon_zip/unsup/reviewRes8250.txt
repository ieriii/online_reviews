Delish, delish. Service is inconsistent, waits vary, but who cares when the pizza is this good? Chewy, airy, gooey. Among the delights I've experienced here: fresh mozz with basil; mussels; prosciutto and arugula; nummy sausage. Nice wine list to complement. Dining al fresco here during the summer is simply Chicago at its best. I've had some tasty pizza in Rome and Florence. I wouldn't necessarily put this in the same bucket; apples to oranges, as I've yet to visit Naples. But again, who cares? Spacca Napoli is damn good. I'm glad it exists. I almost don't want anyone else to find out about it.
