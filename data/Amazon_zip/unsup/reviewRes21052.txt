Went here on a Sat night with my parents and my boyfriend and had a great dinner. Its an upscale gastropub with inventive food. My dad had a smoked haddock cake to start with and it was one of the best things I have ever tasted. I really didn't find it touristy at all (maybe b/c its downtown across from mil. park that someone thought that) ... I had read about it in Food and Wine and it was a great suggestion. Good wine list too. Also the bar seemed to be a good place to sit and have a drink. I liked how the manager came around to make sure how everyone's meal was. And the fois gras was tasty too.
