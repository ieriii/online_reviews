What an excellent find. I absolutely love this place, it is quaint, not fancy at all, but great for a casual date. They cook the pasta freshly on a stove in front of you, so you watch everything that you are eating getting cooked. The bowtie pasta w/Chicken is to die for. Very cheap prices too. This is one of my favorite cheap italien places in the city.
