I know reviewing a place with 300 reviews (now 301) is kind of pointless, but I was so pleased with my experience at The Gage that I thought I needed to give it props. Notable dishes from our dinner there tonight included the 'fondue' starter, and the vanilla bean cheese cake. The latter dish, in particular, impressed me; I think it just might be the most tasty dessert I've had the pleasure of eating. I was also happy with their very robust beer selection - brews were thoughtfully chosen and well described. The downside to this place, of course, is the price. This is definitely a once-a-year kind of treat for our budget, but it was well worth the experience. All of our food was prepared excellently; the staff was on the ball and extremely friendly; and the environment was just right. If you're having a 'date night' out or need to impress some important clients, I would definitely recommend going for broke here.
