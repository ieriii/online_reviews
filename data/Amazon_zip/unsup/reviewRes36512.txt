Really refreshing juice and food! Sometimes I feel weighed down after brunch but didn't have that problem here. I got the strawberry/orange/something juice w/a wheatgrass shot and honey. It was delicious! For food I got the red pepper eggs benedict and it that was also really good w/the potatoes. The jam of the day was grape and apricot, both really fresh.
