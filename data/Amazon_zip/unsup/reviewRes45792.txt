I go here occasionally for a burger and always enjoy the food. However, only thing more constant than the good food is the poor service. It is never more than half full when I have been there, but the service has flat out sucked. Tonight was the last straw. We were seated with the place about a third full at best. Waited nearly 15 minutes for service, which never came. In the meantime I saw about 6 others parties seated and served. All the servers just looked at us, but no one bothered to check if we had been helped. When I go out I shouldn't have to be flagging down servers left and right just to order some drinks, which is routine for me here. After waiting we just left and went to somewhere that sat us and brought us our drinks and an appetizer in less time than what we waited at Wilde.
