This place was dope. We showed up on a Friday evening without a reservation. One of the owners was working the door and after about five minutes was able to seat us. That alone was pretty cool because a line was forming with people that had called ahead. We started with the crawfish fritters. I think we got three for an order. A little pricey for the amount you get, but they weren't the least bit greasy or heavy. A good start.  The gumbo was outstanding. My wife said she could have easily been satisfied ordering another bowl for her entre. They give out a complimentary basket of corn cakes, so that was a nice touch. We went with the burger. It was melt in your mouth delicious. Well worth the trip just for that. Our other entre was the pork shoulder sandwich which was just ok. It was Carolina style, so the sauce was more tangy than sweet. Nothing too great and paled in comparison to the burger. We were too stuffed for dessert, but we'll try some next time. This place really hit the spot on a cold winter day.
