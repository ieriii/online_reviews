Irazu is Ir-awesome (word play). We ate lunch there, the second time we've been to the restaurant. I'll start with its one negative - its small and there's little room to wait, which we didn't encounter but could imagine on a busy winter night wouldn't be fun.... that's where the unpleasantness ends. The decor, atmosphere, and food are all a nice slice of Costa Rica - which lives by the code "Pura Vida" or pure life. Irazu gets that right by having a fun atmosphere and attentive staff who you can tell like working there and interacting with customers. FOOD: I had the chicken casado. The casado is the typical meal of Costa Rica - marinated meat and veggies, gallo pinto (rice and beans) an egg on top of the rice and gooey fried plaintains. So good all around. I've visited Costa Rica and I loved the American quality of the meat here with the authentic tastes of CR. Top all that off with the famous Oatmeal milkshake. Its as good as advertised - get one yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about. It was several months between my two visits to Irazu - I'm pretty sure it won't be that long before my next visit.
