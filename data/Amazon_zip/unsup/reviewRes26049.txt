I've eaten at Simply It a handful of times and every time I leave satisfied. The owner is absolutely adorable and always has a smile on his face. It may be a bit pricey for viet food, but it's a good alternative for driving all the way down to Argyle.  The best part about Simply It is the free fruit at the end... YUM!
