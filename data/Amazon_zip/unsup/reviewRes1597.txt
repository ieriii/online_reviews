After waiting almost 1.5 hour on a chilly May morning, my friend and I finally got to make our order. We split the chipotle buffalo dog, spicy beef link, alligator dog, foie gras duck sausage, chicago dog, corn dog and of course the duck fat fries. Holy Crap the foie gras dog was the MOST juicy, flavorful, melt-in-your mouth delicious dog I've ever put in my mouth. That dog alone was worth the wait. The duck fat fries were good, but I seriously can't say they were that much better than other good fries. The corn dog is sweet, crunchy and delicious. The chicago dog was very standard, nothing special. The foie gras dog is 5 star plus but beyond the strangeness of the other dogs, I can't say I think they really warrant the wait.
