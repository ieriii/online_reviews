daddy would you like some sausage? naturally after seeing tony bourdain list this place on his top 10 i grabbed a couple friends to head on over here. since seeing his chicago episode, i've been here 5 times, and i'm ecstatic if we get in line past the dumpster outside. the food is well worth the wait, whether it's the daily specials (duck sausage with foie gras and truffle aioli NOMZ!), duck fat fries (friday and saturday only), or the staple chicago dog. without a doubt you will get a bang for your buck! just make sure you bring cash
