This place is magical. The first time I experienced The Violet Hour I was very much enchanted. I am not a drinker at all, but I will go and have one of their $12 specialty cocktails gladly. They are all handmade by mixologists (AKA not just a bunch of pre-mixed syrup made by college students) and even come with a small carafe with the extra that didn't fit in your glass. Every time it ends up being almost two drinks that way. The decor is so wonderful, the tall-back Dracula chairs are my favorite. It is all candle lit and they have cool, easy to follow rules that set them apart from the rest of the riff raff in WIcker Park. For example "Don't bring anyone that you wouldn't bring to your Mother's for Sunday Brunch" etc. Go here to chill out to awesome music! Don't expect any dancing! THE HOMEMADE DONUTS ARE INCREDIBLE. I hear they have other seasonal desserts like fried snickers or milky ways.
