Um, yum is all that I have to say. I seem to have some sort of obsession with butternut squash pasta, and they have an amazing pumpkin and butternut squash pasta with pine nuts that was just superb. The bruchetta was also amazing, as the tomatoes were extremely fresh, Wine list was AMAZING. (if expensive). We ordered a bottle of Cabernet sauvingnon that was really good, but also $50 a bottle. Overall great service, and worth the wait. It highly recommend making a reservation as it is not the biggest place in town, and is very popular! Oh, I saw a few families there with children, but this is not a good place for kids.
