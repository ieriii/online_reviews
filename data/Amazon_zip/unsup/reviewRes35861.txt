i came last sunday night with my boyfriend and was sooo excited to eat what most people said to be the best beef chow fun ever (my favorite food of ALL time) but they had no more chow fun noodles left ): so instead we ordered the wonton noodle soup, baby clams with black bean sauce, bbq pork friend rice, and roast duck. the soup was bland although the wonton itself was tasty, the clams were excellent (best i've ever had besides at hong min in palos hills), the fried rice was very tasty.. and the duck which they are known for was blah for me, it being the first time i've ever had duck. i believe it may be the texture and after taste. but don't listen to me, this place was packed to the max and plates of roast duck on almost every table so they must know what they're doing. service was stellar. i shall return for the chow fun!
