This is a great place to take a tentative first date. And it likely won't cost you more than a reasonable $60 or so. Tips: - Long waits for weekend brunch tables. Don't be afraid to take a walk to some parks west of Halsted. It will be an hour. - Try some of the different juices. They are all neat in their own ways. - Great coffee.
