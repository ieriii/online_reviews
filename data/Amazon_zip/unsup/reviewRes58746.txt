From the moment my husband and I walked in, we were greeted into a warm and friendly environment. The popcorn is not just a fad or trend it is actually the best I have ever had. The server was beyond cool and very opinionated which I love. The food was very good, the only negative thing I can see.....is that the appetizers are far better than the main courses. While I wanted to finish every morsel of the Wisconsin Risotto, the Deconstructed Italian Beef, etc. I was only mildly impressed with the main courses that we ordered...Sturgeon and Pork Belly. The wine was BEYOND reasonably priced and the desserts (although small) were yummy! If we had the budget we would be regulars!! I have sent three couples there since dining there last month, and they all left happy!
