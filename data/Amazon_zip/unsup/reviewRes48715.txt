2 of my boyfriend's favorite things are beer and pork, so with his birthday coming up, i set out in search of a restaurant i knew he'd love. his best friend and wife were also coming into town to celebrate, so i wanted to pick a fun place and after some research landed on the publican. right away we liked the atmosphere, which had a fun beer hall feel. we started with a chef's tasting of the oysters, which were very fresh...my personal favorite was the peter's point...yum! then we chose a variety of dishes from the menu to share, which i would definitely recommend... -taste of 3 hams (delicious! lots of flavors, pork loving bf was extremely happy) -spicy pork rinds...a must! SO good. perfectly crispy and spicy. mmm. -blood sausage...our most adventurous choice. i've seen anthony bordain rave about it in every country, so was dying to try it...and you know what? it was pretty good! interesting texture and good sausage-y flavor! -little gem salad....delicious! i had never eaten pig ears, but they were crispy and flavorful! -lamb meatballs- holy god. i will DREAM about this plate. it was SO good. honestly, we were talking about it the next day. the spices, the tender lamb...omg! overall, the communal tables can get a little tight, but i thought it created a fun atmosphere. and it was affordable to boot! definitely a must-go in chicago. we had a great time at the publican!
