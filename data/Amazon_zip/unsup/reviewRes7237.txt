My second favorite thing about Sapori is the quirky coupon postcards they send out periodically. My first favorite thing is the fact that everything they make is so tasty. This, of course, only includes a total of four or five items on their menu, but I have faith in their consistency. The folks at Sapori have struck a delicate balance between bustling and cozy which has the same effect on you as a good thunderstorm in the afternoon. I have always left with a feeling of sleepy contentment.
