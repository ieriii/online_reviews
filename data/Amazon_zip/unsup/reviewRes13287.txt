Don't eat the fish and chips. I did, and I paid for it later. The food is at best mediocre here, nothing really to write home about that I've tried or perused on the menu. The beer is OK, and it looks like they've taken all their fist art from german sex shops. Not high on the list for repeatable ventures.
