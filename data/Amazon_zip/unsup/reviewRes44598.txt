This place must be hurting for money-because they will charge you more than what you actually should pay. Typically, I love this place. In the last year, I have purchased several treats here for birthdays and special occasions. Yesterday, I stopped in at 6AM to pick up some treats for a co-workers birthday. However, once I boarded the L train and thought about it, I realized I overpaid. My bill was $24, when is should have been $16. (Shame on me for not paying closer attention at 6AM). After work, I took the trouble of going back to Alliance, and kindly explained to the guy behind the counter what happened, showed him my receipt, and asked for the difference back (seems fair, right?). Since the receipt was not itemized, he told me that he couldn't be sure what I bought, and therefore could not give me the difference back. This was so insulting. Being a loyal, repeat customer I was offended that he even thought I would try and "rip him off". I was only trying to pay the correct price for what I bought and I was being fair with him (I would have gladly eaten another $8 of pastries!). Instead, he laughed off my request and I have never left a retail establishment feeling so low. While the pastries are good-there are plenty of other bakeries in Wicker Park and I will not go back here. It is an insult to my character to think that I would lie about my bill. If you go here-PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR TOTAL...they will charge you more than what they should. So keep my $8 Alliance...you obviously need it more than I do.
