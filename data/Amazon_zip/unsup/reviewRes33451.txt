Mama Mia! Fill my belly with some pasta and you've got yourself a happy Italian girl. Vino! The wines at this place are wonderful. You can't go wrong. Get yourself a bottle between a couple people and call it a night. Food: Now let's talk about the simplest salad ever, but has always been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. The caprese salad - big slices of ripe beefsteak tomatoes topped with an equally big slice of fresh mozzarella cheese finished off with some fresh basil and olive oil = perfection. And don't forget to soak up the leftover olive oil with the warm crusty italian bread. It's so fresh and a wonderful way to start off your food frenzy. I've never had an entre there - I always get pasta and their pasta dishes are just... awesome. I've never had something I didn't like from there. Their menu changes every few weeks depending on what vegetables are in season. I had this creamy mushroom pasta dish that was to die for. The pasta is family style (huge bowls) so it can be shared between a few people... especially if you get an entre to share as well. The desserts are amazing as well. We had this peanut butter chocolate cake with a cookie type crust - WOW. It was so good. I literally leave here in a food coma every time, but I don't mind it because it's delicious and I always have a great time. It's a small place with a lot of tables so it is crowded and it's always busy so don't go here if you're looking for a nice and quiet atmosphere. But you should go!!! This is definitely one of my favorite spots in my neighborhood
