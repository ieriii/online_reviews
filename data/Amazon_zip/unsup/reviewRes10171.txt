By far one of the best meals you can find in Chicago. Not the budget friendliest place, but once you try the food you will not mind forking over the extra $. This upscale Northern Italian style cuisine is mighty fine. A little intimidating at first. you have to walk through the parking lot that always has cars I can only dream of. The decor is hot, just hot.  They have some of the best balsamic Vin in the business to accompany the bread. Their dishes have great variety and more than decent portions. You will leave full. You can get chicken, beef, veal, rabbit, quail, boar, and imported seabass. Ohh, the pasta is the ____(Very Good). Try the: Quail Antipesto Spaghetti Negro Frutti di Mari (In Squid Ink) Nocci (Best Nocci not from grandma) Great service, Ciao bella
