Oh my god, it's a little piece of heaven in my mouth. I've been wanting to try this place for sooo long and finally got around to it with a couple friends. We went for the $40 Tuesday 5 course prix fixe. We had reservations and were seated right away. As others have said, it's a small place, but with plenty of space between tables so it doesn't feel crowded, but still intimate enough. We ended up adding a duck/foie gras dish special (which kinda beats the point of going there for their prix fixe, but anyway...) - oh jesus, foie gras is DELICIOUS. I'd never had it before and I felt so guilty liking it! The duck was a little undercooked for my taste (medium rare?). I also wish they had explained that the shellfish was sitting on a bed of SALT! Everyone at our table took a bite of SALT! Can I just say, I felt hella country. I thought it was roe or something fancy I'd never had before. Speaking of things I've never had, rabbit was another first for me. I don't know that I would have ever tried it otherwise. It was good, though. The service was efficient, but not particularly friendly or spectacular.
