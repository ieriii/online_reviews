Opart Thai is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city. Even before I lived in Lincoln Square, this was a destination; now that I do, it's a major perk to being in the area! The menu is extensive and they tend to be flexible with level of spice and type of meat, as well as accommodating finnicky requests sometimes. The pad thai is the best I've had; you can request less oil if you want to keep it slightly healthier. And they may just make the best peanut sauce in the world. It's nothing monumental in terms of offerings, some standard fare, but it's prepared well and tastes fantastic. If you dine in, service is generally prompt and the turnaround on orders is quick. No alcohol served but BYOB with a liquor store next door and no corkage fee! Delivery usually takes about an hour (longer than it would take to walk there and back for me -- but that is a testament to my laziness more than their speed) but orders are always perfect.
