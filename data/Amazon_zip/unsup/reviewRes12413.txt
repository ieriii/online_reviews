Ran into a Groupon hurricane here. We came on the last day our Groupon was valid and apparently everyone else had the same idea. This place was hopping. We got here at 5:15, the dining room opens at 5:30. We were fifteen back on the list. To their credit, they kept the line moving as more and more people were walking in. We were seated in about 10-15 minutes and had a nice space by the wall. The place itself was pretty cool. We stuck with some standard dishes. For an appetizer, we went with the empanadas and chicken and ham croquetas. Both pretty tasty and a good start to the meal. For the entrees, we went with the ropa vieja with plantains, rice and black beans and the roasted pork with yuca fritters and congri. First off, the roast pork was a really generous portion but a little dry without the mojo. The ropa vieja was good. We both really enjoyed this one. We ended with the flan. Pretty good but a little small. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Not quite a good as mom's, but not too shabby. As we were leaving, we overheard that management was offering to buy off people's groupons. It was nuts in there, but the staff seemed to have it under control. I'm glad we got there early.
