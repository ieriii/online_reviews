How anyone could possibly dislike the Chicago Diner is beyond me. It is my go-to answer for "Where do you want to go to eat?" for any meal. The service is always super friendly, the atmosphere is neat and bustling, and the food is amazeballs. The menus has a great selection. It typically leaves me choosing about six different things that I want, and then choosing, at the last minute. i've never had the same thing twice, though. Most places I go to, I have a "usual". Here, I can't choose a "usual" because everything's awesome. Treat yo' self: Country Biscuits, Gyros, and BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger have been my ultimate faves so far. DO NOT MISS OUT ON A MILKSHAKE because you will be sads. Also, get dessert. I suggest the Peanut butter Chocolate cake they have, if they have it when you go...it's marvelous.
