It's hard writing a review for a place that already has 500+ Frontera was awesome, I got considerably smashed and food was very good. Apparently this Rick Bayless guy is the real deal.  Upon asking the obligatory "What's the most popular item on the menu" question our server responded with "Our menu changes every 4 weeks." It's pretty cool that they change the menu a lot and Frontera Grill is still popular. After eating there I know why. Instead of ordering an entree my friend and I just ordered a bunch of small plates and for the most part, I love everything. My favorite part about my visit were the drinks and by drinks I really mean Tequila shots and a shit ton of Margaritas. I left sufficiently sated and drunk. I recommend Frontera Grill for anyone that likes good quality Mexican food.
