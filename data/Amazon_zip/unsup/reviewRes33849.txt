Yolk is my new go-to breakfast spot in the South Loop. Had breakfast here this morning. Really great. First off, there was a 1 hour wait. Sigh, I guess we have to kill time by walking around sunny Grant Park. Hehe. The good news about the wait - the guy's quote was spot on. I hate when they say "about 30 minutes" and you end up waiting around for another half hour. Not cool. But no problem at Yolk. This place is pretty big, and they plow through the names on the wait list. The menu here is huge. Good huge. I like choices. Toast is my mainstay on the north side, but with like 10 items, I need to go somewhere else and shake it up. Yolk has everything - skillets, frittatas, pancakes, crepes, waffles, omelettes - EVERYTHING! Finally settled on the banana blackberry pancakes with a side of sausage - delicious. Also tried their freshly squeezed orange juice - so refreshing! Bf got the Tuscan skillet AND a side of pancakes. A TON of food, totally worth it. Our waitress was great, super friendly and very efficient.
