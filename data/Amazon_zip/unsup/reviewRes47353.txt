Lockdown is definitely my new favorite burger joint in town. First of all, it's about 3 blocks away from my house. Tuesday Half Priced Burgers is totally a Let's Go! and their burgers are top notch!!!! The first time I went there two tuesdays ago, it was super crowded and the wait was about 20 minutes. So, my friend and I grabbed some beers over the bar and less than 20 minutes we were seated and ready to order. I had the bootleg burger the first time (kimchi, bacon and fried egg -- seriously! I would never known how delicious kimchi in a burger, loved it). The second time I was there, I had the big house and it was also really good. And both times, I got the mac and cheese sprinkled in bacon bits. YUM!!!! Yes, the place is loud. But, Live Metallica, Nirvana and Guns and Roses. I can sit quietly and watch the TV. haha. Very fast and friendly services. I will continue coming in here, especially on tuesday night!
