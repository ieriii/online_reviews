This review is just for the cafe, not for the market. This place is the kind of joint where middle aged women gather to pay 50% more for a sandwich based solely on the decor. I had the pulled pork bbq panini. It was okay, but when they say the sandwich comes with cole slaw, they mean the sandwich comes with cole slaw in it. Not a welcome addition to the bbq flavor. When I eat barbecue, I don't want the taste smothered by mayonnaise. No man has any business eating here because the portions and price don't match up. And while the food is fine, it's not really worth going out of your way for... unless you're a woman, then you'll get off on a place like this. ("Oooo, fancy shmancy! Here, take more of my money!")
