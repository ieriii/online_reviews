Amazing decor, beautiful menu, very professional attentive staff. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The dragon roll ($16)was ok, much much better than the sunda rainbow ($16), which was tasteless, the tuna was not fresh and it was very dry. Both of the rolls were very small, the individual pieces were not of the same size,and for that price is extremely not worth it. AT ALL. Presentation wasn't phenomenal either. I also tried two of the hand rolls, baked snow crab ($11) - decent size, but it was also very dry and lacked much flavor, and scottish salmon sashimi bundles, which were i must say pretty good, a little too creamy for me, but the salmon was fresh and melted in your mouth. NY steak ($29) was over-seasoned to the point you couldn't taste the meat, which was disappointing judging by the impressive presentation. Malay style seabass ($32) was very very good, probably the only dish worth its price that i got to try. Yes, Sunda has a colorful menu, sexy expensive decor and a high end atmosphere, but that's all it has. I seriously doubt i'll be back for more. ps. Just wondering how all those tall people manage to sit in those tiny "japanese style" tables. I mean, i could be considered average height and i had trouble sitting down and getting up.
