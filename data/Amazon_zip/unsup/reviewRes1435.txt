This place is perfect in every way. I would like to highlight the cheese fries here since I really haven't seen anyone give them the props they deserve: These fries are a package of melty, cheesy, fried goodness. It really is hard to find the perfect cheese fry in this city and these are absolute perfection. BTW they are fresh cut fries so you can imagine how they have the perfect combo of crunch and softness in every bite. Also, on Friday and Saturday you can do the duck fat fries with cheese... oh my gosh!
