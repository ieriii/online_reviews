Perhaps the cold weather and sprinkle of snow has kept people away (yay for me!) so there was hardly any line at 1 p.m., a pleasant surprise. The highlight of the visit definitely came at the end with the hot chocolate. I had the "authentic" which is simply ground chocolate and water, but has a nuanced, slightly creamy flavor; not too sweet, almost like coffee (but much better). My friend had the Aztec version, sweeter, with milk and some allspice and chile. Very nice. We split a couple of tortas--the Gunthorp chicken and the Milenesa. I preferred the crusty bolillo style roll of the chicken as opposed to the panini-like bread for the Milenasa. All the ingredients were tasty (and I appreciate that they are thoughtfully sourced), but to this palate the tortas suffered from flavor/ingredient overload. I couldn't really taste the Gunthorp chicken for example, even though there was plenty of it, as the sandwich was over-liberally doused with salsa roja (redundantly served as a side as well.) And though I love grilled onions and avocado, which are also on the sandwich, it was just...too much at once. (I think I would've been happy with just grilled onions, beans and avocado--wonder if I could request my own version?) Though I was plenty stuffed, I was sad they didn't have any of the chocolate hazelnut cookies that are listed on the web menu. Boooooo! (I'm not a churros gal,) All in all I'm glad I went but I wasn't as wowed by the tortas as I had expected to be. I'll definitely come back to try a caldo (agree with others--wish they were served before 3 p.m.) and a different torta, probably a vegetarian one would be better for me. And I'll certainly get hot chocolate again.
