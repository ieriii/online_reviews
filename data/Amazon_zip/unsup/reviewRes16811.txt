Although my party and I made reservations ahead of time, we weren't seated until 15-20 minutes after that time. Thank goodness for the bar! The mojito I had there was delicious. I was able to slurp that down in no time! I was hoping the food would be just as good- unfortunately it wasn't. Other than the incredibly delicious plaintains (they were some of the best I've ever had), the lackluster food left me craving more. The guacamole and chips were simply ordinary and the trio seafood sampler was not to my liking. The service was also a disappointment. When asked if we wanted the plaintains as an appetizer or to come w/ our meal we all said "appetizer." After waiting and waiting for our appetizer we decided to order the guacamole/avocado and chips. Again we waited and waited for our appetizers but didn't receive a thing. Eventually we received both appetizers but they came with our meal. I would have understood if the waiter apologized for this mistake yet he made no comment regarding it. As far as the ambiance, Carnivale is appropriately theme using colorful and lively decor with its nod to Miami. Although I won't be returning back, I did appreciate their support for local farm goods.
