I attended a hosted event and was able to sample two meats (steak and chicken), as well as a variety of sides from the harvest bars (their side tables). I'm not sure how much of everything they offer to regular diners, but there was a lot of variety. The food had a lot of flavor (the chicken was well seasoned and the corn chowder soup was the BEST I've ever had) and the selection of sides makes it was a great place for vegetarians also. I overheard (not sure if its accurate) that a patron would pay between $20-$25 for this menu. I personally would not pay that much for it. I think around $15-$20 is more reasonable. Beautiful venue with lots of indoor/outdoor space for events and a good, safe location in the loop. I am not a drinker, but I also overheard they had some kind of strawberry drink that was very good.
