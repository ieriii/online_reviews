This place fell the fuck off... It used to be good... I suppose it's always the case that, in time everything gets tired, run down and goes somewhere to die... just like the whole neighborhood that surrounds this restaurant. Sultan's used to have really great food and prices. However, I have witnessed the downfall of what was once a good place to frequent. If you want to sit around and see a bunch of corny ass seventies porn star mustaches on a bunch of people wearing paint on pants, Lou Reed shades, Iron Maiden t-shirts and keds that don't know the first thing about Iron Maiden or that the "cool dude" that's on their shirt is even named Ed Hunter....or what is actually happening in the 70's porno flick that inspired their mustache and crunch on some really crappy falafel, or cold shawarma that makes you buckle over an hour later and nearly makes you shit yourself from food poisoning... then please, by all means, go to Sultan's Market...because,like, uhmahgahhh it's so "ironic" that the food is that crappy and I still pay for it!!!! Run-on sentences tend to happen when I get riled up. I apologize. Anyway, I like Couscous on Taylor, Iron Maiden, and 70's skin flicks better.
