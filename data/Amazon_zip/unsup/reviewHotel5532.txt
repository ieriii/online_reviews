I stayed here with my boyfriend in January during a layover from Nicaragua. Thank goddness for the super cozy rooms because it was freeezzziinnngg outside (oh, and p.s. I'm from Cali, so I'm a strictly warm weather gal). Perks: Nice, comfortable beds with fluffy pillows and soft sheets. Clean, modern room. Free breakfast and shuttle service to/from the airport (although keep in mind: the shuttle only leaves once every hour). And the staff was very friendly. Would have been nice if there was more in the area in terms of food, drug stores, liquor stores (mmmm red wine), etc. But overall a great and affordable place to crash for a chilly layover.
