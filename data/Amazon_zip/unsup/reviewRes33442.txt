Sultan's has the best falafel in the world.I mean that. I have been to the Mideast and while I was there I craved Sultan's. How's that for an endorsement? The only tiny little thing that I find annoying is that Sultan's knows they are the snizznit! So sometimes they can be a little rude. Okay they can be really rude! (One time I waited for five minutes for someone to come back to the cash register while two people who worked there and the register in the past had a conversation right next to me!) But they know that you will always come back. How can you not? One falafel sandwich will keep you filled for days and the other treats are just as good! Other than falafel you can go grocery shopping there and the salad bar is so pretty!
