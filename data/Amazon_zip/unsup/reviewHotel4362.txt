There are no major complaints on this hotel that I have. And I did enjoy the pool and hot tub. Our stay was short and we enjoyed the staff and cleanliness. We have traveled to several bigger cities that provide free internet and health club in the rate. I was expecting more from this hotel. Some other minor annoyances leaves me feeling underwhelmed. I'll try somewhere else next time.
