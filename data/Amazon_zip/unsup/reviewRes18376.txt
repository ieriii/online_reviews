Very lovely little Italian restaurant. Not exactly authentic... the dishes are enormous and rely a bit much on the American love of butter and grease. The flavors are good! Fennel infused Italian sausage was amazing. A bit pricey. As I mentioned, you receive more of a platter than a dish. Three meals in one. BYOB and go on weekday evening. Enjoy!!! ps. the waiters aren't hard on they eyes. :)
