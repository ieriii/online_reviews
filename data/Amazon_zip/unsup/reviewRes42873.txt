AoP is just about as good as stuffed pizza gets in Chicago, and they'll give you the real deal at a reasonable price. (They also have other formats, but the stuffed seems to be the draw.) The slices are very consistent, the sauce is yummy, and it all goes together well...enough so that you don't much mind gooey top crust, a standard stuffed pizza gripe.  Of course, it has strip mall ambience, but there are plenty of other places to go if you want a nice sit-down stuffed pizza that takes 45 minutes to get to the table. Come here for a quick slice that slays the appetite and scratches the itch.  Now I'm hungry, and will have to stop by tonight....
