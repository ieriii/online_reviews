What can be said about Xoco that has not already been mentioned? Rick Bayless is a chicago legend and has certainly earned his stripes. The food here is very unique, not what you would call your average latin american food, but for Xoco this is a good this. The Agua De Fresco is to die for, i highly reccomed you get the water of the day. I had the roasted pork on ciabatta bread and loved every minute of it. The guac was the best i have ever had and i really don't even care for avacado. This place is a solid bet if your in the loop and want something quick, tasty and unique
