Most places have vegetarian friendly dishes these days, but this is a true vegetarian restaurant. They know what vegetarians want, and they're passionate about their service. Most dishes are vegan, and the egg and cheese dishes all have substitutes. I will say that there is no wi-fi, which only effects their rating if you are going there to get on the internet. If you're just going to eat, it's magnificent.
