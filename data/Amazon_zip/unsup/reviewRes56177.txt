I've been a regular at Icosium Kafe since it opened. The food gets five big stars, because it's obviously what's keeping me coming back for more. I've been a server for 10 years, so I may be ultra critical of the service industry. Now granted you don't go to a place like Icosium expecting what you'd expect from a 5-star top of the line restaurant, but the little things still count. I went on a weekday with two friends. Two of us order the Crepe de Paris and we asked to add raisins, and my friend added nuts to his. Our server was very nice and accommodating so I want to give her a 5-star rating too. The kitchen forgot to add the nuts and raisins, so our server apologized (she seemed genuinely flustered by the incident) and brought the crepes back to the kitchen. The owner came back with my crepe and rudely plopped it down in front of me (the same one I had been eating) and threw down a cup of raisins and told me I could add them to the crepe myself. After this, our waitress returned to the table and apologized again, saying she was outvoted when she asked the kitchen to remake the crepe. If they weren't going to make me a new crepe, couldn't they have at least warmed the raisins for me? To give me back the same crepe with a side of cold raisins is quite unappetizing, really. And the owner was so incredibly rude that I don't think I'll go back if I see him there. But having said that, I eat there several times a month and rarely see him.
