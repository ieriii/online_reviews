This place is absolutely worth a few visits if you like good beer and good food. I've been numerous times over the past few months.The beer: This is where they win your heart. They have a rotating menu of homemade and guest drafts, many of which are excellent, all of which are at least good. Find out what the seasonal beer at the time is and give it a try. After you've tried the seasonal and the main styles, try out their cask beers or the higher quality beers (e.g. bourbon stout, barleywine). I really enjoy their variety and they do excellent work.The food: There's a bit of a variety on classic bar foods and I've enjoyed everything I have ordered. My favorites are the Hombre burger, the duck fat popcorn and the Apple Pork Pizza. A rule of thumb - order something wild, there's no point in paying this price for something you could get anywhere.The service/atmosphere: This place is usually packed and the staff does a good job of dealing with everyone. I've never had a bad experience and I have been very pleased with almost every bartender and waiter.
