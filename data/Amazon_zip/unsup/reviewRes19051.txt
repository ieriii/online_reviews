AMAZING food!!! Amaaaazing sandwiches!! The goat cheese/mushroom sandwich is so delicious!!! We also had a Rick Bayless sighting!! The space is small and cramped but they help seat you. It's kind of confusing because at first we thought it was a formal sit down restaurant and were a little taken aback at not being seated because ONE person from our party wasn't there and told to just hang out in line. I had the 'new' Brasilia hot chocolate which I actually wasn't a fan of. Would def go back for the food though.
