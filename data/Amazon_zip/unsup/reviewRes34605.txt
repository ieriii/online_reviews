Sultan's market is such a favorite of mine. I live for their falafel--in fact, I was never a huge fan pre-Sultan's Market. I now crave it on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. They also have some tasty vegan cookies, but it really depends on the day. I have some real winners and some real losers. I can't speak for anything other than falafel & cookies because I can't bring myself to order anything else. When something works, it just works.
