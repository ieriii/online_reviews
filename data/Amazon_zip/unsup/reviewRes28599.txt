The pasta is just okay. We ordered the Gnocchi Aurora. Here is their description: Gnocchi with grilled chicken, mushrooms, spinach, and a marinara cream sauce all smothered in melted smoked mozzarella goodness! $9.95 Sounds good huh? Let's just say friend and I split the meal and we didn't even wanna finish it. Please stop being so stingy with your chicken because I think I saw like 2 small pieces. One thing that I did not appreciate was when we asked if we could get the dish separated in half. Our waiter refused to do so but suggested we take 2 plates and do it ourselves. And please don't reach over me to get the check just because you're in a hurry to go home. I doubt I'd come back here. Last note: tables for 2 people are super small that our plates were hanging off the edge.
