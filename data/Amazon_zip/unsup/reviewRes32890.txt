We tried a combination of all the vegetarian dishes, the lamb (lega tibs), the tilapia (ye-asa lebleb) and the shrimp (ye-shrimp tibs). We all loved the mixed legumes (shiro), beets (kay seerena carrot tibs) and the ground chick peas (ye-shimbra assa). The bread was also really nice. No one liked the collard greens (gomen) or spinach (quosta). As this was all of our first experiences with Ethiopian food, it's hard to make a comparison to any other Ethiopian restaurant. Would definitely recommend it, particularly for vegetarians. Great experience which I look forward to repeating.
