Agreed with 3 1/2 stars. Extra points for atmosphere, friendly service and interesting menu. Pricing isn't cheap but definitely on the upper end of the range for Andersonville. Overall, value is fair. $35pp for 3 courses and wine. Now for the food. While not bad, it's certainly not up to par with the hype or the atmosphere. Of course, the kitchen is only a few weeks in business, so they're still figuring out the rhythm. Also, given the small size of the kitchen area, they're probably tripping over themselves. Ravioli were drowning in butter (overwhelming) and while some pasta dishes need a little extra salt, others were way over-seasoned. Bottom line - while we've had better Italian food, we'll definitely be going back.
