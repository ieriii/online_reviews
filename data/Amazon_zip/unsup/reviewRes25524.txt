Great pizza and the wait staff was very courteous. We went to dinner at 6 on a Saturday and there was no wait. Around 6:30 the place started getting really packed so we got there at a great time. Our only complaint is that we were at a middle high-top table and when it got packed people surrounded around the bar which was right next to our table. Other than that, I highly recommend it.
