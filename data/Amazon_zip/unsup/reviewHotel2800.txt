We were here thanksgiving week for 2 days and enjoyed our stay here. This was in an excellent location with the weber grill restaurant right across the street.We checked in and had a nice suite on the 9th floor with a great view off of state street(street noise was not loud either).The room was very spacious and it had 2 tvs in the room and one was a flat screen.One plus to this place was the free breakfast & cooked to order eggs. They also have a happy hour in the evening with free drinks & snacks also.The indoor pool was no real big, but nice enough to swim in. Me & my honey also enjoyed the hot tub and the jets felt good on my back.You do have to pay for the internet in your room & in the atrium area.They do have a business center with 3 computers that you get on the internet for free.All the employees here are very friendly & helpful and they answer all your questions.Parking here is pretty expensive so you might have to look around to get a deal in this area.I would definitely stay at this place again. Its close to navy pier,and all the good dining. Its also nice because you can hop on the train close by and all the buses.
