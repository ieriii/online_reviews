The food at Xoco is fantastic. The ambiance is pretty good. But the food...did I mention the food? It definitely makes up for the tight seating and long lines. If I lived closer to this place, it would undoubtedly be a place I frequented on a weekly (if not more) basis. And I would be stupid not to... the torta's ranged in price from $8 - $10. Two torta's, two beverages and a desert to split came to a whopping $32. That's what we would have paid at a Panera or Corner Bakery...except I actually enjoyed the food we ate at Xoco. I had the gunthrop chicken torta. The person I was with had the Pepito torta. Both were so good and full of flavor. We split an order of churros (3 for $3) with the soft serve to dip them in. If the torta was foreplay...the churros were definitely the grand finale... ;) They were delicious...melt-in-your-mouth awesomeness. You have to try them!! The seating is not anything fantastic...although I'm guessing that's not really the point of this place. Torta's are considered "street food"...so it sorta makes sense that this place be a small cafe to eat a quick bite and head back out. It's a smallish space...so many of the tables are built into the wall and you eat facing that wall. But it really doesn't matter...because as soon as your food arrives, you're face will be buried in it. I love this place. I highly recommend checking it out. And don't forget the churros!
