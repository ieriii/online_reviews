This is one of my favorite place in chicago. If your lucky enough to get one of the seats on a window on Michigan Ave you will have a great view. I've been to the restauraunt about 5 times and have never been disapointed. Love the Chicken parmesan and the buffalo chicken eggroll things. Love the decor!
