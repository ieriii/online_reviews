Warm, welcoming environment and friendly, quick service. I loved how many options there were. My husband and I got two savory entrees and a French toast to split. It was all very yummy and nicely presented. I would totally go back if we lived closer by and could get there early- arriving around 10:30, we had to wait quite a while.
