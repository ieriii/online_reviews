Love the food...doesn't get any better than this. The only reason this place gets 4 instead of 5 stars is there is literally no where to stand to wait when you walk in. And you will be waiting because the food is so good and affordable and everyone knows it. Depending on where you are seated, you could end up someone's behind in your Pho if you're not careful. Also it has the feel of a cafeteria. There's usually spare basil leaves on the floor that have been forgotten. Not sexy but it functions and that's all that really matters right? Awesome awesome food!!! :)
