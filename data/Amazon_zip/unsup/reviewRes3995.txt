If you plan on eating here, you should also have back-up dinner plans. We had nearly given up on Schwa after calling and calling only to have the answering machine pick up and tell us the mailbox was full. When we arrived at our hotel we asked our concierge if he had any magic concierge secrets and could get through for us.  He, laughed and said that the restaurant was notoriously hard to reach and frequently "cancelled" on people at the last minute. He sort of tactfully indicated that the place might not be worth our troubles. Oh how we should have taken the hint. On a whim we decided "to call them one more time." Magically, someone answered and we secured a reservation for a few days later.  On the day of our reservation we were in a small wine shop picking out some wine for dinner (Schwa suggested we bring 2). The wine shop owner confirmed what the concierge told us - that the place frequently closed per the chef's whims. He then paused and said, "... but you know it's not a Tuesday. I don't know if he needs a break after the weekends, but usually it is on Tuesdays that he just closes."  Fast forward 1-hour. We are sitting in a cab headed back to our hotel (now with 2 newly purchased bottles of wine). It is about 4:50 pm and we get a call from Schwa, "We're sorry we are not going to be opening tonight. Do you want to reschedule ...." Sorry Schwa we didn't and we couldn't. The food must be pretty good for the place to get away with crap like this, but I find it rude and inconsiderate ( particularly since we had rearranged some of our other dinner plans after finally getting through to them).  There are too many other great restaurants in Chicago to go through this hassle with them.
