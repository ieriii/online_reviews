I came here for an awkward first date awhile back. The place was also way too fancy for a first date because we were literally the youngest people inside (I had to ask him what a chophouse was cause I had never heard of the term before). This would've been okay if we were having a great time, but I'm actually a pretty awkward date because I don't put effort into avoiding awkward silences, so if I don't have anything to say...I generally don't. And this place is also very old school. I got the sesame crusted ahi tuna, and he got a steak off the daily special. My tuna was so good - I love seared ahi tuna, and it was delicious with the soba noodles. I also tried his steak and his was cooked perfectly too. It didn't have any fancy spices or rubs, but the quality of the beef really stood out. I didn't have the best experience here because we ate in silence maybe half the time, but the food was perfect and the service was wonderful.
