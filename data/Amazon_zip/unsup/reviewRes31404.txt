Dining perfection! From the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left, we felt like the staff had rehearsed the event. The management is to be complemented for this seemingly choreographed service. While we were waiting to be seated, a manager named Q graciously welcomed us to the restaurant. We expected to see James Bond in the bar but he was not there. We were warmly approached by Cheri and led to the first floor dining room. Its dcor is contemporary, upscale and unpretentious while the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. The table was surgically clean and precisely set. The menus were easy to understand. We found later that the food exceeded the menu's descriptions. Our server, Griff, was fully attentive without being intrusive. He orchestrated a seamless flow of courses as the night progressed from appetizer to entre to desert. His assistance in wine selection was appreciated. Mid-way through our meal, Chris, a manager stopped by for an enjoyable chat. As we ate, we wondered if Mastros is the culinary equivalent of maestro for the chef could be described as a genius conductor given the outstanding selections, presentations and tastes. The food was unparalleled.  The desserts were equally outstanding. Applause to the pastry chef for the wonderful creations. Thank you Mastros.
