I love this place! It's soooo hard to find healthy food that's organic and tastes good...love their breakfasts, especially the fresh pressed apple juice and the stuffed french toast! But now they are open for dinner. A friend took me there for my birthday and it was wonderful. We a beet/watermelon salad with some homemade cheese and a lovely whiskey/pecan sauce. My friend had a rare tuna/nicoise salad and I had the forraged mushroom burger - absolutely delicious. The meet was from a local source, antibiotic and hormone free and free range fed. The vegetables in the tuna salad were fresh beyond belief and the potatoes that came with it were perfect and no greasy taste. I had a pistachio rum cake for desert with mascarpone whipped cream and wild berries...it was to die for! plus they comped the cake cuz it was my birthday! very nice!
