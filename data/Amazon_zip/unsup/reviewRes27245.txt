Mmmmmm, Mexican food. I love it. I love cheap Mexican food even more. On a trip to Chicago, we dined here for lunch after plans for our previous place fell through. The neighborhood was a little sketchy but not a problem, we found parking close. We were seated immediately and beat the giant line that formed as soon as we sat down. I got the three carne asada tacos (which came with onions, lettuce, tomatoes) and it was delicious. It sucked that the corn tortillas fell apart but they most generally always do. My pineapple Jarritos was awesome too, pineapple soda ftw. 3 tacos for $5 and a soda for $1.50. You really can't beat that. Friends got the tacos and burritos as well, they were giant. Finish one half and save the other for dinner! One of the best things though was that they gave you free chips and three kinds of salsa! AND SOUP! The soup was very tasty, as were the chips and salsa, so fresh. I only wish there was a place like this in Santa Ana. A+ Nuevo Leon, thanks for a great meal. It's no wonder you've been an establishment for over 40 years.
