In fairness, I didn't eat here, so this is just a review of the ambiance/drinks. My friend and I got seats at the bar, no wait, at 845 pm on Saturday. The tables were PACKED with people eating food....and the food smelled so delicious. I wish I'd been hungry enough to order dinner. The bartenders were unusually friendly and helpful - one in particular with dark hair and blonde highlights throughout was really personable. The martinis were very sweet and girly - just the way I like them - and they were really beautifully jewel-toned in color. We weren't rushed, and felt very relaxed the whole time. There was a bit of noise in the bar, but we could still definitely carry on a conversation. Gets a little chilly if you sit by the door in winter, though! brrrr! I'd definitely be back, for reasonably priced martinis ($7 or $8 each) and maybe some of those delicious looking fries next time...
