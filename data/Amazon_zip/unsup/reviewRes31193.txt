My husband and I went to Mastro's for his birthday on Friday night. Earlier in the day, I called the hostess to confirm that they were aware that it was his birthday and to bring around their signature butter cake at the end of the meal for him (as he's allergic to chocolate and they otherwise bring around a slice of chocolate cake for you).  The meal went without a hitch--dungeness crab for a shared starter, as well as the chopped salad (light and perfectly dressed), double cut porterhouse (filet side was melt in your mouth delicious and the sirloin side was the perfect texture) and lobster mashed potatoes. Absolutely no complaints until...well, no dessert or birthday acknowledgement came at all. Instead, we waited and waited and then finally, when I just couldn't wait any longer, I went to the hostess stand and told them again. The server later apologized, saying that he missed the notation, but that's the kind of blunder that shouldn't happen at an establishment like this. Delicious, but when you're in a town where steak joints are plentiful, you have to deliver your A game on all fronts.
