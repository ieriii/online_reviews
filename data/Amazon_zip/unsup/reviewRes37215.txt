Even if you go with a budget or list you'll be tempted to add things. The olive oil, cheeses, and desserts are great. The cafe is nice if you want some takeout sandwichs. I'm not very knowledgeable about wine but have been helped by staff into making some sound choices. The price points are a decent range.  A must for any foodie or wine lover. It really classed up my dinner & date nights at home. Lol
