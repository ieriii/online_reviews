Great local spot in Andersonville for Italian food. Huge portions at reasonable prices. The Neapolitan pizzas are huge, very big for an appetizer. We also tried the gnocchi and braised beef ravioli. Both were good. For dessert we went with the apple tart with ice cream and it was delicious. We'll be back!
