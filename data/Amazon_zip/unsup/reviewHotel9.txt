Stayed here when I went to Chicago for a wedding. The hotel had an old world charm that my husband and I liked and made us choose this over something more modern. Yes, the hotel only had 1 small elevator which made it a little inconvenient when there were multiple groups (with luggage) at the same time, which reminded me of a hotel in Europe. The rooms were modest, the bathroom was fine, everything was clean... not luxurious, but what do you expect. The location itself is conveniently located just off the main street. I think we ended up paying $160 per night (after taxes were added) during the weekend in July, which was cheap for that area when we looked. Overall, fairly comfortable and affordable, a decent option.
