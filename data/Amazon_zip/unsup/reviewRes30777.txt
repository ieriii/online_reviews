I like: As a vegetarian, I like being able to go to CD and not have to analyze every last word on the menu to make sure I don't accidentally order something meaty.  I like not so much: As a vegetarian who doesn't like meat, I'm not so thrilled at the menu's heavy emphasis on dishes based around meat substitutes.  Food I've had and liked (and remembered) - veggie sandwich, polenta fiesta, chocolate mousse cake, choc/peanut butter cake. Do not like their coffee. Ick. That said, Chicago Diner doesn't seem outrageously priced (as others have suggested), except for their shakes - yikes! I hear they're great, but I can't imagine being anything but disappointed by a shake I pay $7 for.  Service is friendly and accommodating.  What CD is good for: hearty veg fare for veg folks that don't like scouring menus for the one dish that fits their dietary restrictions at other restaurants. And cake. Oooh the cake. Yum. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but will give them the benefit of the doubt and round up.
