This is the perfect place to meet friends after work. I work in the Loop and take the Blue line home. Definitely worth skipping a few stops and getting off at California. I had the Portabella Mushroom Sandwich with the "highly rated" 'tater salad. Take your time to enjoy this delicious pairing ( lot's of flavor)! The service was outstanding and the beer choices are pretty amazing too. I sampled a few drinks and liked them all. I'd recommend at least trying the stronger beers first then chilling out and experimenting with some of there seasonal brews. I'm coming back here again very soon
