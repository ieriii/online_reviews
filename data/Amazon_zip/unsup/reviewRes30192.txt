Not worth it, folks. My neighborhood Mexican place is far better. On my first trip a few years back, the hostess was so unfriendly that I don't know why we didn't turn around and leave. And then $6 for an itty-bitty scoop of guacamole with a few tortilla chips...please. The mole dish came out as just a sea of brown. Nothing to compliment the mole and just a blah taste experience. This place needs to get over itself.
