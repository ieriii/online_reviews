Because this is the restaurant where my first date took place, I feel the need to write a brief review. The first impression of the interior is warmth. The tables are arranged so that you can have a conversation without raising your voice too high, and the place seems to become busy after six p.m., so there is a good buzz. If you sit near the window, the dark evening and neon lights outside could be romantic, as if you could hear, in your head, "There is a Light that Never Goes Out." I hope that doesn't sound too sentimental. Because I (pretend to) dislike sentiments like that. So beforehand, I had looked through most of the reviews on here, and We went with the vegetarian messob for two. The plate doesn't appear like an enormous amount of food or anything, but it lasted us about two hours, or maybe I am just a slow eater. It was an all-right tasty, and I like the sharing experience of it, along with the interesting sponge bread. The waiters seemed attentive, though when we first stepped in, it took a while for us to get seated. Like five minutes. That is ok, though, because the host seemed kind and later in the evening, a man started playing a song that might have been Ethiopian music, I'm not sure. Conclusion: I would come back here.
