Piece gets so much hype but I always hesitated going because I hear the wait can be insane (they do not take reservations). Three of us went to Piece on a Friday night around 7ish (maybe) and waited about 2 hours before we were seated.  What do you do while waiting? Drink! They have a very large and good selection of beers. But because it's soooo crowded, getting a drink and even finding somewhere to stand can be a hassle. If you snag a seat at the bar, you can order food. Once seated, I was ready for this amazing pizza everyone raves about. We ordered a thin pizza with a few differed meats and green pepper. It was good,yes. But I didn't think it was anything great.  I would go back to Piece but...I'm not in a rush and wouldn't go out of my way to go back.
