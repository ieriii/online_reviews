My husband and I celebrated our one year anniversary at Graham Elliot, and we had a memorable meal. We opted for the 14 course repertoire. My husband went with the wine pairings, and he had great things to say about the majority of the picks. My favorite course was the risotto course. I would definitely come back to Graham Elliot to get the a la carte risotto. It was creamy, flavorful, and the truffles added a great complexity to the dish. The halibut was also amazing. The potato puree was like a perfect mashed potato. I don't often see fish paired with mashed potatoes, but this was a great compliment to the dish. The beef was also noteworthy. It was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. Although I enjoyed the three dessert courses, I would have been content with just the peach or the plum. I didn't feel that I needed both fruity dessert courses. Probably the most adventurous thing on the menu is the snails. I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the snails, I guess don't judge a book by it's cover! I thought our service was fantastic. Everything moved smoothly and everyone was knowledgeable and helpful with questions. I think this is a fantastic place for a special event. I am pretty confused by those who leave Graham Elliot hungry. I was definitely full after all 14 courses. I think it is more than enough food. Highly recommended!
