Thank you gilt bar. The bartenders rock. Not only do they put on a great show, the drink menu kicks ass. We showed up later in the evening all ruckus and a bit whiskey drunk to celebrate a friends birthday. We came in from detroit and within minutes the bartender was extending proffesional courtesy and took real good care of us. The food is a-ma-zing. I will be back. These guys are real funny and charming. If i were you i wouldn't leave your girlfriend alone at the bar or show up late, they will definately be bringing her home if you slip.
