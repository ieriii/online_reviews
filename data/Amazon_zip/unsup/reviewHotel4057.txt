Great hotel in the middle of the Chi-town action! I had a beautiful room with a great view of the Chicago river and North Michigan avenue. My hotel room was an ample size for one person and came with standard amenities, including a comfy bed and coffee that housekeeping replenished each day. As a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I got the Wall Street Journal delivered to my door every morning, which saved me the trouble of rushing downstairs to pick up a complimentary copy before the business class crew totally swiped every last one. The hotel has bars, restaurants, snack and gift shops on-site, so you technically never have to leave the hotel, but who wants to be cooped up inside all day when the hotel is in the center of everything? Shopping, jazz clubs, boat cruises, restaurants, and great sightseeing are all within walking distance. There are tons of tourists and locals out at night time so I found it completely safe to walk around the neighborhood when the sun went down. The customer service at the hotel is excellent! The hotel staff assisted me with everything I needed in record time. I would definitely stay here again!
