Honestly, i freaked out when we first walked in. Dim lighting, hip music....oh god...how expensive was this going to be? How much stress would this place put on my close to empty college student wallet? I sat down. Twisty forks and fancy chopsticks!? OH DEAR LORD! Seriously though. I finally calmed down when I saw the price of the stuff. Very reasonable. Very good. I didn't have any hardcore sushi but I picked up a California maki roll as well as an order of Thai Iced tea and a Panang Curry dish with extra spice. All were very good and very reasonably priced. Granted, it's not the cheapest place in Chicago to pick up some Asian food, but it definitely didn't destroy my dream of eating the next day.
