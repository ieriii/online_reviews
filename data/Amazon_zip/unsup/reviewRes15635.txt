"Great Restaurant in a great neighborhood." Been here 10 times in the past 4 years. They always pour a good drink, the portions are huge and the price is reasonable. Parking in the city is rough at times, Not at Calo's. You can park across the street and they give you a ticket that you have validated by anyone who works in the restaurant. Live entertainment in the bar. I have dined here with 2 people and have dined here with a party of 12. The staff is well trained. I love this place for when a friend comes into town. I know we will have good experience.
