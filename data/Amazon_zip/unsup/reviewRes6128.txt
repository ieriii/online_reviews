My bf have been coming here for the past few years on Valentines Day and it's always been a pleasure. I love getting the Medallion Trio of filets with the different crust....the only problem is that I can never really remember which ones I liked the best, but they are all pretty darn good, so it's not that big of a deal.  The wine list is ok, not the best I've ever seen, but not the worst. However, they are known for their martinis...which I've never had. So maybe I should try one the next time I go. It's not as expensive as some of the other steakhouses in Chicago and it's part of LEYE and to me that stands for quality! They never let me down.
