Caught a show, possibly DD&D that featured hot doug's and living easily 30mins from this place it took the better part of a year to finally get here. They close at 4pm and it seemed as though each time I thought "oh a hot dog sounds good I should try out that doug's place" - my luck I had these thoughts somewhere between 345-415pm! Fast forward about a year and now I live 5mins from HD! Hot dog heaven - yes Doug is dishing out gourmet yum-yum on a bun. They are creative and of the highest quality. I came on a random Tuesday and was able to sit down and enjoy a spicy italian something and some tasty fries. Silly me being a newbie I came back on a Saturday, and there was a long line out the door. I made the rest of my party wait over an hour promising hot dog ecstasy and Doug didn't make a liar out of me.
