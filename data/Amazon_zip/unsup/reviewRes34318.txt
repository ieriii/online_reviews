Good food cheap, that should be the Sultan's Markets new slogan. I'm no ad-man but that's short sweet and to the point.  Staff is awesome, delivery is fast, food is filling but not greasy or gross. The salad bar is dope and not too expensive. For beverages, try the Ting or an aloe vera juice. It can get a little crowded around eating time, but they have seating inside and out so don't sweat it. One of the guys behind the register was in an Aleve commercial too. So: good food, easy on the wallet and the possibility of seeing a celebrity. Go for it, brah, good food, cheap. You can't front on that.
