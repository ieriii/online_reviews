Finally a worthy Chicago brew pub aside from Goose Island, of course! This place was crazy packed when I went but I didn't mind. The beer was very good...I was disappointed that they were out of the Eugene. I so wanted to try it. When we finally got a table, I had the burger and fries....and they were outstanding....or was I just starving after a two hour wait....no....it was outstanding! Great job RevBrew....I'll definitely be back!!!
