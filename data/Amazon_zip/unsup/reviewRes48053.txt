Don't be scared vegetarians! I went here this past weekend was amazed with the food and the neat decor. We were in town for a mini vacation and my husband had heard great things about this place. Being a vegetarian, I took at the menu and cringed. But I agreed to go because my husband wanted to try it.  First off...try the Strawberries salad... it is now one of my favorite salads in the whole world It was simply amazing. Once I told the waiter I was a vegetarian, he said "the chef can prepare you a veggie platter! No problem!" It was delicious and had a wide variety of veggies and salad. It was REALLY good. All my other (meat eater) friends and husband LOVED their meals as well :)  Women: If you are creeped out by the bathroom situation, go to the Women's stall all the way to the right. You will understand once you get there. I thought it was a cool concept though! ENJOY! Highly recommend.
