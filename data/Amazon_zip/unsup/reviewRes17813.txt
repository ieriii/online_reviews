Fabulous cocktails, fabulous decor and fabulous seats-along with a fabulous wait staff. I LOVED the Violet Hour. If you get there early enough, like before 10pm, the wait is really not a big deal at all and even if you do have to wait it WILL be worth it. If you're a girl, try the vodka cobbler (pinker than pink, tastes like fruit punch), if you're a guy they have a very nice (mostly local) brew selection and whoever you are make sure you have the hummus with pita. Heavenly. The servers couldn't have been nicer or more attentive, the lighting and seating arrangements were just lovely and I am most definitely going back!
