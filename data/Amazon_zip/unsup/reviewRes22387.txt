Plenty of options to choose from. Menu is very extensive. Food was good! Especially if you like spicy food. For those that do not like spicy, do not fear, they have a large amount of non-spicy selections.  Love the complimentary hot tea and spicy cabbage. Ordered the crab Rangoon as an appetizer which was the best that I've ever had and the dry chili chicken which was also go, however felt that it needed some more sauce to add with the rice. Will definitely be back to try other entrees on the menu.
