One of the most unique and pleasant dining experiences I've ever had, hands down! Before I even get to the food you have to appreciate the restaurant itself. Upon arriving for my girlfriends birthday we sat at the bar and had a drink before we were seated. The bartender was very nice and recommended a great wine. Then, as if the host was watching us, the moment we felt like we were ready to seat he popped over, took our drinks, and seated us. The table itself was great too. Like all of the other tables in the restaurant they are all very spread out, so there is a great sense of privacy, but at the same time your don't feel like you are alone in the restaurant. The food...just an amazing experience. It was a 10 course meal. I'm not going to explain them one by one, that would take forever. But a few highlights were the trout with everything bagel (ice cream), the lamb, the cheese plate, and the dessert. Each course was brought by a served and then accompanied by our waited to thoroughly explain the dish to us. It was just perfect. They also made it special by giving my girlfriend her own "Happy Birthday" dessert. I would love to go back on they change up the menu. This is definitely not a place you can frequent because of the price, but a place you have to try at least once!!!
