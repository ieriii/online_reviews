My nephew had told me for years that this was a superb spot. Finally went on a Groupon and wish I had come years ago! Since we had the Groupon we ordered appetizers. We were going to split the green tamale (very good and easily enough for two) but when I saw the special of bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, I was a goner. Oh boy was that good! For entree, I had the special, which was pork medalions over potatoes cooked in a coconut sauce. I couldn't eat it all and brought it home ostensibly for lunch. By 10:00 am it was gone. Soooo good! My companion had the swordfish (even after I scolded him for eating an endangered species) and it was also excellent. Service was excellent. I was a little surprised at the decor, which was definitely cafe-esque and not upscale. The prices aren't exactly way upscale, but they don't quite match the decor. But then, we looked around and realized that the average age was about 25 and this is what the young folk like. Noisy, minimalistic, paper covering on the table instead of tablecloth, etc.  So I give it a 5 for food and a 3 for decor.
