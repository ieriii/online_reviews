Hot Doug's is a delicious cased-meat emporium. Even his hot dogs are considerably better than most other places.  But the real beauty of the place is the unusual and mostly delicious concoctions Doug creates.  The staff is very friendly, and Doug himself is always there. Friendly and personable, he often suggests getting the small drink with free refills if you're dining in. Some of the selections can be a bit pricey, but I think they're worth every penny.  Doug's is a great establishment with great people working there. What more can you ask for?
