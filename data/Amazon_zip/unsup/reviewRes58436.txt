My husband and I went for the all you can eat crab legs special on Tuesday night. It was amazing. We made a reservation and our table was ready the second we walked in the door. We knew what we wanted so we ordered right away and within 2 minutes the crab legs were in front of us. They were really hot, so we knew they were super fresh. The waiter was very attentive, even though the place was packed. We never had to wait for more legs. They were delish and huge! We also got a Bloody Mary which was great as well, but almost too filling since we were trying to binge on the crab. The tables are super close together, so if you have issues about personal space, coming during off hours might be a good option for you. The only negative thing I would say is that the parmesan crusted corn the crab legs come with was weird. It was a super tiny piece of corn and it was dried out like it had been sitting out for years. Not enough to take away a star since we didn't come for the all you can eat corn. I would come here all the time if we lived in the area, but def worth the trip every once and a while.
