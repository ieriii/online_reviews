Anything over two stars might be a paid review at least that is what it feels like to me after last night's meal. When I'm in PHX or NYC, I can count on Ruth Chris for a decent meal - but not my home store on Dearborn in Chicago. The kitchen manager and cook (not chef) are asleep at the wheel churning out poorly prepared meal after meal. My wife said the over abundance of orange pizzle on the calamari appetizer reminded her of Panda Express. My filet was undercooked and rare - "still had marks where the jockey was hitting it" - fits here. Steak has a high profit margin and should be a preparation lay-up...but not here. And NO, I don't want to wait for the waiter to come and and get it and have the cook, recook it. Don't waste my time. If you say your a steak place, then be a GOOD steak place and have it right the first time and cut back on the orange pizzle drowning my calamari or change your menu description to say "light fried, drowning in orange pizzle...." For me, I'm going to rely on the other neighborhood steak places and avoid this Ruth store until they get new folks in place.
