I'm a Chinese American who enjoys spicy food. Lao Sze Chuan is unfortunately the closest you can get in Chinatown for authentic Sze Chuan style Chinese food. However, the closest you can get is still far from being great.  I used to go there at least once a month. But the food quality has been going down hill for the paste few years. The taste is very inconsistent. The exact same dish could taste very different the next time you go. And the worst of all is their service. If you are Asian, especially Chinese, you will be treated very differently. Last time some friends and I went, the waitress came to our table several times and asked if we had done. We realized that there was a line at the door and we were the only Chinese dinners. I will never go to this horrible place again.
