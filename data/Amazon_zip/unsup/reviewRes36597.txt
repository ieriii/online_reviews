Indie was my third sushi experience. I thought I hated sushi until I came to this place. Apparently, all places were using unfresh fish and stringy nori. I couldn't believe people at that stuff! Then, I came here and I am a changed person.  Though, I feel sushi will be a taste I become accustomed to as I did with beer. Seaweed salad was a really fresh, and refreshing taste. They serve it in a martini glass with an umbrella.  I don't remember the rolls we got, but I can say with full confidence that anything you order off the menu here will be delish. It's BYOB and I swear, everytime we finished a bottle of wine and were moving towards our next, it was already uncorked--the waitress was that fast and attentive. The dessert menu was phenomenal. Green tea ice cream was a bit of a bust, but the mango cheesecake was creamy, fruity, and fresh, and the mango sorbet was smooooooth. Go with the mango!
