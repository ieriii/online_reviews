One of my favorite restaurants in Andersonville... if not the city. Have been for dinner once and brunch once. Both fabulous. The warm beignets with brunch are a great way to wake your palate up for the delicious-ness to come. I had the country breakfast with cheese grits to die for. For dinner, the shrimp and grits and their gumbo du jour are both good choices. The interior along with the food transport you to the South. You must go! I still have yet to try the desserts.
