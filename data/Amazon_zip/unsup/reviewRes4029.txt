The ultimate in culinary experiences. I say that, because I can't compare the courses I had the delight in tasting to anything I've ever had before because, quite simply, nothing has ever come close. Yes, it is BYOB. Yes, you will have to be persistent and patient for reservations. And when you finally visit Schwa, your face and conversation will be a mix of "How the hell did this creative genius THINK of this" to "Who the hell cares, it's perfection on my taste buds." Yes, yes, yes. Whatever the mix of confusion, awe and delight you experience, know that Michael Carlson will push the limit on the typical dining experience. And damn it, you will enjoy it. He's bold, will serve his delicious sculptural works of art himself, make fun of you to your face, and in my case, will announce and applaud his bacon distributor who happened to be dining at the same time. All to an enchanting lullaby of hip hop tunes. Random, but hot damn, it works. So relax, enjoy the gellee, hope and pray that you are privileged enough to taste the revelatory quail egg ravioli, crispy sweetbreads or whatever wonder is currently being offered, and enjoy the full sensory experience. You won't be disappointed. Bet you a Schwa 9-course meal on it.
