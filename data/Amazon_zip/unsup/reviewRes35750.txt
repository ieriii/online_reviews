HELL YEAH. Sun Wah is one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever been to. The Peking Duck is glorious of course. The bring a seasoned and broiled duck to your table, carve it up including slicing up strips of the crispy skin, and then take it away to make a soup and fried rice that is brought back soon afterwards. The duck is tender, moist, and flavorful. I love the duck legs. You combine the sliced duck with these soft pillowy buns, onions, carrots, radish, and duck sauce. DELICIOUS. Other dishes I recommend are the mussells (always good) and the Mongolian beef. Oh yeah, this place is BYOB. I recommend rice wine!
