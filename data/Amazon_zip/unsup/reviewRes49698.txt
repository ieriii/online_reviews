On a Sunday night, when it wasn't crowded, you'd expect the ample wait-staff to be all over us. Nope - we had to beg them to bring our drinks over after 10 minutes. We had to hunt them down for the check. And the food was only ok. 2 out of 4 of us thought theirs was too salty. The presentation was lackluster and the spinach was over-cooked and wilted. the cheeses were good but again the presentation was not enticing or beautiful. We had been here before and loved it, but it isn't the same.
