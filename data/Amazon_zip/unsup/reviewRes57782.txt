We went after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives which can sometimes be a gamble but this one paid off. We enjoyed the environment, service, and food. The shrimp & oyster po-boy was amazing and I don't even like seafood. My 12yo ordered it and I had the pot pie, mine was good but I wanted to take his after I tried it. My husband and other son had the chicken sandwich and the monte cristo, all delicious. We also tried the BBQ pulled pork nachos which were very good although my husband felt some of the chips weren't crispy enough, I loved it! I am looking forward to going back soon.
