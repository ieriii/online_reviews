The Staff at the dana is amazing... Adriano, a staff member, was the "hero of the night". I had lost everything i had on me.. And by an hour later..Adriano had everything back in my hands.. He is beyond a true professional and someone who goes beyond the job..... and i will be back to the Dana Spa And Hotel for any event because of Adriano.. XoXo
