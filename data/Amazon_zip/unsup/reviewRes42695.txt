The first couple of times I went there, I thought that this was the best stuffed pizza I had ever had. Wonderful.  However, the need to remove the sign that says "Pizza By The Slice" because they hardly ever have stuffed sausage pizza anymore. "Oh, were out and won't be another 30 minutes before..." OR "The kitchen is backed up and won't make any...do you want spinach instead?" NO, I don't want spinach pizza that has been sitting there for 2 hours. I have counted 7 straight times that I went there to see if they had stuffed sausage pizza...nada. I only go to see if they can prove me wrong, which they haven't. And it's on my way home. Their new slogan needs to be "Pizza by the slice...if we feel like making it" OR "Pizza by the slice if you are lucky." I call it the Art of wasting time in line. ***Update*** I just went in and was lucky they had some fine slices of Stuffed Sausage... Next time I go in and don't have to wait will increase their rating.
