My husband took me to Mercat a la Planxa for my birthday, and the food was unbelievably delicious. We tried the chef's tasting and received 13 different dishes. The flavor combinations were so interesting and even the traditional tapas dishes had a new, modern twist. The plating was beautiful, the service was warm and helpful, and the whole experience overall was outstanding. It's probably the best tapas I have had in the city of Chicago!
