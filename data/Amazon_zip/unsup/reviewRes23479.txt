Amazing service. The chef personally came to my table and served me a specially made crepe on my birthday. I'm writing this review 4 months later because it was such fabulous service. The entire party for my birthday didn't show up, but the staff graciously let us in the big tables we reserved. The chef would come and pour our glasses with wine (it's BYOB), and converse with us in his lovely accent and boy...did he, and the hostess and waiter, make my day. Bon appetit!
