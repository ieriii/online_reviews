Those 4 and 5 star ratings must be from newbies to this ultra-high end, beautifully elegant dining room. The calming white window coverings remain but the place is nothing like it used to be. Now dripping with pretense and outrageously large prices for outrageously small portions, the wonderful thing about Tru when it first opened and for several years after that was its elegance without presumption, its awe-inspiring presentations and fair serving size. Now what is billed as bone in ribeye as part of a 3 course $95 meal is 5 bites of thinly sliced meat. In a city known for its beef, Tru's beef option is the ultimate whimp out. Just take it off the menu if you are unwilling to man up.  The other entrees and first courses were good but not great and nowhere deserving of the price.  Although the servers are dutifully professional, they are cold and uncaring. Accents must be a job qualification to enhance Tru's snobbiness, even though you can't understand what they are saying. Yes, they still throw in a bunch of small extras but all those bells and whistles are designed to make you think you got more than what you paid for. Its a scam. Even the wine pours are miserly. When you order a $70 bottle of wine and are looking for another choice, the wine steward should be smart enough to show you similarly priced wines. Ours showed us wines from $120-$250. Now what used to be a wonderfully calming experience is an exercise in not getting ripped off. They even hawk their cook books on the menu. Not very Parisian or classy. A great touch was having the valet get my car without me asking. But that's not enough. I won't be back and won't be referring anyone else. Save your money for a restaurant that wants to earn it.
