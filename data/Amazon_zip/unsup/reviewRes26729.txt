We were visiting Chicago and wanted to find a good Mexican restaurant. I looked to Yelp for help-very disappointed. I am so surprised the number of people who rated this place great or even good. The flow of the restaurant is so messy and confusing to a new person. The service was very slow off the bat, menus dirty. But I have been to so many hole in the wall places I could try to over look some of these things. What can you expect? The prices are pretty cheap. Oh I can see why! The food was disgusting. We ordered quite a variety and the only thing that was "just ok" was the soup...who screws up soup? The meat they use for their carne asada tacos is Arrachera- which in my opinion is wonderful meat for dog food. Flavorless, fatty lumps of crap you simply (and politely) remove from your mouth with a napkin. The homemade tortillas? Hmmmm...I didn't care to much for them. I have had better. I always want to find a positive in everything...what is it for Nuevo Leon restaurant? Kudos to them for even having their own tortillas and GPS was able to easily find it from Downtown.
