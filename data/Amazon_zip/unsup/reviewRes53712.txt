Problems in paradise???I know one of the owners (I went to high school with him) and I was very excited to be able to try Crisp and catch up. I have to say my order of the Crisp BBQ was just okay, but my friend's Seoul Sassy wings were fantastic...I also cannot say enough about the onion rings. However, I was disappointed to find out that there seems to some tension at Crisp. I asked for my old friend and and was told that he just decided not to show one day and that was two weeks ago. Of course people change in twenty years, but this was not the person I knew back in high school. Oh well. I hope they reconcile whatever differences they have and open a Crisp in Schaumburg. Then I could enjoy the Seoul Sassy chicken on a regular basis....as well as the O-rings.
