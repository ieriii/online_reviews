Ok, since the economy i've really been in a recession but have enjoyed cooking at home. I'm never disappointed at home and i know nobody is playing with their hair and touching my food. So first time in a while i go out for brunch - first time being at The Publican. Very nice restaurant but i felt a bit crowded. The tables were too far to the wall by the kitchen, yet plenty of space in the center. The staff rushing through, i felt uncomfortable always in fear of getting hit or about to wear someone's meal. My salmon was delicious! The french toast and waffles didn't look appealing, my friends said it was below average. but the thing that was extremely disappointing was the fact that they have baby chairs, yet they don't have a changing diaper station. Oh well.
