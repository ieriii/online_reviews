Stop by here impulsively instead of heading for some Thai food. The crispy chicken was excellent. Moist and tender chicken with a delightful crisp skin/breading. Tis a bit expensive but worth it if you are looking for fancier fare up north. If you can travel Hot Chocolate in Bucktown seems better for the money.
