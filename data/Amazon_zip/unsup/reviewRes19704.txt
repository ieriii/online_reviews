I love this place! Its been open for a few months but finally I got to experience Xoco. The food was incredible. I went with a good friend we had some wine split a nicely sized pepito sandwich which was perfectly made. The wait was a little long, but once we got our food it was worth it. We also shared the guacamole and chips and had the churros for some dessert which were cooked to perfection! I will defiinitely be back to XOCO. I need to try their soups, other people in the restaurant were eating them and they just looked so good. Thank you Rick Bayless!
