Ok. Don't go for brunch on the weekend expecting not to wait. Duh.  I usually skip out of work on weekdays in order to enjoy this place. The pancakes are really yummy, especially the ones with the vanilla creme anglaise, but they're so rich, i can't stomach more than half of them. Usually i make my dining companion order something savory while i order the pancakes so we can switch halfway through. Otherwise, they're just too much of a good thing.
