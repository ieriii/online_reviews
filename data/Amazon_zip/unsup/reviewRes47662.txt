Gorgeous restaurant with beautiful wood work throughout, and a open bar area on top. Thoughtful layout with interesting space usage. I was especially impressed with the lounge on the second floor, bravo! We were there for a wedding and we had salad buffet & walk by servings of meat. I thought several things were good, but everything else was ok. The salad bar was average, HOWEVER, I did find a moldy blackberry present, and that was the end of my venture of the fruit plate. I really enjoyed their charcuterie plate & deviled eggs. I liked their lamb legs, pork roast & sausage. The dessert was disappointing, we had the marshmallow & fudge, and cake. They did not look appetizing, and proved not to be. The food was average even thought there were definitely good items in between. I expect more from this place due to appearances, and was slightly disappointed.
