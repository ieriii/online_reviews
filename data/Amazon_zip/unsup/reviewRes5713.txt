First there was Jimmy Bannos and his old school loop diner just nailing the New Orleans/cajun thang. With no formal culinary training he catches lightening in a bottle. Fast forward a decade or so and his son Jimmy Bannos Jr apparently knew where the old man hid the bottle. They strike again. Junior, with kitchen duty cred from the likes of Mario Battali has executed damn near flawlessly a rambunctious menu of small plates (get the milk-braised pork shoulder sitting on a large dollop of creamy mashers, chicken kabobs with a creme fraiche like sauce and sauted fingerlings or the steak/onion plates), artisan cheese, "smears" - spreadable pates' and a terrific, well priced wine list. The service is knowledgeable and efficient. Let them surprise you with the cheese and wine selection. Kyle knows from his pig and vine and cheese. I've been here five times and have not been dissppointed. Wait for the warm weather to hit and this place will blow up when they get their outdoor seating set-up.
