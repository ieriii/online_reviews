This place will leave you breathless. As in, you'll be out of breath from scarfing down your plate, your friend's plate, and your friend's friend's plate. And don't forget to pig out on the pickles and chips. So good! Only down side was that they didn't pack the BBQ sauces in our doggy bag so leftovers weren't as good.
