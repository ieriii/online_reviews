very cute decor and attentive service! My friend and I came here to bid adieu as she left for a semester in Paris. We shared two dishes, and the waitstaff was kind enough to split the portions in half and plate the two different menu items separately for us. The Zucchini flowers with marinara? Delicious! I had no idea zucchini blooms would taste so good! All in all, the meal was great and the service attentive! I'll be sure to head on back this way soon!
