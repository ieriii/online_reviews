Everything was terrific about my evening - food was delicious, service was impeccable - but the end of the evening dealing with the valet service made me never want to return. Valet service here has always been interminably slow. Just a fact of Grand Lux. I was excited when I came this evening to see that they offered a texting service. The card given with my claim card stated to text my claim number "5 minutes" before wanting my car. To play it safe, I texted 10 minutes in advance, immediately received an acknowledgement - then went downstairs and waited, and waited, and waited. While being given every excuse in the book - traffic (come on - it's 6:15 on President's Day - I encountered no traffic in the morning or evening), an ambulance, a large number of people wanting their cars (again, come on - at 6:15? I was there for a 4:30 dinner. A crowd to get their cars at 6:15 - right.) Nothing but excuses. A half hour after I asked for my car, it arrived - with all of my settings changed - seat, radio, heat. The valet people acted like I was absurd for thinking this was a long time to wait. Will not be back for that kind of treatment. Not with so many other great options within walking distance.
