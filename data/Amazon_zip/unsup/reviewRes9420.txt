I visited Sprout for the first time tonight, and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The highest highlights were the cocktails and beverage pairings, the service, and the white bean dip (comes with bread for the table). The courses were extremely tasty, but here and there somewhat lacking in flavor or "eat-ability" (Foie gras cannoli was especially difficult). All in all I left with a full tummy and an experience that met high expectations. P.S. Dale makes regular appearances in the bar area, and it was pretty cool to see him in person.
