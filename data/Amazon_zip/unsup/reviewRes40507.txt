My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night. They don't take reservations so we had to wait an hour. But it totally was well worth it. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The bar has a nice selection of beers, wine and cocktails. The food was amazing. However we had the foie gras and it wasn't my favorite. Let me tell you I've had numerous foie gras and it just didn't work for me. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the pork belly was as well. Dessert we had the creme brulee and it was superb. Definitely going back!! This place is hip and has great food!!
