absolutely the WORST restaurant experience i have had anywhere in chicago. prepare to pay $17.50 for the lunch buffet. that gets you luke-warm & cold food, overcooked lamb, stinky old salmon, overcooked chicken & other tasteless items. i came in at 2pm. i got wedged between tight tables with the asses of the servers in my face most of the time. they broke down both tables twice. my food got even colder while i waited 10 minutes for bread.  at 2:30 on the dot, they rushed me out. they took away my plate, asked if i wanted dessert, coffee without looking at me (i know they were dying for me to get out so they could break down the buffet) and took my water, too.  why? in the massive rush to throw me out the door, they charged me $176. oops. it took them 10 minutes to correct the mistake. i had to ask for a receipt of the void because i did not trust them.  why did i have to ask? when i left, no one said bye. no one even looked at me. i really think they should have comped my lunch. now i wait 5 business days to get my $176 back. the mgmt tells me "it is not our problem. take it up with the bank." shame on you, india house.
