Back again. Home-style pan-fried kidney and the twice-cooked pork with dried chilis (I think that's what it's called--it's actually what REAL twice-cooked pork, and not the crap you usually get in Americanized places, is like). Best things on the menu. The liver's great, too, as I said earlier. But I think the kidney and the pork have it beat. Pandas. LOLOL!
