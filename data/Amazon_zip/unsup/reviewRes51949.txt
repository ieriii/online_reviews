Wasn't sure if I should've given this place 3 or 4 stars. But since I was only here once, I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. My boyfriend and I really wanted to try Chicago-style pizza. And since this place was featured on Foodnetwork's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate," we thought we'd give this place a try. We walked in and were seated right away. I would've been a little upset if we had to wait, considering this place was two stories. Our server seemed like a bit of an ass, he rushed us in ordering and even got my beer order wrong. But then again, we've had problems with Chicago servers our whole trip. What gives Chicago? We ordered a medium supreme deep dish. It took a while to get out, but our server did warn us. When our pizza finally came, I was excited to dig in. The cheese was gooey, the sauce was hot, and the toppings were piled high. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the pizza, although the last slice was only OK because it cooled after a while. But aside from that, the pizza was tasty. I think my favorite was the crust. So yummy and crispy on the outside, but all soft in the inside. Maybe I'll come back if I were to return to Chicago, or maybe I'll search for another pizza place. Who knows? But at least I can now finally say I've tried Chicago-style pizza!
