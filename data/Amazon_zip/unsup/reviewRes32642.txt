The moment we walked into Sunda I knew it was going to be a great dining experience. The relaxed vibe and theme of Sunda was perfect. Their menu was very clear and all of our food came out quickly. We did have a slow start with our waiter and had to wait a bit for drinks & menus, but he was very attentive after that. There must have been a mix up regarding which tables were his. I would suggest Sunda for a few drinks and sushi or try their rolls and a entree. The price was mostly affordable for the quality and uniqueness of food. I can't wait to go back!
