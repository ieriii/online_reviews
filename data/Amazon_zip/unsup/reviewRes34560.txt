I enjoy Yolk, have been many times. We went on a Friday about 10:30, the place was packed. Our server came to our table and asked if we wanted coffee. I noticed on one of the menus that they had pumpkin latte, so I ordered that, and our server poured coffee for my husband. I was a little surprised when the latte came & it was the same size coffee mug that my husband had. His coffee was $2.55 & the latte was $4.49, which I would not mind, if, the latte was finished in 2 sips. I had corned beef hash, eggs, potatoes and 2 pancakes. The potatoes were cold on both my meal & my husband's Pot Roast Benedict. I didn't say anything cause I knew I was going to take them home. On the Benedict, the fruit was kind of swimming in the hollandise sauce. I had to wash all of it to use it at home. Huge portions, always good to take home. Service was just ok, I know we will go back, if you are hungry this is the place to go. Food is good, service, well, I've have better and I've had worst.
