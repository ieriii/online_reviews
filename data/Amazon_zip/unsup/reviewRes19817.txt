My friend raved about this place--the tortas amazing, the hot chocolate is delightful, etcetc. I went late on a Tuesday night and passed on both the tortas and the hot chocolate. I picked up a seafood caldo to go instead. To be honest, my soup tasted slightly like a soondubu jjigae and cost me $13. Sure that's close to what a soondubu costs in NY's Ktown, but there are a whole bunch of banchan (small dishes) that come with your meal and rice. I am not impressed. Maybe I will change my mind when I go back for the tortas and hot chocolate.
