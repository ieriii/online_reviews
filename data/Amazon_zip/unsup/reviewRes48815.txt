I think the only shocking thing about The Publican is that it doesn't have 5 full stars on Yelp. This place is so good that after we went home and went to bed, my husband fell asleep, woke up again, rolled over and said, "that was the best meal ever" and then fell promptly asleep again. The suckling pig and chicken were off the charts. We also loved the ham, lamb, and charcuterie plate. We gobbled up the mussels immediately, as they were fantastic (Bordain says don't eat mussles anywhere that you don't know the chef, but trust me this is the exception and he would agree). Obviously the beer is fantastic and the waiter helped me through the menu with kindness. What a great night.
