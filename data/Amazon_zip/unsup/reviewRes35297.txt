I am teetering between 4 and 5 bc its really a 4.5 in my book. I had an awesome experience here. We ordered 2 dozen oysters. They were great. Loved them! Tuna app- wonderful. Ceaser- good. Au Gratin potatoes- I mentioned them 7 times the next day- whatever you do, order them. Shrimp Cocktail- don't! That was the one item I was really disappointed with. I felt like they were pretty poor quality (like red lobster- style) for a restaurant of their caliber. Our Server, Dick, was really great. My date ordered 3 desserts for us to share. All of them were awesome. This place is really fun, nice but not stuffy and everyone that works there is super friendly. I had an awesome time here and think this is a great place to get no- nonsense seafood (sans shrimp) in an upscale yet friendly and comfortable atmosphere.
