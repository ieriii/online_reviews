Thinkin' Brazilian style Steakhouse? Then git yo' behind in to Fogo de Chao. I've been to countless places that attempt to replicate what Fogo De Chao's pulling off, many have come close. However, I always leave knowing deep down where my favorite is. They have an unbelievable salad bar. That's what sets them apart. Most have good quality meat, good cooks who prepare the meat nicely, and a solid selection with good service. I have found the salad bars to always be lacking. Fogo has a beautiful selection of antipasti style vegetables, a surprisingly impressive selection of above average meats and cheeses, and even some items that may surprise you (not bad sushi *for a Brazzeri). Do this ONE favor to yourself. After going to the salad bar, immediately flip the meat request tool over. For some reason I see a lot of people eat the salad, then order meat. I don't understand why. The meal is designed to be eaten harmoniously. Fogo de Chao is a magnificent restaurant that you've likely passed countless times and always been curious about,. It's a little pricey, but they have to cover their end since it's all you can eat. When your craving a fun, lively, meat fest, go to Fogo.
