Did that just happen?  It's not very often that I walk out of somewhere with that OMG feeling. But, this was an outstanding dining experience across the board.  We started with grilled calamari that was paired with a simple salad. Perfect. Calamari didn't feel like rubber. We shared the combination plate (although huge, probably the best way to go for an entree) with the skirt steak (their specialty) and baby octopus. The combo plate came with potatoes, yucca, and a fried plantain. It was perfect to share, and we left stuffed and fully satisfied for $30. If I wasn't with my mother I probably would have participated in the BYOB (wine only, and I don't even care).  Flawless and friendly service. I'll be back.
