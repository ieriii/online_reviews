Hosting staff, thank you for fitting our group at a booth at a very reasonable time. Being the dumbo that I am, I thought I made an 8:30pm reso only to find out I clearly made a reso for 11pm that night. The look on my face was priceless as I tried to comprehend what they told me. Nonetheless, my group to migrate to the bar area where we enjoyed drinks and appetizers and by the time the apps came out, the hostess kindly informed us about an available table, so THANK YOU HOSTING TEAM! You guys rock. First dinner for my first time in Chicago and I could definitely tell this was a pork kind of town. I loved the vibe of the restaurant, it was modern, yet had a very "homey" feel to it. I'm guessing they were going for the farm to table dinner gathering with the community seatings. I liked the booth seating enclosure which made you feel like an animal in a barn. I mean, if you had a sense of humor, which I do, it was amusing. What I absolutely loved: short ribs: nicely charred, sweet, yet oh so savory, perfection! Pork rinds: liked it, didn't necessarily love it. Suckling pig: bit on the dry side and more salty than I would have liked Mussels: creamy goodness and nice crunch from the celery bits oysters: how could you go wrong cheese platter: again, how could you go wrong Worth it for my first dinner in Chicago, being that I have high expectations?? I think so!
