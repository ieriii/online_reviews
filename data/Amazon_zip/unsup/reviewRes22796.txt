Ooooh I think I'm going to say it. Their hotdogs just might be better than Portillo's. It isn't as commercial as Portillo's and is classic Chicago. Their stawberry milkshakes are the REAL deal where chuncks of stawberries clog your straw. No artificaial powder flavoring used. Real good stuff that I miss.
