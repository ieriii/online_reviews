The highlight of Indie Cafe is the fried rice. It is the best I have ever tasted in my life. I get the classic tofu fried rice and my boyfriend gets the crazy basil kind nearly every time we eat here. They also make a delicious agedashi tofu though the serving size is small. The sushi is okay. They are currently displaying some really cool/creepy artwork inside worth checking out.
