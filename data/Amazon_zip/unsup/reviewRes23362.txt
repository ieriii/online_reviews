Icosium Kafe is my version of entering the gates of heaven. Every time i walk in i feel like angels are playing beautiful music with harps, in reality its my fat ass stomach grumbling so loudly, calling out to me to devour as much crepes as possible. Luckily for me i have never had a problem with the servers like many people have complained about....luckily for the waitresses as well, because i might have to smack a bitch if she delays me any time of eating my delicious crepes. I highly recommend the icosium crepe. When you cut a bite of it, make sure you further cut the vegetables inside so you get a mixture of all the vegetables, instead of just getting a bite of solely 1 type of vegetable. Also add a slight amount of the hot sauce and mix it up with the vegetables, it adds a nice kick. when ordering desert i personally LOVE the nutella crepe. I get the combination of STRAWBERRIES AND BANANAS with NUTELLA, On the menu it only says Bananas and nutella. The crepe is more amazing if you request the addition of the strawberries, because the sour strawberries and the sweet nutella is a perfect combination. Ask for a scoop of pistacchio icecream on the side. Trust me on this peeps. Try what i recommended and you will literally turn into a crepe crackhead. You will start scratching and contemplating on robbing people just to get enough money for your next fix... i as well suffer from this addiction :)
