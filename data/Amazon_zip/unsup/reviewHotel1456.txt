The Omni is spectacular. My husband and I had our wedding ceremony, reception, and post-wedding breakfast here, and couldn't have been happier. Rooms are very elegant and cozy but are "suites" (tiny sitting room) which seems very posh. More importantly, the service here is impeccable. Claire, our wedding coordinator at the Omni, did such a great job. One great thing about the Omni, as compared to other hotels in the area, is that the lobby is on the second level so there's not as much traffic from tourists.
