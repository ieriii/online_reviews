God this place was so close to five stars. Like 4.99 stars, but our server did not give me too great of a vibe. It wasn't even bad service, just she kind of audibly groaned when I asked if she could split the bill for two cards and there was some other totally reasonable request that she made an audible groan too. I can't go five stars. On to the food. The pizza is out of site. Haven't tried the stuffed yet, but the thin crust is absolutely mind blowing. To the point where while I was eating it at work the next day, I was depressed, because I knew when I got home, there would be none left. My girlfriend had the pork chops and I tried those. Also fantastic. I'm temped to try just about anything that the I could possibly ingest. I could probably eat there everyday of the week. Except it's a tad bit pricey. An update: I had the stuffed pizza today. My reccomendation is that you stick to the thin crust.
