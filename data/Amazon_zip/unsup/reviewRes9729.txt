I went here for brunch, and after looking forward to our dining adventure for about a week, I'm sad to say I was a little disappointed. First, there are shockingly few vegetarian options for a restaurant called "Sprout" - only two. If you're pescetarian, there's an additional choice for you. But the bloody mary comes with a surprise piece of meat in it, undisclosed on the menu (when every other garnish ingredient is listed). I ordered the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was excellent, the grits were dry and lumpy. Not so hot. I'm glad I got to check this place out, but it wouldn't be my first choice to go back.
