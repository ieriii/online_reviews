Second time here last Thursday and it was better than the first! We had a group of 8 people and were still seated within 30 minutes at a round table. We ordered 3 pizzas, a large polenta + ragu of the day, cripsy pork belly with apple mostarda, a cheese, prosciutto and another sausage, davanti burger, the linguine with crab and sea urchin and I think some more dishes although I can't remember...Definitely enough food for us to feel full. Pizzas were delish! Highly recommend to get at least one. Crispy pork belly was amazing, the combination with the apple mostarda adds exactly the right amount of sweet to complement the saltiness of the pork. Everyone loved the polenta + ragu, definitely a hit with the table. I got it the first time I went as well and loved it. This will be a staple of my future visits I'm sure. The decor is cute and cozy and works equally well for larger groups of friends as for dates with a special someone. Their wine is pretty great as well. We all split a bottle while waiting at the bar for our table and got another during dinner. Both were fantastic. The corking fee did throw me off a bit, but I suppose their wines are not that expensive to begin with so the higher corking fee makes some sense. This is a great addition to the Italian food on Taylor!
