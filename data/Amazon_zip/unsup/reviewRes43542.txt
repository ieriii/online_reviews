Adorable. I really enjoyed this place, however I didn't get a chance to stay long as they were closing in 15minutes. The cafe hours need to be updated in order to drive business in more accurately or not give people the feeling of being rushed once you start banging pots and pans around.  I ordered a simple chai latte and my friend had rhubarb coffee cake. Both tasty. I would be interested in trying some other items out on this menu.
