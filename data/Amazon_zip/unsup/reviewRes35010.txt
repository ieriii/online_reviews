Well hot damn, I'm NOW torn between 3-4 stars, because I've actually had a few things that were just not good enough to get past about 1-2 stars, but other things that have been very very good (the honey has to be the best i've had there so far, and other rolls are on par with what I'd consider typical for sushi in chicago), and they are quick and friendly. I just love that freaking honey roll, and usually at least 2 out of 3 of the other rolls we'll order are great, and usually one will be ok...so for the convenience and the relative consistency, and with how much I've ordered it, its gotta go on my go-to list The first time I ordered from here was a Thursday night I think - they told me it would be 45 min-1 hour. They were actually there in about 20-25 minutes tops, which is always a happy surprise! On the most recent order they got it to me in about 35 minutes, still well under the 45-60 estimate The only thing I REALLY don't like there is the spicy tuna, and that's been my gauge for how much I like a place generally so its hard for me to give this place tops ratings. The spicy element was a bit overrwhelming. I really can't tell but basically I've had much better. Also got the honey, which was great, and the godzilla (I'm not the hugest fan, cream cheese overload, but it was still pretty good). I have tried their California roll and something seemed off. We also just tried their Dragon (very good), Thai Stick (interesting), and spicy scallop (pretty standard) Overall, I'd recommend anyone at least give it a try for delivery if you live near here- 3 rolls and some endamame, which is enough to feed 2, will come out under $40, not bad!
