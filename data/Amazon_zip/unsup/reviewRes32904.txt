I visit Chicago 1-2 times a year and am always frustrated by how terrible vegetarian selections at "regular" restaurants are. (Seriously, making a good veggie burger isn't that tough!). This year, my hubby & I (he's a meat eater) found The Chicago Diner by a fluke and we loved it so much we went 3 times during our trip. It's located in a nice, clean neighborhood. Great service and it's obvious that both the servers & cooks really care about the food. The food is fantastic & made of high-quality, fresh ingredients. We haven't had one bad thing here. The prices are appropriate for the large portions. Even the beer selection & desserts are great. I'm vegetarian, not vegan, but I got the vegan cheese and was shocked. Most soy cheese I've tried is fair but this cheese is truely vegan-and awesome (and I'm a huge cheese lover). The vegan shakes are good and the peanut butter puck rocks. They use filtered, chilled water (no ice). I really wish I lived in the area as I would definitely frequent this place. I will be coming in every time I visit Chicago (at least once). My hubby even said that it's some of the best food he's ever had in Chicago and he's eaten some fairly good meat dishes. I highly recommend it-you won't be disappointed!
