Is it shocking that I had never been to Coast during the work week? Yes, I'm one of those people who always tends to be in a big group that waits for hours (yes I waited nearly 2 hours once for my friend's b-day celebration) so it was a nice treat on a Wednesday night to walk in and be seated. Immediately. I'm a fan of the dark, modern wood tones and chic atmosphere with a complete lack of attitude (ok, usually). Service is pretty good too though sometimes listening to the ingredients in all the daily specials can be a little much -- can I get that in writing? Even if its 80+ degrees outside I find myself ordering the spicy miso soup. This stuff is addictive...I love when they have the hamachi carpaccio appetizer too - 5 tender slices of fish with a little jalapeno. Spicy and oh so good. I guess I really like jalapenos and sushi as I'm writing this because one of my favorite signature rolls at Coast is the Popper roll. The dragon is divine and isn't as large and awkward as the dragon roll at other sushi haunts.
