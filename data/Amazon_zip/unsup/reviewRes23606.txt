I've eaten here four times and had the same thing every time: veggie puree soup, apple and baked brie crepe. So good. The crepe is so delicious that I literally have to remind myself (over and over again) to eat slowly, lest I gross out my dining companions by just straight up shovelin' it in. I could eat two of those things. And maybe someday when I go there alone (so there's no one to witness the gluttony) I will do just that. The people who work here are very nice and very attentive. The decor is pretty. And you really get a lot for your money. It's less than $10/person and everything is prepared with the kind of care and attention you usually get only at a really expensive restaurant. Great place.
