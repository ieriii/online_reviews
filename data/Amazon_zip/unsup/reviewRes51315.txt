Ordered 3 tacos meal and some ceviche to start. Highly recommend. They are not stingy with their guacamole. The beef and pork tacos were pretty good; packed with meat. But I thought the chorizo was a bit too salty for my taste. The service was great. We had a long day outside and drank about 5 pitchers of water. Our waiter kept the salsa and chips coming too. I'd definitely come here again.
