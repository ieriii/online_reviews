What I like about Carnivale... -The South American drinks are made well and tasty. -The dining room is, visually, extraordinarily vibrant. It's fun to look at. What I didn't like... -The food was nothing great. I had the rum glazed pork shoulder and fried plantains with Puerto Rican rice and beans. What you get is exactly what it says, and it sounds better than it is. There wasn't any interesting sauce or anything to go with it. It was kind of bland and dry. If you were to take away the fried plantain on the side; the dish would be hard to take seriously. The novelty of plantains can only go so far. My dining partners had similar sentiments about their dishes (at least one person had a beef dish, and another a seafood dish). -It's overpriced. The aforementioned pork dish was $19. Pork, rice, and beans; not prepared in any notable manner for $19. Hmmmm. It wasn't terrible; the guacamole was alright. If invited by friends I'd go back and try something else. Other than that I might only stop for a drink in the summer.
