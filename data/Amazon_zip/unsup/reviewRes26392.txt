I am not Vietnamese, but I love Vietnamese food (and have had it in Vietnam). Simply it is the best Vietnamese food in Chicago, forget Argyle (or Pho Tank for that matter). Most of what they offer is good, but my favorites are their sandwiches, I always take one to go whenever I eat there. The owner seems really nice and friendly and I am always offered hot tea an fruit whenever I am waiting to pick up food, which in the winter is really nice. However, what really sets them apart, is that, this is a very affordable good Vietnamese food and the place is actually clean. My only complain is that they dont always have basil with their pho in the winter and that sucks!
