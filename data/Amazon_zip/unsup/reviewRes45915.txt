I haven't been here in over a year or so but if I still remember the food and that I still crave the awesome creme brle, you know it was just that good. I had the salmon entree. It was fantastic. Light and flakey like all fish should be. The mashed potatoes were perfect, not too heavy. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and the creme brle was heavenly. The decor was also very nice and the atmosphere was very enjoyable. I think this may have been one of my best Resturant experiences ever.
