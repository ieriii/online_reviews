Okay, normally I love this place. The food is great, the atmosphere is good, the waitstaff is nice...but last night we had a bad experience with customer service. Our bill was $39 and some change, and the server seemed overly eager to collect our money, coming back twice before we were organized and ready to pay. I paid for part of it with what was left on a visa gift card, plus some cash, so that I gave her $52 and some change. She only came back with the credit card receipt, so I asked our change and she referred me to the cashier. I asked the cashier for our change, figuring it was just a mistake. I KNOW I was being super nice and smiley about it because I had just had a good meal and was feeling good. I didn't realize that they had tried to keep my money ON PURPOSE. She started yelling at us in Korean. My friend, who speaks fluent Korean, turned to me with a very distressed expression and told me the cashier was calling me cheap. I think what the cashier REALLY said must have been far more offensive and possibly racist (I'm white), because once we got back in the car my friend was really upset the entire ride home. She didn't even want to translate what the cashier had really said. That is just rude and uncalled for. A patron has a right to their change before they leave a tip. I proceeded to leave a 20% tip because at the time, I thought I was inconveniencing them, and our waitress seemed apologetic. I hope that tip went to the waitstaff, especially the awesome busboy, and not to that vulger cashier. My friend was so distressed it ruined our night, because when someone upsets my friend, they upset me too. We did not splurge on a nice dinner to leave forlorn and offended.  I was not surprised to log onto Yelp and see that I wasn't the only customer this place ripped off by assuming absorbitant tips. I know I'll never go there again, their behavior is just selfish. I hope word of their dishonesty and offensive nature becomes well known.
