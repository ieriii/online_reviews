Okay, so I don't get what all the fuss is about. I've eaten twice at Bongo Room, both times shortly after I moved to Chicago. It was the first name out of people's mouths when i asked for brunch suggestions, so I was really excited. But I must say my experience was nothing more than average. The food's fine, (a little on the theatrical side presentation wise, but nothing extraordinary as far as taste goes), the wait's crazy, the servers are harried, and the tables are pretty cramped. I decided to try it another time on a week day, but nothing changed other than the wait. The city has a huge number of places that are more worth your time.
