Food is alright, but their desserts are out of this world! YOU MUST TRY THE CHOCOLATE CHIP PEANUT BUTTER MILKSHAKE =)!!! Go on off hours, otherwise expect the service to be a tad slow or rude. You can park on the side of the building for free on weekdays I think after 6 which is nice since the area is limited street parking.
