As soon as you walk in you immediately want to throw a party. Great atmosphere and great colors in such an amazing space....and the food definitely follows suit. I would highly recommend the Ropa Vieja appetizer. It has a delicious beef base with the most surprising taste of plantain hidden at the bottom. Your tongue defintiely makes you want to parade in the streets of Rio!
