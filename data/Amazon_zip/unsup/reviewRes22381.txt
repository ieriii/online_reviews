I grew up in Norwood Park so this if of course a favorite of mine. The hot dogs you cannot get anywhere else (and i'm truly serious about this). They have there own recipe for hot dogs, and it really is the best. What I love most about Superdawg is the way the dogs and sandwiches come. In a box, with fries,and a pickled tomato. The fries a fresh and have there own flare. But one of the BEST things about superdawg are there shakes. They're thick, rich, and delicious. If your trying for one of the best dog places in the city, Superdawgs is defiantly one of them.
