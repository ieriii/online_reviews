I love this place. The pasta is always a good choice but they do have other entrees like sandwiches and salads. You get a really good portion I usually have enough leftover for the next day. It is very reasonably priced. I love the bowtie pasta with the chicken (I forget what it is called). It is usually quick to get your meal. The place is a little small and sometimes you might have to wait 15 minutes to get seated, but it is worth it. They also do delivery which is kind of nice.
