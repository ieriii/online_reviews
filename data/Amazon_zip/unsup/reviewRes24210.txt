You know what I hate? Fake Latin food. You know what I love? Irazu Restaurant. After living in the midwest for over three years, I have finally found a Latin American restaurant that comes close to the authentic food I grew up eating. A friend of mine and I asked someone we met at the Bucktown Art Festival where we should eat our next meal in Chicago, and she suggested Irazu. "Really good, quick, and authentic" is what she said. And boy was she right. We walked into the incredibly busy restaurant on a Saturday night, starved and ready for some deliciousness. I ordered the special of tilapia tacos, which came loaded with rice, beans and plantains. We also ordered chips and salsa, and chicken ticos. The beans were just like my mother makes them -- cooked down for hours, and flavored with plenty of onions and salt. My tilapia tacos were messy and simply flavored with grilled onions and cilantro. The tilapia was fresh and cooked to perfection. I have to say I was surprised, too, since they were so jammed with to-go orders and in-house diners. Service was funny and friendly despite the craziness inside. The guys behind the counter let us try their special drinks on the house, which were sweet and surprisingly tasty (I'm not a sweet drink fan traditionally). Next time, I will definitely order one.  If I lived in Chicago, Irazu would be a staple. As it is, I will be convincing my Chicago friends that we'll need to visit this hole-in-the-wall next time we're visiting. Everytime "Chicago" is mentioned in our house, "Irazu" shortly follows, and my husband is on the verge of making a special trip out to Chicago just to try this place. Really, he doesn't know what he's missin' yet!
