Visited Shaw's on our first night in Chicago, for the New Year holiday... the staff was friendly and cordial, and atmosphere unique. We were easily accommodated, for a later dinner (without reservations), and chose to sit on the oyster bar side--a cool venue, with a near identical menu as the traditional restaurant seating side (on the left). I ordered a cup of clam chowder soup--which was DELISH, and thoroughly enjoyed the Cesar salad with crab cake entree--comprising a generous and tasty portion of both. We will definitely return to Shaw's on future trips to Chicago!
