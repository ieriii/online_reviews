I have been to Carnivale several times because I like the food, but I do not think I am going to go back again because of the really bad service that i received last night. I wanted to have the Chuleta but when I started ordering the server told me that they serve the pork "medium" but wanted to know if I wanted it cooked a different way. I thought this was strange because pork is a meat that NEEDS to be cooked thoroughly...when I questioned her about it she was very short with me which is completely unacceptable because asking if eating semi-raw pork is safe to eat is a reasonable question...in my mind. Since I didn't have anything verified by my server I decided to have the Pernil instead. I've had this dish before and it's delicious...but has a fundamental flaw: NO VEGGIES at all it it and no veggie garnish...they literally serve rice with beans, sweet plantains and the pernil so I generally ask for a little bit of the house salad garnish on the plate just to cut some of the fat/sweetness on the plate and they usually understand and oblige. Last night the server REFUSED. I asked her if I could just have a few leaves and she STILL said no even when I told her that It had been done about 6 times before as an alternative she suggested that I pay 10 dollars for their heirloom tomato salad and have that served with the meal...I asked her if I could have a 1/2 portion because I did not want to pay 10 bucks for something that (in my opinion) should be on the plate as a garnish or a part of the dish anyway. nope, no 1/2 portion. When the dish came out it looked way different that how i've had it in the past...this time it was topped with a top of chopped up olives (who the hell does that to pernil???) Also...Everyone else at my table had salad as part of their dish OR as a garnish and was nice enough to chip in and give me some which made the dish better..it was a ridiculous/unnecessary when all the kitchen had to do was give me a few goddamn salad leaves.
