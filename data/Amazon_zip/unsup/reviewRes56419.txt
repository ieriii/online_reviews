I order takeout from Simply It at least once a week. The food is consistent and fresh. My favorite dishes include Pho and the shrimp spring roles. I've also tried many other menu options and am always pleased with my meal. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience, and no one can beat 30 minute delivery. I've been to the restaurant a few times and find the experience just as warm and inviting. Simply It is simply the best Vietnamese food in LIncoln Park.
