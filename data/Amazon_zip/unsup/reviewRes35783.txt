We called ahead for the Beijing duck, and they were eagerly waiting for us when we arrived. I wonder if they asked everyone who walked in around the same time "are you Evan?". So glad we were, in fact, Evan as this was such a delicious and fun experience. The carver/owner's daughter was super friendly and helpful, and described the 2 home made hot sauces as "kill me now" and "kill me later". We found both delicious, and not too spicy at all. They are so addictive, in fact, that we bought a container of each to bring home! We lived in San Francisco for 9 years before Chicago, so we have a very high bar for authentic Asian food, and this is something we will have to hunt down when we move back! For once, Chicago is on the forefront, leaving SF in the dust!
