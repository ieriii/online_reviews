Someone told me not to go grocery shopping when I'm hungry, because then you buy everything you see. Okay, so how come no one said don't go into Shaw's hungry because you will order everything on the freakin' menu! The seafood here is fresh. The ambiance terrific, the service, great. I stopped in for lunch. I ordered the Jambalya cup, calamari, crab cake, and fried shrimp, and topped it off with a Corona Light. Oh sooo scrumptious. The shrimp were incredibly large and I could still taste the sea in them! Luckily for me I got mostly circles and not legs for my calamari...excellent! Side note, the bathrooms are quite nice. I love the type of hand-towels/napkins they use. Very nice touch. I will be back!
