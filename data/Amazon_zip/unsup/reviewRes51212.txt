I sort of just stumbled into this place. My boyfriend and I were just looking for a new place to eat and sure enough we found Wishbone. Upon entering I was worried that the food would just be regular old diner food but its diner food with southern flare. I ordered the rainbow trout with asparagus and salad. The salad side was sort of soggy and just not too good but the trout and the asparagus hit the spot. I wanted something light and that it was. The fish was fresh and flavorful. Their chocolate shakes are pretty good as well. Some of the dishes were expensive but most were fairly reasonable. The service was also pretty on point. As soon as we sat down our server told us about the special draft of the month down to the specific flavors. Loving the various flavors of beer his description was really nice. I didn't end up ordering it but I was just impressed in the servers beer knowledge. Overall this place was pretty good, and I will for sure go back to this place.
