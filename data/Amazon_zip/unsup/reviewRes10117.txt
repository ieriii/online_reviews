All I heard when I told people I was going to be visiting Chicago is: "eat deep dish!" ... well after a week in the windy city, I did find pizza love, and NOT in the form of a million-calorie cheese-drowned pie the city is known for! Instead it was a New Haven-style pizza thin, delicious, sans tomato sauce, simple, wonderful piece from Piece. I was introduced to this place thanks to the food tour I took so by the time we ended up here (stop #4) I was almost painfully full. That did not stop me from loving the pizza so much we made plans with friends to meet at this very same place on this very same day for dinner. Unfortunately, I should have listened more closely to our guide when he informed us that the laid back and spacious atmosphere we enjoyed in the early afternoon was a far departure from the crowded over one hour wait for space to eat, let alone drink at the bar it would be come 7 pm on a Thursday night.  Sadly, the rest of our dinner party wasn't as gung-ho as I about waiting it out for dinner. Now I can only sit at home 4500 miles away and reminisce about the thin, crispy then slightly chewy crust, garlicky, slightly cheesy and wonderful piece. http://www.yelp.com/user
