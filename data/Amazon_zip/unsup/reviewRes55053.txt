Hands down one of my favorite places in the city! The food is beyond amazing and the atmosphere is great. Not to mention the $4 house wine is delicious. Things to try: Blue cheese fondue, balsamic bread, the mussels (the juice is phenom), and the pot roast. But you can't, I repeat CAN'T, miss out on their carrot cake. The best I have ever had!
