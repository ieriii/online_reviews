Always consistent, and always fun. It's crowded, it's loud, and there's a ton of energy. And that's exactly what I expect from a neighborhood popular restaurant--if the food wasn't great, it would be empty and quiet. The food is always fantastic, and it changes constantly. Whether it's a salad, pasta, or a main course you won't leave hungry and you won't be disappointed. My other favorite part is feeling like your part of multiple conversations along the way. Cozy up to the neighboring table and you'll find something interesting to chat about.
