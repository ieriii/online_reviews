One standout saved this dinner from spiteful one stardom, salted beets. Fantastic, salted beets with mascarpone cheese (or similar). One of the first innovative dishes I have had for some time in the context of "American" or bistro dining. Otherwise, everything else was really salty, and/or poorly executed. The olive oil cured tuna with gigandes was just ok; the hunks of tuna were oddly hewn. The cheese plate came with two large pieces of cheese and three wee pieces of bread. Likewise, the octopus was only two small pieces, not exactly matching the waitress's description. Finally, and the real dealbreaker, we sat outside on the patio, which seemed lovely in the first 10 minutes. Seven large mosquito bites later, and one massive spider crawling across boyfriend's button down was enough. The trees and foliage are too close to the tables, resulting in te spider and mosquito incidents. When we asked whether we could move inside due to the insect invasion, we were informed it would be 30 minutes...while we accumulated more mosquito bites. PP started out well and then crashed and burned. I won't be back.
