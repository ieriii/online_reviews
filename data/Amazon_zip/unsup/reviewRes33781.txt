Mmmph brunch is the best meal of the day. Yolk has some big portions. I purposely took a convoluted path to the bathroom so I could walk around and spy on people's food. I got the TUSCAN FRITTATA and it was delish and covered in goat cheese (even better). Definitely spring for a glass of STRAWBERRY ORANGE JUICE and try not to chug it because it's so good.  If you get an omelet, be warned they are are football-sized. My only criticism is I feel that a nice place like this should have better jam and butter instead of the kind you get on an airplane.
