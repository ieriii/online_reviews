I Love this place! I walked by this place a dozen times before i realized it was an actual bar/lounge. No windows and no sign but i think it makes it more interesting. The interior is amazing the drinks are equally amazing. I give it 4 stars because it is a bit pricey but i guess i understand why these are not your ordinary drinks you get anywhere. Great place to take a date.
