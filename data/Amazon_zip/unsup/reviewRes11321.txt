Easily my second favorite pizza place in Chicago. I can't tell you how good this place is. Thin crust in Chicago is one of the best if you can find a good place that does it right. This is one of those places. Wait time was a little ridiculous only cause it was a Saturday night to seat 4, but our man Aurthur at the door hooked us up. The people are super friendly especially Aurthur. Say hello to Aurthur when you go, he will make your night! Great drink selection, great thin crust pizza, great environment! Chicago style pizza is over rated! GO GET ARTISAN STYLE PIZZA, chicago has some of the best!
