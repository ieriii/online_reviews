On a random weekday, we all decided to have Italian food at this place. There were good reviews so why not. I tried their octopus which was a small portion but seasoned and cooked very well. I wish there was a bit more food, but if it tastes good, I'm ok with that. We ordered lots of antipasto to share and it was good. We also shared some pizza so that good too. I have to go back to try more dishes.
