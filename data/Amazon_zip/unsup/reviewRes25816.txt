Well....my boyfriend and I stopped in here, prompted by the plentiful Yelp reviews and high rating as we passed through Chicago on our way from NYC to rural IL for a wedding. We ordered two salads and a small deep dish pizza with black olives to split. The salad was hard to eat. The lettuce was tough and tasted very bitter. The pizza...was disappointing. Granted we are used to thin crust pizza(I am a waitress in a place that serves amazing brick oven thin crust pizza) or the thinner crust regular NYC style pies, but the thing that bothered me about this pizza was that the crust, like the part under the cheese and sauce I mean, was very sweet. I also felt that there was a ton of cheese on the pie and not that much sauce. The one very good thing about this pizza was the outside crust. The cheese and bread caramelized to form this amazingly tasty crunchy ring around it. I wish the whole pizza tasted that irresistible! Service was unwelcoming. There were college kids working there and the hostess rolled her eyes a lot and they huddled in the corner chatting and eating cereal from a ziplock bag while leaning all over the bar and looking generally miserable and unenthused- the kind of behavior that would get me in trouble at any of the places I worked.
