I love 90 miles! The perfect summer patio dinner adventure. Just a short walk from my house, so I am sure to be back soon. I really recommend their garlic yucca fries. And their plantains. And their goat cheese empanadas. I was not too impressed with their veggie sandwich, which lacked flavor and seemed at most like a sloppy mess of vegetables. Next time I will be ordering an assortment of appetizers or sampling the vegetarian plate, which I am sure will be fabulous. They are also a BYOB--so bring in an alcohol treat to enjoy with your dinner. My group brought in a bottle of rum and for $10, 90 miles whipped us up a fresh and lovely mojito pitcher.  I glanced in the kitchen on my way to the bathroom and lots of hard workin' going on. The owner also was out checking on tables and was super nice. What I love to see. A must try for authentic cuban flavors that fit the bill for vegetarians. Give this place a try!
