Excellent Beer selection. Would probably go back just for that. Read the other reviews about the poor service but our waiter was pretty good. He was helpful and very knowledgeable about the beers and food. The food was very flavorful, we had the country ribs (very tender) and some kind of duck pate like dish that was very tasty. There was two of us and had 5 beers total, 1 entree, two appetizers and an excellent waffle desert and it was about 90 bucks. A little pricey, but I feel it was worth it.
