"EXPOSED BRICK THEORY" : My presumption that any establishment which has exposed brick within the dining area will be a place I will enjoy coming back to. So far, it holds true. "Table for four" on a Saturday night at 8pm. "Hour and a half or so" says the hostess. We stake out a nice cozy spot next to the fireplace to drink while we wait. I was about to head to the bar to until a server walked up and took care of us. With RevoBrew's rotating selection of beer, you're bound to find one you enjoy. It was my first visit and being a big beer geek, I wanted to sample them all. GUESS WHAT? I DID! Two Dollar 5-ounce samples are available for all their homemade brews! I was a big fan of the "Baracus"...an Imperial Stout weighing in at a healthy 11%. We also ordered the Bacon Popcorn appetizer to tide us over. Bacon, crispy sage, and shredded parmesan....Yes.  I practically forgot we were waiting for a table! I felt like the drinks were arriving seconds after my ordering them, and it looked more packed than Kuma's Corner in here...how is this even possible? I was impressed at how our waitress was ON POINT. I was even more impressed that we even had a waitress in the "waiting-for-a-table-but-there's-no-room-to-sit-at-the-bar" area. Half a dozen beer samples later we are seated. I managed to consume the following: -Cheddar Ale Soup (Tasty...I detected sharp cheddar FTW!) -Smoked Pulled Pork Sandwich (Awesome, had spicy bite to it, great spicy 'slaw included...would definitely order again!) -Farm Burger ('twas good, had a fried egg on top) VICTORY.......Victory in the sense that for the first time ever, I was exhibiting textbook symptoms of a full-blown FOOD COMA before even receiving the check. FAILURE.....Failed to save room for dessert. -Excellent layout. -Awesome beer selection (they have a huge selection of craft beers if you don't want a Revo' brew) -Great service. I'll definitely be back here! ...but I already knew that the moment I saw the bricks! ;)
