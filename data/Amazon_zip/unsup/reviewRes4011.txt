It's only fitting that this is my last review of the year. As Schwa is one of the finest dining experiences I've had all 2010. Like everyone else has confirmed, it is near impossible to get a reservation for Schwa. Once you pass through all the hoops, you get a call back. Then the waiting begins. It is certainly worth the hoops and wait. The staff is amazing, cool and casual. They explain each course in detail. But not in a haughty way. We had the 9 course menu, which in my opinion is the only way to go. The Amuse: Bloody Mary. Kind of. It was a shot of infused dill pickle vodka. I think. That's pretty much how the night went. The chef would bring each course out and we would puzzlingly stare at the plate, smile at Chef, wait for the Chef to leave and whisper: "Did he say "Biscuits and Gravy?" Yes. Yes he did. Biscuits and Gravy. Schwa style: Sweet Breads - Red Rye Gravy - Mustard. The Smores were a highlight as there is now photo of me out there somewhere licking the dessert glass. Yes. Licking. Beef Mole - Graham - Marshmallow - Campfire Schwa is five star inventive dining with a relaxed vibe. Don't forget a 6 pack for the boys in the kitchen, who, are kind of swoony by the way.
