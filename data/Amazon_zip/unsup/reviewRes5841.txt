Cute restaurant. Stopped by last night. We were told the wait was 45 minutes but we got seated in 15. Food was yummy--cheese board thing, anchiove appetizer, suckling pizza. We also had a chocoloate dessert with crunchy bottom, hazelnut mousse and chocolate nibs that was the BEST dessert I've ever had. Anywhere. EVER. The food came fast and the waiter was really nice. He gave us good opinions on the food, what we should order and suggestions of additions to our order. He was right and I really appreciated his guidance. The prices were good too.
