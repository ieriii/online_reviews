Wow. Where do I begin? We arrived early and they were ready for us. I have never eaten at a place where the service was as impeccable. We never wanted for anything. We never felt rushed, yet we didn't feel like it was slow. They truly do let you set your own pace. We had fun with the waiters and never felt as if it were a pretentious atmosphere. Contrary to what most people on yelp suggested, we did try the wine pairings, since it was our first time there. The pairings did not disappoint. Each course was brilliant in its presentation, ability to interact, and the imagination was such that we had never seen before. The flavor profiles of each dish were perfect. I have a hard time choosing my favorite dish. We can see why alinea is at the top of its game and commend the masterminds behind this well oiled machine.
