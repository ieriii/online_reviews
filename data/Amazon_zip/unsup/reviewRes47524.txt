One of the best dinning experiences I've had in the city! If your looking to impress someone, who has upscale modern taste then this is your venue. As long as said person isn't a vegetarian.    As stated the decor is modern and gives off a definite upscale vibe. The servers are extremely attentive and did a great job explaining how the ZED works. The food was amazing. You start with a buffet that features unique fusion type salads and gourmet quality meat & cheeses. Afterword, you put a little stone on the table and servers immediately rush to your table with almost every kind of meat you can think of. Steak, Pork, Sausage, Swordfish, Salmon, and a few I can't even remember. If your own a low carb diet (which I'm not) this is your heaven. The meal was about $50, but as so often is the case in life, you get what you pay for.
