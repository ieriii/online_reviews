Okay, so, Superdawg Drive-In lived up to all my expectations ... In my opinion, as far as a hot dog meal is concerned, I can buy a package of "franks" at Jewel and hot dog buns with poppyseeds, boil some water, maybe add a side of kraft macaroni-&-cheese, corn-on-the-cob, slice some fresh tomatoes from the "Farmer's Market" & call it a SUNDAY! Well, my boyfriend bummed up his knee getting off an intertube at Magic Waters last weekend; and, well, so, I finally gave in to his secret Superdawg desires ... Yep! We took that Sunday drive over to the place where only the lonely park their cars and pressed that little black button to place our food order right from the passenger seat of our lazy arses!!!! 3 Superdawgs & a Chocolate Malt later, we were sittin' like full-bellied movie stars; trying to figure out which way to turn out of this fine dining establishment. Once we recollected our brains from our food coma, we somehow managed to not get into an accident getting out of the joint! This hot dog was thick, juicy, tasty, a little snap to it's casing, & a nice delectable bun- plus, our server/& hostess on the mic were both extremely accomodating and charismatic/charming which added to the enjoyment of our in-car dining experience. My boyfriend wanted to buy the "light-up Superdawg Hat" souvenier that they sell; and, me, being the consciensious money-saving grub said "no, honey".... I may have to remember that obnoxious request for his Birthday which is coming up and just surprise him ?!!!!
