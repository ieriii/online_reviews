I won't claim to be a deep dish pizza expert since I've been to Chicago on this one trip and only had the chance to try Lou Malnati's and this here Giordano's. Giordano's won the battle of the two for me. Shared a small beef pie with the hubby and had leftovers. On a Thursday night the wait was really long, they have you check-in at the hostess then order your pizza at the counter then the 30 minute wait began. After being seated the pizza came pretty quickly and the service was attentive. The pizza was amazing and cheesy, yum!
