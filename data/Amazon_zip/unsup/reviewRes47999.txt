Went here for my birthday and it was perfect! The Pork Rhines were decent, not sure why everyone goes crazy about them in the yelp reviews, they are essentially a cheeto with a lot less cheese and way more puff... I probably won't get them again. The pork belly was amazing! It was very tender and melted in my mouth! I almost licked the plate clean.. The old style ribs were also amazing! You didn't need to get your hands dirty, they were plenty easy to eat with a fork and knife, it's not like your typical ribs. This was all meat and one bone.. This was our favorite dish! The atmosphere is pretty cool, community seating at a big table with a bunch of random people can be a bit weird, but it's loud enough where you don't overhear everything they say. Also at the end of our meal they brought out an amazing cupcake for my birthday! It was one of the best free desserts I've ever had at a restaurant. I'll definitely go back to try some more of their dishes, they had a lot of choices.
