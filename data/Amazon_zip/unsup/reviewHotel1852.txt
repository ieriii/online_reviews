Not a fan of this place. The staff had a very lazy attitude, terrible customer service, waay overpriced, the room was blah, no special perks. I asked for an Ipod speaker thingy and they couldn't even come up with that. I will not be staying here again. Whack. The lobby is gorgeous, but that has nothing to do with the W, as the building is a turn of the century gem.
