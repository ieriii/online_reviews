I hate it when people try to twist an original but, when they do it right, it's just fine by me... On my flight out before heading back to Chicago, my brother suggested we stop by Hot Doug's to grab a few. You can't leave without trying. At first I was skeptical because it was a 9am conversation about gourmet hot dogs. I said, "Fine." As we arrived I was amazed to see a line of people already waiting to get a bite at a Hot Dog place? Strange.  Well, needless to say, I was amazed. We didn't even have a normal hot dog. I can't even remember the stuff we ordered but we had 7 Hot Doug's specials between us two with fries and drinks. I was inclined to order one just to have on the way to the airport. No Chicago eating experience is complete without this place.  Strangest Hot Dogs on Earth but, it's one of the best I've had.
