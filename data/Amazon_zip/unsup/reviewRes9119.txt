Oooooh, I think I should've been born Persian! I am absolutely in love with eggplant and they surely meet my eggplant needs. The food is always super delicious and hot and the prices are decent (except the fish, eek!). I've never actually gone into the place (I will one day soon!!!) but I can totally 100% vouche for their delicious meals!!! Anything from the Hummus, to the Aash soup, to the Eggplant plate is absolutely wonderful but is probably contributing to my winter-hibernation weight gain a few months to early. Nonetheless, I shall keep buying yumminess from this place for as long as I live remotely close to them.
