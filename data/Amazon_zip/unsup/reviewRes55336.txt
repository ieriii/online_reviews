Hungry and confused. How is it that I have anxieties about going to my favorite restaurant? Love the food, the service scares me!! I have been a loyal costumer for a year and a half now. Lately I get the same old waitress with no social skills who waits on me every time. I have requested other servers but for some reason she always waits on me. When I first started going to noon o kabab I had random servers.Just as good as the food is so was the service. Maybe I'm just too good of a tipper and thats why I get hoarded by a senior waitress. I don't feel comfortable there anymore. Thats why I am strictly going through the delivery. It's a shame that this gem of a restaurant lacks in service.
