The funny thing about this place is that the line makes the experience THAT much better. Look at the starved faces around you...with people pressing their faces into the glass windows to see inside. As you inch closer, you see an opening to step inside. Finally getting up to order is like totally a Harold and Kumar moment. This place is amazingly creative and unique! Definitely check the menu out while you're waiting in the line that usually wraps around outside. I got the duck hot dog with the foie gras mousse on top with some sort of Dijon mustard and something truffle. The hot dog itself was great, but to be honest besides the novelty, foie gras mousse is a little too heavy for a hot dog. But, I LOVE the different options offered here, and the menu choices always make my mouth water. I tried my friend's kangaroo hot dog with passionfruit relish (yum!) as well as like a mountain game mix hot dog which was also flavorful. So great options for those who love creative and aren't afraid of trying something new. And okay normally, I'm a huge fan of duck fat haha.. I love French duck confit and stuff, but the duck fat fries were just ultra greasy normal fries. And I didn't detect any flavor difference besides grease. So I would skip these because they just made me feel sick after. Definitely try out this glorious hotdog emporium... I can quickly foresee this place becoming a serious addiction.
