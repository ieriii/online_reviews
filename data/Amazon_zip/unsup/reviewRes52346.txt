When it comes to the big three, Gino's/Lou Malnati's/Giordano's, I would say this place emerges victorious. Wating an hour for a pizza to cook is worth every minute once it finally hits your tongue. The cheese, sauce, and toppings go together great with their crust, making an all in all delicious. Only reason it's not five stars is because that's reserved for Art of Pizza.
