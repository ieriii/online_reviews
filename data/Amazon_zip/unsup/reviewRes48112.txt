Long wait, but worth it. Great concept...very similar to a German-ish pork and seafood tapas experience. It's not tapas, but the food is served family style with smaller plates. Promotes portion control which was a winner in my book. All of the ingredients are local/regional, fresh and prepared with great care. On the menu it specifically states what location or farm the ingredients came from. Very refreshing way of presenting food. Great oysters, scallops, grilled calamari and lots of versions of pig, all washed down with a chocolate beer...yes, chocolate beer. It ROCKED. We finished the evening with a dessert waffle, artisan cheese plate and a loose-leaf Earl Gray tea. Great experience!
