It lived up to the hype.  The inside was surprisingly casual. The place was hoppin all night. They told us it was a 2 -2.5 hour wait, but actually ended up being a little over an hour. food: trio of ceviches: delicious. the ahi and mango one was my fav, followed by the shrimp ceviche. There was some other ceviche that i dont remember what was in it. it was some sort of white fish. it was ok, but not the best. it was lacking in ruffage. entree: Garlic-marinated Maple Creek pork loin with a serrano chili broth, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes and bacon. Queso anejo mashed potatoes, golden chayote. really, really good!! pork was tender and flavorful and the potatoes were to die for.  i honestly dont remember what dessert we had, but it was delicious.  mexican hot chocolate: just as it should be. spicy and rich. perfect way to end a meal. rhubarb margarita: Rhubarb, chili, lime, rye whiskey. was good but was missing a little something. needed some acid or something, which is odd because it had lime in it, and rhubarb is pretty tart. was good, but was expensive, and i dont think i would order it again. service: Our service was prompt and exact, but our waiter was not especially personable and did not make eye contact when speaking with you. He wasn't not-nice, but was not a memorable part of the evening. I am glad i got to knock this one off the list. Next time i am back in town, i would like to try Tomplabambo, which is right next door. recommended.
