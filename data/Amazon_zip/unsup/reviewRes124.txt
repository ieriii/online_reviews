This is my first review and I'm glad that it's for Alinea! I initially called over 20 times to book a dinner reservation for my girlfriend's birthday, which was two months away. So yes, it is very difficult to get reservations here, especially at a reasonable dinner time. But it was SOOOO worth it! My girlfriend and I agree, it was the most EPIC meal of our lives. The service, presentation of the dishes, flavor combinations, everything was just spectacular. It's an experience like none other. My favorite part of the dinner was the dessert. The chef comes out and makes it for you right on your table! I wish I could come back here for dinner every month, if only it wasn't incredibly expensive. All in all, chef Grant Achatz does an amazing job. I would definitely recommend all my friends to atleast dine at his restaurant once!
