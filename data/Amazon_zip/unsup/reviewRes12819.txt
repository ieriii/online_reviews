The salad bar was amazing... the smoked salmon and lobster bisque were standouts.  I found the meat and the garlic mashed potatoes very salty. To be fair, our waiter let us know that they season the meat with rock salt, and if we found it too salty we could order it differently, but we wanted to err on the side of seasoning rather than bland, so we didn't request the meat without the rock salt.  I thought the service, decor (there was a lady acrobat spinning somersaults in a glass case... I almost thought I was at the San Diego Comic Con), and the salad bar were all outstanding, but the meat, which I felt should have been the highlight of the meal (and the key point in justifying the $40-50 price tag) was just okay to me.
