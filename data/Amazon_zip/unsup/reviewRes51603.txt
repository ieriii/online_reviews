While the service can be kind of shady at times the generous portions, delicious food, wallet friendly prices and unlimited chips make up for any waitress attitude. This is usually my first stop with any out of town visitors and they always, ALWAYS agree that Garcias has some of the best (if not the best) Mexican food around. I personally reccomend the chicken burrito with avacado...yum...yum!
