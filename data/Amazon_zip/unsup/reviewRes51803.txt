The food is the only reason I keep on coming to this place because the service is disappointing. But again, the food is good. Go here, but don't anticipate getting good service. The guacamole is killer and you only need to order a small because its a large portion! I've had the enchiladas suizas, burritos (suizas or rancheros) and they have always been outstanding. Their margaritas are good. Milkshake was pretty blah (I don't know why i bothered ordering it, I think i came here with friends and wasn't hungry so ordered something just to be nice?). This place is open late so its also a great place to grab a late-night bite to eat if you're in lincoln square. I will definitely be going back, especially now that they have expanded the place. I'll dine more frequently when they improve their service! (they are not very attentive- and its almost impossible to find your server half the time! when you ask another server for something, you can tell they're annoyed).
