It was not a good experience getting to this place. We took a long metro ride & it was POURING when we were walking to this place. I was SOAKING WET and of course grouchy by the time I got here. SEOUL SASSY CHICKEN WINGS made it all worth it :) The chicken was crisp & the marination was out of this world....YUMMMIEEE! We also had the Buddha Bowl & Korean Burrito, which was also very good (not as good as the chicken wings though hahaha)
