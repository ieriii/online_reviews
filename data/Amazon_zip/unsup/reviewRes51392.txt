I love this place! Loud and busy they are but the service usually friendly. (true. true. some waitresses more than others.) There was a time when we went to eat here 3 days in a row. Just a note: Be prepared to wait, and I mean wait, a long time for your bill. It is a cheap eat and they open late which is a huge plus for us night owls. Skip the burritos as they are too humongous to even try to contemplate how to eat them but do try their tacos and flautas!
