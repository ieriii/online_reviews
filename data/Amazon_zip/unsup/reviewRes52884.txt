Hands down, the best Cuban food you will find in Chicago. The first time I was in this location, I was unsure about what to order. The staff was helpful at making recommendations and allowed my indecisive self to take my time. Now, I'm a vegetarian, and most people think of the ham and cheese Cuban sandwich when they think of Cuban food--You have to know there's so much more!. While, I've been assured (from my carnivore friends) that the meat options are tasty, there are plenty of veggie things to be had. I love the fried plantains and the Timba sandwich is a staple. If you're a smoothie fan, the guanabana is amazing! (As is the singing that ensues after your order) This location is much bigger than the one on Clybourn. If you have a large group, it would easily accommodate you. There's even a heated outdoor patio that is delightful in even in the winter. Loves it!
