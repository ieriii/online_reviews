Loved the atmosphere. So bright and cheerful. I literally was just looking around the place for most of my dining experience. The food was excellent. I have to agree with all of the yelpers that commented on the guacamole, AMAZING! I've had my fair share of guacamole, it being one of my favorite foods, and this is probably one of the best I've had. Everything else I had was great. Fresh tuna in my tuna salad. Great margarita, and the upside down pineapple cake was delicious. Our server was great. He was attentive but not obnoxious. One of the girls in my party had no idea what she wanted, and he took the time to look over the menu and recommend something she loved. My only issue with Carnivale is the hostess. On the phone she was very helpful, but in person she was definitely a witch with a B. She was not very accommodating at all and was very rude to one of my friends when she asked why we weren't being seated yet. It wasn't even crowded and we had a reservation!!! But I'll let that slide for their great food.
