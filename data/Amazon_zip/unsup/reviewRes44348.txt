I give Wakamono one star for the stellar calamari. Although I love the stuff, its not worth the unbelievably and ridiculously horrible service. I was a devotee of Wakamono and its sister Ping Pong for the two years I lived in Lakeview. I introduced friends, hosted large dinners, and byo'ed to my hearts content. Although the service was always a little touch and go (some waiters are AWESOME at Ping Pong...others, well., ..not so much) I dealt with it because of the fun atmosphere. Thursday at Wakamono was the last straw. My friends and I decided to have a welcome back party for a friend of ours who had been away all summer and craving sushi. We brought a ton of wine and were understandably dismayed to find out about the newly implemented $5 a bottle corkage fee. (Lets just say our bottles weren't really worth it) Of course I tried unsuccessfully to broker a corkage "deal" since we didn't know about the policy change going in. No luck. When we had finally resigned ourselves to the fee, the waitress informed us that the large bottle of wine in our stash would be a $10 fee. Nowhere is this made up and absurd rule written. As I proceeded to explain that, an angry sprite lept out of nowhere and bared his teeth at me screaming "IF YOU DON"T LIKE OUR CORKAGE POLICY THEN YOU CAN LEAVE!" I was unable to speak for sheer shock. When he left the table, I tried to explain to my friends what happened, at which point he reappeard out of nowhere, screaming at us once again, a scary vision in too short cutoffs and a wifebeater.  Long story short, the people running Wakamono know nothing about customer service, decency, or respect. There is no instance during which a loyal patron should be treated the way I was. If you go, do so at your own risk. Oh and make sure you get the calamari.
