Of course its good. I mean, c'mon, get serious. Atmosphere is it what is, service is OK enough (these are the things keeping this from being a 5-star). I've never experienced an extremely long wait or anything. We tend to go to XOCO when we need a quickish dinner downtown, but still want something delicious and fresh. But Oh. Ohhh the food. The food is can't-wait-to-put-it-in-my-mouth-again-good. Sadly, I can't ramble of all of the dishes I've had here, but I can tell you that I've been 6 times or so, gotten something different each time, and have never been disappointed. Of course I'll be back.
