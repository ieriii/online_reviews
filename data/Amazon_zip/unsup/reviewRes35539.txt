So, I went here for brunch to celebrate my sister's birthday and also my acceptance to Graduate School. It was easily the best brunch I've eaten in my life and since then, brunch has never quite been the same. All I've had since then have been but a sad shade of what one gets at Shaw's. There's a proverbial shit ton of sea food: salmon, oysters, crab, lobster, etc.; there are breakfast foods including the entirely overly extravagant caramelized bacon and Bananas Foster French toast; and my personal favorite, lobster and brie penne pasta. While I've never been here for dinner, you really can't beat this place for brunch.
