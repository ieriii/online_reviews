Threw a b-day party here recently and reserved the space in the middle (b/t Wave restaurant and the lobby/reception area). There was a minimum but we had about 35 people so didn't have any problem in obnoxiously exceeding that minimum.  The space looked exquisite....they totally set up the area with tons of candles and flowers and some minimal decor...it really looked spectacular !! hats off to Sara D (W's event planner) for helping me put this together. We had two personal servers who pretty much took care of our every need. Ordered several passed apps which were very tasty but mostly stuck to the drink. She also let us bring in our own Champagne with no corkage fee for a toast...saved a few hundo right there, kudos to Sarah for that:-) Outside of this event, i've been on a few occasions for drinks as it's right next door to where I work....always a good time.
