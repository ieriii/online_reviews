After wanting to get back here for a while, I finally made it back in. I have to say, this visit was much more impressive than my first. In all fairness, it was FAR less crowded than our inaugural experience, allowing both the kitchen and the servers to do their thing in a less frenzied manner. My first review might have come off a little harsh, and I was contacted by the owner via Yelp right away. Impressive. He was apologetic, but also willing to address the issues I had brought up, and was genuinely interested in providing me a stellar experience if I gave them another chance. I am so glad I did. Everything we had this time was completely "on point", from the sandwiches, to empanadas and the amazingly craveable oatmeal shake. The Chifrijo is in a class of its own. It makes me swoon with delight. If you are not anti-pork, this is definitely THE appetizer to try here. Everyone was super friendly, despite the fact that I was not a regular, and I never did reveal that this was my follow up visit, like the owner had encouraged me to do. They did a perfect job without knowing. And that my friends, is a true success story in my eyes. Still a cash only establishment, so come prepared or use the handy dandy ATM in the restaurant.
