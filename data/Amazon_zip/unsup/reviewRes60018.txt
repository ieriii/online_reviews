Now this is good southern cooking. After failing miserably to find some good southern food (see review of Dixi's Kitchen and Bait Shop. The Worst!) we heard about Big Jones. It's much closer and much much better. We have been twice now and everything is always great. The service, the cocktails, the food and even the owners are great. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait, no problem, but the owner (I assume) was so apologetic. We were seated and our server was at our table quickly. He was very attentive, professional and friendly. I ordered a mint jullip that was tasty and strong. The warm corn bread with butter and honey was delicious. We decided to try frog legs for the first time. They were good and meaty and not fried just right. We shared the jumblia and the chicken special of the night. As always my wife wound up ordering the better of the two, that's why we share, but they were both delicious. On the way out the presumed owner again apologized and thanked us for coming. It was completely unnecessary but very nice. I have mentioned Big Jones to friends and they all rave about it as well. We will defiantly be back many more times. I really want to try the brunch.
