I dunno why Garcia's in the single $ section, for the quality of the food, it's actually pretty pricy! Having recently discovered Lincoln Square, Garcia's stuck out as the only non-European restaurant in the 'hood. Walking pass Garcia's on a Fri night, it was one of the hottest bars on the block with a full-house at the bar!  So I decided to bring some friends along and check it out on a less busy day, such as a late Sat lunch. The moment the menu was served, our party of 6 scanned through for the authentic dishes. "Do they have anything with Mole?" Checked. "Mexican style ceviches? This should be interesting!" Checked "Oooh Flautas on the menu eh?" Checked "They have Horchata, but not Jamaica?" hmmmm...... The ceviches were fresh, but waaay too spicy which took away the natural aroma & fragrance of these lime-soaked tilapia bites. The flautas were short & skinny, deep-friend with sour cream, tomato slices and lettuce on the side. Real flautas are meant to be long & fat! The enchiladas were swimming in a reddish, marinara-like sauce... My two tacos (con al Pastor y Bistec) were overcooked, dry, and tasted like they were simply seasoned with Mojo, if any seasoning at all. At least the horchata packed a punch on the cinnamon. If you want CHEAP yet delicious Mexican food, do yourself a favor and take a ride down south. If not, come down to Addison Red Line & hit up El Burrito Mexicano! I promise you can get a better Torta + Horchata for less than $10.
