Sushi X is one of my standard delivery place. I order for work lunch, meetings and date night at home. Because their sushi is just that yummy! They are a unique sushi place because they only make rolls and several types of appetizers. But their rolls are excellent and I think that's because they learned the tricks from Sushi Wabi. I hear somehow those two restaurants are related. The place is cool for dining in... dark, happy music, with big screen projecting anime/movies on one wall.  The delivery/take out is really great because their boxes are custom designed for their rolls, and the chopsticks and napkins always come in very neat packaging. It makes the whole ordering out experience more unique.  My favorites are the yellow jacket, spicy scallop, and dragon roll. If you want more than sushi, add a scallion beef roll, miso soup, and Tako(octopus) seaweed salad. One note: for your first time, read the roll descriptions carefully. There are a few rolls that they put eel sauce on. If you order one too many of those, they all start to taste the same.
