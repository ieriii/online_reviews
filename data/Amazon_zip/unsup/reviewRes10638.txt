The owner for Piece takes his business and service seriously and responds to reviews here. My last experience there was OK but not stellar so he encouraged me to come back in. I returned to Piece last night with a buddy and we had a pretty darn good beer and pizza night. We got a delicious white pizza with half clams and bacon and half chicken and artichokes and a couple beers each -- this was a great 50/50 combo for flavors. I have to say they have a really good beer selection to accompany the pizza as well. He tried the "Don De Dieu" which the waiter recommended and is now my buddy's new favorite beer. I also tried the Chimay and the Flat Iron Stout - both of which were very good. The service was friendly and attentive and we both enjoyed ourselves enough that we will be back again soon with more friends next time.
