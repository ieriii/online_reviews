i LOVE THE CHICAGO DINER!!! We just went there last night for our first time. I am a vegetarian and have been searching for vegetarian restaurants in the burbs for a while. Guess all I had to do was go to the city! Everything on the menu is VEGAN (how AWESOME!!!) and way more tasty then the meat filled diner food I would eat before I became a vegetarian. Such a cool atmosphere and staff too. We were one of the last tables there and didn't feel rushed out the door at all. Oh and if you are still hungry after your entree I highly recommend the chocolate peanut butter cake, yup, that's vegan too! ahhh I will definitely be going back whenever I am in the city. That's a promise! :) Oh, and thanks for saving the large amount of animals you do every year. You make your customers proud!
