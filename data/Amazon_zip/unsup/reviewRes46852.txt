Uncommon Ground; Take Two! New cast, new locale, new fun things to sip and try.... I've kissed goodbye the days of Sunshine Salad old and said 'Hello Looover' to a formula a bit more satisfying. Thanks to our GNO 2.0 outing at UG last night, I was super satiated with all things girls night out fabulous; think sinfully delicious martinis, the amazing company of 30+ glorious gals, a marvelous menu of fantastic eats and the pleasantly assiduous service to top it all off. Kudos to UG and the know-how in just how to orchestrate flawless crowd control... 1. Start with multiple Tree-Tinis - aka Christmas in a glass - a fabulously comforting mix of organic ginger house-infused rain organic vodka, chai-infused sweet vermouth, licor 43 and seedling apple cider dusted with a kiss of cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes like home... if you live at Betty Ford like I do ; ) 2. Sprinkle above with appetizer of baked artichoke, goat cheese & pesto dip served up with perfectly crisp and warm extra virgin olive oil crostini. With a little help from my friends, this terrine of wicked deliciousness was devoured in mere seconds. Rich, creamy, tangy... it's the ultimate in delectable starters. 3. Layer in plates that spilleth over with scrumptious, velvety sage butter and gorgonzola laden pumpkin ravioli and my personal fav of the evening, the Gunthorp Farm crispy chicken with brown butter gnocchi, squash puree, apple & gorgonzola salad. Ahhhhhh-mazing! Talk about crispy... that skin was a-crack-a-lack-ing! I was so generously schooled on the new name in poultry perfection last night and it's spelled G-U-N-T-H-O-R-P. A little after-dinner time spent cozying up in those big, cushy leather chairs in the bar with a hot cup 'o joe was exactly what the cold weather Doc ordered, indeed. Three cheers to Uncommon Ground, the latest prescription for Uncommon Excellence.
