Eh. Food was okay, just reg'lr ole Chinese food though.  Maybe I was disappointed because I didn't have one of those hot pot things. Maybe I was disappointed because the egg drop soup looked like yolk and raw egg whites, but just tasted like raw egg whites. Maybe i was I dunno. The lamb dish was supposedly great. If you don't like cumin, don't get it. THe sweet sour soup was really good, but everything else was just okay. The Kong Pao chicken was okay. The sesame chicken was okay. The veggie fried rice was okay. Just okay. I will try this place again, but I am going to have to get one of those hot pot things to really figure out why people like this place. or maybe I'll just get it cuz there is nothing like a little open flame in a small area. 3 stars...eh. it was so reg'lr I don't even want to add up the stars.
