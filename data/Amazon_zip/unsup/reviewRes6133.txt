**This review is for Private Party dining only, I haven't been for dinner, yet** My company's holiday party was at Wildfire this year and we had a private room at the restaurant. The restaurant, was so cozy inside, with a fireplace...we were escorted to the private room where we ordered drinks and munched on passed appetizers: crab and guacamole on a tortilla chip, cheese pizza, pulled pork on a bbq potato chip, and something beef that I really can't remember. They were all delicious. Once we sat down we were served chicken and portabella skewers and bread. Now, I'm not a big fan of family-style, but it seemed to work really well here. Two salads were passed: the chopped salad and a goat cheese salad with grilled vegetables...both were delicious.  The entrees were tenderloin tips in a red wine reduction and lemon pepper chicken. Again, delicious, although, there was skin on the chicken and it really threw me off. I prefer my chicken without skin. In addition to the proteins there were mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Delicious. We didn't realize until after-the-fact that we could have asked for seconds, the food went fast at our table! Then it was time for dessert and we had a berry crisp with vanilla ice cream and really rich chocolate cake. Everything was really, really good...including the service. We were really impressed with the meal and are really excited to go return for a meal on our own!
