this place was surprisingly difficult to find considering i know the area well and had the exact address. you oddly have to go through their outdoor patio to get in...to what wll most likely be a very crowded bar area where you can hear almost nothing. this sounds negative no? but it's not i swear. the wine selection and beer list are great. the menu itself is also good. their estimation of the time you'll wait in said bar area drinking and standing awkwardly over the dining guests: suprisingly accurate. i happened to go on a wednesday evening and the wait was 45 minutes. i have to think in a few months it'll die down, but on the other hand i'm not sure since it's such a small space. what were they thinking anyhow? it's good booze and swine. it's downtown and reasonably priced. did they think that wasn't going to work? i don't understand. definitely share your stuff with other people. it's that kind of restaurant. their charcuterie is very good. their almonds are good, but too large unless you have a large table. skip those if not. bone marrow is really good and will keep you from a nasty hangover. get that for sure. pigs ear under the "fried items" is really good. they could stand to ditch the pickles in it however--sort of off. octopus. yes. the outdoor area is less loud, but you might get a draft depending on how close you are to the flap. i'd suggest eating there though over inside as it's not that cold and you avoid people eating over you during your meal.
