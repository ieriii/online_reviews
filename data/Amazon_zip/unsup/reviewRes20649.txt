I swear on the life of everyone I know that I ordered the Ahogada spicy the first time I tried it and it was DELICIOUS! I went back a second time and figured that it would be the same. Took a bite and my mouth caught on fire. It wasn't even enjoyable to eat. =( I was so sad. I'm going to have to get medium now just to be safe.
