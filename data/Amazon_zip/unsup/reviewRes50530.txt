Fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice? Good. Andouille hash? Meh. I so wanted it to be delicious, but instead it was disappointing. The chicken sausage, while spicy, had a weird texture, and there was altogether to much of it, when you're looking at a meat to potatoes ratio. The rest of my party seemed pretty pleased with what they had ordered, so maybe it was just an off dish?
