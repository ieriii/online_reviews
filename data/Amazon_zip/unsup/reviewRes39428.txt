I was way skeptical of eating here, because it seems like bro central -- not like fratty bros, but like bearded hipster bros. The focus is on eating meat and drinking whiskey. I don't eat meat, and I'll only drink whiskey if I'm trying to get angry and tear some walls down. I was wary when my guy and his boys brought me along this weekend. But to my surprise, I had an impressive, savory, satisfying vegetarian meal here. The butternut squash risotto is meat-free harvest goodness that sticks to your ribs and makes you feel warm and toasty. Also helping with the toasty feeling is the special citrusy hot toddy they're serving up. Warming and fun! The look and style of this place are stellar -- welcoming and sleek in equal measure. I'm a fan.
