I have been to Wilde a few times. I would say I come back more for the ambiance than the food or drinks. They have two long wooded cherry bars & a charming seating area next to a fireplace, with a setting of a library, with real books mind you, that I just love. The menu is fitting for the establishment, I feel the food could be better, to fit the warm, cozy atmosphere. The drink menu is suitable as well, though being an Irish noted establishment, they could offer a better variety of whiskey drinks on their menu. The last time I was a little bothered for when I asked for coffee and Sambuca, and I was brought the coffee and the Sambuca in a shot glass!! Ummmm- I spoke with the bartender and said generally Sambuca with coffee comes in a cognac glass with 3 coffee beans, he told me that he had been bar-tending for 10 years & never heard of such a thing, REALLY??? though he readily accommodated me. Now if I was at Kirwood , the home of Tools & Trixies, I would understand a bartender not knowing what I was talking about, I do have to say he did come back & tell me that he spoke with other bartenders & yes this is how Sambuca is to be served and I was right. Thanks, I knew I was :) but I did appreciate the fact that he looked into it & came back to tell me that he was wrong. It is hard not to like this place in spite of it's short comings, the charm of the place and the friendliness of the staff keeps me coming back.
