So apparently this place has 2 locations... both of them are on Clark Street. One is at Clark and Foster, the other is on Clark by Fullerton. So when Icosium was suggested as a place to meet up we each went to the location we knew of. As it happened, they were different locations. When I finally got to the correct Icosium Kafe the server was very kind and didn't mind that my friend had been sitting there for 45 minutes waiting for me to arrive. She was quick to ask if I wanted anything and came to check on us frequently. The food was really tasty. I built my own crepe and was in no way disappointed. They use quality ingredients and don't skimp on what they give you. Usually when I get hearts of palm there's only one or two tiny pieces, my crepe was filled with them! The same goes for the portabella mushrooms, they were very generous. I would have loved to try a dessert crepe but alas my belly was too full for that. The lemon crepe sounded amazing though and I've been on a citrus kick lately. Also, it takes very little convincing for me to get anything made with nutella, and they offer several crepes with those. I should also mention that to add to the comedy of errors that went along with the night, we were also under the mistaken impression that they were open until 10. So we sat there chatting away until 9:30 when they turned a couple of customers away telling them that they closed at 9. Oops. It was nice that they didn't kick us out and just let us hang out. I look forward to going back there, although this time I'll leave when they actually are closed.
