The pig is a magical animal and any restaurant devoted to serving pig is a place I want to check out. Purple Pig sits right on Michigan Ave and needless to say it's a big tourist trap. So of course we decided to go there for lunch before hitting the town. The place was crowded but luckily we were able to get a couple of seats by the bar. The bartender was a bit aloof/quiet but polite and helpful. We started with a couple of Estrella Damm beers while we browsed the menu. We finally decided on the croquettes, a salami and goat chesse panini, and the pork blade steak (on a friend's recommendation). The panini while still good, was the least memorable of the three. The croquettes were made with potato and Speck ham with a chili aioli and they were crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The star of the show was the pork blade steak with 'Nduja and honey. 'Nduja is a type of sausage made with pork shoulder, belly, and jowl, and roasted hot peppers. The spiciness of the sausage and the sweetness of the honey sauce were a perfect complement to the pork which was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender. I highly recommend this place if you're ever in Chicago.
