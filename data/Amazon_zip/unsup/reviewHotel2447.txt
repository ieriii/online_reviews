This hotel was way too baller, but it's ideally located - a short walk from Millenium Park, the Museum Campus (where Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium are located), and Grant Park's right across the street. That is probably a huge reason for its popularity. I like how the bar is actually crackin on the weekends. Carlos the bartender had his work cut out for him on both the 3rd and 4th of July. They have complimentary ice water set out on a table so that you don't have to bother the bartender with non-alcoholic stuff (although I'm sure he would give it to you if you asked). There are an abundance of tables situated by the window for people watching, which is always fun. I don't like the fact that they charge for internet though. Everything else is already pretty expensive.
