We had to hit this place up while in town over the weekend. I'm not used to specialty pizza places (most of our pizza eating is done at home so it's typically delivered) so I wasn't sure what to expect. Everyone talked this place up so I was expecting something extraordinary. It was good, but I guess my expectations were a bit different. Either that or I just prefer TX style pizza (doesn't the pizza at Sam's Club count as TX pizza? I find that to be one of my faves). Or maybe I don't know my pizzas? Either way, the pizza was really good, but you have to like LOTS of cheese. The crust is more like a cornbread type crust rather than the flour-based as far as texture goes. Don't be deceived by the long lines outside. It moves quickly. It was cold out when we went and weren't sure if we could handle standing out there for too long, so we asked the host for his time estimate for the wait. He told us 10-20 minutes and we were seated at the bar in about 12. I don't think that's too bad for a busy Saturday afternoon. The bartenders do know how to make the basics well (Jack and Coke, Vodka and cran, etc). I think this is a really good place for groups and for tasting Chicago's version of deep dish pizza. My only warning is to come hungry and valet park. The smallest pizza is 4 slices and 1 is enough to fill ya up. We parked in the closest parking garage across the street and paid $25 for less than 2 hours of parking. Ouch! (Valet is only $13 plus tip.) Can you tell we were tourists? We didn't know any better!
