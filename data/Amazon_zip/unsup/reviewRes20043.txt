5 stars because I ate here 3 times during a span of 5 days. The caldos are wonderful, and so suiting during the cold Chicago winters. It really is a "meal in a bowl"! The sandwiches were decadent and savory; choices of meats are excellent. The churros are also very authentic! Like the ones I've had in Spain. Well, worth the wait! Rick Bayless really shows off his ability to dazzle up great ingredients in the form of non-fancy dishes. I want to say I even prefer this place over his renown Frontera Grill.
