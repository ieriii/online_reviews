I just had an epiphany. The waiters were all dressed in camoflauged attire but I just remembered that this restaurant is called Tank. LOL. I mean the only thing remotely military is their shirts. Other than that, it is all Vietnamese food. It looks like this restaurant is very close to a Red Line stop although we drove here. Parking is not so easy to find. There is pay parking on the street close by, so I recommend doing that. I came here to eat Pho, an extra large bowl in fact. Although, I think that my extra large bowl was more full of broth than noodles.....regardless, it was pretty good.
