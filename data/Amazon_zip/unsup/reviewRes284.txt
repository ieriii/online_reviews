My husband took me here for Valentine's Day. I thought it was very upscale, but non-pretentious. Neither of us had been there before, so when we entered the hall and didn't see the door. I thought, what the hell did he get us into. Once the automatic doors opened, I knew we were in for a delight. We did the 12 course tasting menu. We tried foods that we would have normally shied away from. The bison in particular, it was tender and very flavorful. It was funny because I was pregnant at the time and I kept going to the restroom to stretch my legs. When we got home and into bed, I went into labor. My husband seems to believe the bison had something to do with it. LOL!  It was a pricey, but well worth the dollar. The ambience was wonderful, the staff and the other patrons were friendly. I will definitely go back.
