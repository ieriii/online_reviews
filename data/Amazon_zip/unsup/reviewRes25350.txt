After reading all the wonderful reviews here I was terribly disappointed by Geja's. Many have said Geja's is romantic. Perhaps this is true if you sit in a booth. For us it was crowded and tiring. The tables are VERY close together and the service is mediocre. The food was decent, but certainly not "amazing." First the salad was two slices of cucumber with lettuce and some generic vinaigrette. Then the cheese course, which was very good. Then the main course: the presentation was terrible, and cooking it was worse. They provide you with soy oil, and just soy oil, to cook your food. Our waitress confirmed that it was JUST cooking oil. They don't try to spice it up with some pepper, maybe throw a sprig of ANYTHING in there?!  I love fondue, but this was bland as bland can be. We were really looking forward to desert at this point, it HAD to be better. The coffee was fine, but instead of cream or half-and-half on the side we were given a cup of whipped topping. You might think this is cute, and if it were real whipped cream I would agree. They gave us WHIPPED TOPPING from a spray can. Let me reiterate: I spent $100 on food for two and they gave me whipped topping from a can. Finally desert comes out: the fruit was terrible and the chocolate was Hershey's syrup with orange liquor. At this point we just wanted to get out, but it took our waitress 10 minutes to come with the check and another 5 to return to take my credit card. I wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously before wasting so much money. Please don't make the same mistake I did!
