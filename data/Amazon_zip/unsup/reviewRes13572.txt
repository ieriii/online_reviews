I don't think I could say anything about the excellent food that hasn't already been said. The quality is phenomenal. However, every time I've come in, there has been a wait for tables, with empty tables because the "servers need to catch up before their sections can be re-sat." If I've walked in on the same day of the week to that same problem - it sounds like an under staffing issue. I don't think it is fair to leave a salivating, cranky, and extremely hungry customer staring at empty tables for 15-20min. I often skip trips to Glenn's to not wait on slow seating, and slow table service (only speaking about some staff, others are fast and fantastic).
