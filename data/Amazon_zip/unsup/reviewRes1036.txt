I actually came here on a July but I was too lazy to post a review.  Hot Dougs is awesome and worth an hour wait. Just make sure to bring water or an umbrella for shelter. They were nice enough to turn on a hose for people waiting in line to cool off. There was an ice cream camped out there ready to sell water and frozen treats.  Once we finally got into Hot Dougs we ordered a Duck Sausage with Foie Gras Mousse, a Garlic and Pork Sausage, a Mountain Man (venison), and an order of Duck Fat Fries. Hot Dougs is cash only. When we went to pay we were short 2 bucks. So when we were deciding what to drop or run to the car to grab the rest of the money. Doug asked us how much we had and said ok that's fine and let us go short. Doug is super nice and very personable. As for the food, the Duck Sausage is a definite must order! Highly recommended. So nice ad rich. The garlic and pork sausage was also good too if you love garlic. The mountain man was just ok. The duck fries were really good but I don't think I can really tell the difference. Overall, I would say you definitely need to try this place at least once. I'm would return but probably on a weekday when there's a much shorter wait. Just remember to bring enough cash.
