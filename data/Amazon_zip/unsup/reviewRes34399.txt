Been to the brunch factory a few times, not a bad option if you don't mind the crowds. I thought the place looks cool, nice atmosphere and friendly service. The Big Texas Fajita Omelette and Huevos Rancheros were decent -- I still like West Egg's El Bandito better. I prefer salty and savory to sweet stuff, but I've had the whatever-flavor pancakes a couple times and they were A-OK. Nothing really stood out as something I would have to come back and have again. Probably could get similar food slightly cheaper somewhere else.
