This review is for drinks and atmosphere only. I ate here within the month it opened, but I wasn't too focused on the food/drinks, and cannot review from that perspective. However, I visited recently for drinks. It was a bit crowded, so my date and I had to stand while having our drinks. However, the drinks were excellent. There's an excellent selection of top shelf good stuff, and tasty cocktails for all sorts of palates. This isn't the typical hipster joint or quintessential Logan Square place. The Lincoln Park trixies/chads, family from out of town, and resident hipsters are all sure to feel welcome and comfy here.
