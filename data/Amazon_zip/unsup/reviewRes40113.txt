Was pretty excited about making the trip up to L and E. Menu looked pretty good, as did the selections of whiskey and beer. Pros: Cool space, great tunes, laid back vibe, friendly staff. Cons: Food needs some work. I had... Wild boar sloppy joe w/ fries....decent concept, but way too much food...felt bar food gross after eating this. Pork cheek and gnocchi...tasty but not memorable Marinated olives.....wonderful! Pretzel and rarebit....eh. Others had: Buffalo frog legs....fried and covered in buffalo sauce...what's the point? Pea risotto...rice was gummy. Overall, somewhat disappointed but would probably go back for drinks and snacks. Big entrees not worth the price tag.
