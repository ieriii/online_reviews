Wishbone is a really cute brunch spot. I have never had to wait more then five minutes to get in even on a weekend around 12:00. Unlike most other brunch spots around lakeview/lincoln park it is very spacious and the food comes out quickly and the service is good, not to mention the prices are very reasonable for Chicago. I suggest the shrimp n grits, cheddar grits with mushrooms, green onions, bacon, and shrimp. YUM! Overall just a great fall back spot when you don't want to wait to get in somewhere else for brunch on the weekend.
