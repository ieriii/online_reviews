One of the best dining experiences of my life. So far, at least. I went here for an anniversary dinner, because, hello, I (or rather, my boyfriend, since this dinner was my anniversary gift) can't afford to go here every day. I knew going in that the portions would be small and pricey, but it would be an interesting experience. Interesting it definitely was. The BF and I did the Tasting Menu, so we tried the Deconstructed Caesar, the Chicken Noodle Soup, Crispy Black Bass, Wagyu Flat Iron and Chocolate Gateau. The only thing I didn't 100 percent adore was the Black Bass, and that was only because a couple of the sauces were kind of odd. But even then, the fish was cooked to perfection and I thought it worked with one of the sauces. Zero complaints on the food, really. The popcorn at the beginning of the meal was a nice start, though I wasn't as amazed by it as others seem to have been. All around, presentation was beautiful, service was outstanding and the atmosphere was comforting. I've been to other restaurants run by well-known celebrity-type chefs in the same neighborhood (take your guess, it's probably right), and I definitely felt more comfortable and invited here than at the other place. The vibe was a perfect mix between comfortable and high-end. Contrary to what I've read in other reviews, I was full at the end of my meal. And it was that perfect kind of full where you don't need to eat anymore, but you're not on the road to Stomachache City. Besides, you don't go to a place like this to get the All-You-Can-Eat Buffet feeling at the end. You go for the experience and the dance of joy your taste buds will be performing at the end. And that's exactly what I got. Bonus: I spotted Graham walking around the restaurant. Since I'm a food television geek, that was fun.
