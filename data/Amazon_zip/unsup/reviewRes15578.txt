SERVICE: I've never had a bad experience with service. FOOD: Every single time I go, I get the exact same thing: Red sangria (the white peach is good, too), an appetizer of their famous, DELICIOUS homemade guacamole, and the ropa vieja for my meal. It's incredible. The taste of the ropa vieja is indescribible - but if I had to try, I'd say it's the perfect blend of sweet plaintains and tangy sauces mixed with rich pork. Once you've had it, good luck branching off and trying to order anything else! I'd give it 5 stars - but I feel like I need to try more of the menu first. 5 stars is definitely awarded to the Ropa Vieja!
