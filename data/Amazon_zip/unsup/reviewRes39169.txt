I can't say enough good things about my experience at this restaurant! Service was fantastic. The waitress was very knowledgeable and also "down-to-earth". Refreshing. We had two awesome appetizers and two entrees and weren't quite stuffed. Cornbread pudding and charred olive oil ice cream for dessert? Hell yeah. Also, bring your whiskey stomach. They have so many great ones to try. No reservation may make getting a seat tough for larger parties. The place was packed by 5:30 on Saturday. Grab a cocktail and wait it out. Its worth it. Definitely going back.
