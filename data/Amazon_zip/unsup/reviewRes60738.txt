In short, just because you have a solar panel, it doesn't give you an excuse to be a jerk.Went there for a friend's concert. Waited over 45 minutes to get a server's attention to order food (despite hand waiving, attempts at eye contact, etc.). When I pointed this out to the server, she rolled her eyes and stormed out. I had to excuse myself from the cramped table, asking a patron whom I didn't know to get out of his seat, so I could get up and calmly walk into the empty hallway to de-escelate the situation with the manager. And... my husband and I still ended up paying $35 for my evening cover and one drink each.
