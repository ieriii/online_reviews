when i first moved to the city, garcia's was one of those small BUT amazing mexican restaurants. since then they have expanded their seating and unfortunately destroyed what was once such a great thing. their food is still a good bang for the buck: large (2 day) portions for an affordable price. their service and flavor have decreased in excellence. the staff are inattentive, snippy and clearly spread too thin. the food lacks the great mexican flavor that it once had and the guacamole is possibly one of the worst i have ever had. with so many other great mexican restaurants in this city... keep looking, garcia's is not it.
