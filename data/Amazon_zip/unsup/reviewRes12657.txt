Absolutely loved the place. The only complaint I have is that I was too full to keep eating. We dined with our son who can be a bit finicky, but he tried and liked almost everything we put on his plate. Be prepared to spend some cash, but be prepared to be amazed. I suggest Nicolas (sp?) as your waiter and get the ribs for sure (O my god they were heaven).
