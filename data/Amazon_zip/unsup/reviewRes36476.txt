I was here last Monday with my friends right before I went back home to Vegas. The atmosphere & setting was very cute, nice bright setting with a flower on the table setting. We were sitting against the wall right by the right side of the restaurant, where you can see people walking in the entrance. It was a party of four, nice little brunch with our boyfriends :) We arrived around 2pm, & I knew we would be out by the time they closed the kitchen/restaurant. From the beginning the server seemed to rush us, asking for drinks & what we wanted to order. I didn't mind it at first, but once we ordered our food she was ready with the check in her hand & asked if we wanted any more coffee because she was going to empty it out, also saying that they wanted to close early that day. .. ?? That really bothered me~ but since all of us were having a good time catching up before my flight, that's why they have three stars. As far as the food, I had Meli's omelet; panchetta (bacon), shollots, parsley, chives & boursin (cheese). It came with potatoes & wheat toast, with a slice of cantaloupe. For the longest time I was trying to figure out if the boursin was cream cheese or sour cream :P I liked it though! I couldn't finish it all, but I didn't bother to ask our anxious server to wrap it up. I didn't get to eat some of my toast & try the jams! ugh. If I do go there next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to come a few hours before so I won't feel rushed to leave so the staff can enjoy the extra 15 minutes getting off work :)
