Followed the other recommendations on yelp and they proved to be very accurate. I picked this place for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved everything from the description of each cut of meat before ordering, to the cocktails, to the free "happy birthday" cake (complete with a candle :). The steaks, bell pepper risotto and sauces were to die for. We also split a crab cake to start that sits on two house made sauces - amazing. Our waiter Eric was top notch as well. Great first time experience and will be back for another special occasion.
