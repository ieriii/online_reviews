After 2 separate and really good Opart Thai experiences, here it is: 1st (dine-in): My fiance and I picked up some IPA and headed over to Opart Thai on a friend's recommendation. It was busy but no wait for a table at 7pm on a Thursday night. We sat down and were instantly given ice water and a bottle opener by the uber-friendly host. The food was really solid: the steamed shu mai were lovely, the Tiger Cry was delicious, the Panang Curry light and flavorful, the Kuay Tiew Kee Mao was fresh and just really good. Decor is a tasteful mesh of traditional and modern. Overall, a great experience. The food is not going to change your life but it was certainly above average for reasonably priced, casual, Thai food-- and sometimes, that's exactly what you need. 2nd (delivery): Called tonight at 9:15pm (their delivery hours end at 9:30) and the guy on the phone took my order promptly and said it would be here in an hour or so. It arrived, piping hot, 20 minutes later. Awesome. Really nice delivery guy, too. Bottom line: Opart Thai is kick-ass.
