Took advantage of the breakfast menu over the lunch options during a visit to Bongo Room with my momma. She is extremely picky when it comes to restaurants, especially breakfast food. To top it off, she also has the worst luck when she is the customer. For the most part she always ends up getting the worst dish and service whenever we dine in a group or with family. I was hoping that Bongo Room could turn this curse around...they did, but they did snag. Anyway, to the food. We arrived there two Tuesdays ago around 12:30; the place was bumping, but we were seated within a minute. We both ordered coffee to start off and our waitres was friendly and allowed us plenty of breathing space to narrow down our food options. We both selected out of their special menu which consisted of the omelet with chicken breast, avocado, tomatillo salsa, cheese and spinsh. I selected the brioche french toast with rasperry puree, cream, and chocholate crumble. I was initially hesistant about my decision since I am a huge fan of a good balance breakfast that includes a portion of eggs, but I went with my gut. Both of our plates come out in a timely fashion--but to my dismay, they ran out of spinach and they asked my mother if they could substitue with basil; she agreed. Both plates were aesthetically pleasing and my mother really enjoyed that her food was nice and hot--she did complain about the quality of the basill however, for being Mexican; she realy enjoyed her dish and the tomatillo salsa (which later on inspired her own breakfast twist). And, my selection was superb. The dish was not overly sweet and I almost killed my whole dish. It was a great balance, the vanilla sauce complimented the rasperry and chocolate crumble. My only complaint would be texture.  My rating is closer to a 4.5, however my momma raves with a 5 star rating...so 5 it is! I'm definitely coming back again and now my dad is envious and hoping to visit soon.
