Love Geja's. Have only been there once. It is in the basement and apart from the tables, they have a tiny bar in the back. For those of you that don't know, this place serves Fondue. Come hungry when you eat here - and plan on at least two hours - no need to rush it. I don't think I would call it romantic, maybe a more suitable word is 'dark'. It is so dark I could barely see my date! Which was a bad thing b/c she was hot! Anyways, this place is recommended when you have some extra cash in your pocket.
