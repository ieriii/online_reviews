Big Jones opened up in my former hood, and my neighbor was working in the kitchen, so I thought I'd show a little love. I stopped by this place for brunch twice. My first complaint is the lack of decent vegetarian friendly menu items. I think there were maybe two things on the menu I could eat (and I will point out that I also eat chicken and crab). I ordered each of them once, and frankly...they were only ok, and that may be overly generous. I understand that they like their meat in the South, but how hard is it to make eggs and grits? Fried okra? I also ordered a cocktail which tasted a bit like dirty water, and the service seemed a touch...snobbish?  My companions seemed to enjoy their food, so I'm assuming that their meaty items are much better. And it IS super-cute, so if you're a carnivore, you can give it a shot.
