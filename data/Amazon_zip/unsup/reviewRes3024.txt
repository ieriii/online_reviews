Fantastic! One of a few places with true service- the kind that would be unaffordably overstaffed in almost all restaurants. Sophisticated atmosphere. Reservations required. Dress shirt at minimum; good sport coat or a properly fitted suit would be perfect. If nothing else, try the 3 course dessert tasting menu; Gale Gand knows what she's doing.
