My lady friend and I were on our way to the Planetarium and found ourselves driving through Greektown. We were hungry so we parked by the dog park on Sangemon, and walked towards the Greek restaurants on Halsted Street not sure where we would get a quick bite.We saw the outdoor patio at the Greek Islands and thought...it's such a beautiful day (Aug 18, 2012) with the temperature in the mid 70's...let's eat at Greek Islands.We walked into the restaurant through the long corridor and asked the hostess if we could eat outside. A man standing nearby (who was probably one of the Greek owners) barked out rudely in that classic Greek accent, NO, ITS CLOSED--TOO COLD!!!With that, he turned away not giving a damn whether WE thought it was too cold. He didn't offer a nice table in the restaurant and certainly didn't care if we stayed or left. My lady friend just looked at me and was stunned.We have seen the good reviews on the Greek islands food, but with an attitude like that, we will NEVER set foot inside the place again. There's plenty of restaurants around, especially Greek restaurants on Halsted.The Greek Islands? TOO COLD FOR US!!!!!
