After having had an awesome experience ordering from Lou Malnati the night before, I decided to order similar dishes from Giordano's for a head-to-head comparison. First up, it's the fried calamari. While Lou Malnati's version was sublimely tender with a fresh tasting cocktail sauce; the Giordano's version was tough and soggy, and the cocktail sauce tasted every bit as being poured from a bottle. Giordano's is known for it's stuffed pizza, but the minimum size was 10" versus 6" at Lou Malnati's. It was too much pizza for one person, and I was underwhelmed by the top and bottom crusts (which is what makes it "stuffed"). If the crust is good, then one is more than enough. And Lou Malnati's version also came out ahead in the pizza category for me.
