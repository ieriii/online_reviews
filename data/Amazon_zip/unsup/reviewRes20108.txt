LOVE the churros. The Mexican hot chocolate is soooooo rich, i couldnt even finish it. Just FYI, the breakfast ends at 10am, but the tortas arent available until about 11am. We went right around 10am on a weekday and were able to just get some of their breakfast items (chilaquiles were good, but didnt have eggs in it?) and we didnt have to wait in line at all...i dont know that i would ever wait in line for the breakfast items, but the churros were really really good
