We decided that it was time to venture out of Aville and try something new. A friend that lives in the area spoke of this place so with Monday off away we went. We arrived shortly after 4:00 on a Sunday and had 4 people in our party. The bar area was full but did have some single seats available. We checked in with the host (who was extremely nice) and she indicated that it would be a 5-10 min wait. We said that was fine as we were waiting for one person. Our friend arrived and she took us to a table in the back near the brewing area. The menu had quite a bit to offer as well as we all were happy with the beer selections. Drinks were ordered and delivered promptly and our order was taken. Appetizers came out quickly and we had the mussels and the cheddar soup and both were very good. Each person ordered a sandwich which also arrived in good time and everyone was happy and stated they would be back. Noise wasn't an issue for us but we were in the back of the room as well as away from the bar. The space is much larger than I thought but I didn't feel packed in. The prices were reasonable; 4 people, 12 beers, 2 appetizers, 4 sandwiches w/side, 1 desert came to $135. We really enjoyed our time there and it appeared that those tables around us were as well. Our sever was very nice and helpful as well as the host area was friendly. If it were closer to home we would probably be there more often we will be back.
