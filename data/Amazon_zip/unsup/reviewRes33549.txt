This place is pretty Legit. I like the fact that you can order eggs and then get pancakes with fruit for 1.50 extra- makes it a lot easier with decisions. Also, the food is great, the eggs are especially tasty and there is a lot to choose from. Two things I would like to say. 1. Going there on a Weekend morning is akin to going to the cheesecake factory. It feels like an all day affair. Don't go if you are starving bc you will wait for awhile. 2. Even though its a shorter wait, don't sit at the counter. Its stressful and way too busy in the Kitchen to watch. The seats are uncomfortable. They almost cut my friends head off with a tray. The service is bad there too. (I know, it doesn't make sense...)
