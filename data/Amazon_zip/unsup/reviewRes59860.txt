I am giving it a 5 because the service was good and waiter was always attentive and of course the food was great! We ordered 3 appetizers goat's cheese with marinara ,crab cake and scallops. The scallops were undercooked and I let the waiter know, he mentioned it to the manager and she shortly came and apologized and said they were not going to charge us for it.It was my date's B-day and she loves steak and was very happy with it, I had their fish special which was very good. the atmosphere was cozy and relaxing.
