I've eaten here a couple of times, and the food has always been great! I've only ever done dinner here, and I've only ever gotten seafood off the chalkboard. I figure why bother with anything else? They have some really interesting choices for a fairly affordable price. Especially during the Monday night special where all the chalkboard dishes are $15, it's a great deal. I've gotten some excellent swordfish steaks, as well as some excellent halibut. The sides are awesome too...the potato pancakes are the jam. The place itself can be a little cramped at dinner, especially if the outside area isn't open. It's BYOB which is nice, but they also have a selection of craft beers and wine available. It's a really great place, I wish I could eat there more!
