This place has gotten dramatically better over the time it's been open. Wakamono is now in my top 5 for sushi in Chicago. The sushi is very fresh, the rolls creative, and the sake recommendations are actually well thought out.  Sushi Freshness: There are few places where you can try Uni (Sea Urchin) as a rookie and not lose your lunch as a newbie. Often this is because the Uni often served in the city is on the tipping point of going bad. This is due to the fact that Americans haven't formed a love for this yet.  The rest of the selections are fantastic.  Rolls Are Creative - Even the salad role (ideal for vegetarians) is excellent. If you've gone and dates with vegetarians and want to impress next time, try this. They won't feel guilty for making you eat vegetarian yet they will have enough to eat here.  The Sake: The list is simple, yet diverse. It's not as broad of a selection as Rise but it is elegant due to its simplicity. A few things to try: Jalapeno Miso Soup, Emerald Roll, and of course the Uni - be warned, it's an acquired taste, but worth trying. Enjoy! PS - Ask for the table near the koi pond.
