We did the Sunday Brunch for $48/person. Loved the lobster bisque, pork/beef (don't remember which) tenderloin, oysters, and waffles. Everything else was just okay. My least favorites were the steamed crab legs and bacon. The crab legs were super salty and the guy serving them was kind of stingy. He seemed to enforce a two-piece limit so I had to constantly get up to refill my fiancee's plate. The cold crab legs were better, but, generally, not as good cold. The bacon was too sweet and cut too thick. Food is definitely better quality than other buffets, and there is a decent variety. Kinda weird that they serve sushi though. I'm still unsure if I'd squeeze out another $50 bucks for brunch. Perhaps if there was another table of food or better breakfast fare? We definitely want to try dinner next time we're in town. Don't order their Signature Bloody Mary. It's TERRIBLE.
