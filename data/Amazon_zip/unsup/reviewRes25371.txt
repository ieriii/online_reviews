Amazing food, the best Spanish wine list I've seen in Chicago and hip, impressive interiors. Definitely get some of the cheese selections with their super yummy spreads and toppings. The seafood paella was to die for and a small enough portion that I didn't have to convince the rest of the table to "go in on it"... it also came out really quickly so that was a nice change. It is easy to drop a lot of cash but you'll be too overwhelmed with flavor to care. :)
