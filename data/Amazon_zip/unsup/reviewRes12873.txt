dad's eat free on father's day! i took my family here for dinner one father's day. it was my dad's first time here. my dad loves meat so he totally fell in love with texas de brazil. my mom isn't a meat lover . she was perfectly content with their salad bar. everytime i go, i walk in with an empty stomach, walk out looking like a pregnant lady! all worth it though. i love their bread and love that they have oysters at the salad bar for dinner. not sure if they still do. service is always excellent. if you sign up on their mailing list, they always send you free meal coupons and discounts.
