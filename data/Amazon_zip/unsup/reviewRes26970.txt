Caramelized crust was good, but the pizza overall was not. This is the exact reason I don't generally like deep-dish...Pequod's crust is more like a thick, heavy Bisquick creation rather than the chewy, flavorful yeast-based crusts I prefer. I can't exactly say if it's better or worse than any other deep-dish, but I didn't like it. And it took over 45 minutes to get my carryout pie. It's a shame...I've heard for 10 years how good this place was. The search continues.
