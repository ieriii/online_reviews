I have to agree with Andrea, Garcia's is toxic! I was forced to go to Garcia's against my better judgement the other night to meet some friends. From previous experiences there, I smartly chose not to order food and stuck with a margarita (blah)....guess what? I was the only one who wasn't up all night with cramps and other fun bowel issues. I also made a trip to the bathroom and got to see a few cockroaches roaming around the floor. It is the absolute LAST time I ever go there. How does this place stay open? It is filthy and the food is inedible! I would much rather go to Los Nopales down the street.
