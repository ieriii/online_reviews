Do not patronize Garcia's. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants with good food and better service. Their food is decent, but the service is consistently very poor. They have little concept of customer service. It seems that they don't want to accommodate you, even an easy request of subbing another meat in a dish (al pastor instead of chorizo). In addition, even though menu items under one category said they come with rice and beans, the waitresses wouldn't accommodate it since it only came with certain dishes.  Again another excuse - "we don't write the menu, we just serve the food." And, when I said that they need to indicate that on the menu or change it, the waitress rolled her eyes at me and walked away... Really?! Great customer service! Stay away and spend your hard-earned money somewhere else. Never again, Garcia's. You've lost my friends' and my business.
