So far in Chicago, this is my second favorite pizza place. Pizano's has my heart for the number one spot, but the Art of Pizza is a very close and very good second place. The slices are huge--I was full off of one slice of their stuffed pizza. The crust is buttery and delicious and the sauce is a wonderful combination of sweet and tomato-y. If you're in the neighborhood and want some great Chicago pizza, this definitely one of the best places to go. Just a heads up, if you order "thin" crust, it's not cracker thin, it's more along the lines of pan style. But still incredibly delicious.
