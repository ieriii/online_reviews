I love this place... If you're worried about bad service, you gotta get used to it when you go to a more "authentic" east asian place. You are getting the same service you would in asia. Its short, sweet, blunt, and to the point and you get your food in a timely fashion. The bulgogi wasn't as flavorful as some others ive had but the amount of banchan you get with your meet is great. Bring some friends get drunk on some soju and enjoy ridiculous amounts of food...having eaten at korean bbq spots with native koreans, bringing lots of people and getting shitfaced is a must. Order the pork!
