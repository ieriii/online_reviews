Thee place to go to when you want the best and consistently delicious vegan food in the city. Whenever we have out of town guests this is the place we always go to take our non-vegan peeps and they never leave disappointed. It's a comfortable and trendy space with such a diverse crowd of patrons. I consider the Chicago Diner a good ole friend, always reliable and makes the day/night brighter. Also, the shakes are the desserts are to die for!
