Discovered this place on a recommendation from a friend - my boyfriend and I are now big fans. He's a big meat eater and I'm a vegetarian, so we love that there's always something tasty for each of us to eat. Neither of us are beer drinkers, however, but I'm quite happy with a small cider selection and the mixed drinks are good, too! We've never had a problem with service and seem to go at 'the right time' and haven't had to wait, but the noise is my real complaint; even is the music is low when we arrive, by the time we leave the noise is club-level loud. If you're seated on the floor (opposed to the booths that overlook the restaurant), there's no escaping it.
