Absolutely delicious! The fried zucchini with garlic sauce (Skordalia) and my baked shrimp, feta and tomato sauce served over rice (Garides) was so yummy. I only wish I didn't eat it all so I had some leftovers. The service was excellent and the restaurant is big and inviting. This is definitely "My Kind of Town"! Plus for those of you visiting with kids, Greek Islands is kid-friendly!
