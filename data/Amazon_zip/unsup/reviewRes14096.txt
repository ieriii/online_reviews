I'm just going to have to go with 4 stars for now, until I can go back when things have died down a bit. I didn't try the food, except for the bacon popcorn, which was good, but almost gratuitous. Everything I saw people getting looked amazing. The beer I tried was pretty good. Nothing blew me away. But it was solid all around. I was also surprised to see that in addition to their own beers they offer a wide selection of other beers craft and otherwise, including Goose Island and Half Acre, which I didn't expect. The decor is pretty well done. The definitely sank some money into this place. Hip and a little upscale, which seems to be the way the area around here is going, whether you or anyone likes it or not. The difference with this establishment is that it will become a destination spot for people from other parts of the city to come to. And I do think it is good for the neighborhood.
