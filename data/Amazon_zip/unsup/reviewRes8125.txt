Not much more to say than what others have said so I'll just write something brief to pad my numbers. I've been to both here and Brizazz (sp?) now. I thought the meat overall was better here, but the salad bar fell short. It was fresh and tasty but not nearly the variety as the place a few blocks down. Service was excellent - we had a party of 8, our waiter was very friendly, the meat guys were cool, and the manager came over a couple times to see how we were doing and genuinely seemed to care. I loved when we flipped our coins to green for the first time and the table was absolutely swarmed with meat. Overall a great experience.
