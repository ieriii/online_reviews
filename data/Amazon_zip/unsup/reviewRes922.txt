For meat-eaters this place is king. And if you're a vegetarian -- like myself-- this place is just eh well I could make this myself...  I ordered the Joe Strummer Dog. Basically, a Chicago Style with a veggie dog. The dog was plain, probably a Tofu pup or Yves branded and it was loaded with a fresh pickle, relish, onions and tomatoes. Considering this place is all about the gourmet, a Toffutti branded vegan sausage would have been legit. Grill that up a little and vegetarians would have a lot more to talk about. Not that this place is catering towards people of my persuasion, but it makes the experience better when you're trying to oblige your meat eater friends. Everyone that works at Hot Doug's is great. Super friendly, relaxed atmosphere, so that makes up for the lackluster vegetarian fare. If you're going to get dragged here by your meat-eaters buddies, then I'd suggest trying to get the veggie dog mixed into something other than the Joe Strummer. See if they can put some cheese, sauce or something other than the usual on it.
