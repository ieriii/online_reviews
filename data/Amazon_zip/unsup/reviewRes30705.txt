Nana caught my eye based on a food show they were on. Nice looking place with a different menu. I went for breakfast so I only saw the breakfast & lunch menu. You have to be a fan of spice and spanish style food to appreciate this place. I got the Nanadict which was featured on diners, drives, and dives with Guy. It was very good, had a bunch of different flavors, spices, and textures. The poached eggs brought the meal together. My favorite item on the plate was the tortilla cakes (not sure the official name) that was resting under the chorizo and eggs. My girlfriend got the chicken sandwich, nothing special but the sweet potato chips were top notch. Nana only got 4 stars because the green tea tasted like there were flower petals in the tea bags, the mac & cheese was more of a baked alfredo pasta, and it was on the more expensive side for breakfast.
