It was fantastic! I loved the bacon-wrapped dates, stuffed with almonds and the croquettes. The olives were only ok. I wish I would have ordered the cheese plate (Queso - Mixto)... the folks next to us did and it looked excellent. The service was OK, but not great, but all-in-all, it was an excellent meal! I would definitely return!
