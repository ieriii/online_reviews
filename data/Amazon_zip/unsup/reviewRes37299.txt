Ill start with the only reason I did not give it 5 stars... I really think they should either have a list for out door seating or some sort of bar area along the flower box to set your beer and stand next to-as not to awkwardly loom while you wait for the first come first serve out door tables... The waitress was amazing! I told her what I craved in a world of dark beer and she delivered beyond my expectations... On a side note I went to buy this beer at SAMS and it was $4 or $5 a bottle which means Hopleaf's markup was not all that much-which-blows my mind not only do they have one of the best beer selections in Chicago it is decidedly fairly priced! I had the Duck Reuben and it was just delicious! What more could I ask for? Oh I know!-A spoon or a straw to suck down that amazing dipping sauce for the fries-are you kidding me! That sauce is mind blowing our table clearly almost had a passive fight for that amazing little cup of sauce! It was no weak sauce for sure! I was dining with some discerning out of towners who had just done the Alinea 23 courses of ecstasy the day before... They still found excitement here at my neighborhood Hopleaf, little did I know that this place is known at all corners of the earth... Now I do and understand the wait a little better-darn tourists! Just kidding! I have had more then a few questions as to what beer I was drinking as with many of the beers you will partake in-it was served in a glass specific to its varietal... It is - I copied this from the brewers website... St Bernardus Abt 12 The absolute top quality in the hierarchy of the St. Bernardus beers. It is also the beer with the highest alcohol content (10.50 %). A dark ivory coloured beer with a high fermentation. The show piece of the brewery. Thanks to its soft and unconditionally genuine aroma, the beer can be smoothly tasted. The Abt has a very fruity flavour. Hop Hop Hop To The Hopleaf!
