Our group of 5 dined here for their infamous Beijing duck dinner. I dutifully made our reservations and reserved the duck dinner for the table. Tuesday night at 630 and the place was pretty empty, but by 7pm it was starting to quickly fill up. Along with the duck dinner we ordered some Chinese Broccoli and a seafood dinner special. Once all the food arrived at the table, it didn't look like there was going to be enough. But at the end of dinner, we were all satisfied and I was the lucky recipient of our duck leftovers. Leftovers! Our meal came to about $15 per person. Not too shabby. The duck is delicious. It's a fatty fowl, but delicious and flavorful. The crispy skin adds some texture and crunch and is soooo worth the splurge. The fluffy white buns you get to make little duck "sammies" with are wonderful. It's like bao dough only BETTER. It's as good as my mom's siopao dough and that's saying a lot. Add some daikon and plum sauce and it's a delectable treat. The duck soup and the duck fried rice were just OK. I'd rather just eat more bao and duck sammies the next time I visit. Or get the noodles--I've heard the duck and noodles are out of this world. Chinese Broccoli was very fresh, well steamed but not overdone at all. I like the place--airy and open with lots of exposed brick. Our original server was OK, but she disappeared on us leaving us asking another server and a busser for all our needs. Eh, they ended up taking good care of us in the end.
