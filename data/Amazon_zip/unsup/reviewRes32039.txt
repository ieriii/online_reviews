What a nice experience!! Came here with a group of 7, called ahead of time to make sure there would be gluten free injera- which when we tried next to the regular in comparrison was pretty awesome!! Prob even better and more flavorful although slightly heavier. You def need less. Restaurant was clean, fresh, service was absolutely wonderful and warm, friendly and accomodating. Flavors were a nice heated spice that creeps up slowly on you. We told them we were all eating veg, and they suggested family style and took the show into their own hands,,,, Seved us plenty of sambusa apps which were light and fresh and YUM, followed by a few giant platters of lots of veg options on our family style injera!!! I love all the greens, the beet dish, and the chickpea and lentil dishes. Not a huge lover of the split pea, carrot or potato ones. Priced extremely reasonably and I cannot wait to go back!!! For us all to have apps, dinner and one glass of wine each plus tax and a 20% tip our total was $30 each. NOT BAD!!! Energy is warm and inviting, great for families and friends. Casual and homey.
