My wife is going to hate me for not giving this five stars, as it's her favorite restaurant in the city. But I'm really not afraid of her. Plus she never reads my reviews. We went to Frontera for their New Year's Eve celebration, which was a semi-fixed, seven course menu. Basically you got five appetizers, each served as a separate course, then your choice of an entree, followed by three small desserts. The overall experience (including service) was 5-star, but my entree simply failed to blow me away (though I would still rate it as "very good"). Rick Bayless was present that night (first time I had seen him there). I find most TV chefs to be annoying to the point where I'd like to punch them in the face (and I'm not a violent person), but I rather like Rick, and don't find him annoying at all (although he certainly is odd). His daughter was there as well, and we saw her stop and chat with several of the children who were there for the event, which I thought was very nice. The appetizers ranged from "excellent" to "awesome": -Chips, Guacamole and Salsa -Enchildas in black bean sauce -Some weird but tasty mushroom ceviche -Tuna Ceviche (awesome) -lobster/butternut squash bisque (awesomeawesomeawesome) The desserts were excellent as well: -A flaky pastry with apples and blueberries -A dark-chocolate ice cream sandwich (wow, delicious) -Some kind of almond tart My wife had the pork dish, which was smothered in a mole sauce. She declared it "delicious"--a word she rarely uses. I had the flank steak, which was good, but not particularly memorable. It was more spicy than flavorful. My entree came with a sweet tamale which was actually more interesting than the steak itself. We will certainly be back, since this is my wife's favorite restaurant and we tend to come for her birthday and other special occasions. Plus, let's face it, she's the boss of me.
