We didn't go to the main restaurant we went to the diner/oyster bar bit. The restaurant was deserted as it was a saturday afternoon but it looked very atmospheric and very reminiscent of America circa 1920's - 1960's, fabulous. The oyster bar was well cool, it was like walking into a time capsule. Very clean, buzzy, high tables and stools and a very efficient and friendly waitress. I ordered fish and chips which was really good. The chips were pretty good although they could have been a bit chunkier. The fish (Haddock) was nice and crisp and the tartare sauce was pretty good too. I had a Diet coke which came with free refills which at $2.50 wasn't bad. My partner had a gin and tonic which at $11.50 which pretty appalling, they called it a cocktail but a gin and tonic is not a cocktail. Still if my other half wasn't such an alcoholic he would have had the damn coke. Still he was paying, bless him. So I can highly recommend the oyster bar although we didn't have oysters! The clam chowder was really nice too!
