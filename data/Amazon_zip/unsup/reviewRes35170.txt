Finding good Chinese food in Chicago is as likely as the Cubs winning the World Series any time soon.  However, here's one of a small handful of Chinese food restaurants worth a look.. First off, i'm not a midwesterner (don't hold that against me) but I've had my fair share of addiction to the China Towns of San Francisco, NYC, DC, and LA.  Chicago's China town by comparison... a solid C/C-.   I digress... I was shocked (and enamored) to see meat hanging in the window.  Hallelujah !  Good sign number 1.   Peking duck actually on the menu?  Good sign #2. If you're grossed-out by a "butcher" chopping poultry and pig parts as you walk into a restaurant then you're better off going to to Joy Yee or PF Changs to order "chinese food" (and don't read any more of my reviews) But if you're still reading, I recommend giving their menu a try.
