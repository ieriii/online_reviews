Geez, what happened? Mia Francesca's used to be one of my go-to restaurants for solid Italian food and last night I felt like I had been tricked into going to Olive Garden, though I feel that the food might actually be better there. To start, the herbs in the olive oil served at the table were dried, not fresh, which is really disappointing. I don' t like woody bits in my olive oil. It messes up the tasty bread they serve. Minorish point, that. More importantly, all three pasta dishes we ordered were really sub-par. The pasta was way overcooked in each dish; one of my friend's cavatappi was just falling into mush. On top of that, all dishes were way oversauced, to the point it was like pasta in soup and didn't resemble anything you would find in a "real" Italian restaurant. Sure, the flavors were still good--it's kind of difficult to mess up the awesomeness natively present in basil, garlic, or tomatoes. But darned if they didn't try. On the plus side, the service is super friendly and they do make you feel welcome. Now if only they would step the pasta dishes up. I don't like paying so much for food I can make better at home. That's kind of the point of eating out.
