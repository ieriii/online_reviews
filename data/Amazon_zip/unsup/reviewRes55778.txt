8 of us joined at Sabatino's to see off a couple flying back home. Most of us had not been to Sabatino's before. Each and every one of us walked out of the dark, comfortable restaurant knowing we had just had a wonderful experience. This is no fast food place. We enjoyed a relaxed, extended meal. So extended, that the couple flying out had to be served early and leave to catch their flight. One of us left to take them to the airport and their meal was preserved for him. The food was very plentiful and every single dish was excellent. The pizza bread starter alone was good enough for a return visit. The side pasta dishes were fabulous - my preference was the mostaccioli.If you are fortunate enough to have Max as your server, you will enjoy an outstanding experience. Absolutely attentive without being intrusive - funny and engaging.I loved Sabatino's. It is an old vintage Italian restaurant.
