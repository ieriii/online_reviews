One of my favorites.  First off, it's real close by, super-convenient... Secondly and / or thirdly: The layout is comfy, the food is very, very good (healthy, hearty, tasty), and the waiters always seem to be casual, informative, funky folk.  I just love the vibe here. First dates, noshin' with good friends... I've even have had some business-type meetings here.   I love sitting by the fireplace on the big squishy chairs. (I can't remember if there's a couch there - probably is.) Oh, and I've seen intimate live music here in the back. *Crystal Bowersox did a gig or two here!  Okay, enough of the queer-ball starstruckedness.  Yikes, I almost forgot, when it's a nice, warm day or breezy summer night... I've just had a delightful time, sitting outside, with my doggy Winnie, sitting next to me - just outside the patio area.   Menu favorites include: Huevos Uncommon, the soups, spinach / goat cheese dip, the chopped salad... Burgers, sandwiches...  And of course, the sweet potato fries.  The one drawback could be the price.  But, I know what I'm paying for. Good food, good atmosphere.  So there ya go.
