I absolutely love the interior design of this restaurant. The food was great! A little on the pricey side, but well worth it. Drinks on the other hand were not all that great to me. Try the garlic noodles. You won't be sorry! Be sure to make your reservations well in advance. This place is packed during dinner hours!
