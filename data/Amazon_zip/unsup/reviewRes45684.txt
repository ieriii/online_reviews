Late dinner on a Friday (choices dwindle remarkably after 10p.m.) mostly because it took me a long time to get it together and drive up to the North Side. Me and a friend walked down Broadway looking for something outside the realm of quick food (don't get me wrong, I'm always ready to go to Taco Bell) and the Wilde Bar was still serving food and it was close to 11p.m.. I got my standard bacon burger (fried egg was not available) with sweet potato fries on the side and it was alright even though I was so hungry I would have eaten paste and/or gum off the bottom of a CTA bus seat. I tried a number of their different beers (Commodore Perry, Pere Jacques, Sophie, Alpha King) but none of them really screamed "I'M OUTSTANDING." The inside of the place looked nice, although dim lighting makes a lot look nice. Including but not limited to people. And as a self-described gentleman whose performed the Walk-of-Shame on a number of occasions, I can wholly attest to the dim-light makeup. Like they say, "Beauty is only a dimmer switch away." Or is it a light switch. I don't know. Helpful tip: If and when you have your eye on a certain draft beer, ask to sample it before you commit to a tall glass because it tasted like the lines were dirty. I wish you could easily do that with women.
