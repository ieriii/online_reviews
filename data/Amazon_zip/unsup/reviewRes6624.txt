I loved Chicago Q! Highlights: -Delicious house-made pickles and chips are complimentary! I could have eaten that whole bowl of pickles myself, they were that good -The appetizer sampler platter that allows you to try the chicken, pork, and kobe brisket, plus cornbread and their 4 barbecue sauces. That's a great way to start off the meal and see what Chicago Q has to offer -As an entre I got the pork shoulder with coleslaw. It was an enormous portion, so I took over half of it home for lunch the next day. -The poblano cheese cornbread was out of this world, and I don't even like cornbread. I'm still dreaming of that stuff. The decor is casual but modern and our server was great. Can't wait to go back!
