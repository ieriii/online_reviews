I am very late to review but still jazzed (doh-ho-ho) about reviewing my experience. We probably strolled in here 1:30 in the morning, of course carded at the door by someone I would not like to make mad. I promptly had to use the restroom to attempt to rid hiccups in, failed so I asked the bartender for water cause of my hiccups and he scowled at me and asked me to do it again, and it worked hiccups stopped and he gave me water with a smile. The jazz I saw here was amazing, a.m.a.z.i.n.g! even if I wanted to talk I couldn't because I was in the moment with my wine and jazz. drink prices were great. talked to the musician who played a full two hours until 4 in the morning, he gave me and mr. t a free c.d met some pretty cool people in the crowd here too love it, I will definitely be back here next time I am in town
