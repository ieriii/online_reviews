Amazing dining experience. Easily in my top 3 ever. We dine out at least 100 times per year. My girlfriend picked this place but was nervous that I wouldn't like it since I'm not nearly as adventurous as she is. When I looked at the menu I was a little apprehensive that the food was too different for me. We went there on a Friday night when it was extremely busy. We were told we had a 45 minute wait so we tried to order a few drinks at the bar. It was so crowed we were ready to give up and leave. Next thing we know a bar waitress takes our order and tells us to go to the back where it's less crowded and she'll bring us our drinks. On the way there we somehow bump into the owner, Jimmy, who sits us down at a counter right next to where the servers pick up the orders. Cluttered, tight courters, a bustle of activity all around us but still, the best seat in the house. We saw everything they made right in front of us. Probably met the entire staff. They were so efficient, attentive, professional, and happy. They all seemed to have fun working there. I forget our servers name, but he was great. One of the chefs, Amanda, was so friendly and helpful. It was like having our own personal chef. We just ordered what they suggested and everything was so so delicious. This place is a must.
