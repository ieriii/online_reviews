Recently stayed at the Drake Hotel (4 nights). The hotel itself was beautiful! The staff was very helpful and friendly. Beds were very comfortable as well. The only downside was the fact that the rooms are not standard queen/king beds. --They have rooms with two twin beds and one bathroom, but in order to have a room with two queen beds, you have to upgrade to a suite, which includes two bathrooms. Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant or tea, unfortunately. Overall, the stay was good.
