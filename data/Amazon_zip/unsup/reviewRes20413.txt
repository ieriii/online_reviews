Great spot. Went late on Thursday night with reservation and although when we got there the place was jumping and extremely loud it mellowed out around 9:30. Sushi rolls were good but the tuna and yellowtail were out of this world. Not the most romantic environment but for what we got it was very reasonably priced. It was boyfriends birthday and they did beautiful desert with candle deal. Very complimentary BYOB. Wait staff was first rate. Will definitely go back.
