When I called to make a reservation on a Tuesday night for 10 people, I was told the manager would return my call, but if he didn't, to not count on having a reservation. Hmmf. That kind of wrinkled my nose, but we ended up getting the reservation anyway, and everything went smoothly from there. The pizza was fantastic. Perfect thin crust, just enough seasoning, and not too chewy. The red sauce with pepperoni really hit the spot. However, red sauce with chicken and spinach did not do it for me. I suggest sticking to the good ole' artery-clogging ingredients here. Their beers cover a good range, too. I had some Belgian draft that was perfectly light for my taste.  Our bill was $14/pp, which included 2 large pizzas and drinks for everyone. All in all, worth the price.
