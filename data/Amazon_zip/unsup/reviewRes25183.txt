I used to like this place. Then they fed me their Tequila Pollo sandwich with salmonella tomatoes last Thursday. (see p.s.) When I informed them, they said, "Sorry". A week of salmonella, a canceled trip, and a poisoned meal and all they have is "sorry"! I thought a refund, a free nonpoisonous meal in its place, ANYTHING, was customary! I understand these mistakes happen, even though it had been two days since the killer-tomato warning went out! But its their job to be on top of these warnings and its their job to make sure a poisoned customer is later consoled. I wish there was a 0 star rating. p.s. Theres also another diarrhea review here. BEWARE! Maybe it wasn't salmonella. Maybe it was more anal-food. p.p.s. I'm not a jerk when ordering my TAKE-OUT. So no, I didn't have it coming.
