For greek food with a contemporary twist, Artopolis is a winner. This combination deli-bakery-bar-restaurant has a casual, cafe-style charm.  While they do have some traditional dishes, they also feature excellent salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. My favorite items, hands down, are the Artopitas...mmmm. These filo dough turnovers are stuffed with all kinds of goodies, emmenthal and mushroom, kasseri and feta, etc...and they are AMAZING! Artopolis has a counter in the food court at Midway, and these artopitas are part of my pre-flight ritual...sometimes I have to get one post-flight on the way home (shh, don't tell anyone)! Okay, back to the Greektown store...The pastry counter is insane! There is a mango yogurt cream thing that is just to die for. Oh, God, I'm getting hungry. Go there. Just go.
