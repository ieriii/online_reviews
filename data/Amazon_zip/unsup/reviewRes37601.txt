First off, I have to say that the Hopleaf has one of the finest micro-brew menus in the city. Sometimes, a person can forget what a good beer is like. Last night, I drank exactly 1 triple karmeliet and 1 anchorsteam over 2 1/2 hours. And, I was not only drunk (these brews don't mess around with alcohol content) but felt full rather than bloated. That said, the crowd was horrid. There is absolutely no "mingle" factor. Folks come in parties of 4-8 and use their group-inflated confidence to shove lowly parties of 2 away from open seats and tables as quickly as possible. Without getting into a rant about the overall lack of chivalry expressed by north-side, creative-professional-whatever men, I want to illistrate a quick scene for you: A girlfriend and I see that a group is getting up from a table. We walk over and stand patiently (it's kind of like waiting for a parking spot; we have our turn signal on). They leave. We put our beers down. Ahhh. Finally. Seats. Oh wait...what's this? Three representatives from the Salvation Army Surplus Store are making a diagonal sort of move towards our new reprieve. A defunct American Apparel model trails closely behind. They proceed to try and gain her approval by bullying us (two single women) until we leave our post. Well played, boys. Well played.
