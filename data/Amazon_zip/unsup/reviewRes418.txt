I don't know what to add to the heaps of praise dumped on this establishment, but I do know that each of the three times I have experienced Grant's wizardry has been one of the peak dining experiences of my life. Simply, it boils down to this. Regardless of all the advanced and scientific cooking techniques they employ, the food here is always grounded in the fact that it should first and foremost taste good. Sure, there are parts of an Alinea dining experience that are inventive to the point of being wacky, but it's not just for wacky's sake. Every twist, every invention is rooted in respectful consideration of the ingredients--they let the essence come through, and how they do it is really clever and fun. The presentation is like getting to eat art. Tasty, tasty art. And science. The staff is attentive and friendly without being obsequious, removed enough to let you enjoy your meal at your pace, but willing enough to talk smack about wine, food, music, etc. if you are on your fourth glass of paired wine and feeling chatty. I am going back in a couple weeks, and won't even blink at the price. I shop at thrift stores so I can afford this food.
