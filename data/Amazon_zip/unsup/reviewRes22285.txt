2012 BIB GOURMAND WINNER FROM THE MICHELIN GUIDE The Michelin Guide released their 2012 Bib Gourmand Winners late last night. Not only do they come with a super-cool logo, chalked in the night by Michelin's team of restaurant ninjas, they signify "affordable" restaurants. Bib Gourmand winners don't usually get stars. On the plus side, this is a place for Michelin to recognize ethnic restaurants - and this year Lao Sze Chuan got some love. This restaurant is one of Tony Lao's and based on UB Dogs' Uncle Bob's recommendation we ordered #640 Spicy Crispy Chinese Eggplant with Ground Pork and then we decided to try #503 Double Fried Slice Pork with Cilantro Jiahou style (dry). Both were delicious and we boxed them to go so we could try some other restaurants in Chinatown. that Uncle Bob knows his foods. Thanks Uncle Bob !
