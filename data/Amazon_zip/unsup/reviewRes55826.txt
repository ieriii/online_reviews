The food is great at Calo's. I do have a problem with their packaging. Every item of food is at least double wrapped. Not only in containers but aluminum foil and paper as well. In a time where it is clearly apparent that waste and over consumption is leading to global problems it seems absurd that they are almost flaunting waste with their packaging..They would get 4 stars if they had greener practices.
