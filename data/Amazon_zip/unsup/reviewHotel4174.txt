This hotel is in a great location for some good, touristy sight seeing. It is next to the Chicago River and walking distance to both the Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The rooms are very nice with large, comfy beds. The atmosphere is pretty upbeat. Only downside is the lack of free wifi and the tv gets bad reception. I mean, I did not go to Chicago to watch tv but on down time it is nice to sit and veg. The signal was in and out constantly. All in all, I would recommend this hotel.
