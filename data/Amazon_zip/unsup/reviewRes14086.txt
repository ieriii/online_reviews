Mustard Herb Chicken Sandwich. When you get it, take the top bun off and rip out the inside of the bread, your top bun will fit perfectly over that delicious piece of chicken and you will more efficiently enjoy that sando. Hell yeah. Goat Cheese Croquette Salad. Eat it however you want, its phenomenal. Once I was there and they had this pizza that had goat cheese and cute yellow tomatoes- it was off the chain. This place looks incredible. A welcome establishment in Logan Square... especially compared to Logan Bar and Grill which is whack in comparison. 5 Stars! I love eating! Oh- beer is also cool!
