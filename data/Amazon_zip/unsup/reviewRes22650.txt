It's always amazing food, it's incredibly fast, and it's affordable. Seriously operates like a machine, churning out food for hundreds of customers every day, but the quality is certainly not lost. I would go here any day of the week for the chicken riganati (sp). Try the fish as well. Free valet parking, by the way.
