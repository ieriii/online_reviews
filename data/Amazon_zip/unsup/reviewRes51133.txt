I came here for breakfast on a Saturday and it was really good. It was nice that it was so big, so the wait was not too long even on a hot Saturday. I got the southern biscuit that came with eggs and cheese grits and gravy. I was pretty impressed they had sweet tea here, though it's never the same as they do it in the south. Anyways it's a great place to come and get brunch and see a lot of southern things on the menu. It's not very authentic though so don't come expecting to get fabulous southern food. For the price though, you can't go wrong... I want to come back for NC BBQ night...
