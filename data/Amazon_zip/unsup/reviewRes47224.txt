Nice to have a restaurant that has great burgers AND fries. Lockdown's fries were probably the best fries I've ever had. The dipping sauce was so delicious too. I ended up doing the Flight Risk per the bartender's rec. I had three mini burgers (Arson, Punk Bitch, and The Big House). All were so good! They were cooked perfectly, were extremely juicy and who doesn't love pretzel rolls. I will definitely be back soon!!
