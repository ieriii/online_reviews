I'm surprised I don't have a review for Revolution already posted. From the day they made it public that a brewery would be opening within walking distance of my apartment, I was beyond ecstatic. The first few trips were hit or miss, but they've really hit their stride in both service and, more importantly, their beers. The food is great. I can't figure out why someone would put up with bland standard bar food at nearby cookie cutter bars when you can have really well crafted meals at Revolution. I have never been let down. The beef stew is amazing. But beyond the food, the real reason this place hits the spot is of course the beer. The first few batches were tolerable, but not memorable. Thankfully they tweaked their mainstays and really put some effort into their newer brews. The recent rye beer was amazing, and the collab with Three Floyds really impressed. I look forward to every release with anticipation for what they come up with next.
