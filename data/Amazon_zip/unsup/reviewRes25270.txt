What a surprise! I've never had an exceptional tapas experience until Mercat.  Met a friend here for dinner before the Joffrey Ballet last Friday night. The place was a last minute choice, so of course we couldn't get seated for dinner, but the cozy bar on the first floor served the full menu, so we lucked out.  Everything we had was exceptional, the bacon wrapped dates, the paella, the shrimp flat bread, and the mussels. Plus, just the bread they served as freebie was exceptional, with fresh tomato and garlic on a strip of a nice flavorful focaccia type bread.   The place was so good, that I brought my husband back there the next night - again couldn't get reservations, so we sat in a cozy little booth/nook near the upstairs bar. It wasn't a fluke, the second night was as good as the first and we tried several different things including the short-ribs/scallops and a ravioli that was just exceptional.  We drank the white sangria. We ordered a pitcher but they were out of the actual vessels so our server just kept filling our glasses throughout the evening and charged us for the pitcher, which ended up being a good deal I think because we took our time ordering food and spent nearly two hours enjoying the food and the atmosphere. Now I'm trying to decide who I'll introduce this place to next, out-of-town guests, pals, or plan ahead a bit more and get a real reservation for a romantic dinner for two.
