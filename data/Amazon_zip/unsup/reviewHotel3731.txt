Awesome from the beginning....all the staff was very accommodating and GOOD LOOKING...I thought I was in the twilight zone for a second. Our luggage got to our room in a timely manner. At the time of our stay the elevators we messed up so the poor employees had to come get every guest whenever they called. They were always there fast.  The rooms were modern with free wi-fi. The peek-a-boo shower would have been great if I was not there with my best girlfriend. The view from our room was awesome. We didn't get a chance to visit the spa but we did go to Vertigo Sky lounge. Great patio that you can get room service, bottle service, or just drink if you want. The staff made us all feel very comfortable and gave spectacular customer service.  I would recommend this place to anyone. Great service, vibe, food, EVERYTHING!!
