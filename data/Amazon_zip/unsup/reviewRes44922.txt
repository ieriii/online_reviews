Gross. When we first walked in, i felt that we may be in a chain type of place, but being from Philadelphia, i couldn't be sure. We ordered a small special and were fine with waiting the 40 minutes for it to be cooked (this is totally understandable) but like Hitarho said, it wasn't the size of the pizza that made me stop after one slice, it was the taste. totally bland and not even hot. I love my sauce too, and this just didn't do it for me. i felt like I had been robbed of my chicago deep dish experience.
