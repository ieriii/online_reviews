I liked Las Tablas better when it was across the street, as a whole in the wall, BYOB joint. Now they're trying to be all uppity with their fresh fruit this and fresh mint that.  The service was slow as molasses.  It took a looong time for everything. Good thing we weren't in a hurry, because it was "let's-go-somewhere-else-slow". So it took forever to get our drinks and even longer to get our empenadas. After waiting 30 minutes, 1 empenada ended up being cold in the middle. We notified the waiter, and he brought us another (very quickly - that was the only quick thing during the night), and it was frozen in the middle!!!  Then our entrees came, and we told him we didn't want another. The rest of the food was mediocre. The yucca was icky, very stringy. And I would have preferred the plantains to be cut up in smaller pieces for caramelization.  I had a couple of fresh fruit martinis, and I was drinking the fruit in chunks. My strawberry martini was full of seeds, and my mango martini was like eating cut-up mango. They were pretty strong though, but definitely not worth the price, and I would pass for next time. Then our bill. Our server made the biggest deal about not charging us for the second empenada. OBVIOUSLY! He made it seem like he was doing us the favor of a lifetime. You gave me cold empenadas on 2 separate tries and you want me to thank you for not charging me (and by the way, we got charged for the one we ate)?!  Next!
