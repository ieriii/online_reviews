Here is the thing - the food is so good - it really is - I crave the breakfast empanadas - CRAVE them - but why oh why do they put slow duckies at the register - there is always this lovely woman at the register who makes me feel like I have arrived at my favorite place - but when she is not there I KNOW IT WILL TAKE THIRTY MINUTES to get a little empanada which I can grab with my own hand - sigh I am thinking I need to buy a dozen - freeze and warm up eh? I don't even get the churros anymore - as amazing as they are - because it takes too long for mr. hurry about Seriously - if you are not in a rush - what a dreamy place for a different kind of breakfast - just not fast - hah then in chicago you can't even get a fast bagel at einstein's.... oh cute boy factor LOW - when they first opened everyone was a hottie - now not so much - not so much
