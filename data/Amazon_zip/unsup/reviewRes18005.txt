I took a couple friends new to the city here (OK I'm still new too but I did my research already!) and we were all very pleased with our first Rick Bayless experience! I had the pork belly torta (Wed special)... great choice, me! So good and surprisingly filling for a sandwich.. I took half home for boyfriend, who scarfed it up and demanded more.. so we went back a few days later. Goat barbacoa torta (Sat special) was on point, but the suckling pig was kinda dry and bland, unfortunately. Their bread is to-die-for, perfectly crusty and warm, and the fillings are usually super flavor-packed and juicy. Churro's pretty good.. not too sweet and kinda light. Aztec hot chocolate wasn't spicy but was still mighty tasty. Both times, we were seated pretty quickly, once outside and once inside. You line up for the far register and wait for a table number to be assigned to you before you can actually order, and they bring you your food. If you want to sit outside or order carry-out you can order at the front register. Worked fine for us.
