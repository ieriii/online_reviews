stay far away from this place!! the food is mediocre and the service is absolutely terrible! the weekend hostess is rude and the manager, justin, is even worse. if you want to eat what you actually ordered WITHOUT hair or suspicious foreign items in your food, this place isn't for you. it's dirty and the staff does nothing to improve the experience. save yourself some hassle...because that's all you'll get from them...hassle, hair, and rudeness. try pasta pallazo at halsted and armitage for a much better meal!
