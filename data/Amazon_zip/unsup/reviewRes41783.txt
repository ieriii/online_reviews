II really enjoy this place. Good soups, apps and regular dishes. Their menu is quite extensive and I would recommend placing an appetizer order I like the combinations. If there are two of you the combo app and one of the soups will be plenty for two. I really like bun and theirs are delicious. Service leaves something to be desired but there always seems someone walking around that you can ask for help. I would recommend going there for lunch on a week day a little less busy.
