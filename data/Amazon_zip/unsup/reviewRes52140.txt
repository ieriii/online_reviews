This is another place I tend to only go to when I'm playing tour guide downtown to out of town visitors and they want a "Chicago Pizza Experience." Be prepared for a bit of an ordeal during peak dinner times to get a table. First you end up in a line outside. Not good if weather is not good. Then after waiting 10-15 minutes, you are escorted inside to a waiting area with seats. You will be directed to move down the row of chairs as other parties are seated. The line moves quickly, but the line process is reminiscent of a cafeteria, not a sit down pizza parlor.  The thing you'll notice immediately is the graffiti on EVERYTHING that visitors have supposedly left over the years. It is on the walls, booths, seats, everywhere. At first it felt a bit dirty to me and I felt like the black marker scrawling on the booth would wear off onto my clothes, but after a bit I got used to it.  Gino's East has decent pizza. I'm not a deep-dish pizza fan, but the thin crust pizza was solid, average pizza. I'd have to say Lou Malnatis is still my preference, but I think I would go to Gino's East before Giordano's.
