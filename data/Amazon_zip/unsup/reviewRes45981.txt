If you like Cheesecake Factory, you'll like this place. I confirmed that it IS they ARE related. Which is not really a bad thing. Consistency is key, its the key to success! Just like cheesecake, plates are HUGE (wife and I just share one!) and then we have room for dessert. Nothing really jumps out for me on the menu, everything is GOOD. Not OUTSTANDING, but really good. Seriously, I recommend share A SINGLE MEAL, and share a dessert. I could care less if they waitress gives me a weird look (which, they don't here!). Desserts are REALLY good though. Can't go wrong with pastries!
