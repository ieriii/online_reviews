Perfect way to spend a winter's night in when I'm visiting DT Chicago: Call Grand Lux Cafe, order box of their PERFECT, freshly baked Chocolate chip pecan cookies to go. (check) En route to picking up your cookies, grab some milk from Walgreens. (Go for the whole milk you puss) Thoughts of those warm morsels of happiness compel your freezing California arse to brave the cold and walk a little further. (check) Order Pay Per View, or better yet, hope for a 'Big Love' marathon (check) Sit in your fancy schmancy hotel bed & bliss out to milk & cookies. Wake up with a start the next morning. See your face covered in chocolate-goodness. Feel slightly dirty and guilty about your 'decadent' evening solo. (PRICELESS)
