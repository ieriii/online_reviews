I guess I'd rate this place pretty low on the quality of pizza front - too thin and greasy for me, but I would rate it high on a fun place to meet up with friends.  Yes, it's crowded and popular on the weekends, but it's a busy and good atmosphere to hang out in - if you're into sports there are lots of TVs everywhere - I prefer the booths in the back to the high tables in front though, it can get pretty loud by the bar. I'm a big beer fan, and although I haven't been wowed by any of their brews here, they are not bad. Piece is a good spot to meet up with a group given you have time to fight the crowd and are either looking to watch a game or just looking for a pizza and beer hang-out evening.
