So I went back yesterday after taking the Half Acre brewery tour. This time I had the Strange Famous, a vegetarian burger, and opted for the pretzel bun. The patty is a house-made combination of wild mushrooms, seitan, chick peas and corn. It's topped with goat cheese, among other things. Very tasty! I am willing to forgive that the patty didn't hold together perfectly. The beer selection really is great. I like that Bad Apple focuses on a few sandwiches and burgers. There are a few things I think they could do better (see my previous review) but overall, I'm a fan!
