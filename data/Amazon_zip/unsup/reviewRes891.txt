As the 1900th review, there is at once high standards for and very little need in writing a review articulating all the reasons that Hot Doug's is a big fuckin' deal. My friend and I walked into Hot Dougs, a beacon of comfort and culinary joy after an extensive trek through public transportation + a mile long walk through the blustery Chicago winter. Since this was a Tuesday at 3PM in a snowstorm, there was no wait (phew). We shared large fries and five hot dogs between the two of us, which led to immense stomach pain and lethargy but zero regrets. I doubt you can go wrong with any of the specials. It's BYOB, and all of the people who work there are really (almost suspiciously) friendly.
