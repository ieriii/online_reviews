I had dinner here this past Saturday with my husband and friends. We arrived @ 7:30 and were quoted 1 hr for a wait. We went down the block and had a drink and 58 minutes later we were called for our table. I truly appreciate an honest time quote! The food was good. According to the table, my spinach gnocchi w/ gorganzola cream sauce was the big winner. Huge portions. I had enough for 2 more servings at home. All in all a nice experience. Then something happened. Check arrived, our friends had a $25 gift certificate which they generously applied to the bill and then we split the difference. What I can't believe is that the waiter had the audacity to come back with our signed credit card slips and "remind" us that our tips did not reflect the gift certificate or the wine service he had given us! Yes, we had a bottle of champagne and 3 bottles of wine between us (don't judge!) and we forgot to tip pre-gift certificate price. The difference was $4 from each couple, which in our wine haze we added back out of sheer embarrassment. Especially since 2 of us have worked extensively in the service industry. After, though, I am annoyed and a little angry at the server for being so rude. Unless you work at Dick's Last Resort, renegotiating your gratuity is unheard of! Especially since the wine service he mentioned was minimal. He opened 3 of the 4 bottles. Did not pour and did not change glasses! That does not count as wine service. Sorry, but I had to make this known.
