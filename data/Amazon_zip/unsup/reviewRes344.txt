Straight to the point, AMAZING!!! Went here the day after I got married (June 13, 2010) and was just blown away with the service, food, and attention to detail! Wish I could give them 10 stars. It's worth the money you spend. I would absolutely go back! My husband and I did the tasting menu and wine pairing. It was just the right amount of food and the wine was paired perfectly with the food! Can't wait for my one year anniversary to return!
