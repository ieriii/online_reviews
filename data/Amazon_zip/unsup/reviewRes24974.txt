My bf loves the Pepito sandwich, the steak sandwich is more my style, and I think the burritos are just ok. The sandwiches come on thin French bread and a combination of Lizano sauce, sauteed onions, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, and mustard. The steak fries are hefty and salted just enough, and the cheese empanada was heavenly. I didn't know cheese could taste like that! I could only take a few nibbles of it, though, for fear of having a heart attack right there. Most everything we ordered was greasy, surprisingly except for the sandwiches. It is a great alternative to fast food without making you feel like you drank a pint of grease--maybe just a spoonful. The restaurant itself is pretty dumpy, if you don't mind that sort of thing. It's definitely a place you'd go to to grab a quick lunch or carry-out. There are enough tables in the back to seat maybe 25. And there is a very small parking lot in front (fits maybe 4 cars). I'm definitely interested in trying the Casado dinner next time which supposedly serves two for $12. Strong recommendation: finish your meal off (or pair it ) with an oatmeal shake! For $3, you can get a huge oatmeal/tapioca pudding tasting milk with cinnamon on top! For the prices, I'd come back again. Lastly, Irazu now delivers!
