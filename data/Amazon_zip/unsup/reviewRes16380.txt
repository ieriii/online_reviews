Wow. Is the only word I have for a standard of excellence that is not to be missed. The lamb boti kebab masala is a must have an the CTM will not let the Western palate down. The Tandoori mixed grill is a great appetizer although extract spicy could be scintillating into the wee hours of the morning. To eat here is to find the best of India in Chicago with service that does not let te mother land down. The tandoori lamb chops rival the best of Edison and NYC but are well done and could be served medium to enhance the tenderness. The lamb kebabs are larger than normal and are great spicy with extra garlic. The veers are Indian standard with few surprises. Great for groups or a Romantic setting. Enjoy your meal and know that this passes the real Indian food test.
