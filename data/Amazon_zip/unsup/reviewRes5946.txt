We hit up Davanti on Friday night with another couple. We were told the wait would be 1-1.5 hours at about 7:45 on Friday night, which was to be expected. Our wait ended up being just under an hour, and there are plenty of bars to grab a cocktail nearby. I was really irritated by the wine list pricing. On first glance, everything appears to be dirt cheap ($21 bottles!) Then the waitress explained that those prices are retail, and there is a "$7 corkage fee" per bottle (i.e. the "$21 wine" is really $28). WTF is that? How much take away wine are they selling vs. what is being consumed on-site? It seems like the better way to do it would be to list the wine as $28 and offer a $7 discount if you would like to buy a bottle to take home. But that's just me. Given all the hype, I was somewhat underwhelmed by some the food. The truffle egg toast was delicious, as was the roasted tomato and burrata cheese salad. Our salumi platter had some of the best proscuitto I've had outside of Italy. The carbonara risotto was awesome. However, the octupus was only OK. It was extremely chewy and overly charred. The giant rigatoni with sausage was about 2 minutes shy of al dente. And the pizza was just bad. The crust was floppy and soggy and couldn't support the toppings. The cheese wasn't melted all the way. All in all, it was pretty good. I think I would steer clear of the pizzas and stick with the small plate stuff.
