Okay, if you want to call this Italian steakhouse a throwback, go ahead. I'm all for it, if 'throwback' means great, attentive service, plenty of tasty food and charmingly unchanged, dimly-lit, traditional steakhouse decor (with a few faux grapevines adorning some not-so-faux lattice). If you want a truly intimate experience (no, not that kind), ask for one of the private little booth-rooms that seat two nicely (or four, if you really, really like each other). They're great for private conversation or when you only have eyes for each other. Most of the staff has been here forever and they know what 'service' means. It's always a pleasure to dine here. As for the bar, they know how to pour a drink. And if filet mignon marsala is on the menu, don't think twice. Fork-tender, it doesn't need that hefty steak knife they provide. If you have room for dessert (you won't, but make room, anyway), tiramisu is always consistently good, but if you want some fun, order one of the flaming options. Everyone seated nearby will appreciate the show. We were a bit late for our evening reservation (May 17th) and we were accommodated pleasantly and quickly, though the front room was almost completely full. And did I mention the filet marsala...
