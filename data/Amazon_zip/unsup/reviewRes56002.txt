Loved this place! Great atmosphere, amazing waitstaff and very unique menu.My husband loved the venison burger and my daughter enjoyed her chicken dish very muchI am a vegetarian and while I love eating out, I pretty much know I'm going to have a pasta dish or salad when we go out. The Gage offered two great vegetarian choices, and I ended up with a very interesting cabbage roll along side an interesting fennel sauce. I know this is not a mainstream choice, but I really appreciated having such a different dish offered! I didn't eat a lot of the cabbage (it was very good, but i was getting full after appetizers and a salad plus we had ordered their huge bowl of fries for the table.) Another waitperson (other than our fantastic waitress) came over to make sure that I was enjoying my meal since he had noticed I wasn't eating all of the cabbage. That's an amazingly attentive staff!Dessert was great too, chocolate pot de creme with cinnamon ice cream for my daughter who loved it, and the kumquat sorbet for me which was fabulous. We will be back soon, thanks for a great dinner!
