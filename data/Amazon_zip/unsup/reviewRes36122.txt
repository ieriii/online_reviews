It was my first time for lunch in the new location. Service was quick and the food was good. The roast duck over rice was great! The duck and shrimp dumpling soup was a surprise - guess I should have read the menu more carefully. The dumplings were a mix of everything and the duck still had the bones on it, but the broth and greens were very tasty. I would order a different soup next time.
