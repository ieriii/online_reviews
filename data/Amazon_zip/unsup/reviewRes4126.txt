That Michael Carlson is among the country's finest Chefs is established. And that Schwa is among the country's most innovative and spectacular restaurants is equally without question. But on Saturday, November 19, MC and his team soared beyond their normal excellence into a zone that was akin to watching Michael Jordan put up a seemingly effortless 50 points, or a great painter create a masterpiece with but a few strokes of his brush. As Seth Carlson (Michael's younger brother and the outstanding front of the house coordinator) promised, we experienced MC and his team "throwing down" that night. What they created was awe inspiring. We four privileged foodies were the lucky diners at a special truffle dinner composed by MC and his team. The menu was inspired by one magnificent half pound Alba white truffle (provided by Ian Purkayastha). To complement the white truffle, MC secured two additional rarities, a tuber macrosporum (a spectacular truffle sourced from France) and real Kobe strip loin (sourced from Japan). We accompanied what turned out to be 13 courses with the following wines: (1) Pol Roger, Cuvee Sir Winston Churchill, 1988, (2) Drouhin, Marquis de Laguiche, Montrachet, 1999, (3) Leflaive, Bienvenues Batard Montrachet, 1996, (4) Mo-Camuzet, Cros Parantoux, 1998, (5) Mo-Camuzet, Richebourg, 1998, (6) Comte de Vogue, Musigny, 1998, (7) Rousseau, Chambertin Clos de Beze, 1990, (8) Bruno Giacosa Barolo Falletto, 1996, (9) Bruno Giacosa Barolo Falletto, 1999, and (10) Chave Hermitage, 1990. The wines, as good as they were, however, took a back seat to the extraordinary meal they accompanied. (FYI, the WOTN was the 90 Rousseau Clos de Beze, closely followed by the 98 Cros Parantoux) The atmosphere was highly charged and the excitement was palpable. The music enhanced the energy in the room and seemed to hit a crescendo as each dish was placed in front of us. Wine was generously shared with the chefs and with other curious diners who were wondering about the 4 guests surrounded by nearly a case of wine. Before the first course was placed, the softball sized Alba truffle and the goose egg shaped tuber macrosporum were presented to us for one last look [Photo #1]. Then the extraordinary Japanese Kobe beef loin was excitedly brought around for jaw dropping glances [Photo #2]. With the preliminaries out of the way - the festivities began. The meal consisted of the following 13 courses:  1) "Peanut Butter, Jelly and Truffles" - A shooter of grape soda, spicy peanut butter foam and shaved tuber macrosporum (French) [Photo #3] 2) Potato/Lobster/Pork Belly/Foie Gras - Butter poached lobster, seared cubes of foie gras, purple potatoes, crisp pork belly pieces on a thin bed of a gelatinized potato puree and shaved white truffle [Photo #4] 3) One Bite Quail Egg Ravioli - fresh pasta, buffalo ricotta, quail egg in Vermont butter reduction, shaved parmesan and white truffle 4) Apple Tortellini - fresh pasta, julienned apples and celery, celery leaves, clarified apple reduction, shaved tuber macrosporum [Photo #5] 5) Rabbit Taglietelle - fresh pasta and rabbit leg confit, sous vide rabbit loin on bed of sweet polenta, shaved white truffle [Photo #6] 6) Taleggio Eggs- coddled eggs, osetra caviar, taleggio, shaved tuber macrosporum, served with artisanal hand-blown glass spoons [Photo #7] 7) Salmon and Pink Lemonade - salmon, grapefruit cells, pink lemonade, fresh sumac, candied grapefruit peel, powdered tuber macrosporum [Photo #8] 8) Apricot Halibut - halibut, apricot, cauliflower, cocoa nibs, shaved white truffle [Photo #9] 9) Pheasant - confit of pheasant leg, seared pheasant breast, crispy skin, napa cabbage, crispy polenta [Photo #10] 10) Wagyu Beef - Japanese Kobe beef, taleggio, Brussels sprouts, crispy parsnip, shaved white truffle [Photo #11] 11) Flowers - Lavender bubbles, chocolate covered gooseberry, shaved summer truffle on top [Photo #12] 12) Chocolate Truffle Shake - white truffle ice cream, shaved chocolate and shaved white truffle [Photo #13] 13) Whisky & Dr. Pepper - whisky gummi, cherry whisky sauce, spice cake, cola nut ice cream, vanilla bubbles accompanied with a glass of Dr. Pepper [Photo #14] Each course was unique, delicious, interesting and explosive -- complexity, simplicity and elegance, all at the same time. A magical experience. Michael and his team were, simply stated, at the top of their game. It was an extraordinary evening. Cory, Debbie, Jeff & Matthew
