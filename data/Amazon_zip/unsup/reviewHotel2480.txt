On the negative side: I was not impressed by the $8 for an hour of internet or $18 for a day. So many other places offer this as a complimentary feature. Rather put off by this cash grab. Tthe rooms were ok (probably due to when it was built in the 1920s) neither good nor bad.  On the positive side: Beautiful and historic place with a good location.  Well maintained. The common areas were positively beautiful. The biggest plus is the service - superb. Very friendly and efficient.
