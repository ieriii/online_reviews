God bless America. And Hot Dogs and Hot Doug's. So to start off be prepared to wait. I figured by going after the lunch crowd we could get our order in 20 minutes or less. Boy was i wrong. Total time was 2 hours: 45 minutes of waiting outside in the cold, 5-10min on the order, and the rest of the time enjoying the wonderful goodness of the specialty dogs/sausage. Don't forget your cash and if it's winter wear a warm jacket, a hat and some gloves. I saw a lot of undressed people who were popsicles by the time they got inside.
