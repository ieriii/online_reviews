I have to say this place was worth the 30 minute wait out in the cold. Maybe it would be a little better with a toasted bun...never having been here I was told to try the standard Chicago dog. I have to say it was pretty good with everything on it. (pickles, tomatoes, relish, caramelized onions) I got my hot dog fried and grilled. Probably helped with the taste of the dog. I came on Friday so they had duck fat fries available. That extra rich buttery fat makes those fries taste pretty good. Service was excellent once you actually make it to the counter to order. The long line is just to order your food. Seating is pretty easy for smaller groups...I suggest breaking your group up in to small groups if you are coming with a lot of people I'd say if I was in Chicago again I'd make another stop here.
