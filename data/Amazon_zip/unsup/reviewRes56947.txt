I had been hearing about Piece for quite a long time, and was excited to visit last Friday for good beer and pizza with my girlfriend. Fully aware of what the atmosphere would be like, we were excited to go for beers and pizza before we headed out for the night. After a reasonable wait, we were seated at a high top table near the bar. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the atmosphere, and were already talking about how we can't wait to take our friends there in the future. Also, we found it amusing to watch some of the more inebriated patrons socializing.... Unfortunately, one of those drunk patrons began to cause a ruckus. Long story short, the staff at Piece eventually handled the situation with delicacy and poise.We were unable to finish our meal that night, but are looking forward to giving Piece another shot as we feel that it really may live up to the hype under different circumstances.
