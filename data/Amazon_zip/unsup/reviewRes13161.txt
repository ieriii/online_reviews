If you know are going to Texas de Brazil for dinner then you should not eat lunch and maybe a light breakfast so you can gorge yourself with as much of their food as possible. We had a good view of the wine angel and might I say that is almost worth the trip itself. I look forward to trying the restaurant they also have in Memphis, TN the next time I am there.
