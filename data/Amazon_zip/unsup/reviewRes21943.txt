Good food, got exactly what I had envisioned when ordering. Good chips and salsa and good drinks. WIll definitely be going back at some point. My only knock is that the majority of the seating is in back through a narrow hallway, and the ambience could be better with a TV or whatnot. OVerall, left a good impression.
