When staying in Chicago with friends for Michigan Ave fun, this is my hotel of choice. It is not fancy, but it is clean. It is affordable and parking is free. This is great when you would rather spend your money on a great meal, show or food. We had 3 adults comfortably in our room and cant beat $100 split 3 ways for a night
