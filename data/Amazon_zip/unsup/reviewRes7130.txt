Chicago Q is an interesting take on BBQ in a very comfortable restaurant in downtown. While the dining area is very well decorated and the service was very good on my visit there, the food is still a work in progress so I couldn't give Chicago Q more than 3 and a half stars. I have only been once so I haven't tried as many items on the menu as I would like. Once you are seated you are treated to a bowl of pickles and potato chips. The pickles are great and I destroyed the bowl quickly. The potato chips were good too but I felt needed a bit more seasoning. To start I had the BBQ flight and the Kobe brisket was the best out of the 3 items. The pulled Pork and pulled Chicken was pretty boring. I got a side of the cornbread and it was very good. It crumbled apart very easily but had great flavour. The different sauces that came with the appetizers were very good also. The smoked dry rubbed Chicken wings are great and easily the best Chicken wings in Chicago. For our main course, we tried the St Louis half slab and this unfortunately wasn't as good as Smoques St Louis Ribs. The fries that you get also aren't as good as Smoques, they are less seasoned and just don't taste as good. I had to rush to make an appointment so unfortunately we couldn't try anything else on the menu. Chicago Q is worth a visit and I expect on my next visit there to be rewriting this review and giving it 4 stars.
