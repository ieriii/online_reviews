Awesome place to sit in your car and listen to the ball game. I can't add to what the other reviewers who love this place had said. My word of advice is that when you park your car, don't park your car so that your face to face with the car in front of you. That's just awkward. Park the car backwards and face out. Also, tip the waitresses for god's sake.
