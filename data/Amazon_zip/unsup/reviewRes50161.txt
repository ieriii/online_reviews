Very seldom does a sports bar have really good food, this place really does have good burgers and everything else. And you can get waffle fries or sweet potato fries with your burger, can't beat that. The burger is juicy, bun is not too big or hard, veggies come on the side crunchy and fresh. Everything else is very cliche, the sports bar theme, the Wicker Park crowd and the outdoor seating. But, it's a sports bar well done, and we all need to go to one at some point.
