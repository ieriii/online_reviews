Sunda was recommended to us, so we decided to go there for our Anniversary. We had no idea what to expect and were pleasantly surprised.....It was amazing! The atmosphere was unique, the food was amazing and the service was terrific. We will definitely go back and maybe will make this restaurant a yearly tradition!
