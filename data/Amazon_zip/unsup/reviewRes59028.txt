We just held a happy hour/dinner for my 40th birthday at Sunda on a Saturday evening. And I can't say enough great things about Sunda for a large group!!! Everything from the food, to the atmosphere, to the service was spot on. Sunda worked with us to plan the perfect event for 25 people. Instead of a sit down dinner, we reserved the lounge and had a more casual party of passed appetizers/sushi and open bar for a set price per person.  It was the perfect venue to allow everyone to mingle in a casual atmosphere. There was plenty of seating as well as room to stand.  When we arrived at Sunda, we were immediately greeted with their amazing Peared Sake!  The decorations and atmosphere in the lounge were warm & inviting.  The tables even had personalized menus on them.  A server walked around with all of the food...which was all delicious!  He even remembered what people liked and would bring out more of it and seek that person out.  Another server walked around and took drink orders.  Everyone that we encountered that worked at Sunda was incredibly nice. Sunda did not disappoint for my birthday celebration!  If you are planning an evening out for a large group, I would definitely look into Sunda. They will work with you to plan the perfect event! As this was my first time at Sunda, I will for sure be returning!!!
