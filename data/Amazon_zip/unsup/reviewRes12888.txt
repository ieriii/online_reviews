This restaurant is my husband favorite restaurant. He loves meat (you should see him when he goes here. He goes crazy!!). His favorite meat is the house special. I forgot the name. Its crunchy and juicy (although it's probably a little bit salty). My favorite is actually the salad bar. I like the freshness of the vegetable that they serve. The cheese is also amazing. Overall, texas de brazil is the best brazilian steak house compare to others.
