Shhh...don't tell, but my honey is a picky eater. And not a foodie. And unlike me, who "oohs" and "ahhs" over food, my honey is real quiet and gives a simple "it was fine" to most food. Which is why when the honey raves about dinner, I pay attention. And the honey raved about the Chilean Sea Bass at Sapori Trattoria. Happy honey = happy me. As for me, this was my second trip. And I've been impressed both times. I had the pumpkin ravioli and it was amazing the first time, a little more doughy last night. But still pretty good. I'm not convinced I'd go back just for that again based on last night's dinner. The insalate stella (i think that's the name--the one with apples and pine nuts) was delicious and I could eat that all day long, and never grow tired of it. About the incidentals: The summer outdoor seating is lovely and it had all the trappings for a good date restaurant. Our waiter was charming and the support staff was helpful with the refills of water and bread. I was a little disappointed with the reservation system--I had made reservations and while we were seated quickly, other walk-ins who came in at the same time that we did were seated before us. And they seemed a little confused by their own seating system. Not enough to keep me away, but a bit annoying none the less. Overall, a very start to date night with the honey. We'll be back.
