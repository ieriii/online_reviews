I found the whole Frontera experience to be underwhelming. We had to wait a long time before getting a table (an hour, so I guess by their standards it wasn't even a "long" time). We sat at the bar and the bartender was excellent but the drinks were pretty expensive. The appetizer we ordered at the bar was delicious but, unfortunately, that was the highlight of my night. I didn't really enjoy the rest of the food and given the price tag I was pretty disappointed. My enchiladas were too salty and kind of bland at the same time. The server was just so-so. We sat at a small table for two in a highly-traveled part of the restaurant so I just felt really squished.  I didn't have a horrible time there but I can think of a lot of better ways to spend the money that I spent on the food that night. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.
