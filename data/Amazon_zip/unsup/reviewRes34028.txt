Solid breakfast to power a Monday morning in Chicago. We discovered Yolk simply by traversing past it on Michigan Ave. while heading to dinner the previous night. It was proximate to our hotel, the Essex Inn at Michigan and 8th. I enjoyed a tuscan frittata - chicken and sundried tomato in a scramble topped with feta... yummy. They had no problem subbing fresh fruit in place of potatoes. Coffee was good and plentiful. Our server, Jose, was friendly and attentive. Room was large and lively for 9am on a Monday - this was probably as much a function of the conference in town as anything else. While not stand-out, Yolk was a solid breakfast convenient to the action.
