Duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck. I'm sure that I'm doing myself a disservice by not having tried any of the other dishes here, but sometimes when you find something that works, you stick with it. I was fortunate enough to find something that works right away - the Duck dinner. As part of an anniversary celebration, I had made reservations about a week prior -- and judging from the people milling about at the entrance, reservations are definitely encouraged -- and specially requested the duck, which must be ordered at least a day or two in advance. With that I will echo concerns below that Sun Wah is a large, warehouse-type room that is neither particularly romantic nor suited for those who need to speak up on a regular basis. But back to the duck. The sweet sweet duck. Before either of us had dented our glasses of wine (byob for a $5 corkage fee), the duck was wheeled over to our table and sliced before our eyes. Crispy, juicy, and full of everything I had hoped. It's served with a plate of bao, a delightful hoisin sauce, daikon, and carrot for freestyling duck goodness, or mini duck sandwiches. Later, the rest of the duck was brought back in the form of duck fried rice and an underwhelming soup with wintermelon (whatever that is) and lemongrass. Throwing some siracha in it makes it more interesting, but even so, when compared to the other two courses, it didn't stand up at all. The bao/duck ratio was a bit tough to manage, and required another plate of bao, but it was still worth it. Service was quick and friendly, and the duck dinner was reasonably priced and delicious. There is really very little more that I ask of a restaurant...
