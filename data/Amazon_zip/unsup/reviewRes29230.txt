Food: average Thai, in a good way. Service: below average. I had Peanut Sauce Lover, spicy with tofu. He had curry fried rice, tofu. I liked my food, but server was very neglectful. Took a long time to take our order, fine. Didn't remove the appetizer dishes before the main course, really? Never once inquired if the food was okay, and we needed corkage. And we sat for 10 minutes after eating before he inquired if we were finished.
