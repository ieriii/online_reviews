Nothing is better than combining laziness and food! Hence the drive-in is a wonderful, beautiful thing! This was my experience with Superdawg: slept in till noon, rolled out of bed, got in the car in my pj's still, drove to superdawg, parked, ordered, ate, went home. Notice that I didn't say "get out of car into freezing cold and rainy Chicago weather." I just love drive-ins, its a little piece of Americana that is near and dear to my heart! This place is great! Friendly car-hops, delicious food, hilarious 8-foot tall hot-dog/people characters on the roof of the restaurant. What more can I say?
