This place makes me feel like the dog in that Beggin' Strips commercial. "It's BACON!" I loved this brunch. The Duck Hash was a huge hit with crispy potato pieces and tender duck hunks slathered in runny egg yolk. My friend who ordered the Pork Belly Bibimbap loved the pork but said the dish overall was a little spicy for him for breakfast. The Quiche was also pretty good, a crumbly, traditional crust packed with moist egg and studded with cheese. The piece wasn't huge though and the side salad that accompanied it (as so many side salads do) kind of pissed me off. It was helped out a lot by their stellar bacon. It's so thick and fat and fatty and smoky and crispy in all the right places, you don't even need the maple glaze. But it's still delicious, so why not? It was easily the standout dish of the meal, and it was only a side. Runner up goes to the Cinnamon Roll, which was perfectly soft and gooey on the inside. And more restaurants, please do your butter like this. Let it sit out. Let it soften. Put it on the table before I even get there. Being greeted by butter is never a bad thing. As for drinks, the coffee was unremarkable but the Bloody Marys were fantastic. Love that they come with a little beer back. Since I often like to have about 7 beverages in front of me at brunch, this saved me a little time in actually having to order. I'll be heading back here soon, probably muttering "bacon, bacon, BACON!" the whole way.
