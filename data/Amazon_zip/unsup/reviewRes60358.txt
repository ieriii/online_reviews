On december 27, 2011 my family and my father that just came from Costa Rica went to your restaurant located in Jackson. Sorry to say but we had the worst meal ever and it was not about the food. It was due a little complain about the pizza we ordered. We order the veggie without broccoli and we get the pizza with the broccoli plus the 45 minutes to get the order completed. The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged. I talked to the manager and he said that he did not approved anything and he directly said that we were saying liars about that. We tried to talk to him and the waitress and he said he did not want any confrontation. We were angry because he called us liars, we, yours customers!! What kind of place is that to be treated that way. You should pick your employes, because at the end is what makes the difference. My family and friends will not come back anymore.
