I came here for a work lunch. The decor is very nice and is a great place near the Loop to bring a client out. Would also be good for a birthday dinner or special occasion - would definitely not come here on a whim though. The space is deceptively small, but was about 70% full and that is a lot of people. The sound level can get a bit noisy. The food was great - the rock shrimp tempura is as yummy as everyone says it is. The bao are also a good appetizer - I'm just bummed you can't split the serving of 4 between duck and pork. I had a rainbow roll and it was good - what I would have expected based on other sushi places. The service leaves something to be desired. I felt that our waiter would leave for big chunks of time and either forget about us or forget things. Maybe they don't serve dessert during lunch, but I was itching for a coffee! oh well. Would recommend with the caution that it may be a longer meal than what you are expecting.
