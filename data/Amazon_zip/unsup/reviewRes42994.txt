This place is great! The atmosphere is trendy and bustling and the service is excellent. They have regular table seating as well as a lounge area. The cocktails are good. There version of a Moscow Mule is refreshing but they put a bit too much ice in the glass for my taste. The Pimm's Cup is utterly divine. If you go here and you eat meat, you MUST MUST ABSOLUTLY MUST get the bone marrow. Its to die for. It comes with charred crusty bread and the most delicious red onion chutney/compote(which by itself is worth ordering the dish for) and the most perfectly roasted split down the middle marrow bones. Rich and delicious. The Paris pasta and the orecchiette and sausage pasta were great and beautifully seasoned. The deserts are in a league of their own. Amazing classic American style lemon meringue pie is the perfect end to a great meal. The meringue topping is airy and not overly sweet and the lemon curd is tangy and tart. It was the perfect end to a great meal. I can't wait to go back!
