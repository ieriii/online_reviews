This place was great. In from Seattle and I had to try some deep dish Chicago style. We were advised that this was a place to go. We waited in line on a Saturday night only about 10 or 15 minutes but I hear it can wrap around the corner so best to go during 'off peak' times and probably get in pretty quick. We ordered the supreme small since it was the two of us. It took about 45 minutes but it was really good. The crust is really really rich along with the cheese, sauce, and pepperoni so two slices were just right. We started off with a house salad family style for two and the croutons were really good. I would recommend this place for people... bring your extra large white paint pen so you can write all over the place. Perhaps make a fun event and try another deep dish place (we plan to) to compare.
