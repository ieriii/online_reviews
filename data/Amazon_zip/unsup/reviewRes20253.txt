I have been going to Coast for a few years now. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and the fact that it was less expensive, you could put your name on the list and they would call you at Danny's and you could bring your own hooch. As of late, it seems that word has gotten out, the prices are more expensive and the quality has gone a bit downhill.
