I was here last weekend with a vegetarian buddy of mine. He was concerned there would be nothing for him to eat here. Well, turns out all items here are vegetarian until you pay extra for meat ! I added lamb sausage to mine and it was awesome. It's on a busy street corner (Foster and Clark), but it's pretty quiet inside.Our service was fine and the bill was reasonable. Yes i'll be back, but maybe not until my veggie friend comes back to town.
