Hot Doug's is a Chicago legend. This restaurant has been featured on several television show, most notably the Food Network. Chances are you will find yourself in a long line. In the Chicago cold this can be quite unbearable. Rest assured, the wait is well worth the pain! The menu is vast and very entertaining. The food is also great! Doug was working the register when I went in and he helped answer some questions. The duck fat fries are very good and the veggie dog was excellent. Defiantly give this kitschy hot dog joint a try!
