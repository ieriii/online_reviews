We enjoyed two or three mojitos at the bar before we were seated on a busy Friday night this summer. Insider tip: there is a second bar in the rear dining room if the front bar is too crowded Good: bar (mojitos, wine), spicy addictive butter, cold gazpacho-like soup, baked pork, green sauce on calamari, pistachio cake. Our server was good. ?: A gal I met at the bar said she enjoys the spicy brunch as well. Not sure how the singles scene is at the bar since most people seemed like they were out on dinner dates. Negatives: the rice and bean mixture was dry, the fried plantain balls were oily yet bland (not sure if they were fried plaintain), we were overcharged for the wine "specials." Bad grammar and waiting in the ladies' restroom. Overall: above average. Pricier than other reviews indicated ($150 for two), but we drank a lot!
