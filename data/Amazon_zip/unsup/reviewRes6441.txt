Trio, Trio, Trio. The petite fillet trio with different toppings is a must. Wash down the carnage with a trio of martinis. Share with friends the trio desserts. My personal favorite is the halibut with lemon sauce if you don't want red meat and their mojitios are definitely strong. The atmosphere is causal and fun. Great place to bring friends and family for a good night out. Make reservations to be on the safe side since the restaurant can fill up very quickly... especially on those beautiful summer nights.
