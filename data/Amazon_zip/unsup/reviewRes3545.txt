How have I missed reviewing Crisp until now? I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said, but if you've got an urge for chicken this should be the first place in the city you head. If you've got some room left after their delicious Seoul Sassy or Crisp BBQ chicken you NEED to try a Buddah Bowl. The medium sized one is my personal favorite. It'll last for 2 meals, and they'll both be so good you want to turn around and go right back to Crisp for another one. The owner, Doug, is super-friendly and tries to greet customers by name. It must be hard, as lately the place is always packed. The food hasn't suffered a bit though. Every bite is still as delicious as the first bite I had about 6 months ago. The best news of all, is that Crisp now delivers! Huzzah! I can't even begin to put into words how happy this makes me, or how much money this is going to cost me. :) One word of advice though - I tried to call last night to place an order before pick up and I couldn't get through. When I got there and mentioned it to Doug he said that their phone number is weird and they sometimes have problems - especially if you're calling from a number outside of 773. If you don't get through, or get a weird machine, just try back in 5-10 minutes. I don't understand it, but I really don't care. Crisp is totally worth a little extra effort. :)
