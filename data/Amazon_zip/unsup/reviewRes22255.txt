Hmm.....I'm torn with this review because we had a hot pot dinner that was delicious and filled with meats, seafood, and veggies. Unfortunately, we both got sick after eating the dinner. What is bizarre is that the stomach problems did not hit us until later the next day. I have a sensitive stomach that usually is affected quickly and within a few hours from dirty or bad food. I'm not quite sure why we both suffered stomach problems. But the hot pot was really delicious that I am thinking about going back and hoping for the best (no stomach problems the next time!). We'll have to see...more updates later.... If you're thinking about doing the hot pot, I recommend getting the deluxe hot pot with half regular broth/half spicy broth. The spicy broth is pretty spicy so unless you can handle it, I suggest doing the half and half. The food that comes with the deluxe hot pot is fish balls, meat balls, veggies, mussels, shrimp, beef, tofu, tripe, fish, and bean curd. The hot pot includes six garnish/spices of garlic in oil, cilantro, green onion, hot chili, and two other things we did not use. Cost is $17 per person, but after taxes and tip costs around $24 per person.
