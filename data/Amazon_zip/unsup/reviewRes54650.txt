This might be my favorite restaurant in the entire city. The lobster bisque is to DIE for. The food is consistently delicious, and the service is consistently superb. The champagne brunch they have on sundays is awesome (try the blood-orange mimosa!). I have never had a mediocre meal at Shaws- they always blow me away. I would eat here every single day if I could.
