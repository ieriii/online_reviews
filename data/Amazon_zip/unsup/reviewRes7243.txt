We went to Chicago Q for my boyfriend's birthday last night...let's just say he was beyond thrilled! He got the sampler of brisket and ribs, I got the pulled pork. Each came with cornbread (OMG!). We also had a side of beans and a side of mac and cheese. Everything was amazing. And, we had a ton of food left over, which makes excited to go home and eat tonight!  The other thing that made our experience so great was our server. Ask for Amber. She was excited about the menu, knew her beers well, and was super friendly. Everything she recommended was fantastic! Chicago Q is definitely a do-over. YUMMY!
