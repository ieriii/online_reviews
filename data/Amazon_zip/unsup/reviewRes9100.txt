After three days of crap food in Chicago, didnt get off wait list at Alinea...We made out way to Le Colonial. Although it is a "chain" we were welcomed as though we were entering a fine dining establishment. Each person we interacted with was professional and seemingly happy to be working there. We opted to eat at the bar and had excellent service. The bar tender, male, was very attentive, took in all details and walked the ever important line of present and absent, perfectly. Food was just what you expect...tasty, as described, abundant without being wasteful and healthy. It was like coming home.
