I am in kive with this swanky, comfortable bar-cafe-bakery. In kive is what I reserve for places that I love so much, even a typo can't slow me from finishing this review so I can hurry back. We strolled down here after a so-so supper somewhere else and were in here for about a half hour, just looking around at the gift selection, the authentic Greek wine and liquor offerings, before finally making our way down to order some cannoli, baklava, and eclair. It's the kind of place that you believe your cafe would be like, if you ever got off your ass and opened your own cafe.
