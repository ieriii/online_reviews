Once upon a time, the stretch of Milwaukee between Armitage and Willow was lonely, its only companions were tenements where buzzers didn't work. There were no Chuck Taylor-wearing people with plastic glasses, and Lincoln Park was the coolest place on earth. A little green shack stood at the corner of Moffat and Milwaukee, a long grill sizzling with casado, bistec teco, milanesa and tacos of all shapes and sizes. Nobody knew it was the only place in Chicago that served genuine Costa Rican food! But then "Check, Please" came a-calling and the Food Hound Steve Dolinsky knocked a knick-knack-paddy-wack on the doors and soon, everyone knew that milkshakes with flavours like oatmeal, guanabana, mamey and cornmeal existed, that yuca with mojo (aromatic fried garlic) was a blessing from heaven, that grilled onions gracing a fried steak was the freshest breath of air anyone could inhale. The lines grew, as did the waiting time for a Formica-topped table, on weekends, giving new meaning to Latin time. But as you stand the enveloped in the aroma of grilling meats of various cuts and sizes, and freshly fried tortilla chips bop by under your nose, it's like your appetite is on steroids and goes from Barry Bonds circa 1997 to 2007 in two minutes. And it's OK, you don't mind, because you like to see the moms and pops do well. Everyone lives happily ever after, and the moral of the story is to save room for all the sides that arrive on your platter -- the cabbage slaw in tangy vinegar and black beans rice is as happy of a fairy tale ending as the main entree.
