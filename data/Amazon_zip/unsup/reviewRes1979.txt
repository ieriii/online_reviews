In New Orleans the tourists line up for beignets, in DC they line up for cupcakes and in Chicago they line up for hot dogs. Thursday at 11:50am we waited for 40 minutes and at least it was nice out. The service is great, with Doug upfront and it is amazing to visit an 'iconic' food establishment where the owner loves their customers. The dogs are pretty delicious (I had a tasty Anna Kendrick/Fire Dog which was not as 'mighty hot' as advertised), excellent fixings, good fries and the pricing is spot on. Inside the place has a nice vibe, fun decor and the crowd predominantly 20 and 30 somethings. I like a hot dog like the next person, but I am sure not willing to line up for one.
