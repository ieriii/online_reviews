I've stayed here two times. The first time, I was extremely impressed with the hotel for the price. It's boutique-y in feel and they have a nice rain shower in the bathroom that has floor to ceiling glass that overlooks the sleeping and lounge area. The bed has plenty of pillows and is quite comfortable. The rooms are equipped with flat screens, and they have nice bath products. During my first trip, I was consistently having to have my key re-magnetized. Apparently cell phones and credit cards cause the key to malfunction. Unless I was wearing pants with pockets, and I could store the key separately in my pocket, there ws about a 60 percent chance that I'd have issues with it. The second time, I still happy with my stay, but the key issue really began to wear on me. If I weren't going in and out of my room more than once a day, maybe this wouldn't have pissed me off. About every 3 times I had to get my key re-magnetized. And I wasn't alone. Seemed to be quite a trend here. The worst was when you were in the elevator with a bunch of people who keyed the elevator so you could push your floor button, only to realize that your room key didn't work once again when you reach your room. On weekends, it's also a pain in the ass because the elevator is shared with the rooftop lounge and there are loads of drunk people you have to ride with, some who like to push all the buttons "for fun". (are we three?) The service is friendly and accomodating, the rooms nice, but the keys suckkkkkkk. And Friday night elevator riding does too.
