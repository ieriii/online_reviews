Great tasting fresh fish. I recommend the Volcano roll if you're eating in. If you're getting take out, I wouldn't get it - it tends to fall apart and get a little soggy for some reason. Pretty much any of their signature rolls get a big thumbs up. As for the alcohol policy that many have written about... I've been there several times with 2 bottles of wine an haven't heard a thing about it. I think if you just keep it under control you should be fine. My only complaint is with walk ins... many times i've been told that the table I was sitting at would be needed in an hour and a half. We finished well within that time, but it doesn't put you at ease to know your experience has an expiration date. Save yourself the trouble and call for reservations.
