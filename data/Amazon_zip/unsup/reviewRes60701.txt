We have been regulars for years and have put up with the high prices because the quality was so good and so there was perceived value for money. The cocktails are good, not extraordinary, but good and the food overall is very good, also not extraordinary, but a nice organic option.That was until we pretty much got fleeced in my option on the fish and chips "special" on a Friday night. I heard they had this and was dying to try it. I love a good fish and chips dish and for $19, which is very high priced for this type of entree, I expected either an interestingly reinvented fish and chips or at least a healthy amount of amazing wild caught fish. Well, the fish was pretty tasty, above average, but there were two very tiny pieces and the rest of the plate was loaded up with fries. Way, way more fries than they serve with any other entree. It was a painfully obvious cash grab to load the plate with mounds of cheap fries while providing no more than $3 worth of fish to the diner. I shop for wild caught fresh fish at the best markets in chicago and I know what the costs are. This was ridiculous. I sadly walked away feeling quite cheated and it has tainted my feelings about this restaurant. I doubt we will be regulars anymore and will move on to something else. And yes, the service here is always crazy slow. We often go off hours when there are only a few people in the place and they struggle to out out a few dishes even though I can see and hear enough people in the kitchen to prepare a simple hamburger or sandwich.
