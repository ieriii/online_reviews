I was excited to try Anteprima again after waiting a year to try it the second time and the second time wasn't as favorable as the first, but it was still good. The menu was very creative and I got the ribs which were decent, but dry and not quite what I expected. Someone else with us ordered the calamari and black pasta and it was disappointing. The wine selection is decent and the ambiance is quaint. I would say try this place out, but be prepared for unusual dinner options.
