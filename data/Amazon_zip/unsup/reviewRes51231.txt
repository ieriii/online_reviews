I love this place!!! Great interesting decor, service has always been really welcoming and on top of what they are doing. The menu is limited but I've never had anything but great food. Try their brunch on the weekends, awesome. Also, sometimes we go on weeknights and it's crowded in the main dining room, try the bar, usually you can sit right down, same menu and you get delicious chips and salsa! Yum!
