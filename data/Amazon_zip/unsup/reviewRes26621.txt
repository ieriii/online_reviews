This place was really fresh and tasty. They gave me a free cup of hot tea while I waiting for my freind to arrive which I thought was really nice. They also have us a really interesteg dessert (some sort of jello, not a fan) to go along with our fruit smoothie. anyway, the food was really fresh and was presented really nice. This was a cozy place and I recomend it!
