Sprout is a superb prix fixe fine dining establishment with an approachable wine list and phenomenal cocktails. Definitely a higher-end dining experience, as most male patrons were in sport coats and dress shoes, and the ladies were all dressed for a big night. Good thing my baby made me get pretty for my birthday dinner. $60 per person for a 3 course prix fixe dinner demands that the food be outstanding, and it is. Plus there's an amuse bouche after the second plate which was a grilled cheese square that I could probably eat 100 of, but it's just a tease. My only real complaint was that when we sat down and ordered drinks they took a solid 10 minutes to deliver (and I watched as they sat on the bar for at least 5 minutes). The bread and butter that was brought out before the first plate tasted very fresh and gave me something to soak up my Cider Manhattan cocktail, which is one of the best drinks I've ever had (even though they made me wait for it). Also, there was a hibiscus ice (palate cleanser) after the first plate, which was simple and good. Other than that, the waiter was good and was knowledgeable about the menu...though it doesn't really help to inquire too much about each dish, as they're supposed to be mysterious and complex. There's just no way you're going to know what the dish tastes like by reading the menu, so go with your gut and try to string together a nice combo. I went with Ono (wahoo fish), Mushroom (veggie option) and Banana (see their menu for details). Wouldn't change a thing! Highly recommended for a special occasion and an open mind to local, organic fine dining. $240 out the door after 2 prix fixe dinners, 2 cocktails and a bottle of wine, so I would recommend for a special occasion.
