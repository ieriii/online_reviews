I am not a big sushi fan, but last night I met up with a bunch of friends at Coast and loved it. Firstly, it's byob, which is fantastic. They were able to accommodate a party of 7 plus a baby under the age of 1. The staff was fantastic and friendly. The food was outstanding. We got everything from carpacio and sushi to sukiyaki. Everything was delicious. It's a big pricey, but was absolutely enjoyable and worth it.
