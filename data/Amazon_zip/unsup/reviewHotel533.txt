I live in a box in East Lakeview....(who doesn't?!), so, when I found out a bunch of my friends were coming into the city for my birthday, there was no way we'd all fit at my place. I booked a room at the Hampton because I'm a point fanatic for all Hilton properties. Plus, it was right around the corner from Rockit, which is where I wanted to have dinner. How convenient! It's a good location, overall, for people visiting the city. The parking here is like $40 for 24 hours. Not too bad for RIver North, I suppose. There's adjacent lots for cheaper, but I'm not sure how secure those lots are for overnight parking. Staff here is super friendly. Like, whoa. I didn't know the service at a Hampton could be so awesome. I got a rate of $189 online. That's a pretty great price considering you get two rooms, two tv's, a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, and pull out couch. It's way spacious, good for pregaming, and I think they give you free popcorn. Rooms are clean, bathrooms are small, but functional. Hampton's also offer free breakfast, which are handy in attempting to cure your morning after hangover. If you're lucky, you'll be there when they serve up my personal fav - waffles.
