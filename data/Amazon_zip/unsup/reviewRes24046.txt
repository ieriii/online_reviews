Before I moved to New York, I remember passing by the Icosium and always with the thought, "I want to go to there." I'd attend class at Joel Hall or see the Neos or meet friends at some bar on Clark Street and, as mentioned, look at the corner where Icosium stands with a little bit of lust. Now that I reside in Chicago again, I've committed myself to doing/going to those places that have rendered me quite so lusty. Icosium being no exception. FINALLY! It was a lovely bruncheon date, post Halloween weekend, and when presented other options I naturally said, "LET'S GO THERE!" Cheka Chouka + eggs, vegetable broth with sweet potato base, coffee, water with a mint leaf...yeah, I said it. My compadre shared the crepe with me, as they are HUGE! Look people, the crepe itself, to note, is awesome. The greens are beautiful and fresh, and methink organic (?). The cheese? Rich and creamy (go goat cheese!). I mean, this was a fail-proof choice. And I finished my half like a good girl - was plenty! The soup (and I'm not talking the Joel McHale kind): delish. A little bit sweet, this sweet potato-based concoction, and a little bit spiced. I saw someone knock the mushroom - the sweet potato is a great way to start the digestive juices and is a great palate - alarm clock. WAKE UP PALATE, TIME TO DINE. The coffee (which I went Simple Jack here and ordered regular coffee) was just fine. The bonus: coffee is poured from Algerian-looking, brass urn. Milk? Little brass urn.  *The place is covered in little brass urns, tapestries, beaded light fixtures, and all things otherwise Algerian/Turkish -- although, I think I only saw one 'lucky eye'...* Service: friendly, helpful, and all with a smile. GO HERE. I'm going back. And getting sweet crepes. Just remember: these crepes be huge.
