I've been going to Las Tablas for years. I first went to their location on Irving park and recently switched to this location due to geographical reasons. I've always been a fan of Las Tablas. Their steak is excellent! It is flavorful and tender. I introduced my French partner to Las Tablas about a year ago and he is their number one fan. He's eaten steak at high-end and low-end places around the world and he says that Las Tablas' steak is definitely one of the best he's had. Las Tablas gives you bang for your buck. Order a combination (pick two) and make one of your picks the steak. I usually have the shrimp as my second pick which is also great. My partner either has the calamari or octopus. He of course loves them both. They are BYOB from Monday to Thursday. If you are not a big eater, skip the appetizers - their portions are huge!
