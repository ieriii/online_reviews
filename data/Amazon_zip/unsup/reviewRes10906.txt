Just for the record - there is no such thing as LIVE BAND KARAOKE. The word "karaoke" is a Japanese word meaning "sans band" or (more formally) "without an orchestra". I'm just sayin'. Having said that - Piece is a melange of all things mediocre in a restaurant. They rely heavily on the neighborhood and the famous owner. The food is decent - but not anything to make you rush back for another piece of the pie. It is the execution that carries the day at Piece. First you have these cool "indie" chicks in their thrift shop clothes waiting the tables. Then you have this bigass pan with this amoeba shaped pizza on this rack that hangs over the table. The problem with the waitstaff is they get by on "cute". They don't provide adequate service, because they don't have to . Cute people will always get a good tip because people like cute people. Cute doesn't last forever - so someone should maybe help them get better at their jobs. With all those tattoos and piercings - that is likely where a lot of them will be... forever... As far as the prices... We paid $7.95 for a dish of guacamole and some chips. When I say "some chips" I am being generous. There was about the same amount as you would find in the ubiquitous 99 cent bag at 7-11. I get that guac is not cheap to make - but chips are. These were store bought chips - not even the good ones. Overall - it isn't terrible. The thing is - with so many really good pizzas out there - why WHY would anyone pay through the nose for 2 star food and 2 star service. Move on, pizza-man! Move on!
