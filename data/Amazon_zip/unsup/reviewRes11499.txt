Outstanding! I've been here dozens of times and there is no better place for brunch in this city. The food is creative, fresh, and very tasty. It's definitely a place to indulge. I would not go here if you're on a diet. The pretzel pancakes are to die for. The seasonal pumpkin pancakes are also delicious. It's obvious they use fresh ingredients and took the time to design every item on the menu. The service is always good despite the long waits. I always bring out of towners here and they love it.
