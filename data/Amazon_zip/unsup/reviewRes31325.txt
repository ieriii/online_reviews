After hearing about the awesomeness that is Sunda for the past year, I FINALLY made it there. This beautiful restaurant was jam-packed on a Friday afternoon and a packed restaurant is always a great sign that the food and service is dy-no-mite! After being seated at a nice table in the back, we ordered a bottle of Ty Ku sake and began salivating over the menu. The sweet rock shrimp tempura, the spicy soft shell crab over a bed of red hot chili peppers (Devil's Basket),and one of each of the Sunda Signature Sushi had our taste buds doing the happy dance. Aaron, the general manager, stopped by to chat with us before sending over a dish that they will soon be offering on the menu. There are not too many foods that I dislike, but brussel sprouts is definitely one of them. HOWEVER, Aaron sent over a crunchy, shredded, perfectly seasoned brussel sprout salad which can only be described as BEYOND outstanding. The chocolate cake was greatly appreciated later that evening along with the other leftovers. I slept well that night. Now I see what all the fuss was about. Sunda lives up to the hype in every way--the sleek decor, friendly, attentive service and especially the food. I plan on coming back at night with a few girlfriends to check out the bar scene.
