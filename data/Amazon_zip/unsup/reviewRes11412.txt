Piece is about as close as you can possibly get to authentic New Haven pizza in the Midwest (I was born in New Haven and grew up on Pepe's, Sally's and Modern on Wooster Street so I should know). Chicago is known for deep dish, but Piece cooks their thin pies in a brick oven, which is what gives it such an incredible taste. Don't waste your time with salads and appetizers - come here for the pizza! While the pepperoni and sausage are excellent, my favorites are the "white clam" (no marinara sauce - sounds crazy but its delicious) and the "bacon with red sauce" (trust me). Only negatives: their napkins suck (you'll use about 50 of them), and the pizza doesn't do very well with carryout (you gotta eat it there or else it dries out). Expect long waits on the weekends, especially for big groups, but the bar area is quite big and they have an incredible selection of their own brewed beer so it's definitely worth the wait. Definitely my favorite thin crust pizza in Chicago. Five stars all the way!
