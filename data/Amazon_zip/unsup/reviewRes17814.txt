A group of friends and I went there on a Friday night. The decor is awesome inside! Very colorful and so inviting! We got our menu's and everything on there looked as if was going to taste really out of this world! So I ordered a chicken dish that came with a salad and was covered in a butter sauce. Many of my friends ordered seafood dishes. The food was just good. I experienced much better food for alot less. So I think its a nice place to visit once, but ill never go back. The drinks were great and the service was awesome but it was just way too much money for just good food.
