My husband and I went to Vietnam last summer and we thought it was so great and the food was spectacular. We used to live in Texas and the Vietnamese food there was pretty decent. We now do live in Chicago and had some friends who recommended Simply It to us. I figured it wouldn't hurt to try it.We came in Saturday night and there was such a large crowd of people waiting for tables. We actually had reservations for a group of 6 but did have to wait for 20 minutes. I really didn't mind the wait. The owner was very nice. He had gave out appetizers, water, and tea to everyone who were waiting on tables.The place was crowded, I mean crowded. Chairs were touching almost back to back and certain spots you would have to squeeze to get through, like going to the bathroom. But, we all still enjoyed the food, everything was excellent and fast. We will definitely come back.The only complaint that I do have is that the weekend is too busy. For a slow-paced dinner, I'll make reservations for an earlier time next time. Or make reservations for a weeknight. But, we will come back.
