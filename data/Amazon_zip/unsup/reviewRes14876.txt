Went here last night and was not impressed. Yes the free pizza bread is good but the rest of my meal was not worth the price. The Tortelli Al Pesce (shrimp & crabmeat stuffed tortelli) did not taste like anything but tortelli and tomato sauce. There was no shrimp or crab flavor.  My husband had the Linguinni and White Clam Sauce and he had to add red pepper flakes, salt, and cheese to put some flavor into the dish! Someone else had the ribs which were very tasty. The egg drop spinach soup was good as was the salad but a bit more dressing would be nice. Our waitress was very friendly and talkative but our water boy seemed mad that he was working on Chrismas Eve!  I dont' think I would return to eat there, overpriced tasteless food. We have had much better for less on the south side.
