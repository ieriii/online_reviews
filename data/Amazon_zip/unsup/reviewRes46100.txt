Only been here once and the experience wasn't great. They apparently don't seat large tables so my friends and I ended up waiting 3 hours to be seated. They told us it would only be an hour to an hour and a half, and then kept telling us it would only be 15 more minutes. They also forgot to bring our bread. The only good thing is that since we waited so long to be seated, we asked for free dessert and they agreed to it. The food is good in general, not amazing and not really worth the price (it's pretty pricey here), but their desserts are amazing. Definitely must get the beignet if you're gonna get dessert.
