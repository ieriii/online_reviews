I've frequented Zed 451 at least 3 times in the past year. I took my mom for Mother's Day for brunch and Zed 451 did not disappoint. The duck hash browns were a hit at our table as well as the salmon, chicken& waffle and cinnamon rolls. The harvest table is what I come for--the truffle butter with the various breads, the cold salads and the yummiest oatmeal I've tasted in a long while. During the winter months, sitting near the fire pit is comforting and cozy. The hostesses are always kind and the waitstaff are always accommodating.
