Bongo you take yourself way too seriously. We wanted to order a pancake after we ordered our food and we were not allowed to do that or take a pancake to go. Our waitress was extremely rude and the unnecessary rules and limitations to order MORE food was very unexpected.  The pancake I did have was undercooked and doughy...only tasted edible because of all the sugar they pour on top. Friends and I will never return.
