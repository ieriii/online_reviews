If you need to read the reviews of Sprout to decide if you should dine here or not then you are either too much of a foody or you are in for a surprise. We dined on a Saturday evening relatively late (8:30). We were seated right away upon arrival and immediately given attention from the waiter. Service is excellent, the server was very knowledgeable not only of the food courses but the alcohol as well. I had the whiskey sidecar which was well prepared and flavorfull, my wife opted to have a glass of the pinot noir that was suggested by the server. We chose the prix fixe option and every course was well prepared with a balance of textures, flavors, colors, and temperatures. I won't go into detail because most everyone is familiar with Chef Dale's style form his stint on Top Chef Season 3. For those of you wondering, yes you will most likely see Dale in the front of the house, he was constantly coming out to the bar and server stand to check on certain guests and friends of his who were dining. Overall it was a very pleasurable experience and we would certainly return.
