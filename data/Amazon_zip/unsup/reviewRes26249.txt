I came here in the spring with my friend not knowing this place was BYOB. I wasn't a yelper then! The waiter was extremely attentive, and when he saw that we were the only table with no alcohol, he sent us fresh squeezed lemonade on the house! Granted the lemonade tasted really yucky for some reason, it's the thought that counts, right? We shared the clay pot chicken and crispy tofu with pineapple. Both were fine, though the clay pot chicken definitely was better. I am pretty sure this is not authentic Vietnamese food. I have been to many in Los Angeles. But it's a neat little place that I would revisit again. Plus the service is awesome.
