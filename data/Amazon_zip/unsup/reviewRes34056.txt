Calling all vegetarians!! This place is veggie mecca (meat lovers love it too though)...The BEST falafel you will ever have, all the items on the salad bar are fresh and tasty, the lentil rice YUM and the baklava...OMG...buttery (yes it's real butter!!!) flaky, nutty deliciousness...and did I mention - all so reasonably priced.
