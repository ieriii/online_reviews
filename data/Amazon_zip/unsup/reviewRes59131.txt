The food is OK but god help you if they get something wrong and you speak up. The manager / owner will argue with you rather that address your complaint. He values being right more than he values return customers, and he is the owner of all 3 Yolks in Chicago.I'm not the first person the make this comment on Yelp, and I know I won't be the last.Also, the place is always crowded, closes at 2 in the afternoon and has bad acoustics. It's difficult to carry on a normal lunch conversation here. Not worth the expense if you know good food and good customer service.
