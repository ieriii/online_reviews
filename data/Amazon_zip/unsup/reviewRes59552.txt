Great for large parties and tiny parties and I'm-feeling-like-a-panda parties--because you'll want to eat like one, this place is a gem, aside from the inevitable smoke. Atmosphere is swell and the service is sometimes fun, sometimes business, but always serving.The pickled and otherwise assortment that begins the meal is delightful. I cannot decide if I want the tiny dishes to be labeled in some fashion. Partly, I want to know and build my language, and partly, I want no one to know.Don't put the bone on the grill. I am a cautionary tale.
