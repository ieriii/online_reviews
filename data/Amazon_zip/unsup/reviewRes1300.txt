What else can I add to the other 1000+ reviews? If you like encased meat, this place is the best of the best. Whether you stick with a classic Chicago-style dog or branch out to one of their specialty sausages, you won't be unhappy. In fact, you'll be really full of really yummy food. It's worth the line, but go at an odd hour to minimize line waiting.  Cash only and the closest ATM is 2 block away (the woman in line behind me didn't realize this until she was almost at the register... I almost felt bad for her, except that she had clearly already gone past a number of "cash only" signs).
