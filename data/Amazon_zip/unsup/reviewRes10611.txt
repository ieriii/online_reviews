Update 8/16/2010 - Owner has called most apologetically and professionally, and offered to have us give it another go. We'll update our review following. For now, updating to 3 stars from 1 previously posted based on his attention. 8/13/2010:My husband made a 9:00PM reservation and we arrived about 9:03 tonight amidst a rainstorm. Upon checking in, the hostess advised us that it would be "just a few moments" and would we like to get a drink in the meantime. $28 and 35 minutes later, no table. I asked where we were in the process and she expressed that with the weather, they had to reseat everyone from the patio to the indoor restaurant, but "we were next." I mentioned that it was my birthday (it is) and this was a present from my husband. We enjoyed our drinks at the bar and moments later she came up to us and tried to seat us at a bar table they'd just placed (read- no table was in the bar before that). The bar was loud, not romantic, and we were aghast. What was a most anticipated and hopeful experience was crushed. Our "spend" in the bar was never addressed and our needs not met nor cared for. We are now home awaiting pizza, having left prior to our alternative seating on the patio...and it's still storming. But, there's a really big umbrella, our hostess says. The kicker -the restaurant's POV is that "it wasn't' supposed to rain until 10PM." Great - where would that have left us? Sad end to what should have been a celebration. We will not return and discourage any that would try (in the chance of rain in the evening) to even make a reservation.
