So, we were apartment hunting in the area and STARVING, so when we drove by I remembered this girl at work talking about how she loved this place and that's how we walked in. There were four of us and not one of us had ever experienced 'southern' cooking. the fried green beans were out of this world, and the Shrimp Fricassee (sp?) was amazing, i wanted to have it as my main course! the mac and cheese wasn't amazing as i had been lead to believe, but it was still good. our entrees were OK, and the only suck was our waiter must have taken 4 smoke breaks, bc he would disappear and then come talk to us and spew tobacco all over. gag. oh, and the lights above the table were really cool, except for the inch of dust covering them. you almost want to eat like a prisoner, hovering over your food so something doesn't fall on it when the AC kicks on. OK, so that makes the place sound bad, but the food was really good, maybe next time we'll take it to-go/?
