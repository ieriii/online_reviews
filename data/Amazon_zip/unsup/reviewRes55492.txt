Been here twice, found it thoroughly underwhelming both times, especially when there are significantly better restaurants in Chicago that deserve more hype.Service is a bit tacky, with waiters sprinkling in odd bits of faux-italian when they're talking to you.Food often comes in massive portions (never a good sign), but quantity clearly doesn't deliver on quality. The pasta I had was about an hour past al dente, the risotto on another visit was curiously gummy, the beet salad was limp and flavorless.The setting is nice, but they need to do a lot more work on improving the kitchen.
