I can't believe I lived in Chicago for three years and only came here during my last week. Frontera definitely lived up to the hype. We had dinner and drinks at the bar and basically asked the bartender to order for us. My favorite dish was the yellowtail ceviche and the champagne margarita was amazing. The service was excellent and we had a great time watching our neighbors ordering round after round of margaritas.
