What a hidden gem! This is in the running for best deep dish in the city. You can't beat their lunch special in the city: $4.95 for personal pizza +1 topping and a drink (including Bud Light). Staff is cool-- extremely efficient, but not pushy. I would recommend this place to everyone. P.S. Has upstairs seating that is available for private parties. enjoy!
