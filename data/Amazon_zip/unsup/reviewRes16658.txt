Carnivale (All Scores Out Of 5) Food: **1/2 Selection/Variety: ** Atmosphere: * Presentation: ** Portion: **** Service: **1/2 Price: ***1/2 OVERALL: **1/2 = "It was eh." Just the name "Carnivale" makes me think of meat and meat galore, that which rivals the likes of Fogo de Chao. Unfortunately, it's not. Got my hopes up for nothing. Carnivale is hard for me to put a finger on, but it's supposed to be some kind of latin restaurant with dishes from Central America and South America. As you walk in, it looks like a typical entrance to a semi-expensive restaurant. Dark, a bit smokey, and a bar teaming with life. Finding the bathroom was an excursion in itself. Once your table is ready, you walk through the curtain to a huge...room. Anticlimatic? So was the "room." It looks like they put tables on top of a huge ballroom with extremely high ceilings. Towards the top of the wall, you see a gigantic assortment of wine all neatly stacked in a rack. In the middle there's a stairway that leads to a second floor which, I recall, were mainly booths. Here's where atmosphere comes in. It was LOUD! Maybe it's the high ceilings, maybe it's the hard floor, perhaps it was the hundreds of people screaming to talk above everyone else. It was a very unpleasant noise. We were lucky enough to be inside a little alcove so it blocked out most of the sound from the "ballroom", but it was loud enough that I had to scream to talk to people just across the table. In addition to the noise, as long as we're talking about atmosphere, it was hard to imagine the place being latin at all, save the music. Nothing about the decor or setup resembled anything latin, unless photographs of buttcracks are supposed to describe the culture, which I highly doubt. Ok, so the atmosphere ain't all that, fine, as long as the food's good, I'll be happy. Inside the menu, there was a single sheet of paper listing their...ahem..."amazing" variety. There really wasn't anything interesting in it that made you want to really order it. There's really just some categories (Salad, Seafood, and Meat), and the choices in those categories don't really stick out as being different from each other. I had a very hard time trying to pick a meal, because nothing seemed all that appetizing. The only thing I could imagine being decent (or at least different) was the Borrego, lamb T-Bone. My Borrego came out ok. Since there were so many "pieces" to my meal, it's pretty impressive that they got it to come out as neat as they did. I saw the Mama Mendez 'Arros Con Mariscos', which is like a rice covered with seafood and sauce dish, and it looked really bad. Think of even the cheapest Chinese restaurants, the kind you used to get at college. This almost looked like someone had just spent a few minutes eating it before returning it to the kitchen to tell them it's not their dish...then it appears in front of you. The pollo that I saw come out was rather unpleasant, because it was literally just a dead chicken on a plate. There's nothing neat, eccentric, or even funny about the dish other than it's a dead chicken. Presentation was really all over the board. Some were neat, some were not, nothing too consistant. Now the food! My Borrego...Texture was good, and it had a lot of garlic on it, which is a huge plus to me. The downside was that it was incredibly salty! It's the kind of salty that actually irritates your lips a bit. With enough water, it went down, and despite being overly salty, my plate was actually fairly satisfying. The Pollo is definitely something you need to avoid like the plague. The chicken here is so dry, and no frills, and no enjoyment, and certainly no satisfaction. The steaks didn't really deserve any kind of honerable mention. The rest of the menu that I did try was rather...bleh. The portions left you full though. The service was pretty average, or maybe just slightly above, because I don't think I was ever left needing anything, but they didn't do too much more than that. There was nothing spectacular about how they brought the food or how they offered to bring or refil your drinks. Finally the price. My Borrego (did I mention that it made me full?) was only $25. With the property, the decorations (though not the best), the staff, and the hyped up name in mind, $25 is not a bad price to pay at all for what I got. $14 for the dead chicken...that's reasonable. I'd say that your average is around the low to mid $20's, and I think that's very reasonable for a place like this. There's really nothing that impressed me enough to make me want to go back.
