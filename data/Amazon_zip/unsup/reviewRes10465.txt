My lovely husband picked out this place and we had an awesome dinner! We were told by our dear nephew that you must dine in the patio..so we did and luved it! The menu had yummy items but we both opted for pasta dishes. I had the lasagne with bechamel sauce and bolognese with a glass of Sangiovese. And Hubbie had the flat noodle with boar and Chianti...mmmmm. Oh and go for the beet salad!!
