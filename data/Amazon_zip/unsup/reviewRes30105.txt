Discovered this place on a trip to Chicago many years ago and it still has great food, atmosphere, and most importantly good service. It's menu is varied with both American and European selections and the prices are quite reasonable. When in Chicago, my wife and I both find it a welcome stop both for breakfast and for dinner after a busy day. The food quality and service has not declined in the slightest over the past 10 years-something most restaurants can't claim.
