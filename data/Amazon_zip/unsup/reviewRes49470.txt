Ok, so I came upon this place when I booked a trip to Chicago and then browsed the James Beard 2009 nominees to find the best spots. I came here for brunch because I don't really like wine (I either fall asleep immediately or get way too drunk too quickly) or cheese (lactose intolerant). So going here was a bit of a silly idea, in retrospect. But I digress... The food was solid brunch fare. The omelette was perfectly cooked and the potatoes were crispy, but soft. I could definitely see the appeal for evening diners, too. The concept and layout of the place is very cool. Nice and modern, airy, and unpretentious. Also, I liked how you could see the kitchen from the dining area.
