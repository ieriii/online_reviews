This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown. The food is always consistent. Their standout dishes are definitely the spicier dishes. They have an extensive menu. You can't go wrong with the dishes on the Chef's specialties page. The cumin lamb and the hot pot are two of my favorites here. Yum! This restaurant is very popular though, so be prepared to wait in line during dinner time on the weekends. I believe they take reservations though.
