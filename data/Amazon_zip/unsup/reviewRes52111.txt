Ooooohhh you HAVE to try the Chicago Fire. Little wait on a Saturday afternoon, decent service, way too much food. Don't let your stomach do the ordering, scale down for sure...the slices are to damn heavy to carry around afterwards. I would skip the appetizers so don't wait until you're mega hungry to head over there (since it takes about 45 minutes for your deep dish pie to cook to perfection.) Wear loose pants.
