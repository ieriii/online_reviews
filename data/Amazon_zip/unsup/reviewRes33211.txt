So, so delicious. I was craving a salad and begrudgingly agreed to head here. Good choice. The cold bar was great (a bit fresher on my first trip-earlier in the day-than the second), and the chick pea salad dressing they have is the best ever. Beets, olives, etc; but I would advise trying the three kinds of something-stuffed-in-something and drenched in olive oil that I can't identify but want to eat everyday. Also the dolmas are fucking great.  Falafel is really not my jam; theirs is good, pretty spicy. I'm more a 'mix everything that is sitting out' together and hope for the best than an entree-orderer, but everyone I've been with that orders off the menu has been completely satisfied. Food is really, REALLY reasonably-priced-think under 6 bucks and you're full.  However, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how wonderful the guy working at the register is...always really nice, never makes me feel bad for forgetting it's cash only every. damn. time.
