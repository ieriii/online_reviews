I come here once in a while to splurge on my savory senses. The first thing I do is I go to the cafe to get the hummus plate. Man, the salted olive salad that comes with the plate is just this montage of salty goodness that works perfectly with the more paparika induced hummus. garlic.  Next, I go to the counter where all the cured meats are and I ask for the only culatello in the city. I mean it. I've looked, trust me. Ahem. It's the only culatello in the city. So I go home and I open the mouth-watering culatello and I eat a few thin slices. I then put it back in the refrigerator and try not to think about it too much. Finally, 4-5 hours later I come back to the fridge only to notice that my wife ate it all. RINSE and REPEAT! Every time ladies and gentlemen. Every time.
