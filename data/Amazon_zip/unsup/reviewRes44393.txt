They do not bake here. They sell baked goods from other bakeries. So how does this shop qualify to call itself a bakery? Their bread comes from Chicago Ave. Their bagels come from another shop. I believe their croissants (which are not anything near a real croissant) also come from another bakery. So how does this shop qualify to call itself a bakery? If you want coffee and to hang out somewhere, they are ok at best. Filter is a much better option that does not pretend to be something they are not.
