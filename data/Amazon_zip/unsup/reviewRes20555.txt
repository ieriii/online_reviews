I really liked XOCO. We tried to get into Frontera Grill at 6PM on a Thursday, and even though they only take limited reservations and there were only two people waiting at the wait area, we were quoted 1 1/2 to 2 hours for 2 PEOPLE. Wow. So, we went to Hub 51 which was good and had tons of seating. Came back to XOCO for dessert. Stood in line maybe 20 minutes - which was fine, we had time to kill before David Gray. Got the Aztec Chocolate and my wife got the Cafe Con Leche, plus we both got orders of 3 churros each for a total of $14 after tax. To me that's a GREAT deal. We couldn't even finish our churros we were so full. I'd definitely recommend this place for dessert. I can't speak for the entrees but they looked awesome. Be ready to wait. They seat on a basis of tables being open, which makes sense "Dennis." Since you wouldn't want to get your food and have to stand around with it waiting for a table to open up. That way you're only waiting in line, not waiting holding food. You get a number when you have a space open, then you just go to it after they take your order and they bring it out once ready. Check it out, Bayless is awesome. Hope to try Frontera soon. Maybe on a Tuesday?
