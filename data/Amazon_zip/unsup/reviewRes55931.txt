In short, the food is awful. The service was very friendly and accommodating, but the food is down right terrible. We had high hopes and ordered the calamari salad (tasted OLD and fishy), the bruschetta (very salty and not at all fresh tasting), the polenta (again not fresh and salty) and finally the zuppo di pesce...again, just bad. I ate about one bite of the main course and was done. We didn't finish anything because it was that terrible and we were starving!!! This place is one of the closest restaurants to our condo. We really wanted to like it, but no luck. Our first visit was about a year and a half ago and it didn't go well. We read the Yelp reviews last night and were shocked to see how highly it was rated. Thinking it was a fluke that our first visit was a bust, we gave it another whirl. MISTAKE!
