Five stars, BUT I am not Korean and had never had Korean barbeque before. I love fun new ethnic experiences, and that's was San Soo was. I was there before the renovation, so I'm not sure what it looks like now, but we used to sit in individual booths with high walls around you so you feel like you're in your own space. Cooking the meat yourself adds a fun dimension to the experience, and of course the place smells fantastic. I definitely felt out of place surrounded by Koreans groups who'd filled the place up after they got out of church. It was SO much fun and completely delicious.
