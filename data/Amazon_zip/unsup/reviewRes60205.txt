Best lil mom n' pop pizza joint to come into chicago. ever. While we are home to deep dish etc...FOGO 2 Go makes a wild range of over the top thin crust pizzas that leave you salivating convert from the Chi "norm"!super fresh ingredients. the sauce is to die for!PROS: Tuesday (our normal roommate and kids pizza night) for one pizza that you buy FOGO 2 donates a pizza to the church food ministry across the street! feeding he homeless homemade dinner, just wonderful giving back to the community like that!CONS: the menu is very small and poorly designed, it's a little hard to make a choice since it's all jumbled up. but once you do, it's always the right pizza you chose!
