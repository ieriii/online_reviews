I've only been here once... many years post my UIC experience (How did I never come here before???)... for dessert after a filling dinner at the Parthenon. What a great space! When you walk in, the coffee bar is to your left and the pastries... oh the pastries... are on your right. I opted for a chocolate mousse cup and an endless cup of green tea. Boy was I not disappointed. In fact, I could not finish my dessert and ended up having to take it home. There's also a cafe menu available which I will definitely want to try next time.
