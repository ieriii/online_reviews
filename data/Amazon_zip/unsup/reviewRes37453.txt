The food is good - but mostly overpriced. There aren't a ton of options in this area though.  Service is horrible --- i am continually amazed when it takes them 10 minutes to get the soup that is sitting behind the counter. Don't go if you are looking for something quick.  If they could figure out how to deliver reasonable service I would give 3.5 stars.
