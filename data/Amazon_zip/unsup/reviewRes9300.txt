Finally, got there last night for dinner with a friend and it was MAGICAL. Everything we had was great. You receive complimentary plate of Feta with onions, radishes along with house made pita. Started with Moosir as an appetizer, if you like Yogurt give this a shot, yummy and a HUGE portion which had to be taken home. Who takes the appetizer home, that's how big it was? The Entrees, I had the Lamb Koubideh with the Dill Rice. Amazing, absolutely AMAZING. Tip--get the the Dill Rice, it's that good. My friend had the Koubideh Combo and of course we shared plates. The Chicken on the combo is the BEST Chicken I've had-PERIOD. You have to try this Chicken. Sirloin was the other Kebab on the combo ans it was very good but the Chicken just blew all else outta the water. Portions were so huge that we forgot about dessert, ok no room for it. Definitely looking forward to returning soon. Oh, the price for 2 was reasonable and that's with the tip. The Service was not only good but friendly. It's just north of the Kedzie Brown line station, like steps away. Make it a point to have dinner here and they do offer a carry out, delivery service which is closer to the tracks and on a wintery night as we passed by it was packed.
