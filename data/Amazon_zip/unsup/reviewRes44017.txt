The food is delicious. There is a wide variety of maki rolls and every night they have a special one...which my boyfriend and I always try. Even if something is not on the menu (such as my favorite--Tiger roll), they make it for you. I have been to Wakamono at least 30 times and have taken most of my friends there--everyone raves about it and they often return for more. Their drinks are well worth the cost and the service is efficient and courteous. The only reason why I am rating them at 4 starts, rather than 5 is because we have difficulty understanding the staff at times. If the restaurant is full and you don't want to wait around for a table, I recommend that you sit at the bar and enjoy watching all the sushi/maki making craft. N'joy!
