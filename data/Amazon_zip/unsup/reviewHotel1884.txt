I love "W" Hotels. They always have friendly staff and cool, loungey atmosphere in the lobby. Two very small examples of why my stay at the "W" City Center was memorable. It was my Birthday weekend and"W"-Insider Jessica Young took the time to send me a little birthday platter of goodies! AND this "W" had a particularly AWESOME fruity smell coming from around the elevators. Two little examples of how the hotel serves and comforts its guest.  I chose, will recommend and will stay at the W City Center again instead the more socially centric W Lakeshore for a number of reasons. Since it caters to business travellers it tends to have much better weekend rates. It is also very close to the Sears Tower, Greek Town (I'm Greek so it was important I go see how my people are doing) Millennium Park (The Silver Bean) and Grant Park (The Fountain from Married: with Children). Plus there is a Loop stop at the corner AND a water taxi stop down a block that will take you to the Navy Pier. Can't go wrong at the W!
