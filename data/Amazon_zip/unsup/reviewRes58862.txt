It was great. The only thing that prevents it from being 5 stars is that I'd love to see a better selection for those with shellfish allergies. A few of the rolls sounded 95% great, except for they would add lobster or shrimp and that removed a number of options. Even still, I'll go back, but I'll keep pressing them to be more allergy-friendly (can we get our own deep fryer, at least?)
