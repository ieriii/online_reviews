Oh Garcia's I love you so. I especially enjoy the 2 taco platter that comes with truly delicious rice and refried beans. My boyfriend really loves getting the burrito with both chorizo and ground beef... a little too much for me but hey to each their own. Ask for the green salsa with the food. Its so good! If you want delicious and authentic Mexican food at ridiculously awesome prices then this place is a must. Its crave worthy. I want it now!
