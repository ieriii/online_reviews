This was an absolutely wonderful dining experience. I was expecting it to be as well considering the awards, reviews, and price.  I enjoyed each course. They were each complex and creative. The taste and smell of each made me want to take notes as I had them b/c there were so many that it was easy to forget. Fortunately, they give you a lovely print-out of the menu for that evening...which is a nice keep-sake.  I did not partake in the wine pairings. I believe it is 10 tastings of different wines. From previous reviews, I thought it best to just order a bottle of wine which I was very pleased with. To top off a wonderful dinner, Grant Achatz was in the house and came to present dessert. It just made the entire night even better. And, oh my goodness, that dessert was SO unbelievably delicious! Oh, and get coffee...the best ever. The service is outstanding although there were a few times when they were a bit antsy and tried to clear my dish before I finished. I'm a talker, what can I say? :) Also, my reservation was at 5:30 so the restaurant is just beginning their service which makes the servers almost too attentive. At my table, I faced the openness of the room which allowed me to take note of everything that was happening....enjoyable b/c I was able to see the process but also a little annoying b/c I could see them hawking my table trying to gauge when to come over.  So, my advice is to sit facing a wall if that will make you uncomfortable. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to go back!
