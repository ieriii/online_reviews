This restaurant is atrocious and ridiculous. The service is horrid. We ordered wine and it never came. Never. Not even after our entrees came, not even after our meal was over. The waiter never even apologized. That is INSANE. On top of that the wine was all over 70 bucks. Way too high for a place like this. The food itself was unique but uninspired. Very below expectations. Obama ate here, really? The portions were so petite it was like a Saturday Night Live skit.AVOID THE HYPE and do not go here unless you like pretentious bland food.
