Unlimited meat. Piles and piles and piles of delicious meat served on swords and shaved onto your plate by a guy in silly pants. If you can't get behind that, then I'm not sure what you're doing with your life. Service is always quick and friendly, salad bar is amazing, all around great experience. The only bad thing is that parking is near impossible so you have to maneuver your rotundity many blocks down or even worse, try to fit your body that is now filled with at least 10 pounds of meat into a train or bus seat. Going up and down stairs with a belly full of lamb is not fun.
