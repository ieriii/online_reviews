I think it's a great place... I stayed there for a long weekend and had a penthouse suite ... fantastic views, oversized marble bathrooms, large bedroom, huge living room with a very cool sitting area, large plasma TV, they even had an 8 seat conference room with an all glass table... it was very cool.. one of my favorite was a bowl of M&M's in the living room that was very neat looking and was getting re-filled by staff on daily basis.. .needless to say that weekend my calories intake was astronomical
