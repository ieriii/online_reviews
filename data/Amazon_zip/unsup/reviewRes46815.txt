I've lived half a block from this location for almost a year, and I've walked past it regularly. Rooftop garden? Neat! Amazing menu on the Web site? Cool! Numerous friends extolling its virtues? I had to come here. I decided to have my birthday dinner here, so I and ten of my friends descended upon them. My sister ended up being an hour early, so I got to sit at the bar and listen to local musicians play. A bar AND a string bass? I started loving my night there. (Note to Uncommon Ground: I tried to look up who was playing on your Web site, but I can't find anything prior to today. Why not maintain a list of previous performers for people like me who want to know more, but were busy drinking at the time?) We had a group of 11, and we got seated at a table for ... 14? 15? So they can definitely handle large groups, and they did so with attentiveness and good cheer. The food was, in a word, amazing. Friendly chatter was replaced with talk of how good the food was, and there was much sharing between us. Happily enough, my dessert *did* come with a birthday candle, and even more happily, no song. It's great being a grownup. Great food, great service, great ambiance, and I only had to stumble home half a block. Best. Birthday. Ever.
