My boyfriend and I decided to go to the Art Institute on a Thursday evening, and after consulting Yelp, decided to try this place for dinner afterwards. There aren't a whole lot of options in the area for dinner that aren't super touristy. Making reservations couldn't have been easier for 8:15p on a Thursday. The place seemed full when we got there, but we were still seated right away. The space is huge, actually! Tons of tables. But thanks to smart room divisions, the area we were in felt cozy. The service was excellent, and we didn't feel rushed through our appetizer and drinks, which I appreciate (especially given how busy they were, and apparently usually are). No hint of snootiness here. I had some kind of sage martini, which was delicious and quite strong. My bf really liked his old fashioned, too. We got poutine for an appetizer, which was surprisingly good, and both ordered burgers (maybe not the most balanced meal). The burgers were very good and huge (we both took half home). You could get a similar burger lots of places, but for the atmosphere, location, and quality of the rest of the menu, I was happy. One other note - it was quite loud inside. We didn't have trouble hearing each other, but you definitely had to speak up.
