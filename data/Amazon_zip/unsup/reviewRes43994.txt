I've yet to have a steak here (I'm usually there for lunch), but I have no complaints about the food. Everything I have sampled so far as been tasty and good sized portions. The service is attentive, sometimes too much so - waiters tend to check in with you a few times more than necessary. The location is great -- right next door to the Merchandise Mart -- and the happy hour can't be beat. $2.95 food specials plus drink specials as well. I'll be trying a steak dinner here in the next couple of weeks, and hope to have a good experience.
