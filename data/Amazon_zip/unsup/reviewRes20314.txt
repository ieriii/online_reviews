I just read that Coast was just voted the Citysearch Readers' Choice "Best of Chicago" sushi place and was so appalled I had to write something immediately. Yes, it's BYOB (though I just read they've applied for a liquor license now that there is no longer a library across the street and they are eligible), and I love that they deliver (for a charge -- but I get suckered in to home-delivered sushi all the time), but I have had some of the worst cuts of fish from Coast that I've ever had in a sushi place in Chicago. I've actually stopped ordering the sashimi and just stick to the maki rolls now for this reason. If it were cheap, I'd say go for it, but really, save your money and go about a mile south to Mirai (or Bob San for that matter) for truly good, innovative sushi and atmosphere.
