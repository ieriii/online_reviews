The Gilt Bar is a favorite of my coworkers. We come here to let loose during the week. The service is great, the bartenders are hilarious and accommodating. I wanted my Long Island made a certain way and the bartender took extra care to ensure I was satisfied with my favorite drink. The best thing....free popcorn! I love this bar. Its packed with professionals, wanting to forget about their day.
