After coming back from Wrigley in a somber mood and experiencing a disappointing Cubs loss (5 to 12) against the Phillies, we decided to kick up the mood a notch in the opposite direction by finally trying Chicago's iconic food staple: The deep dish. We had our choice between Giordano's or Gino's East. Word-of-mouth made our decision for us. This location was open the latest till 11pm. Was kinda shocked with the price: We had the Small (4 slices) Gino's East Supreme - choosing pepperoni, with fresh onions, green peppers and mushrooms. Which weighed in at $21.75.  The Medium (6 slices) is $27.50 and the Large (8 slices) is $31.50... A pretty hefty hole in the wallet for a pizza. We were warned that it would take 45 minutes to a hour for it to be served, so we also had the Tuscan harvest salad which consisted of mixed greens, apples, dried cranberries, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese with fat-free (totally contradictory and irrelevant to the rest of the robust menu) raspberry dressing. Sounds good, but this was mediocre to the salads found in California. But hey, I'll quit my whining because this is about the pie. When it came out it didn't look that appetizing (http://www.yelp.com/biz_). It looked sloppy and was pretty much a plain mess of slop. But my first bite knocked some sense into the sight misjudgment. It was truly tasty with its chunky red marinara sauce and mounds of pepperoni slices. The crust was just OK. So for this experience it's A-OK, however for the price, I would gladly eat a multitude of other foods available in this awesome foodie town. But I just had to experience it or else all hell would break loose for not trying it. One note, this place is famous for allowing you to write on their walls. So make sure you bring anything that writes in WHITE so that your caption can be seen!
