*giggle* a joke. if you're used to frozen dinners, maybe a place for you. It's all pretension. And it caters to the crowd that likes to pretend it knows what "fine dining" is about.  Maybe go in the way-back machine to before it was sold. Maybe then it was good. Now it's just a pathetic, overpriced shell of a restaurant where people from the burbs visit if they can't get a table at ponderosa...errr. gibson's.
