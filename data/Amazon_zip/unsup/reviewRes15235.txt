I was expecting a hipster crowd with a hipster attitude at this place, being in Logan Square and all, but was happy to be wrong. Upon arrival, the staf was amazingly nice and patient with me as I waited for my friend to arrive for a late lunch. The place is decorated very cool, with a beer barrel theme and a bohemian rock star vibe, if that makes sense. The special was some cheese dish that had one cheese that melted in your mouth. The burger was amazing for lunch. One of the best i have had in the city in a while. I have not been to Kumas yet, but I was told it was in the same category. I will definitely be back for dinner and drinks. Great new place!
