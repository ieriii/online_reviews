Fondue is FUNdue! -- yes, this saying is as old as our waitress was, but it seriously is fun!! (although it would be easier if they just gave you a big fry basket or something) My boyfriend took me to Geja's for a romantic, pre-birthday dinner, and we had a wonderful time! We both got the "Prince Geja's Combination" and substituted the chicken for more seafood. Even after putting a veggie at the end of the skewer, the seafood still managed to fall off and float around in the hot oil, which was a little tricky/dangerous to "fish out" (no pun intended). It was fun and we laughed until we cried. It was absolutely delicious -- and memorable! Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, especially the wine selection -- which is extensive. She was very informative and gave us her best practices for cooking fondue. I didn't give Geja's the full 5 stars, because the chairs are kind of low -- or at least my boyfriend's was. If they would've offered him a booster seat, Geja's would've gotten the full 5!
