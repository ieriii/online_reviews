Great food, great service. I have visited Nana for lunch, dinner, breakfast...never had a bad meal. Service is usually very attentive, and the parking is usually very good, plenty of metered spots are usually available. I am a vegetarian, and they are very accomodating when it comes to making substitutions, ie subbing veggie soyrizo for meat in several dishes.Highly recommended!
