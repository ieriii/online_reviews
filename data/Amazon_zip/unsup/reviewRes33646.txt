It's a pretty neat place for fast, delicious middle-eastern food. The lamb shawarma is phenomenal. It's quite juicy meaning it can drip down your arm if you're carried away eating (as i so often am), so try not to wear button-down long sleeve shirts okay? The yellow lentil soup is creamy and flavorful. I like those shisha on some of the tables. Reminds me of college... good times. I always wonder if I could smoke it after chowing down everything. Hm. Outdoor seating is great in summertime. Take the blue line if you can (Damen stop). If you must drive, try one of the side streets such as Le Moyne. It's free and easier to find than metered parking along Milwaukee etc.
