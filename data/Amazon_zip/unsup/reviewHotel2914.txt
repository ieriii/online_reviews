The Sheraton is a great value for a nice hotel in downtown Chicago! The rooms here are comfortable and nice (especially for the price in downtown Chicago!). They are in need of an upgrade, though when this happens the price will go up considerably. The Sheraton has a great view of the Lake, the river, and the city. It's a wonderful location. You are in between the south and north Michigan Avenue, which means that you'll be a comfortable walking distance from suh attractions as the Art Institute and Millenium Park on the south end of Michigan... and the Magnificent Mile and the Watertower on the north end of Michigan. I do not recommend the food here. We had brunch one morning and the price was outrageous and the food below par. There are so many great restaurants in the area... just don't eat here!
