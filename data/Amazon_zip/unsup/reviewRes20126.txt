The organized chaos: The line can be devastating and it's a little chaotic and hard to understand if you've never been there before. If you are eating in, the host will tell you to stand in line and wait until he/she gives you a number, once you have obtained this number you order, you sit, you enjoy some of the best food you will eat in the US. Don't be shy. If you want to grab an ice cold Bohemia and stand in line, go ahead, and feel free to have another while you're waiting. The food: I need not say much. It's fantastic. I am relatively certain there is nothing on the menu that is not out of this world. Go there, go often, and try everything. I will say the Ahogada (two towering pork-filled obelisks in a delicious, spicy sauce/broth/soup) is my favorite.
