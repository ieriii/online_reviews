This place is great for Monday Night Football. $1 domestic bottles and great food make it a perfect place to go. I should add that the girls who work there are very much on the good looking side. Outdoor seating was great when the weather was nice. Inside main floor was also nice. Upstairs was small and congested, but with a good view of the main level. The downstairs is just okay. If you are there with a big party, it is a decent place to be.
