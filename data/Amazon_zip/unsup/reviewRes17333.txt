Thirsty for a cocktail? If you're looking for something new...something that you can't really compare to any other place serving cocktails...check out Violet Hour. No other establishment that I've been to takes as much pride in making a solid cocktail as these guys do. They try hard to keep it mysterious. First, there are no signs or anything that says "Violet Hour" outside.  You wait outside on the sidewalk before a host- who likes like a body guard/secret service agent- permits you to enter through a dark tunnel which leads to a room that looks like Versailles in France. The bartenders are highly skilled artists who take pride in their work. You'll spend some good money on a drink, but you'll never forget it. I recommend bringing friends from out of town in order to give them a little taste of a truly authentic Wicker Park establishment.
