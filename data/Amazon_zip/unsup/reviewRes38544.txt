Definitely one of the best bars in Chicago with a fantastic beer selection, but beware the alcohol content is much higher with most of their beers. The servers and atmosphere is perfect. I haven't tried their food but I only have heard great reviews about. Definitely worth the trip to Andersonville if you don't live in the area.
