One word: unimpressive. I had high hopes, which is perhaps unfair going into any restaurant with good reviews - you hope your experience will be fantastic, too. I didn't know I would need to make reservations on a Monday night, and so we ended up sitting at the sushi bar rather than waiting an hour or so for a table. I usually like sitting at the sushi bar because you get to see what's getting made - but that's not the case here. The sushi chefs are separated from the customers at the bar by design, and when the rolls are finished they're set behind a wall , hidden away from curious observers like myself, and then quickly whisked away to tables by food runners and servers. Oh, sushi sushi, you romance me so. Sadly, that is not the case here. We barely spoke to one another, my sushi rolls and I. It was like eating with an awkward stranger. While the sashimi cuts are fresh and mildly conversational, the rolls were disappointing and silent. My friend and I ordered the white dragon and wasabi rolls - the wasabi roll was to both of our liking, but the white dragon roll was literally the size of my forearm because the rice was an inch and a half thick around a dime-sized mixture of shrimp tempura (which I couldn't see or taste), cream cheese, tobiko, and avocado. Service was unmemorable, prices are moderate - BYOB helps that though - the restaurant itself is loud and busy, the decor is comfortable, and the lighting is somewhat low to set the mood, whatever it may be. All in all, I will go back again and give it another shot, but I'm in no rush for masochism.
