I love the food here. I've been here 3 times in the past 6 months and I really do enjoy the food. I had the Friday special last time which was this mushroom stuffed salmon with a side of potatoes. It was SO filling and SO delicious. I tried my friends macaroni and cheese with cauliflower and I could not believe how great that tasted. The service wasn't that great but on busy nights I am more forgiving. Overall, love it.
