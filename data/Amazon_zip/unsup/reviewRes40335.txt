I will definitely be back here, but it wasn't exactly a homerun. The seasonally rotating menu looks great and lives up to expectations for the most part. The two of us had two small plates (scallops with gnocchi and truffles; quail and dumplings with root vegetables) and two entrees (sea bream with mushrooms, potatoes and corn puree; veal breast with lobster) which was slightly more food than we needed. But we were starving and the menu makes it hard NOT to over-order. The scallop dish and the veal dish were truly memorable. The other plates were great but not something you'll come back specifically for. The drink menu is among the best I've seen in the city, and it's well-rounded. L&E offers an obscene number of whiskies; the cocktails are excellent and reminiscent of what you might find at Violet Hour or The Exchange; the beer list is well stocked with craft brews, both on tap and in bottle; even the wine list is more than respectable. Come on a weekend night and you will be waiting, perhaps up to an hour. The good news is that the bar is not a bad place to kill some time. If L&E can improve their service a touch and make the food quality slightly more consistent, a fifth star won't be hard to justify.
