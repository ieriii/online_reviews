Very disappointing experience. we were sitting for 5 minutes before we even saw our waiter, Took 15 mins to bring our drinks, food came quickly. Burger; asked for medium, burger came out burnt. F*&k that. got the wilde burger i was still hungry after it, you get about 10 fries, v small portions considering the price. you get better value in bars downtown. UGH
