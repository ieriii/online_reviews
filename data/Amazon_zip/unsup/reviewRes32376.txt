Is it just me or does this bread fell like human flesh? Yeah, the texture is weird but the taste isn't bad.   This was my first Ethiopian experience and I must say I had a great time. We ordered the eight person chefs picks which featured about 10 different items. Lamb, Beats, Cabbage, Chicken, Fish and several other items were considered chefs favorite picks. The food itself was decent, but the real fun was tearing off pieces of the bread and eating with your hands. Finally, it's polite to eat with your hands! Great idea! Had fun trying the Ethiopian beers also (a little sweet for my taste though). This is the perfect place to take a group of people that want to try something different. The atmosphere features African artwork and is pretty cozy. The server was friendly, but disappeared for extended periods of time on a few occasions. Our group stayed outside and talked for about 5 minutes afterwards and was approached by two different panhandlers, the overall neighborhood was starting to get a little sketchy around 9:30.        Overall, I would rate this place very highly for group fun. The Demera experience may have more value than the food itself, but the food isn't half bad either. Great for your friends coming from out of town that want to do something unique, I'll be back for sure.
