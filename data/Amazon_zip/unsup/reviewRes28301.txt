I know there are 144 reviews for this place and while I just skimmed through them, they are mostly positive. I agree, this is damn good pizza, but I wanted to add my two cents by saying, DO NOT get this pizza delivered. Dine in! Some pizzas were not meant to be delivered and this is one of them. I know that the wait here can be long and it's loud, but its worth it to dine in despite the wait.
