Hopleaf, you are always so busy! and you never open your mezzanine area. This is why you lose a star. They have a good beer list, warm quelque chose right now, yum, but if you are expecting the map room you'll be greatly disappointed. They are similar and I think a lot of people come here for the oysters. The beers are great though and they do have a great selection, so if you live on the blue line go to the map room, if you live on the red line go to hopleaf. you can find amazing beers here and not break the bank to hard. Nice food as well, I've just had the fries, but I enjoyed them enough.
