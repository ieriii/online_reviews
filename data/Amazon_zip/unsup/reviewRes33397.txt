I wish I could write separate reviews for brunch and dinner here. I'd say the brunch was a 2 and the dinner was a 4 - so we'll go with a solid 3 overall. Brunch - I think this is a new deal for them. I went with a group of girlfriends a few weeks ago, and it was just kind of awful. I was so excited because I saw that they make their bloody marys with my favorite mix (Zing Zang! recommended by my brother the bartender ;) ) and it was super bland and watered down. UGH. It took the server forever to take our food order. I got a hash with scrambled eggs, potato, fried chicken and bacon... which should have been heaven... but was DISGUSTING. The dish basically had fried pieces of gristle in it. I couldn't even come close to trying to finish it. Dinner is much better. Service was very attentive even on a busy Saturday night. Pasta was delicious and still good as leftovers the next day as well. I thought their pricing was reasonable too. Work on the brunch, though, Mia Francesca. Please. I think you can do a lot better.
