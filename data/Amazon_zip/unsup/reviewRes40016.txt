Have been a handful of times for brunch and dinner. Chicken and waffles were pretty delicious; though the breading did fall off the skin a bit, but I'm not going to hold that against them. Crab benedict and shrimp n grits both very tasty; though I could use more grits. My only beef is that they're a bit pretentious feeling; the last 2 times I went there they asked us to wait 5 to 10 minutes when there were plenty of seats open. I don't care if you don't bring me a menu or anything for a bit, but at least put me at a table if there's one open. Decent beer selection, and excellent mixed drinks... had the dark and stormy, which was great; and was with someone who enjoyed the bloody mary. I like going here to try something I haven't had before... and now because they're just down the street. See you again soon.
