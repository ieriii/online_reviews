What a fantastic beer menu. Just an insane amt of good quality beers and the prices aren't too outrageous for them. I had one of their burgers with a giant portabella and arugula on it. It was fan-flippen-tastic. I added on some truffle oil to my fries and it made for a wonderful meal. Overall we were really pleased with this place and I plan to take my parents when they visit. You can get a decent meal for 10 and under. Not bad at all.
