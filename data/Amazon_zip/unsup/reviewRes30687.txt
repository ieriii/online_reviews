Whatever negative reviews you've read about the service, let me say that I have nothing but positive to say about the service. The menu can be intimidating, and our waiter put us at ease. He helped us pick a saki, since neither of us know the first thing about saki. (I know enough about wine not to order a wine from Sunda, though. Can you say obnoxious markups? $12 bottles should not cost $40.) He also helped us determine how much food to order, and gave good recommendations for the times when we couldn't decide between two items. For the record, we ordered duck hash, the "Oh no you didn't!" roll, the roll that featured lobster and bacon, the pork belly, and the Chilean sea bass creation. For desert we had the Ridiculous.  For me the dish of the night was the lobster and bacon roll. A ton of creativity went into that one. I had the duck hash to myself, and my wife had the "Oh no you didn't!" roll to herself. We enjoyed those dishes, for sure. I love duck, and this was a real treat. The pork belly dish was great (and I look forward to the leftovers this weekend). My wife liked the sea bass more than I did. It might be because I was getting full by the time the sea bass came out, as it was the final dish. I liked the Ridiculous, which is saying a lot because I don't care for carrot cake that much. The nuts made it shine, I think. Aside from the wine selection and pricing being a disappointment, I would say that Sunda could do a little better when it comes to dessert selections, though. I wasn't dying to try anything else on the menu, and dessert is a very important part of a night out for us.
