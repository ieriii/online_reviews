I really like New Haven Style pizza, and though Piece is a decent approximation, it's just missing something. The crust is somewhat charred and chewy, but it's really not very flavorful. I was excited to order the white pizza but you could barely taste the garlic or the olive oil (read: they probably use the cheap stuff). The red pizza was a little better but pretty much a typical thin crust pizza, nothing special. The pizza wasn't terrible, just nothing worth going out of your way for. The beer, for me, was a big disappointment. All of the beers were mild and "safe." I understand that you have to brew for the masses, but any worthwhile brewpub will have a couple prestige beers meant for beer fans. Just as a person who usually drinks light (or lite) beer won't like a hoppy IPA (at least not at first), a person who likes stronger beer won't really like a bland pale ale. There are other brewpubs in Chicago that do a great job of having a wide variety of beer, so as a brew pub Piece was really lacking. I tried 6 of their beers on my visit (through the 5 oz sampling option) and didn't particularly like any of them (I couldn't taste any rye in the rye beer!). Like their pizza, the beer wasn't terrible, but just not something I'd seek out. I was excited to visit Piece because the combination of beer and pizza is a tried an true winner. Unfortunately, I came away feeling like Piece did neither particularly well.
