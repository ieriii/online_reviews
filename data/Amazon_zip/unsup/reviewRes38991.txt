I had the Cauliflower dish when I came here not too long ago, as well as a mimosa which went great with it. Server was nice, we got to sit outside and enjoy the breeze. I love the decor of this place, I also appreciate that there is barely any signs to recognize it. I would definitely like to come back and try the breakfast next time! Just an FYI: they serve booze all day with the food so look no further if that's what you're in the mood for.
