BOOO! Icosium, Boo! I try so hard to like this place and the soup really helps, but apparently the owners don't think much of the intelligence of their patrons. My husband and I stopped eating at Icosium because the prices were high for a casual meal. However, I was thrilled to bits when I recently went back with some friends to discover that they had drastically cut their prices down to $6 and $7 a crepe and slightly shrank the portions. Tonight my husband and had dinner here and when I opened the menu, I was extremely pissed to discover that they jacked their prices back up to $9.50 a crepe. We decided to stay on the assumption that perhaps they increased the portion to justify a nearly 50% jump in price... but alas...three crepes a $40 bill and a hungry husband later, we left knowing we wouldn't be back..  One star is for the soup and one is for our fantastic waitress who deserves all five stars.
