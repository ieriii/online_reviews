We live down the street from the Bad Apple, and my husband and I were regulars until we had our son 4 months ago. We liked the menu (good veggie options) and beer selection. We haven't gone out to eat much in the last 4 months, but yesterday we decided to bring him in for the first time. My aunt and uncle were in town, and my parents came with us too, so we had 6 adults and a baby with a foldable stroller with a removable carseat. The large round table in the main area was available, but the host told us that there wasn't room for a stroller near that table, so he seated us in the back room with another large (loud) party with two newborn crying babies. The room was so dark that we couldn't see each other or our food even though it was the middle of the day, and our baby seemed frightened. My aunt has a hearing problem, and we were seated right next to a speaker blasting loud hip hop, so no one could talk. The service was oddly slow, and the food wasn't as good as we remembered - my mother, aunt and I all ordered the Southwestern cobb salad, which was incredibly salty, and my husband's veggie burger was bland and undercooked.If they're going to ghettoize large parties with strollers, they should at least fix up the back room so it's as nice as the other rooms (regular lighting? softer music?). Lincoln Square is a neighborhood with a lot of babies, so it doesn't seem smart to alienate their parents by seating them in the punishment corner. They also used to rotate the art occasionally, but they've had the skeleton art up for a long time now, and I would recommend that they go ahead and rotate it out.This last experience was so bad that we won't be back anytime soon.
