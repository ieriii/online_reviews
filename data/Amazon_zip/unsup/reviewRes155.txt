Do it once, spend the money, and dream about the hot potato cold potato and the black truffle explosion.  Suggestions:  1. Book an early dining reservation (i.e. 5 p.m.) It's worth it to eat at the Senior Citizen hour, because you'll be the first in the dining room to be surprised by each course. The presentation of the courses would lose its luster if four other tables were "ooh-ing" and "ahh-ing" long before you got it.  2. Skip on the wine pairings. If you're going to spend $800 for two people, you think -- might as well splurge on the wine pairings... but I found it cluttered by taste buds.
