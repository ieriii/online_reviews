I went to Gilt again last night and it continued to impress me. I think this is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Although a bit pricey, it's certainly worth it once in a while for a treat. It has to be noted that the cocktails are perfectly made. I had the Moscow mule and Pisco tropical. Both were delicious - the perfect blend of alcohol and sweetness. For dinner, my boyfriend and I ordered the peach salad (which was too expensive for the amount of salad that you actually get - my only complaint), pork meatballs (sweet comfort food) with polenta and the pasta with chicken and artichokes. The food was rich (but the portions are just right so it's not too rich) and simply delicious. For dessert, we went with the brownies and cookie dough/vanilla ice cream a la mode, and I was in heaven. I'm still thinking about that dessert this morning and already envisioning a return to Gilt bar just for drinks and dessert...
