Don't let the ambiance fool you. This restaurant has a very neighborhood appeal with a menu fit for foodies. If you're looking for unpretentious atmosphere and delicious cuisine I suggest to pay a visit to Longman & Eagle and discover why this place was awarded a Michelin Star. As the line can be crazy the best time to go may be around 2 pm if you don't want a wait. Fried Chicken and Waffles - It's not easy to do a juicy friend chicken breast, but Longman has certainly figured it out. Duck Hash - Delicious and Highly recommended.
