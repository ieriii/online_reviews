This place is a quiet and delicious refuge from the overbearing Chicago winters. The fondue here is unparalleled. The service is wonderful and it's comfortably dark so you can't quite see your neighbors as you plant another fondue fork into the cheese/hot oil/dark chocolate. An absolute must for Chicagoans.
