The g/f brought me here for the first time the other day and it made me realize what I had been missing since I moved out of the city years ago - smaller, non-chain bars/restaurants that serve an amazing and eclectic fare of food. The beer menu wasn't too shabby either. We started with the mussels - tender and flavorful, they exploded in your mouth after the first bite and just melted down your throat. The white wine sauce with beans and pieces of ham was excellent paired with the crispy rolls served on the side. I found it odd that fries were served with it but the garlic aioli threw that thought right out the window. Next up, I ordered the brisket sandwich (I was going to get the CB&J but was unsure about it) which also came with fries & aioli. She ended up getting the CB&J with chips. I really wish I had gotten the latter, because the brisket - while good- just didn't hit the spot. The meat was a bit on the tough side and didn't have enough flavor for me. I tried her sandwich and was blown away. It was buttery and rich, wasn't too sweet, and was just plain excellent. If I had to eat it at another time of the day I'd say it would be great as a breakfast sandwich. For drinks we got beer. I stuck with Five Rabbit and she tried a few different ones I didn't care for. Their selection is amazing. The atmosphere, while busy, made me feel right at home even though I have never been there before. I love a busy place because it means they must be doing something right. If you come without reservations and have to wait for a bit, just do it - you'll thank me later. The cost for us to get 2 sandwiches, 4 beers, and mussels-for-one = about $60. It was well worth it IMHO and I will be back again soon!
