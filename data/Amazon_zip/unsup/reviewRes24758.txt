I have been thinking that fondue is just another version of Hot Pot, and i have heard a lot of people refer Chinese hot pot as Chinese fondue, but after hitting Geja's Cafe, i do believe there're many similarities among fondue and hot pot. However, i don't think its appropriate to mix up the names. Fondue is fondue, Hot Pot is Hot Pot... Geja's features a romantic dining atmosphere with dimmed light and live flamingo guitar player (right next to our table during our visit), serve staffs are attentive and professional, the server explained everything clearly to set down your concerns. And there are wide variety of wine selections available and some are at great prices. Spent quite good amount of time finding a parking lot, valet parking is suggested if visiting around 7:30pm.
