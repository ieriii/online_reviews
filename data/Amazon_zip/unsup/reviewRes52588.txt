They only get an "A-OK" because their little popover butter rolls were DELICIOUS. We went through three baskets of them. The meat was ok. I said yes to the filet mignon three times, each time asking for medium rare... and each time I got medium to well-done... Also, we only got one little plate of mashed potatoes and I had to keep asking for more bananas... AND, we didn't get anything bacon wrapped. We were there for about an hour and a half and it wasn't until we paid our tab that the chicken and filet wrapped in bacon came out... Sad time :( The best thing - other than the rolls - was that everyone had a sense of humor here. We were able to talk with everybody and it was a very laid back atmosphere... I'd say it was a great deal for Restaurant Week, but probably would be really bad if we had to pay full price. OH! I almost forgot. Since I love shrimp, I let myself have ONE shrimp. The first one I got still had a giant, thick, black vein in it. So I didn't eat it. However, I didn't notice this until the shrimp guy had already come by and I told him I was allergic and could only have one... But since Joe leaves his "yes, please" side up much longer than I do, the shrimp guy came around again and I told him that I couldn't have anymore... So Joe got some more.  Then, Mr. Shrimp Man came around again and said, "none for you!" (see? fun to joke around with) but I had to insist that I didn't eat my other one because of the giant, thick, black vein... And he gave me another one. It was overcooked and very fishy... And I had an allergic reaction very quickly. Boo!
