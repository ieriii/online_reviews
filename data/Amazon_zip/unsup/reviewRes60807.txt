I love Lockdown's theme and food! Delicious! My favorite burger to get is the Fat Elivs, it's sweet meet's salty and AMAZING!But, I am mainly doing this review on a particular server. Sigh.I usually come in the evenings but the past few time's I went in the AM when it isn't so busy, figuring I could get in and get out during my lunch hour. Psh. NOT the case. Each time I have gone in the AM it was the same server, I don't even know her name as she barely talked to me. It wasn't busy so I sat myself at a table and waited (the busboy came over immediately and game me a menu, water and silverware, he was truly awesome). Each time I knew what I wanted so I just sat and waited, and waited and waited some more. The server (they only have had one when I have came in she bartends and serves) was playing on her phone or watching TV and completely ignoring the fact I was there. Finally she came over and asked what I wanted to drink, I asked for a soda. She didn't bring it back right away...but no worries. I ordered my burger (med rare) with a side of mac n cheese minus the bacon. The busboy brought it out as soon as it was done and I dove in. First of all the mac n cheese had bacon in it and the burger was well done. I caught her attention and told her my food wasn't right. She argued with me and told me that was exactly how I ordered it!!Anyway...to say the least I don't go there on Monday and Wednesday mornings anymore.
