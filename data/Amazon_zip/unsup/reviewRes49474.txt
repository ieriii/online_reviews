After having this place recommended to me by a co-worker ages ago, I finally had the pleasure of actually going. And low and behold, who was there dining on Saturday night but my co-worker who had recommended the place!!! All I have to say is that this place does not disappoint and I can't wait to go back again!! The highlight of the meal was the skirt steak, but if this is your first time going you must get the combination plate. I had the skirt steak and the baby octopus and both were amazing, but I realize octopus is an acquired taste. The star of the show the skirt steak, the marinade and the seasoning that use are indescribable!!  I am usually one of those people that takes home leftovers...not this time. It was so delicious that I was sticking my fingers in the pan to get more of the sauce when my steak was finished (I am classy like that). If you are going to have dessert you must try the flan...it was awesome!!
