I agree that the entrance to the place is difficult to find -- we walked past it twice. The food is okay -- I thought their chicken tortilla soup was the best out of all the things we ordered. The Margherita Pizza was too overloaded with cheese and the sandwiches were just normal -- nothing special and not really worth the price. I did want to check out the grocery store but I didn't have time -- it looks like they have a lot of variety. The best part about eating here is probably the people watching. If you grab a seat by the windows, you can see all the people going to and from Navy Pier...and as a bonus, all the construction they're doing across the street!
