We went to alinea for our first anniversary. Being foodies like most yelpers and living in chicago for about 7-8 years, we had to try it. I would agree with Patrick N, to not read the reviews too much and just try it for yourself. The surprises and theatrics of the meal are what make it. This was one of the most memorable experiences I have had in a meal, and its worth the price for once every couple of years when they change the menu. We have a full set of pictures from when we went, and i may upload the video of Grant Achatz making our desert. He didnt do this for everyone, so we felt particularly lucky that he did it for our table. The food is of course amazing, and even if you have dietary restrictions, which we did, they will be accommodate every request. There are some reviews of people who did not have an excellent time, so this may happen to some and if it does to you, that sucks because you will be footing a pricey bill. However, for the most part, people leave happy, and thats hard to do when people are paying 250+ a person.
