One of my favorite places in the world... total home run and very unique.  The place looks great, with long tables, cool lighting and stable seating.  The service was exceptional and food flew out the kitchen, even on a packed night. For maybe the first time, everything I ate I recommend: ... Port rinds, no greasy, super crunchy ... Artichoke burrata salad, fresh ... Octopus, excellent with lentils ... Ham plate, basic, nice meat selection ... Pork belly, the best ... Steak, simple and super juicy ... Radishes were fresh, but could have done without ... Chicken with sausage and fries, excellent - one of the best prepared chicken I have had Overall, the food is simple with very high quality, fresh ingredients.  The portion sizes were nice sized, some were even large and the the price was reasonable as well. I'm coming back!
