The next time I ask someone where i can find good middle eastern food in chicago and they reply with Sultan's, they are getting a bike lock to the face. This place is, in short, an abomination. The only thing that holds this place together is that I can get fresh pita there when I am unable to get my fresh pita from Al Qaiyum. Otherwise, I would never set foot inside this mediocre joint. Really? The best falafel in chicago is served to you from a hot bain, withering under heat lights and over boiling water until it's sloppily topped with some watery -ass jeruselum salad? I took two bites of this drivel called a "falafel sandwich," declared it disgusting, and went home hungry. In fact, I preferred it that way, rather than finishing this terrible torpedo of shame. If this is your idea of good falafel, I feel really terrible for you and urge you to make a road trip to any of the suburbs outside Detroit, particularly Dearborn. Many of you do not have the luxury of knowing what a good falafel tastes like, and I feel sorry for you. Stated before, this joint is an abomination and I will add, a mockery of the spectacular middle eastern food I have had the privilege to enjoy in my sheltered little anglo life. I beg of you, find me good middle eastern food in Chicago. I've been to Pita Inn, it's the best around, but I am yet to be blown away like I have been in Dearborn.
