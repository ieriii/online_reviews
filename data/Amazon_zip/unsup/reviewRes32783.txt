Hands down, the very best vegan food ever! I have been a vegan for 30+ years and a couple of years ago decided to switch to fruitarian so I no longer eat at The Diner and miss it tremendously! The desserts alone are worth the trip. The portions are huge, the service is friendly and helpful and the food is phenominal. Everything I have ever tried on the menu is absolutely delicious. The homestyle potatoes are the best thing to come out of a potato, ever. As a long time vegan who has been around the vegan food block, I can honestly say that The Diner is without a doubt the best Chicago has to offer. Being a fruitarian sucks, most definitely.
