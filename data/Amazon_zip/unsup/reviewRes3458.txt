I come to Chicago at least twice a year to visit family. So, I've been wanting to try this place ever since I first saw the reviews on Yelp about a year ago. Living in New York for the past 5 years, I've been addicted to Korean fried chicken: Kyochon, Bon Chon, Kyedong and UFC. Not to mention, I absolutely love bibimbop. So, of course, I've been looking forward to trying the food at Crisp. So, last month, I finally had the opportunity try this place. Three of us ordered the following: Original Bad Boy Buddha, half of the Plain Jane, and half of Crisp BBQ. I'm going to be completely honest, the Original Bad Boy Buddha and Plain Jane were just okay. Granted, the Buddha was a different version of the Korean bimbimbop, but the three of us weren't impressed by it. The Plain Jane was just okay, and we didn't really dive into it. However, the Crisp BBQ had really good flavor, and we devoured it. Like I said, I guess I've been spoiled with NY korean friend chicken locations. The chicken at Crisp was WAY TOO greasy. I know it sounds crazy, but the way the fried chicken is prepared at Kyochon, Bon Chon, Kyedong and UFC, there is HARDLY any grease. It's hard to believe, but until you try it, you'd understand. After eating a dozen, there are only some traces of grease. However at Crisp, after eating the fried chicken, there was a thick layer of grease. My pros: Crisp BBQ had good flavor, service was FANTASTIC (no matter how busy, they would take the time to answer any questions; attentive and very polite), and the ambiance (I enjoyed the indoor picnic feel).
