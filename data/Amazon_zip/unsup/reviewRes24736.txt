Went here for Chicago Restaurant week. Amazing. I had their brunch tasting menu, which included a 7 course menu, a charcuterie buffet with suckling pig, and a dessert bar. For $30, this was an absolute steal. Highlights: - Roasted suckling pig was hacked apart while still crackling and juicy. Seriously made me forget all about Purple Pig.  - Their take on Eggs Benedict with truffle oil was incredible. Fluffy yet decadent.  - Crab topped toasted brioche was also similarly amazing. - They made a tasty spinach and green apple salad dish that I originally thought was going to be the weak part of the menu but turned out to be an delight. Very light and fresh, and the interplay between cold,tart apples and partially sauteed spinach was clever. All in all highly recommended. I can't remember the last time I had a meal that good.
