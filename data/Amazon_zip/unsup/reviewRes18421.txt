Pros: 1. Awesome burger list 2. Laid back cozy vibe (Exposed brick; fun scrap-metal artwork) 3. Burgers actually cooked to your requested wellness (when was the last time I ordered medium and actually got medium?) 4. Nice sized burgers paired with "just the right sized" buns 5. Unlike DMK, not too loud Con: 1. Not terribly juicy burgers
