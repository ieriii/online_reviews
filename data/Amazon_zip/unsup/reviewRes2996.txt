I went to TRU about 4 years ago. This was my first real fine dining experience. The place felt a little intimidating because I wasn't really sure how to sit, act..eat some of the foods. But once I tried the cavier staircase, it quickly melted away. By far my two favorites were the marinated tuna dish that sat on top of a bowl with a beta fish swimming underneath my plate and the HUGE dessert carts with homemade lollypops and chocolates. My bf at the time had called ahead and the staff was even kind enough to print "Will you go to prom with me?" on my menu. Best dining experience to date.
