Outstanding! In town on business for a couple weeks and heard that Rick Bayless had a new restaurant. I went on a Monday only to discover they were closed. Went back on Tuesday and wow I'm glad I did!Ordered the special which was Carnitas with a guacamole sauce and some other heavenly ingredients. It was worth coming back for.Grabbed several Churros on my way out. I'm just sorry I didn't try the hot chocolate. Good reason to go back I think!
