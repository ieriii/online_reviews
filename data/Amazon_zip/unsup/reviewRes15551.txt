As luck would have it- I have had the chance to eat at Calo a couple of times in the past couple of weeks. Granted- Andersonville is way off my beaten path- but if I am in the area, Calo calls to me when I want some good, comforting Italian food. The first time I had ever heard of Calo was when I was with a bunch of Yelpers at Simon's Bar drinking their ever popular Glogg. I hadn't eaten (never a good idea when you are "Glogging") and one of the menu's provided for me by the bartender was for Calo. I called and ordered a pizza and mozzarella sticks to share.  After being told it would take an hour- the food actually showed up in about 30 minutes- hot, cheesy, thin crust pizza, just the way I like it. Maybe a little pricier than I was expecting but what the heck? I love when people bring the food to you! Given that the delivered food was so good- when a friend who lives in the area asked where did I want to go and eat- I thought . . hmm . .let's go to Calo and see what else they can do! Well- the experience was great. From being seated in the front window to watch the snow fall- to the amazing lasagna Bolognese and the gnocchi with Gorgonzola- I was hooked. Service kept some great martinis flowing effortlessly and I left with a smile on my face (and a song in my heart given how many martinis I had, I'm sure!) Give it a try. You may find your next little favorite Italian place right here in Andersonville!
