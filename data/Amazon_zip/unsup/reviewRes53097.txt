I wanted to like this place but maybe I came on an off night. Service was very good, friendly, and helpful. My date had oxtail and loved it, I had the days special pork something, it was chunks of fatty pork with onions. Apps were great but they brought them out with our meal so we had a table of food to eat. Dessert, chocolate flaun in chocolate sauce= old flaun with Hersey syrup on it. Overall I will try again but next time but they will have to really earn another return.
