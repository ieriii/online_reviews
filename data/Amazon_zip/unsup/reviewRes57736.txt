Love this place! The food is really good, but I take 1-star off for customer service. I'be been here about 5 times, and 2 of the times we had less-than-stellar service from our waiter/waitress.Most of the time the service is good though, and even when it's not the best...the food is still good. You can tell they really are making the food there- not just re-heating something frozen. So it takes a little longer to get your food, but it's a nice quiet atmosphere that you can't help but enjoy relaxing while you wait for your food.Breakfast ALL DAY...yum. Scones and pancakes are both fabulous. Lots of people there reading the paper, or working on assignments because it's nice and quiet.
