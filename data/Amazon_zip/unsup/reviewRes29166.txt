So good, and they deliver sooo far! I love the bowtie pasta with cream sauce, chicken, mushrooms, red peppers, etc. Amaaaazing. Spaghetti and meatballs are classic too, plus they just give you so much to eat you always have leftovers. I have tried most of the pastas here, so you can go with pretty much anything. Sorry for the vagueness of this review, but it doesn't hurt!
