Having accumulated over 400 glowing reviews, Doug has received a lot of much-deserved hype. Not much to add, except some practical advice: 1. Arrive at either 10AM or 4PM to avoid the thirty minute wait (for a hot dog). 2. There's not a lot of distinction between the regular fries and special duck-fat fries, (to my tongue). 3. It's remarkable how Doug remains so personable, even when dealing with hordes of hot dog demands.
