The service is great. The food is nothing too fancy, but really yummy. The margaritas are awesome as well. I need to go back and try them on a half price day! I got a veggie burrito, and it was really good. They gave me the dinner platter, which I didn't actually order, and it cost around $10 with the rice and beans on the side. This would have annoyed me more, since I don't eat meat and wouldn't eat Mexican rice without knowing it was made with veggie stock, but the service was so friendly that I overlooked it. I ordered my burrito "supreme" which means it was topped with melted cheese and avocado. My bf got a steak burrito (he too was given the dinner platter without ordering it- and it was around 1pm) and said it was delicious. Now I've never been to Bayless' restaurant so I don't know "GREAT" Mexican food, but this did the trick for my burrito craving.
