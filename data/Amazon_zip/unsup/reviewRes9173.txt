I walked in thinking I would get Vietnamese food with a French bent. I walked out somewhat disappointed.  I ordered the Vietnamese ravioli for starter. It was wrapped with rice noodle sheet. The flavor profile and the contrasting textures of the dish were quite good, but there was a construction problem - you try to pick up the food, and everything just falls apart. Nothing stays together. It was more like a noodle dish than ravioli. A complete misnomer and a failure at fusion concept.  For entree, I had the chili jumbo shrimp. It was delicious. But it didn't taste particularly Vietnamese or French. The flavor profile was basically a pan-Asian blah. And the kick promised by the menu description and the waiter's warning was quite mild.  For dessert, I got the Vietnamese macaroon. I thought I was going to get a Vietnamese interpretation of Pierre Herme. But instead I got an American macaroon (of the flaky, coconut variety) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with chocolate sauce drizzle. It was not bad, but it tasted like something I can buy from Dominick's.  Overall, the food was not bad, but nothing was memorable. It's not authentic Vietnamese, but at the same time there was no sign of Vietnamese-French fusion that I could detect. Everything tasted safe and generic. Frankly I was expecting more, especially with the price premium.  But I still give it 3 stars (more like a 3.5 actually) because the food didn't taste bad (there was no execution problem to speak of), and the setting was quaint and beautiful (apropos given the namesake) and the service pleasant.  If the chef focuses more on the concept of Vietnamese with a French twist (or vice versa), then the experience will be much more coherent and interesting.
