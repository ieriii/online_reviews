Amazing service, perfect menu, and a strong family original feel. The manager came to our table made us feel right at home.l.. He was funny and very warm welcoming. We started with the appetizer with the tomatoes, prosciutto, and motzerella. Loved it!!!!! I am pregnant and have very weird food aversions so I made a custom request for gnocchi and a vodka sauce (I felt bad doing this because I am usually not picky) and it was incredible!!!!! My husband had the lasagna and it was enough for both of us to get left overs!!! It was just as good the second day and our whole date night was great, it was our first time there And we love sapori and will definitely be back. Wait!!!! I forgot to mention the homeade cocoanut and mango sorbet!!!! The cocoanut came in a cocoanut shell and is soft enough to scoop out :) Delish! We even went to the grocery store an bought a cocoanut sorbet bc we loved it so much, but of course.... Didn't even compare to theirs!!!!!
