Tried a few things in the bakery and they were pretty decent. Key lime bar and turtle brownie. Just a warning -- the study hall next door is like super quiet. Kind of like a hipster library. Some people get things done when it's silent, but it drives me crazy. And then when one person gets a phone call, everyone in the place can hear the whole conversation. The people who work there are nice though.
