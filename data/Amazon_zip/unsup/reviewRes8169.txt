I haven't gone for a couple years because they changed their corkage policy to being rather obscene. They used to be $25 per bottle, but then changed it to PER 750ML, so they want $50 to open a magnum of wine! If they hadn't made that change I'd likely still be going there with my father when he comes into town and never even tried Brazzaz or many other restaurants. So their greed cost them a guaranteed early dinner seating for a party of 6 once or twice a year. Considering how competitive the Brazilian Steakhouse market is (FOUR all within walking distance of each other!), you'd think they'd do everything they could to build and maintain loyalty... Their meats are all good and everything, but being the largest chain of the Brazillian Steakhouses, they're the standard setter, thus don't have any unique gimmicks to set them apart (ie Brazzaz's shrimp and Texas De Brazil's Lobster Bisque). So now that they made me venture elsewhere in search of fairer corkage, I have been to Brazzaz and tasted their awesome shrimp and I'm not looking back should I crave to cram crap loads of meat down my throat.
