The Publican is a fun spot but don't expect great value for your money. Most of the dishes tasted very good but there was a lack of warmth in the overall ambiance perhaps from the high ceilings or the plain wood walls. Best two dishes were the fried clams (not a bad value here) and the roast suckling pig - which was tender and flavorful but it was just a pile of meat no visions of suckling pig here. The short ribs were very chewy - way too much so. The fresh sardines were OK - a bit fishy tasting. The frites were the best thing on the menu. $7 for a big pile of fries that tasted like they had been cooked in duck fat and topped with two fried eggs. Creamy and delicious! The cheese plate seemed like a good value (with at least 5 types of cheese and more than an ounce of each) after all the other high prices but needed more of the honey and nut mixture. Our server forgot about us and we had to ask for the bread and beers twice and he didn't check in on our meals until it was way too far along. The water service was fabulous - water glass was filled every few minutes.
