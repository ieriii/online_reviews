Had a great time with a grubwithus group here a few weeks ago. We had SOOOOOOOOOOO much food! Starters Empanada Assortment (YUMMY!) Avocado Salad: Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, red onions & avocado with olive oil, salt and pepper. Entrees Masas de Puerco: Marinated pork medallions, fried and topped with garlic, served with congris and maduros. (these were just OK, a little tough on the pork) Ropa Vieja: Traditional Cuban dish made with shredded beef, onions & peppers slow-cooked in a Creole sauce. (Pretty darn good) Veggie Platter: Grilled portabella mushrooms, red and green peppers, zucchini, yellow squash & grilled onions. (I'm a sucker for grilled veggies!) Tofu Dish: Grilled Tofu, marinated in Creole sauce & topped with grilled veggies. (unnecessary because none of us were vegetarian but delicious nonetheless) White Rice, Plantains (I love plantains!) The waiters suggested that we go to the Walgreen's down the street for some bottles of wine since it's BYOB. Then they made us some fantastic sangria! The whole dinner was a hit and there was plenty to go around as leftovers when we were done. I'd love to come back here on a nice summer night and sit outside! There are a lot of other dishes I'd like to try.
