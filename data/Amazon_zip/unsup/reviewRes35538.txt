I love this restaurant - cheap, good food, friendly people, easy. But I give 4 stars just because the meat is hit or miss sometimes. Sun Wah is very authentic and has lots of exotic meat and flavors.. and their description isn't always exactly clear. I've had "Marinated Chicken", which sounds generic and safe enough, but the flavor was a bit... unfamiliar to my taste. But don't get discouraged to try this place out!! Because their meat, no matter how they're prepared or what kind of sauce, is always cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy. No chewy, cheap meat at Sun Wah. I usually get BBQ chicken on the way home - 1 pound of deliciously cooked chicken for $4. Oh, before you go - they don't take cards for orders less than $12. And, especially if you're getting food for 1 or 2 people, it's VERY hard to go over that $12...
