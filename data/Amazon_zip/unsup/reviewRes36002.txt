I came for brunch on a this past Saturday with my best friend. For a table of 2 they explained that the wait would be approximately 25 minutes. That was no problem especially because that gave my friend and I the chance to go over the menu and also spectate on the dishes that were being served at the other tables. The plating was beautiful there not one dish that did not look anything less than beautiful. When we finally go seated our server approached the table promptly and was friendly. Most of the choices on the menu came with this delicious potatoes!!!! OMG those potatoes!!! I had some sort of mexican turkey chorizo flavored with eggs and jalapenos. IT WAS AMAZING! My friend really enjoyed how fluffy her eggs were. She also had the orange juice which taste like you literally stuck a straw in the best tasting orange you will have in your life! I am definitely coming back again I would definitely recommend this place to others.
