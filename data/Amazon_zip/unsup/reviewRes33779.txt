I've received quite a Middle Eastern culinary education from my Assyrian boyfriend. I'm lucky in that way, because otherwise I'd be unable to recognize flavorful, complex flavors of quality Middle Eastern food from the sub-par food at Sultan's Market. I really wanted to like it. Really and truly I did. After seeing Sultan's Market on Check, Please!, it looked so fabulous my boyfriend and I hightailed it there. I was so sad to discover an average homemade meal at his family's house is so much better. The spinach pies at Sultan's Market had too-thick dough, with no onion or lemon flavors bursting through the spinach filling. The falafel, while well-seasoned, was too big, so it held just a bit too much grease for my liking. And the tahini? I'm sorry to say it was more yogurt than tahini in my opinion. It did smell great from the outside, even on a cold, windy day. Maybe the quality suffered because of an surge of visitors? Maybe it was just an off day? I hope so because I'd love to give Sultan's Market another chance one day. Just maybe not so soon.
