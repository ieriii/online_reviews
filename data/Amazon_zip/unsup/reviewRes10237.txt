Piccolo Sogno you get 5 stars! I went back for the second time last night and the experience was just as memorable - if not more! Truly authentic Italian experience, from the wine to the bread to the courses to the service. It's amazing!  We had the roasted vegetable special served with prosciutto and pecorino romano for the starter. Definitely enough for three people to share, and was a perfect perfect starter. Beautifully done seasonal veg. So good.  Then, we shared the special pasta of the night which was a wheat penne served with a tomato/onion sauce with pancettta and parm. Delicous, light and a great choice!  For my entree I had the short ribs (which I had last time and JUST HAD to get again because they are sooo good). They lived up to my expectations for sure. They melt like butter. THIS is a dish to go there for! We also got the whole fish of the night, which I think was a seabass. It came with a citrus, wine and caper sauce, and was filet'd tableside. Lovely.  We topped of the dinner with a nice '07 Chianti Riserva and ended the meal with their saffron infused panna cotta which was to die for! The service is exceptional here, as is the cuisine. I hope to be back a lot!!
