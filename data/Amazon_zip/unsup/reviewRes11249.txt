I've been here three times now, and the food is very very good. I would not say this is the BEST in Chicago, however. i would also not go on a weekend, because I do not wait in line for an hour to be fed when I am hungry. But the lemon ricotta pancakes with brown sugar are absolutely SICK.  And I mean that in a very good way.  If you want to wait an hour for a phenomenal brunch you will never forget, go to Lula's.
