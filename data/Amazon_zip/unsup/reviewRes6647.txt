We were walking through the neighborhood on one very hot, muggy Chicago day and came across this cute restaurant. We decided to pop in because we were absolutely starving, and could use some refreshment. We were seated right away, and the decor inside was clean and inviting. Our waiter recommended the orange blossom martini. I must say, I did not like it even remotely. It tasted like cheap booze, I'm sorry to say. I did force it all down since it cost $11 dollars. They brought BBQ chips and sweet pickle slices to our table prior to ordering. Both were delicious and fresh.  We were so hungry we wanted to order an appetizer. I wanted the fried green tomatoes, but my husband refuses to eat tomatoes so we compromised on the cheddar bacon hush puppies. These hush puppies have the ability to be fantastic, but alas ours were overcooked. The flavor was there, if they were just pulled out of the fryer a moment or so sooner. The dipping sauce that came with the hush puppies was a perfect accompaniment. I would recommend this, but not when it's overcooked and dry. For our entrees we both got the pulled pork sandwich. I also got a slice of the chipotle corn bread. The corn bread was moist and just the right amount of sweet and heat. Fantastic! The pulled pork was served on a pretzel roll, which I loved because the bread didn't fall apart as I was eating the sandwich. The pork was kinda fatty and bland, to be honest. This was not the best pork sandwich I'd ever eaten in my life. They serve all of the sauces on the side, so you can pick and choose what to add to the sandwich. I went with a mixture of the North Carolina vinegar and the Spicy for the sandwich, and just tasted the others. All sauces were flavorful and tasted homemade.  Chicago q is just OK. Nothing to go out of my way to get again, but if I were in the neighborhood and craving BBQ, then yes I'd stop in.
