We went when the weather was nice, and sat outside... (nice... it's loud inside)... this place was spec-freakin'-tacular! The food was unbelievable (although contemporary-style, so small, but delicious). I had the Slagel Pork Belly... it was almost too good (is that possible)... I was sad to finish it.. it arrived with tiny pieces of cabbage, and a splash of something tasty decorating the plate. Others at our table had skirt steak, the Roast Char (some kind of atlantic fish), and the roasted Cauliflower. We all tasted from everyone's plate. Everything was divine. But wait... I forgot to tell you what we had before dinner arrived. Longman and Eagle has BOURBON flights... that's right... 3 very small glasses of different bourbons, at different prices... my buddy and I each got two different bourbon flights, and shared... you got to taste them side-by-side, an interesting experience. btw.... Longman and Eagle... I had to look up the name of the restaurant... seemed kind of a strange name...right? The column standing in the middle of Logan Square is the Illinois Centennial Monument. Designed by Henry Bacon and built in 1918 to celebrate Illinois' centennial (duh), the reliefs were carved by Evelyn Beatrice LONGMAN, and features an EAGLE at the top of the column. Get it... LONGMAN & EAGLE... (although I would guess Bacon and Eagle, while more appropriate sounds too foody, so LONGMAN makes more sense). Tada!
