I used Priceline to find an excellent deal for this hotel (one of their secret deals where they don't tell you who the hotel is until you pay for it.) The hotel is near a few different train stops (brown line is the closest) and within walking distance to shopping and food. The room itself was a normal size room, smallish bathroom and we had a great view of a partial wall and the indoor pool :) I will say, the water pressure in our bathroom was very low. The hotel bar has a fantastic view, and might be one of the best views I have seen in a hotel bar. The drink prices are on par for a hotel as are the room service prices. There is a short indoor walk to a small food court that included a McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts and their famous popcorn place (can't remember the name). Dunkin Donuts came in handy for our morning coffee. Overall an excellent deal and a nice place to stay.
