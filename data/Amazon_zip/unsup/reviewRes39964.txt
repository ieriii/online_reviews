I come here with my roommate for late night suppers when the mood strikes. The prices are reasonable and the food is authentic. The kalbi is great and so is the seafood pancake. We like to wash it down with a little plum wine. Service is a bit lacking sometimes (because they're so busy) but they are usually very friendly and cordial.
