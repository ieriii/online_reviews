Just got back from a Chicago trip and Hot Dougs was on our short list to try. We decided to stop by for lunch before the Cubs game and it was well worth it. Our group took a taxi from the Sax hotel and found a line of about 20 people outside around 11:15 am. It took us about 30 mins to get to the door and the line had grown to about 50 people. You're standing there making small talk with all the friendly customers around you while taxi after taxi pull up and drop off people. Doug was personally taking orders and very congenial. The food came out fast and the turnover at the tables works so dont worry about not having a place to sit. I personally had The Frankie. Then, we shared an alligator "Game of the Week", Paul Kelly, Curry Pork, and Antelope. Everything on it but relish. All great and worth another trip back next time we are in town. The Duck Fat fries (only available on Fridays and Saturdays)were the cherry on top. Crispy and tasty. I would rec coming before 12pm and bring cash since they dont accept credit. This place is a good one.
