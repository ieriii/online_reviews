Textures, saltiness, spice, and oooey gooey goodness. That pretty much sums up my delightful experience at Graham Elliot's. Would I come here again to drop $400 for two people on the Collection tasting? Probably, for a special occasion though ;) I thankfully received a mini menu of what my hubby and I experienced and it even said happy anniversary on it, so sweet!  In general, plating was phenomenal. It was almost a sin to eat the food that was so meticulously put on a plate. Texture was unbelievable. There is always something melting, and crunching in your mouth all the time. The best items of the collection tasting were the following: Pumpkin Soup App - this soup literally hugged me all over. I would take this over butternut squash any day. it had the perfect amount of spices, cinnamon wasn't overbearing and the soup was so smooth. All of the entrees were fantastic, but what was really fantastic was the canape - the little treat from the chef prior to the seafood entrees, the introduction to the things that dreams are made of. we were served mussels in ale - YES, beer! OH MAN, this was a salty crunchy treat sent straight from heaven.  swordfish - this was cooked medium rare, almost to the point where I was scared to eat it, but thank goodness I did! The piece of fish just melted in my mouth. The chorizo paella gave it the perfect amount of spiciness and texture.  scallops - there is nothing bad i can ever say about perfectly cooked scallops. the little popover bread that it was served with was the cherry on top. The chocolate dessert was so freakin' good. There were so many intricate levels to it, crunchiness, sweetness, tartness, nubs ... oh nubs. I would totally come here again, to drop 400 again, it would have to be for a special occasion, but it would be definitely be on top of my list.
