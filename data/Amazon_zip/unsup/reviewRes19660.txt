First, Xoco gets 4 stars for having Bohemia. The nice Xoco employee that let me start drinking said Bohemia while I waited in line deserves 5 stars.  Folks, this place is goo-od. Me and the sis went here Friday afternoon and waited about 40 minutes in line but, oh, were we rewarded. I had the Cubano sandwich and she had somethign with pulled pork and they were delicous. We had churros for dessert and it was the perfect end to the meal - we were both very pleased. I'll definitely be back.
