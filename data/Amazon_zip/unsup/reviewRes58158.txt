Had brunch at this tapas restaurant yesterday and was really surprised what a bargain this place was. 8 small courses (including dessert) for $25 and an all you can drink bloody mary bar for another $8. I don't know how they make money doing this, but I was glad to be the beneficiary. Be warned the menu is set so you can't just order what you want, but that wasn't a negative in the least. All courses were fabulous though I did find the biscuits and gravy course a bit heavy. The bloody mary bar was great as well-- 3 types of tomato juices to choose from plus a load of mix-ins. Stellar place and a stellar deal.
