I love the cafe here. The tomato soup is the perfect antidote to the harsh Chicago winters. A bit pricey for such a casual atmosphere, but it must be the location. My favorite cafe items include the tomato soup, turkey/brie sandwich, and basically all of their desserts. The red velvet cake has captured my heart ages ago!
