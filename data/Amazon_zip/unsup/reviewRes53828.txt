Being vegetarian, it is SO important to me to eat tons of veggie dogs in the summer. I used to work a few blocks away & my co-workers & I would stop by on our lunch break almost every day. They have a cute little outdoor area to eat that's hidden from the street, which makes your eating experience way better than street-side. Everyone that works there is friendly & always smiling. I think the owner is taking orders pretty much six days a week, which I find SO respectable.Also the line around the block can seem daunting, but it goes by quickly, don't fret.
