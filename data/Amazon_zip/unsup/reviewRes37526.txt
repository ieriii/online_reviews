We used the catering service last week. The food was good but things seemed disorganized when I stopped by the pick up the food. It was not ready on time and when we got it to the event and unpacked it, the hummus was missing from the Mediterranean Platters. Going back or getting it delivered were not practical at that point so I ran to a local grocery store and left a voice mail message for Fox & Obel. Four days later, there has been no reply. It is not the worst error ever but for the money, I expect better service.
