First of all, I'm a devout fucking omnivore. I usually scoff at vegetarians/vegans, because to me the recent uprise of the meat-free movement just seems like another trend, another must-have accessory to the modern hipster's arsenal of pseudo-political beliefs. Chicago Diner, however, manages to impress even me. It was the first meat-free establishment I ever dined in, and I've been coming back ever since. I appreciate well-made, flavorful veg food for its health benefits, and they do not disappoint in that department. I've never had anything bad here, and only once did I have something that was "meh", which was the sweet potato quesadilla. It didn't have nearly enough cheese or spices, but it was still very much edible. Other items that I've had -- the reuben, mac 'n cheese, APPLE CIDER!, and nachos to name a few -- have been extremely tasty. The wait staff is really charismatic, hospitable and attentive, too, which is a nice plus. I feel like they wouldn't bare their teeth and hiss at me if I were to confide to them that I am secretly a fan of animal flesh. So while I still roll my eyes every time someone asks, "Is it veee-gan?" in a self-righteous drawl, I must confess that secretly I'm quite a fan of the cuisine, at least that which comes from here.
