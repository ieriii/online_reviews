If I were ever given to choice to choose between Hopleaf's Montreal-style brisket platter and a kick in the nuts, I'd take the kick in the nuts. I stopped at Hopleaf on my vacation to try out some of the microbrews and decided to stay for a meal. I ordered the Montreal-style brisket. The waitress brought to me a plate with macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, a pickle and a mound of fucking fat. I dug through my mound to see if some meat were hidden somewhere inside, but I couldn't find any. When the waitress came back and asked if everything was OK with our meals, I only had to say "well" and point to my plate and she immediately said, "Oh...that's just a huge mound of fucking fat!" I really wanted to order something else, but the waitress quickly snatched up my plate and went to the kitchen. She came back about a minute later with the same plate and the same mound of fucking fat and she also gave me another plate with some fresh cuts of fucking fat. So I ate my mac and cheese and my cole slaw. I dug through the mounds of fucking fat and found a few morsels of meat. I felt like I was at a crawfish boil where you burn more calories playing with your food than you get from eating it. I had never been so pissed off over a meal in my entire life. And this was my vacation, I was supposed to be enjoying myself. I'm guessing I should have said something again, but I'm not sure if I could handle a third plate of fat. 5 stars for the beer selection -4 stars for food and service
