i LOVE sushi x! i've been a long time customer of this place... ;) one thing i ALWAYS order at sushi x is their crab rangoon ROLL. not dumplings, they found a way to make crab rangoon into a roll! yummO!! if u don't like cream cheese in your sushi rolls, i suggest you stay away from this one because the roll is about half filled with cream cheese! yum.. i've tried almost everything on their regular menu and EVERYTHING is just that great. red dragon is perfect if you want something spicy. what i really like about this roll is that you get the best of two rolls: shrimp tempura and spicy tuna! wakamesu is always perfect before stuffing your face with sushi here. this place is byob and wait can get a little long. they let you drink what you bring before you sit and sometimes give you edamame for waiting so long~ how nice of them =) anyway, prices are moderate for sushi rolls. staff is friendly and always on point. place itself is clean and so is the bathroom. i've also ordered delivery from this place many times and each time, the sushi comes neatly packaged and in a timely manner. everyone must give this place at least one shot because trust me, you will always come back for more. :)
