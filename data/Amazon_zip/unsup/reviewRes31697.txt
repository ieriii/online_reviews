The Diner is the go to veggie place in Chicago. I think it's won national appeal because it's not a little bit greasier than the alternative Cousins Raw or Kayrn's Raw. The place feels like a diner, so be prepared to squeeze into your booth with ppl brushing up against you while you eat. The food is wonderful (favorite is the Nachos). Also make sure to save room for dessert as they are yummy. The prices are diner like so you can get a good meal under $10.
