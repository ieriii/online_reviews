I just went here with Windy City Pizza Club and it did not live up to my expectations. I've always heard what great pizza Piece had so I was excited to come here. The atmosphere was sort of blah. They sat us in the pit which reminded me of a cold basement. There was hardly any tables there so sitting there with a big group of people was difficult. The pizza selection that they had with different toppings was interesting. I had a BBQ chicken pizza with mashed potatoes on it. The crust was very thin and dry. I've definitely had better pizza elsewhere. The service was slow and unattentive. I understand that we had a larger crowd but you'd think that the waitress would've been more attentive as her tip would've been larger with us. To sum it up, if your looking for home made brews and pizza with interesting ingredient choices than Piece is your pie in the sky. Otherwise there are better places in the windy city to go for pizza!
