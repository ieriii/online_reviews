This place doesn't seem like it belongs in Chicago (especially located just steps from the living hell which is Mother's) . I'm from a rural community in Michigan and any time I step into q I feel like I'm instantly transported back home. A great place to grab a meal and a beer. the Kobe Brisket sandwich is heaven.
