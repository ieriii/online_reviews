I stayed in this hotel while attending a conference in McCormick Place West, and it was pretty nice. The location was very convenient, so after working a full day on the exhibit room floor, I could escape to my room pretty easily, just by walking over the bridgeway. There isn't much around it to do though, so if you're looking for more to do in the evening than stay in and watch TV, you should try for something further north. It is close to Chinatown, though you should drive there or take a cab. There's a patch of a bad neighborhood between McCormick Place and there, so walking is not a good choice. But the room was nice (mine had a little bonus living room area), room service was excellent (better than a Westin I stayed at a few days later), and everyone there was welcoming and friendly. There's an attached parking garage, with valet available, and you can easily get to downtown or down to 55 from there.
