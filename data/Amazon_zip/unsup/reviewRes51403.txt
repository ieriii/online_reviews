My all-time favorite Mexican Restaurant. Yes, I said all-time. I've even lived in Southern California for a couple of years and tried countless of Mexican restaurants, but none could beat my beloved Garcia's. My go-to dish is the steak chimichanga, which is basically a deep fried burrito topped with guacamole and sour cream. It's filling, cheap, and just can't be beat. Their chips and salsa are also solid.
