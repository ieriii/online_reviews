Fogo de Chao should be called Fogo de Wow. While this place is pricey, it's really worth it for the true Brazilian BBQ experience. The bacon wrapped filet mignon melted in my mouth. Each cut of beef and lamb was juicy and full of flavor well balanced! The sides dishes to clean your palate such as fried polentas, garlic mashed potatoes, baked bananas, and cheese bread are so yummy! The salad bar was plentiful and fresh. The drinks were quality. It's quite crowded on weekends but we were able to find seats and service was satisfactory for how busy they were on a saturday night. Even petite asian women like me who usually eat more veggies and pasta would appreciate this Meat-lovers place. Trust me, try it and love!
