First of all, this place has a great ambiance for both men and women. I am really tired of going to sushi restaurants with a cheesy decor or tried-and-true theme of bamboo, and oriental decor. This place sets a very nice tone that'll appeal to all groups. I came for lunch with a girlfriend who was visiting from out of town and wanted to go somewhere with a scene. While Sunda wasn't incredibly busy for a lunch "scene", we definitely had a great meal (she and I both ordered the petite lunch-special NY Japanese style steaks) for a great price. Their service was great but I'll definitely have to hit this place up for dinner sometime soon to see what else they have to offer.
