I still DREAM about the food from Lao Sze Chuan! The biggest pro-tip I can give you is to go with your friend, who is from Szechuan! My friend knew exactly what to order and we were so pleased. So here's what to order! All of which can in sum, be called "TASTY!" Non-spicy: Szechuan string beans (good garlic flavor to them) Seafood tofu soup (plain delicious) Spicy (but really not that spicy if you're used to spicy): Chef's Special Sole Fish Fillet with Tofu Chef's Special Dry Chili Chicken (I'm addicted to this...) Ma Po Tofu Stewed Eggplant Hometown Style Note that Szechuan spice is different from other spices in that it hits you hard upon first taste, and is a little sweet. However, this restaurant does an amazing job of bringing out different flavor profiles in the spices that veer more towards savory. As for ambiance, the chairs are a little uncomfortable because they are plastic, but I admire that they have the restaurant's logo on them. In addition, the second floor seating area is very cold, but the downstairs is too warm. Choose your temperature battle. They also have a full bar.
