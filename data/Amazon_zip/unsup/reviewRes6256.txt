All I have to say is Yummmmmm! I recommend getting a steak trio when you go here. When you order a trio you will have a list to choose from which your 3 small steak will be flavored with. A popular flavor is the horseradish, and I also like the Parmesan flavored steaks. If you like potato's then you definitely should try the twice baked potato's. They taste absolutely splendid. The potato's are large enough too if you would like to share it with a friend. Wildfire is a little bit pricey, but worth the money for the experience. Great date place too =)
