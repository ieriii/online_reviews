Brazzaz is delicious. Great atmosphere- sophisticated, both casual and dressy and business-type clientele. The salad bar is larger than other brazilian steakhouses with delicious offerings. I recommend the fresh oysters and salmon, but save room for the classic coulette. It's the best meat offering. The drinks are nice and they have a good wine menu. The desserts are fabulous, especially papaya ice cream and the passion fruit mousse. A bit pricey but they have half-price lunch deals. It's a pleasant environment and is never too crowded. There's also a nice bar if you are ever waiting. Valet is also not too expensive if you cannot find parking on the metered streets, which might be worth it to sit and eat a lot of meat.
