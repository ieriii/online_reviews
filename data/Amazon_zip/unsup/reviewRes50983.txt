i really wanted to like wishbone after hearing so many good things. also, i love the decor. it's so bright and cheery...especially on a gloomy and cold thursday night. however, i was pretty disappointed. my friend and i ordered the salmon cakes, black bean cakes, cheesy grits, mashed sweet potatoes, sauteed spinach, and collard greens. it sounds like a lot of food, right? meh, not really. the serving of sweet potatoes was really small...maybe a few tablespoons worth? they looked kind of sad and lonely on the big platter. the collard greens & cheesy grits were standard; everything i'd come to expect from each side. the spinach, however, was AWFUL. how can someone mess up sauteed spinach, you ask? throw a gallon of salt over them, that's how. my face actually puckered from eating the spinach. it was way too salty and kind of ruined the rest of the meal for me since i couldn't get that taste out of my mouth. the salmon cakes were good...small, moist and salmon-y, as i would expect. the black bean cakes were small and dry...which is not what i expected. the mango salsa on top helped with the dryness, but condiments aren't supposed to "fix" food...it should enhance it.  now, perhaps i ordered the wrong menu items...their breakfast menu looked delicious and i might go back to give that a whirl...but i'd steer clear of the "cakes" and the dinner sides. with all of the negative things i reported in this review...i do have to say that we had the best waiter. he was attentive, friendly, and bumped this review from 1.5 stars to 2 stars.
