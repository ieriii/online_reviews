This place offers a delicious and unique breakfast entrees. i am use to the suburban greek style pancake houses but this place offers an unique twist. I tried the breakfast burrito which reminds of the ones served at cafe's on California beaches. My friend ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes which were real good but more of an dessert.  Service was overall satisfactory for getting there before closing time.
