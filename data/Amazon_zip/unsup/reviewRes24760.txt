don't get me wrong, i love irazu. especially as a summertime spot. but i want to point out: if you order a shake with soy rather than milk, they not only charge you more (fine, this is typical) but they also give you a smaller portion. an oatmeal soy shake costs more and comes in a smaller glass than an oatmeal milk shake. when i asked the (very nice) server about this discrepancy, he told me it was because i'd get sick if i drank that much soy. actually, sir, i personally would get sick if i drank that much milk. let me be the judge of such things. that said, i could kill some of their patacones right about now....
