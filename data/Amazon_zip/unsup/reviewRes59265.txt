This is a great place for Roast Duck/Peking Duck 3 Ways. I call for a reservation, specify the duck, and it's always been there. Only Duck Chang's in Annandale, Va beats Sun Wah, and Sun Wah beats every other Roast Duck I've had in SF, NYC, DC area, and Toronto. (I just wish they did 4 Ways.)Sun Wah's approach is a bit different - they serve buns instead of pancakes, and the vegie dish is fried rice with duck. The soup could be richer. OTOH, they get more meat from the duck than other places.They still haven't got the service part down pat, but they seem to be improving, but the duck makes any glitches worth the wait. Don't go for an elegant meal - go when you want good food.
