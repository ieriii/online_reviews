Favorite. Sandwiches. Of. All. Time. Irazu's sandwiches have lizano sauce, which is made from the dreams of the gods, apparently. Maybe the secret ingredient is heroin or something. I don't care, I am addicted to it. This place makes me regret moving out of Chicago.  Some people think the entres are pricey. These people are dumb, because they should have gotten a sandwich. The sandwiches are far under priced for what you're getting: HAPPINESS. Also, try the oatmeal shake. Surprisingly delicious!
