I can never tire of this colorful sumptuous place. The ceviche is tangy and balanced with the freshest of fish. The sauces are always deeply intriguing. How can you resist the blood orange margaritas, even if they kill you at $12 a pop. We had sopas with braised beef and goat taquitos that were a great counter to the bright ceviche.
