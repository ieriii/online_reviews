Stayed here recently for a trip to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary and the Fourth of July. I'm going to say that, dollar for dollar, this is the nicest hotel I've stayed at in recent memory. Ended up paying around $130 a night with taxes for a room on the 21st floor with an amazing view looking North out to Lake Michigan. Room was very comfortable, loved the bathrooms, spacious, bed was perfect, and the furnishings were stylish. Only a few minor complaints - could hear people/thumpings/etc. through the walls at night, didn't really bother me but it did the Mrs. Location here is great - red line subway a few blocks away, and all sorts of pricey shopping if you're into that sort of thing. Bar scene at night was bustling, though I wouldn't recommend many of the bars, unless you want to rub elbows with graphic t-shirt douchebags. Gibson's steakhouse across the street was really solid, and there are some good quick places to grab breakfast if you don't feel like springing for room service.  Just like all the reviews have noted, the staff here was incredibly helpful and polite. They helped us book a river cruise and answered numerous other dumb tourist questions. When I made my reservation a few months prior, I explained it was for our anniversary - and upon our arrival we received a personalized note from the manager and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries. Obviously, the Chicago hotel market is very competitive, and this place understands that guests appreciate a staff willing to go the extra mile.  Again, I've been at nicer hotels, but if you are into value, I don't think you can beat Sutton Place.
