A collection of some of the world's finest beers under one roof. Beer is religion at Hopleaf. Everything is served in the appropriate glass at the appropriate temperature, by an extremely knowledgeable staff. Food is great too. If not the best, the second best Mussels in Chicago. And the frites...oh man, the frites.. The menu is not health conscious, but hearty, flavorful fare. This is not a typical bar / restaurant. It is iconic in its selection and menu, and while it may not generate 4 star reviews, it is a 'must not miss' in Chicago.
