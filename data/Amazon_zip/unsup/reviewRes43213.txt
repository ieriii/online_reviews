sooo there were a many things on the menu that i wanted to get! I finally narrowed it down to the house-made granola, vanilla yogurt and fresh fruit and the whole wheat wrap with hummus, feta, spinach, grilled eggplant, pickled red onion (without the red onion). I chose the wrap... I think i should have gone with the granola. I don't want to give milk and honey a bad review because i made a bad choice. I loved the atmosphere, eating outside on the sidewalk, and self service, get your own drinks dealio. I did not love the grilled eggplant. it was slimy.  i will go back.
