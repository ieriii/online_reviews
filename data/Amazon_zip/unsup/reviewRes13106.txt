We waited about 15 minutes for our server. Appears as though they don't have one or two servers dedicated to the patio but apparatus every server takes a table or two which seems terribly inefficient in identifying new patrons. Bus boy went past 3 times without getting our serve so clearly they need a new system... Clam chowder was pretty good. Blackened catfish po boy was good and so was the seafood streudel. The clam chowder was the only thing that I'd come back for. Good patio but a little loud with the train and montrose traffic.
