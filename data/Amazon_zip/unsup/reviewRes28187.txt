Every time we've headed to Pilsen on the weekend, we've stopped by Nuevo Leon and there's always a line and we've headed off to find something else but we tried it one Tuesday evening, no lines and no trouble parking, there was a spot right in front. 2nd visit was on Labor Day Monday, there was a line through the restaurant but we were seated almost immediately, the service and turnover here is very quick. The interior is very casual, none of that hoity toity downtown Chicago gourmet Mexican food or atmosphere here. And none of that downtown hoity toity pricing either, we were stunned when the bill came and the damage was only $44 for 5 people including tax! ***Cash only, BYOB*** No hoity toity artfully designed, how much are those three nacho chips, small plate dishes either, the portions are enormous and the prices low. Before we saw the size of the dishes, we ordered a couple of appetizers, queso con chorizo ($8), Chihuahua cheese with onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, homemade mexican sausage and fresh flour tortilla chips and Nachos Dias ($3.50), quesadilla halves with ranchero sauce, sour cream and guacamole. Even with 5 of us eating them, we were almost full after we ate them. And we still had main courses coming!!! I ordered enchiladas suizas ($6.00), 3 corn tortillas with a choice of sauce filled with ground beef or chicken, topped with cheese with rice and beans. 2nd visit I had a combinacion plate with a tamale, enchilada, tostado and taco, all of it good.
