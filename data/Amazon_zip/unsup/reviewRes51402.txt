Garcia's food is slightly above average - but the amount of food you get for the price is priceless. Oh and be warned, if you go on around seven (with or without reservations) on a Saturday night... you'll probably have to wait for a table. I planned my friend's bachelorette dinner here. For eight of us to eat the bill came to $75 with drinks, a twenty percent tip and yes, dinner. Everyone was pleased and some went home with doggie bags. For me, the vegetarian burrito with avocado hit the spot. You can't argue decent food with bottom-line prices!
