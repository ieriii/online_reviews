Most of the food here is average. The mussels are awful - very fishy. I do recommend the fondue though. They have a minimalist roof deck so that is a plus. The inside is woody and foresty which I think removes the Euro chic attitude from here. The crowd is upscale and overall well-mannered. The staff is very polite and accommodating. Just an FYI, the bathroom doors slide and don't swing. I waited outside them for ten minutes thinking they were locked. Don't be the fool I was!!!
