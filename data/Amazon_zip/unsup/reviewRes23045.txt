Every time I go here, I end up with a huge belly ache, which is completely my own fault - I order too much 'cause everything's so good.  The menu's great for vegetarians, and, actually, it's great for meat-eaters too. If you have out-of-town guests who fall into one of those groups, bring them here, and they will be totally impressed with Chicago. My favorites: the palmito salad, the ceviche, the plantains (even better if you get them double-fried in garlic oil, obviously) and basically all the sandwiches. Actually, just order whatever you want - it's probably really good.
