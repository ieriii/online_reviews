Well it was freezing cold (around 20 degrees that day not to mention the windchill) and a line wrapped around the building. Guess my cousin and I weren't the only crazy ones. Thankfully the line moved quickly. When we entered, there were a ton of signatures from famous celebrities, average joes, you name it, all tagged on the wall. Pretty cool atmosphere. My cousin and I went for the original deep dish and that is what we got. Our server was pretty cool easy to talk to and very attentive. Our food arrived quickly. I was surprised the pizza wasn't the best I've ever had, but I'm in it for the whole experience and don't regret coming. The crust just wasn't my style, sauce was great on the other hand. Would I eat here again? You betcha.
