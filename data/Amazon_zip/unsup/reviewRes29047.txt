To say that the expectations for here were high is a bit of an understatement. Lots of raves from friends and it being included in the michelin bib gourmand list, I was due for a showdown with Opart. I ordered up some shrimp dumplings,pad lard na with chicken, and Pad Kra Praow Lard Khao with beef. The shrimp dumplings were extremely good and the soy sauce that was with them added even more. The pad lard na was tremendous. The noodles alone were worth it as they just seemed to melt in your mouth and there was a great savory sauce that went with it. The beef and rice was very very very spicy. In fact it was so spicy that it even caught me off guard a bit but was very good once I adjusted to it. I ordered it for pickup and it was done in about 20 minutes. There is a good amount of food in each dish, but you aren't feeling too stuffed afterward. I can't wait to come back here repeatedly to try as much as possible on the menu
