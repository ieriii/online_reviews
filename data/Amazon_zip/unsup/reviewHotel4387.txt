Shhhhwanky. As I type this review, I am sitting in my room at the Palmer House Hilton. I am in Chicago on business, and found this hotel after checking hhonors because the W (the preferred hotel in Chicago) was sold out.  Overall, the room is very nice, albeit very small (on the 13th floor). The lobby is huge, and reminds me a lot of the Westin St. Francis or the Sir Francis Drake back in SF. It has that "blue hair appeal" that makes a 28 year old feel a bit out of place. If you're into flirting with GILF's or something, this place is a goldmine. The hotel staff are polite and helpful. The bathroom is the size of an iphone, at least the one in my room is. If you stay here, ask for the state/adams side rather than the monroe/wabash side so you don't have to listen to the L trains every few mins. This side is much quieter. I'd stay here again (especially with the double points hhonors promo), but this definitely isn't my favorite hotel on earth. Its a clean, nice, and moderately opulent hotel suitable for its 250/night price.
