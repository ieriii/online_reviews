This is my all time favorite restaurant whenever I go to Chicago. I used to travel to Chicago for work every week. Through out the week, sometimes I have 3 of the nights just went there for dinner after worked. I never have anything bad that I ordered / tried something new. I loved their red snapper (be careful with the bone) and Com Chien (House fried rice). This place is always packed with people, especially during the summer time.
