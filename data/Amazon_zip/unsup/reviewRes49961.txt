Went here on a Saturday evening and loved every minute of it. We started with empanada combo and I have to say they were the best I've ever had. Finished off the night with the Entrana skirt steak and it was also amazing. I'd of given 5 stars but to be honest the sides left a little to be desired. The yuca and the potato were both a little dry, and the plantain was, well, it was plantain. I'd go back for the empanadas alone.
