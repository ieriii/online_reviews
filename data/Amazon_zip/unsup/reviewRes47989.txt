I went here with my friend Bianca who is a publicist for Sony and my friend Natalie to visit my Swedish friend Jonas who was in grad school at the University of Chicago. Bianca found this restaurant for us in GQ - yes we're obsessed - and it was on point. The decor is wonderful - kinda like a backyard picnic and the waiters are all dressed in gingham. So cute! The booths are awesome too - they enclose you so you feel like you are in a private boat haha! We ordered some oysters and a bunch of other stuff - everything was delectable. We got the duck and aged ham. Ugh soo good! If you are ever in Chi-town please do yourself a favor and come here!
