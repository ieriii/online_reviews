As good as it gets does not even remotely express how amazing our experience was at this restaurant. First of all...the decor of this venue is brilliant, from the lively colored lamps to the tantalizing photos filling up each wall. I almost tripped over myself several times while trying to walk down the hallway because I was eying the snapshots. Bravo to the person responsible for the interior design of this place! The staff was very accommodating, we were walk ins on a fully booked night and didn't have to wait at all for a table. We then received a personal tour of this magnificent labyrinth from a manager that noticed us poking around. Did I mention I'm in love with this place?! Because I am...and that's not even including the food...oh the food was sooooooooooooo amazing. We started with some Spanish chorizo and Manchengo cheese, followed by ropa vieja (deeeelicious!). For the entrees my fiance had the churasco , which was a melt in your mouth perfectly charred on the outside orgasm in your mouth. I had the Spanish white fish and seafood stew special, which was mind blowing as well. Everything was cooked to perfection! We've had our fair share of fine dining fish and filets, but this was hands down the best I've ever had. The cherry on top was the gigantic 3 layered ice cream cake we got for dessert...guava, mango and pistachio with chocolate ganache. Might not sound like a great combination, that's what we initially thought but we were intrigued...it was a masterpiece. We honestly ate every single thing we ordered from start to finish without missing a beat, and the topic of discussion for the evening centered around how mouth watering every bite was! So much so that I felt compelled to write this review. I do not have one single bad thing to write about this place. Absolute perfection.
