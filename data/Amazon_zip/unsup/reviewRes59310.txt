This place is one of my all-time favorites. It has a wonderful atmosphere and the service is really great. The staffs here are always super nice. You can't go wrong here, whether you order sushi or Thai. Now they offer good wine selection. Last time I tried ginger martini, perfect! my friend love asian mojito. It's also BYOB with very small corkage fee $1.25.
