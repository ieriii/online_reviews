LOVE it. The atmosphere is modern understated and lively. The service is pretty good. But the FOOD. The food is out of this world delicious, inventive, surprising. The wine list is pretty great too. I have been here a few times for romantic dates and for business/social meals and it works in both cases. This is the kind of place you go to try something you won't see on a menu anywhere else. The combinations and complexity of flavors are creative and they always seem to work beautifully. Not to mention the truffle popcorn they start you out with is to die for! It's not cheap, so make it a special occasion, but man is it worth it! Probably the best part of it: you can go have 5 star creative food and wear jeans. Amazing.
