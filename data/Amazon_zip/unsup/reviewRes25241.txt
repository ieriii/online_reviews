After eating here twice I was surprised to see bad reviews on yelp. I've had nothing but great experiences at this restaurant. Compared to other fondue places, you get a lot for the $50 premiere dinners: cheese fondue, seafood and beef for the main course, and the best part...chocolate fondue for dessert. Nice cozy atmosphere for a date night...I don't have anything bad to say about a restaurant where I can roast my own marshmallows before dipping them in chocolate and covering them with graham cracker crumbs.
