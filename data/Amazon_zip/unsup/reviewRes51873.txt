What kind of yelper would I be if I traveled to Chicago without trying out the famous deep-dish Chicago-style pizza?? With a group of four, we ordered two pizzas: the vegetarian pizza with no cheese (since my friend is vegan) and the spicy sausage pizza.  First of all... deep dish pizza that I had was nothing like I imagined. It was so much better! I had the misconception that the crust would be super fluffy like those bread cheese sticks. Luckily for me, I was wrong because I hate those hand-tossed pizza crust. For those who still haven't had a deep dish pizza, the crust resembles a pie crust. Delicious.  Secondly, if you are like my friend and are vegan -- please save your money and don't go here. You will be spending $20 for a very plain pie with nothing but marinara sauce... The spicy sausage pizza is a must try though! The sauce on it was perfectly seasoned with hot, melted cheese, topped with spicy sausages. The spicy sausage flavor definitely overpowered the pie.  The restaurant also felt very cozy... maybe it was because the writings on the wall reminded me of Buca de Bepo. Our waiter was not very polite, so minus one point. Other than that... this place is a must-try.  I'm no pizza connoisseur, but here is my rating for pizzas I've had thus far: 1.Pizza in Italy 2. Chicago Pizza 3.New York Pizza. Cheers!
