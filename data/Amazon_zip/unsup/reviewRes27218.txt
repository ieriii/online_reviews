HOLY CHORIZO! This place is the stuff... And when I say that I mean you are going to be stuffed. It have been a while since I have been to a Mexican restaurant and this place fit the bill. I was sipping on my just slightly chilled Lime Jarrito and spooning bits of chicken soup that comes with every meal. You could say that my stomach was cutting backflips, because I was stuffing my face with enchiladas, beans, rice, tortillas, and sampling their delicious salsas. I have to especially note the options of Mole on the enchiladas... go green. You may find yourself undoing that top button on your pants and smiling with satiety. I think that I got TOO MUCH food for the buck... I don't think that I have ever said that... but lets hope the owners don't yelp and find me out. I was dreaming about leftovers with a full stomach. I will be back! There was a long line to be seated, but the wait wasn't so bad and food arrived expediently. If you take a neighborhood tour, you should definitely stop by this place.
