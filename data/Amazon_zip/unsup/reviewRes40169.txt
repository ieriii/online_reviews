We were there yesterday for lunch, wife, her sister and I. wonderful pork belly BLT (no tomato....but what the hell!) it was gorgeous. Tonight, food excellent waiter probably new...needs to back off a litte. I 'have' been before...and I 'can' read the menu :) and one last little thing....shortbread should be shortbread and not salty biscuit (a la Americana)....but my wife loved it. note: 5/5 and comments because I WILL be back and i'd like to nudge you in the right (MY) direction.
