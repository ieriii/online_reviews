The space is beautiful. However, I found the food to be mediocre at best, and the service was a bit on the pretentious side for me.  I was at Wilde's with some friends for an event, and we decided we would like to stay and check out the food. The hostess was quite snooty about seating us because they were so busy. Being in the business I am pretty laid back and understaning about these things and did not appreciate being treated like I was an idiot. When we did meet our server he was clueless. The food was so average it is not really worth commenting on and we left wishing we had enjoyed our dinner somewhere else.
