We went the day after Rick Bayless won Top Chef Masters which was exciting because we saw the guy that helped him on the last episode! Ok, geek out over. Showed up at 4:30 since they open at 5 and there were maybe 6 tables of people ahead of us. They dont start seating until 5:30ish and we didnt get a seat until close to 6:30 which was annoying because I had to get to work, yeah I know, lame anniversary, but it was also good because we had a few of their margaritas which were very tasty!! You know a place is good if they take the time to make sure their drinks are well made and well thought out. Our waiter was super nice and very into the food, he checked in on us the perfect amount of times, never interrupted our conversation to do so. It was like *gasp* he was paying attention to his tables even when he didnt just happen to be in the area. App: Taquitos and Queso --- YUMMMM Entree: Strip steak marinated in serrano, really nice flavors it wasnt as spicy hot as I expected but it was seasoned so well. It came with these 2 little tamales that were absolutely delicious. BF had the enchiladas with the mole sauce and he was very happy with his choice. Desert: Goat milk ice cream, a scoop of passion fruit and one just milk? I don't remember the details because we were 4 margaritas in at this point :-) but the light feeling and fresh flavors were the perfect ending. All in all the meal was flavorful in ways I couldn't have imagined. Sweet, spicy smokey, fresh -- wonderful!! Definitely check it out but make a reservation or expect to wait a while which it is totally worth!
