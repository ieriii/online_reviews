Simply It = Simply Outstanding!! Went here for the GNO last night and everything about the experience was just perfect. The company, the food, the service - all stellar!!  I'll start with the food. Every single thing I ate was delicious (and I ate a lot!) My favorites were the vietnamese spring rolls, the shrimp papaya salad, and the lemongrass chicken. Everything was fresh, hot, and presented beautifully.  The veggies were all cooked yet perfectly crisp - difficult to do but wonderful when done well! If you're really into presentation, I highly recommend the pineapple calamari (really I recommend it in any event - yum yum!!). The fried bananas at dessert were heavenly! Where this restaurant really stood out for me, however, was the service. We were a group of 25 people, which is tough for any small restaurant. Even tougher when they were only expecting 20. They were so gracious, enthusiastic even, about adding extra tables and seats to our already huge table and bringing out food for people who had missed the appetizers. Water glasses were never empty and wine bottles magically opened all across the table (BYOB FYI). Also, the servers gave great explanations of the foods and the different sauces - without even being asked! As for the company, well, I think it goes without saying that 25 yelpettes would be the best!! I will definitely be coming here again next time I'm in the neighborhood. 5-stars indeed!!
