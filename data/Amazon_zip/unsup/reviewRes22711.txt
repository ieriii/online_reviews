Great place. It is big, much bigger than it looks. I'll start with the end - dessert! What a great tiramisu-that's-not-called-tiramisu! My date and I both had lamb chops, which were amazing and under $20. AND! I had my very first experience with flaming cheese. And trust me, it was flaming. What a great experience - the waitstaff even reseated us when my date was unhappy about our original table!
