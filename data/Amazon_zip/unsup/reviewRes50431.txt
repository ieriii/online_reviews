Service: Excellent Bathrooms: Spotless Atmosphere: Narrow, Felt country-ish Food: Above Average Maybe I was having an off night! I genuinely liked this place. I thought the menu could be a little more extensive. I would have liked to see an Etoufee or Jambalaya. Cornbread was excellent, Shrimp and Grits was good not great! Chicken Salad left much to be desired.
