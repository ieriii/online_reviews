We had spent 8 days and 7 nights here at this very peaceful, courteous and tranquil hotel and would probably come back to it the next time we're in town. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wanted a nice mix of people watching but a nice quiet bed to lay their head down on afterwards. Located right by Morton's, Carmine's and Jilly's, it's the perfect place to grab a martini, a nice meal and watch people pass by under the canopies. The staff here are tremendously friendly and really go out of their way to accommodate you. The first night I went on a frantic search looking for the ice machine which I'm used to be in a private room in the corner but after a walk up and down the hall, I finally called the front desk inquiring where such a thing was. Apparently, they really value their quiet here at Sutton Place and room service brings up anything you need at any hour. That a little odd to me but I did notice there was a lack of drunken loud parties, walls thumping and loud music in general which was a plus. The room was comfortable, spacious, had a great view and it was easy to sleep like a baby here. The king size bed was like that of fairy tales and the goose down pillows literally cradled my head. Mmmmm...10 hours of sleep. The bathroom was spacious, full of wonderful bath gels and just right for the business traveler or the leisurely weekend getaway. I'll admit that I'm more of a fan of the Fairmont but it was still lovely for what I consider a boutique hotel.
