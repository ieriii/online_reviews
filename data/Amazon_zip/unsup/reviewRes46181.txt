**get the lunch specials** I went here with a friend a couple months ago when I was in town. We were strolling down Michigan ave and thought to treat ourselves for a nice lunch. We went around 2pm...and were seated promptly. The lunch portions were surprisingly massive. I had the Caesar salad + pasta promodora combo. The restaurant is beautiful. Try getting a table by the window-- its a nice place to people watch on the magnificent mile. note: dont get the double stuffed potato rolls-- not very healthy.     but....do try the roasted pinapple upside down cake. :) can never     go wrong with dessert at a fancy spot.
