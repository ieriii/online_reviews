I'd love to rant...or rave, about XOCO. Really I would. I was so so soooo excited to finally be off and available to get downtown in the morning so I could try the fresh churros and thick hot chocolate I've heard so much about. Friday night I checked out the website for XOCO, got all the details I needed (open at 8a, breakfast served til 10:30a, check). We got downtown saturday morning about 9a, found parking right away. Paid the stupid parking box $5, walked across the street only to find XOCO dark, empty, and locked. With a small paper sign taped to the door stating they'd be closed from Jan. 1-11th. uuummm...woulda maybe been nice information to PUT ON YOUR WEBSITE! Damnit. So, having already paid for parking downtown, we wandered around til eventually grabbing sausage biscuits and hot chocolate from the Rock n Roll McDonalds down the street. Under $10 for my "meal" and it was no wait, great view, and the McDonalds Hot Chocolate did me just fine. Pfff. Rick Bayless, that's a big ol' FAIL to start out the new year. UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE!!!
