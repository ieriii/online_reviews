I went here before for breakfast and was impressed, but just had lunch there and now I am a fan! Dan picked me up from work and we decided to leave the loop and head west into Greek town. I went to Meli before and enjoyed the food , so I thought.. lets go there! Parking was a little bit of a nightmare, but we parked on Jackson further east. The place isn't big, and I was short on time, but we must have had luck because our buzzer went off in less than a minute of getting it. The hosts were in suits and the waitstaff in all black, but the dining room was yellow and bright with pictures of cafes and flowers. Our table was close to the Juice Bar/Espresso Bar and the selections made my mouth water. They had wheat grass and different fresh squeezed juices coming from the barista/juice bar station. I was checking out people's meals and that made it even harder to decide on what to get. A Salad or a Sandwich? OH the Dilemma!!! Dan went with the No name wrap.. seriously it is called no name. I went with the Meil's Chicken sandwich because I was in the mood for bread! We had a choice of fries, chips, or pasta salad, but for additional fee you can get tomatoes or fruit cup. Dan and I both ordered the fries. 5-10 minutes later, our food was at our table! The plating was fantastic and made a simple lunch feel luxurious. I cut the sandwich in half since it was pretty big and took a bite. My mouth had a food orgasm! The sandwich was amazing! Chicken in a honey glaze, avocado, grilled wheat bread, Swiss cheese, and tomato was the Chicken Meli. I added some Dijon mustard to make the sandwich just pop! The fries were very tasty and had a good flavor. I took a bite of Dan's non name and in my head thought I had the better sandwich! woo me! I did see some fantastic looking crepe with strawberries and chocolate going to a table across from us and that is making me want to come back! Meli is a smaller place but the food is worth the wait!
