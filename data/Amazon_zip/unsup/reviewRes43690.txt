I've only ever been here for lunches, and business lunches at that. But for a business lunch, this is a perfect venue. For a business lunch, I'd say 75% of decision should be venue/atmosphere-based, and 25% food-based. It's what's happening, not what's being eaten, that matters. Though you don't want your client or your boss or partner sending something back for that matter. Ok, maybe its 70/30 or perhaps even 60/40. But in terms of atmosphere, Kinzie Chophouse is a 5-star for a business lunch. It's quiet, so you can conduct business without shooting across the table, but its not so silent that you have to worry about wandering ears picking up bits and pieces. When you walk in, it just smells business. A suited-up crowd, mostly older men with briefcases. And the waitstaff is well-aware that is the type of crowd they are dealing with, so they are attentive without being overly so. I've never had the awkward interruption of a waiter during a discussion. In essence, they make themselves non-existent while still getting you your food and drinks. Perfect. And the menu has tons of options to suit all types of diets. Even my vegetarian friends could find options here. Most people (dear god I hope not at least) don't come to lunch and order the bone-in fillet, so they have an array of sandwiches and pastas, salads and burgers. The steak risotto is tasty, if not a tad bit heavy for my liking. The portobello mushroom burger is solid, and I've had virtually every salad they have to offer. I'm not sure I'd venture here for dinner or non-business related stuff--a bit too stuffy and formal for my tastes. But for all things business, this is your spot.
