The best eats in Chicago (Sorry, Charlie Trotter). Those of us who waited forever for Doug to re-open are not disappointed. Doug's culinary combinations are spot-on. I have never had a bad meal here. I even got one of the last foie gras laced offerings (Quack, Quack, or is it Honk, Honk). This stuff is what carnivores were made for. Doug, don't change a thing. Please don't franchise, sell out, expand or change the decor. Your public needs you behind the counter.
