SUPER DAWG ... SUPER GOOD! This was my first Chicago Style Hot Dog and I didn't think I would be a fan of all the fixin's, but I was. It was fantastic. The perfectly sized poppy seed bun fit in all the fabulous toppings without loosing a single bite of that goodness. I rolled out of the drive-in stuffed to the brim. Thanks Maurie and Flaurie!
