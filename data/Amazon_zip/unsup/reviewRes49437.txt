Great cheese and wine selections - get a flight or two and really learn what you like! Prices allow for sampling/sharing - and it's a good way to go for both food and vino. I generally do appetizers or sides here to accompany the wines as snacks and have always been pleased with the food. Cheeses are fresh and the array of offerings really is astounding. Wines are reasonably priced, so do go and experiment. Service has always been pleasant on my visits, and I would go again when I am in Chicago. This is the kind of place that can lead to wine epiphanies, so it gets 4 stars for that alone. How often can you try 4 Champagnes?
