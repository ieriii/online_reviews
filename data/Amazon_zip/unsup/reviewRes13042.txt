Amazing...This was my first time, and our server Rick was very attentive and helpful. I'm sure by reading some of the other review's here this goes without saying but come with a HUGE appetite because there is so much to eat, and as soon as you turn that card it is on!! Highly recommend pacing yourself as well this was my down fall, just kept shoveling it all in and I filled up quick.. Can't remember what its called, but there signature meat was the best, I can't stop thinking about it...Very fun atmosphere all you can eat meat, attentive staff, I don't think it gets better.
