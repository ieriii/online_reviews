This place is amazing! I decided to get a room when a group of my friends came to visit. I'd paid for a regular room that was designed to accommodate three people in separate beds (two doubles and a rollaway). When I arrived to check in, they told me that my room would not accommodate three people in three bed, but no problem -- they'd upgrade me to an apartment room. Woo hoo! I was even given a complimentary drink from the Primehouse menu while I waited for them to make up the new room. The "apartment" was perfect. We had a dining area, a separate lounge area, a large bar with an iPod dock and speakers and a great sleeping area. The decor is ultra modern, but it manages to still feel warm, luxurious and comfortable. The staff was generous and worked hard to make us feel welcome. The concierge was very helpful and managed to get us on the guest list at Reserve on extremely short notice. We were also given special passes to skip the line at J Bar, but we didn't have time to use those. We were generally made to feel like royalty the entire time we were there. I was actually kinda sad when it was time to go home :) All in all, the experience cost me a small fortune, but for our once-a-year girls' weekend barhopping extravaganza, it was definitely worth it.
