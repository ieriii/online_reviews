Twice within a week.. By choice? Somewhat. Been here many times before? Yes. During the Week: 1st Time: Craving Steak at 11pm after "House of Walker." Steakhouses are closed, so Korean BBQ is as good as it gets. 2nd Time: Birthday Dinner on a Saturday at 7pm. There are better options for Korean food in the City. The food is average and nothing special. What's especially great about them is their hours and the amount of side dishes that they have. Their Maki is actually pretty decent, even though it's only a California Roll. If you would like to save while eating a variation of food you can't go wrong with Combo 1 at $19.95. Service: A mixed review. Some waitresses are mean and a select few are very nice.
