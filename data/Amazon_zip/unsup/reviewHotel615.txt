I wanted to steal the pillows. The best pillows of any hotel I have stayed in to date. I think they have a site where one can order them. I have to check it out.  The service was excellent from every person I encountered in the hotel and even from the Einstein's bagel shop which is, oh so conveniently, located in the lobby. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. The bathroom was large and the shower provided instant hot water. There was a nice window seat. Room service was prompt and the food was good. Beware: the stuffed burger feeds two and will put you in a coma. I did not give all 5 stars, as I did not check out the gym,, the restaurant, etc. The room I had was one of those doubles that has a door leading to the next room: not sound proof. So, I had to endure an argument of the couple next door. I let them get it out, and it quieted down nicely.
