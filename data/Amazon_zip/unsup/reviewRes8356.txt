Although I'd heard raves about the pizza, I had no idea how cute the restaurant would be. Spacca Napoli is tucked away in the middle of the neighborhood, with a buzzing patio area. We sat inside so we could avoid the wait and it was just as nice. Our table was actually right next to the open kitchen so I spent most of my meal watching all of the pizzas being made. Yum. We tried one of the specials, the Tre Pomodori, a red pizza with yellow and red cherry tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, and kalamata olives, and one of the menu items, Bianca con Bufala e Rucola, a white pizza with mozzarella, olive oil, and arugula. Two good choices and so different that I couldn't pick a favorite. The first was light and tomatoey while the latter was heavy on cheese (always a good thing when it's buffalo mozzarella) with the bitterness of the greens. The crust was delicious as well! We saved room for dessert which was a good idea. Seriously, I had trouble narrowing down a selection from the dessert menu - everything looked amazing. I settled for the pistachio gelato which was incrediblly good, but more like an ice cream than a gelato (complete with nuts). I also got to try a bite of the tiramisu (yum) and the tartufo (wow!).  I will definitely be back as there are a few more pizzas I want to try...and maybe that baked ricotta dessert.
