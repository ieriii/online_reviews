I was visiting Chicago and tried this place out as it was close to the hotel. The food was below average. There were flies flying around the table. The rice, which costs extra, was poorly cooked (how can you mess up rice?). $5.00 gets you a 4 ounce Mango Lasse - yeah. We asked the waitor to make the food mild for our children. Well, the food came out spicy and they couldn't anything except the Naan. The portions were very small, and the prices were way too high. We had 1 meat dish, and two vegetarian dishes, rice, and 1 mango lasse and our total bill (which included an automatic gratuity) was $75.00 Crazy! Go somewhere else....please.
