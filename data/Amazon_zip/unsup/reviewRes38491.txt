A recommendation from a local to us tourists. Their beer menu is absolutely ridiculous, especially if you're into trying every Belgian beer in existence. For what was essentially a neighborhood bar that has tables and a two page menu, the food was impressive. It's really hard to go wrong with a sausage platter, which was the best dish of the night. The mains weren't nearly as memorable, but that might be due to the numerous high ABV beers I'd had. All the patrons seemed local and considering it was after dark on a Monday night, I'm surprised at how packed the place was. I have no idea if Hopleaf is a typical Chicago neighborhood eatery, but I think it speaks well for the city.
