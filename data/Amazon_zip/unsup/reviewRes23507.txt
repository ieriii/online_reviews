Exceeded all of my expectations. I ate here on a summer Sunday evening. Of course there was a short wait... 20 minutes or so. During the wait, the owner came out and proceeded to play some Chinese drum, which was mildly entertaining during our wait. At least they tried. Everyone seems to complain about the service here. I had great service. They repeated every item I ordered to ensure they got it right. They made sure everything was prepared to my liking. We had the Chili Chicken, the Mongolian Beef, and Vegetable Fried Noodles. Every one of these dishes was perfect and delicious. The chili Chicken was spicy. The chicken was like Fried Chicken- and I love fried Chicken. Everything was great at this place. I would easily place this as the best Chinese meal I have ever had.
