The place may be great for desserts but not for dinner. It was horrible!! The food was so sub-par and lacked flavor. Not quality Greek food. The prices were way over priced! I would not recommend this place. The server also tried to up sell us and gave us a ldirty ook when we said we were not interested. She was very slow as well and confused. She was not busy and the place was fully staffed. I wish we would've tried the Athena around the corner.
