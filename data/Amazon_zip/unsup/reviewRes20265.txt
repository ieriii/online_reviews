BYOB!! Make a visit to Olivia's market just down the street for a small bottle of sake, or if you are like me, bring a large one to help make the sushi experience that much more enjoyable. This BYOB has pretty standard maki and nigiri but they sure do make it good! You cant go wrong with their signature maki rolls either, the dragon and volcano are my personal favorites! Interior is dimly lit but does tend to get loud so don't plan on having too intimate of a conversion... the table next door will be able to hear you. I like this place over some of the more expensive sushi options closer to North/Damen/Milwaukee.
