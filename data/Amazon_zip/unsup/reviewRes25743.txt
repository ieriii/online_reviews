Geja's Cafe is a fantastic restaurant. I took my partner here for a nice dinner out. Making the reservation was easy, the hostess and server were very nice, well-mannered, and fun. The seating is sort of like having private booths, which adds to the romance. The decor is classy and welcoming. Sometimes while dining out at nice places there's a sort of pretentious and uptight vibe, but not here. We felt very comfortable. The cheese fondue is the best we had ever had. The food was just extraordinary. At the end of our meal, we got to write with a silver sharpie on our wine bottle for it to be displayed in the restaurant. We hope to go back to Geja's for every anniversary. It's really the best!
