Wow. I was so happy I went here for lunch since I've been meaning to try them out for a while now. And OMG I will definitely return! It was my first time there and they were able to suggest some of their popular dishes. I'm not a pork person so I chose ropa vieja (pulled beef mixed w/ sauce [i forget the name of the sauce]). Also since I have a sweet tooth, also ordered a side of maduros (fried plantains, sweetened).  The Ropa Vieja was delicious. It was a lot of beef but it was so good i ate all of it. Top it off w/ maduros, oh man oh man. I was so happy! O yes, I also had mango shake and I was in heaven! Will definitely return!
