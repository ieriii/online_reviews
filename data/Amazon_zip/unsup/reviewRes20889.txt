i have been going to coast for years. i like to go early so that i don't have to wait. although when we do go in later and have to wait we usually stop over at danny's or charleston for a beer, and then someone at coast will give us a call when our table is ready. ya gotta love that! i also love that it is byob, it just makes it more affordable to go there more often. i like the atmosphere, and most of the servers throughout the years have been really really nice. i especially like the wasabi maki roll.
