Nothing beats fifty/50's patio on a nice summer day. I come here for one item on the menu- their award winning wings. Regular and Buffalo is how you order them. Slow and with a cold beer is how you enjoy them. The wings are incredibly large and supposedly aged and marinated for several days before fried and served. I'd be bold enough to say that boobs aside, Fifty has tastier wings than Hooters and far less greasy. The best Wings I've ever had. The patio provides tons of opportunity for hipster/people watching. In addition, it has 3 outdoor mounted TV's with sound on for each major sporting game. Hands down my favorite summer bar. It can get very crowded in the summers or during big games.
