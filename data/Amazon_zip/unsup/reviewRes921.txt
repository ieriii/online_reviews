I'm in lust with Hot Dougs. Its never a fail no matter how long I have to wait in line and it only gets better, now that I know you can BYOB! First I will say if you don't want to wait in line go early or late because the lunch rush will take a good 30 mins of your time. On a Friday or Saturday you can almost 100% guarantee an hour wait but again its well worth it especially for some of those delish duck fries they only offer on the weekends. The menu staples are all amazing, my fave being the firedog; The Anna Kendrick (formerly the Keira Knightley, the Jennifer Garner and the Britney Spears) I've tried a lot of the specialty dogs which change weekly but always get a default firedog as backup. Some favorite specialties I can remember are the Kangaroo sausage and the Rattlesnake sausage. Oh and don't forget a cheese fry to complete your order! The staff is great and I love the punk rock atmosphere and wiener decor. No trip to Chicago is complete without a stop (or 2) to hot Dougs!
