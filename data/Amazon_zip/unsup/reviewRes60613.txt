First, we waited for over an hour, but the restaurant wasn't full. That put me in a bad mood. The floors were slippery . Once we got seated, we ordered some buffalo chicken rolls. This brought my mood around. I ordered a drink. It was average. There seemed to be some greasy people working up in there. Our waitress started out nice, but things turned ugly when our food came out late, and wrong. They comped us the messed up order. The food was pretty good.A couple more drinks and I was good to go. Overall it was not the worst or the best, just okay.
