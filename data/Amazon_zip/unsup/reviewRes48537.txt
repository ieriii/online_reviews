Had a terrible experience at the Publican - we waited for our table for over an hour before we finally left. A couple next to us, waiting, had the same experience. During our wait we ordered a couple beers and the famous fries - the beers along took 20-25 minutes to get out to us, and the fries came about 15 minutes after that.  This was my second time at the Publican - the 1st time was a good experience but not sure if i can get past the horrible service my wife and I had.  The next night we went to the Girl & the Goat, total opposite of Publican...looks like the Publican better watch out.
