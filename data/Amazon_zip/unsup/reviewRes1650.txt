My first Yelp review. I felt the need to review Hot Doug's as my first review. What more can I say about this place?? I've been coming here since I was in the tiny high school just up California ave. (06!!) For years now I have enjoyed duck fat fries on Fridays along with the classic Chicago Dog. (NO KETCHUP EVER!!!) Also, buffalo sausage, ostrich sausage, thuringer, The Teuben (my favorite specialty, tastes like I'm at Manny's!) and a b.l.t. sausage believe it or not! (bacon as a sausage?? Believe it!) This is simply my favorite place for a red hot. I've been to MANY shacks and stands and while many are very tasty, Hot Doug's will always be on my standard.
