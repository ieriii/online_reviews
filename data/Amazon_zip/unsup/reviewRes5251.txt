Mark this down as my first experience with pig's ear. Or at least pig's ear that's no longer attached to the animal. While I can't say that I need to experience pig's ear again (it's a little too creepy crunchy), I hope it's not the last time I have a chance to eat at The Purple Pig. This is what many other tapas restaurants try to be: Cozy, lively, communal, with a great variety of well-priced food and drink. While there wasn't anything I didn't like, my favorites were: * Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette * Majorcan Sobrasada * Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki * Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip-filled Fried Brioche}
