LOVE this place! It's a tiny place so it's always difficult to find a spot to sit down at. But totally worth sharing a table with strangers for this deliciousness. I like their seoul sassy sauce on the chicken wings. They have some spicy sauce on each table that is amazing on the wings or fries. I've been told it's a cheese sauce, but it tastes like mayo to me. Their bowls are also good- rice with meat and veggies.
