To combat the 2 hour wait for a table during dinner, we went in the mid-afternoon. There was still a fairly long wait. I guess this place must open up with hipsters camped on its damn doorstep. I'll agree with everyone else - the food was adventurous and interesting. The portions were smaller than expected, and the chefs seemed to be having this whipping fit in the kitchen, so everything came with some sort of whipped cap upon it, whether or not it fit the theme of the meal. But to their credit, every whipped up whatever was fantastic. I didn't know you could do that to turnips. The tables were pretty cramped and I felt like the busboys were waiting, poised to leap at the table and snatch away the plates as our forks lifted the last morsel of food from them. Probably because the busboys were indeed waiting by our table and eyeing us, poised to leap at the table to take away our plates. Were they running low on plates? Or did they just want us to pour our food into our gullets and move along so they could stuff another couple of eager bearded plaid-wearing patrons into our spot? Whatever the case, I felt hurried along about the food and deprived about drinks. I didn't think a water refill and a beer with dinner was unreasonable, but I guess that's just how it goes when you're seating 60 people in a room meant for 25. The staff could barely move about.
