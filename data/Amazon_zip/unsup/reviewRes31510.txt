Well although I'm not a vegetarian or vegan..(although I can easily live without meat and all the crap that comes along with it) This place was great! Even the carnivorous BF enjoyed himself too..he's wasn't crazy about the sandwich he had, and he's more than willing to try it again.. but the sweet potato fries and my nachos were great! I'd never had an organic pop before but that was great too..I don't think I'll ever have another coke or pepsi again..not really a pop person to begin with :) Our waiter was so friendly, and service was fast..what else could you ask for? I can't wait to go back, everyone seems really friendly..not a frown in the house! Great food and you don't feel like a pig who just drowned himself in the slopper afterwards! Def 5 stars however maybe I'll eat on the patio next time..a bit crowded right in front of the window for the whole world to see you scarfing...:)
