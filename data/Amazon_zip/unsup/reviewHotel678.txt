Great location for our New Years Eve stay (2 days). Michigan Avenue a 15 second walk away. Navy Pier 3 blocks away. Garrett Popcorn right next door. I even noted a Saki bar across the street. The pool (10th floor) is one of those "why even have a pool if it is this size"? A Starbucks in the lobby...but I recommend better coffee at half the price at the Dunkin Donuts across the street. Not much of a view in our room (could see a slice of Michigan Avenue). Went with the larger size suite...which worked out well as we had 7 (2 were the grandkids) in the room.
