Really great ambiance, though, I agree with other yelpers that it is a bit cramped and a bit noisy. It was fine for a Saturday out with a group of girls. Lovely cocktails and we shared calamari as an app. Chicken for the main was super moist and flavorful. Other three girls enjoyed pastas in large portions. Mia Francesca was great about accommodating a vegetarian in the group, but offered a lack luster response after water was spilled on me.
