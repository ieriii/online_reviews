The ambience of this place is awesome! Different from most places in Chicago. I come to this place on a pretty consistent basis and about 90% of the time there is a wait (they do not take reservations) and pretty long one at that. You can go somewhere else and grab a drink while you wait for their call that your table is ready...I advise not to go too far, they might not wait for you to come back. In my opinion (and usually everyones I go with) Violet Hour has the best cocktails in Chicago. They are all so unique and yummy! Drinks are $12 and definitely worth it. I recommend to try and get seated at the bar, their bartenders (mixologists) are very insightful. After a drink or two off the menu, I highly recommend you ask for the bartenders suggestion...or even better ask them to make you a drink not on the menu. You will NOT be disappointed. Careful though, their drinks do not skimp on the alcohol! Although this is not a place I'd come to to eat, I have nibbled on some of their food and have never been disappointed (nor super impressed) but when you're starving, it certainly hits the spot. Violet Hour is a place you MUST check out!
