I would like to express my dissatisfaction in my last visit to Giordano's at East superior street, Chicago. I would start saying that I drive 200 miles to eat there and spend time with my family, but after I am greeted by your impolite and indifferent hostesses the experience turned from an excellent meal to be to an adventure.Let me clarify that I really understand the waiting time; however, there MUST be a better way to calculate the time in line considering that you can order ahead. I've been at this restaurant at least 10 times, usually with minimum 3 people; and 9 out of 10 the hostesses treated me like I was a vagabond that was asking for food, instead of a patron willing to have a good meal with his family. The customer focus and centricity needs to change; maybe you will not do anything considering all the clients that you havehowever, loosing my family as a customer just ensures that I cannot recommend this restaurant to any other friends, family, and their friends, business associates etc.My last visit on December 27: The hostess told me to wait 45 minutes, and after 30 minutes I could place my order, I needed to place my order ahead of time, so my waiting time on the table is lesser. This makes sense; this way I can east faster and more clients get to be seated sooner. I explained the hostess that in the past I've been told to come in certain time, and I usually did it, but then I found out that I've lost my spot because the called ahead; the explanation was indifferent, "well, it is true sometimes we call people ahead of time". That's it, no more to say, and next customer please. Well, the thing is that I ordered 15 minutes after I checked in; I was called at about 40 minutes instead of 45 which is pretty good; but then I waited at least 12 minutes before the server stopped by the table and offered something to drink. The wait for the pizza was endless, maybe another 20 minutes; when we asked the server; his response was that the pizza takes 60 minutes; however, your menu both in the store and internet says that the stuffed pizza takes 35 minutes, so doing a little bit of math at least 57 minutes passed before we got our food; needless to say that the pizza was cold when arrived to our table. It is a shame that the good food and the quality of the meals get overcast but the indifferent service provided by the hostess, servers, and the managers.In summary: -The pizza is good provided that hostesses and waiters are in a good mood that day-The hostess greet you in a way that you rather to go instead of stay-The servers do not like to work for their money, and if they do, they take a lot of time to show that-Despite the fact of visiting the same store many times, over a period of 6 years, in different seasons, and almost always been attended and served by Hispanics ( and me being a Hispanic) the service is always the same: Indifferent and with so little respect for the patron-Hopefully this email goes somewhere and some things gets corrected; hopefully this behavior pertains to this office and does not represent the operation of the whole chain; otherwise Efren and Joseph could not be as proud as they are about their cooking and their food taste
