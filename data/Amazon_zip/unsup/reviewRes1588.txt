I've been here a few times, with waits ranging from 1 hr 40 min to as little as 20 min. Today, we had the: Antelope Sausage with Roasted Red Pepper-Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Baby Belletoile Cheese Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel Duck fat fries The duck sausage is always the best choice (I always order it), and the duck fat fries are flavorful and have a great texture. We usually try some of the specials to experiment with new flavors. The bacon sausage wasn't very bacon-y (sad face) and the antelope sausage was pretty good. My vegetarian boyfriend really likes the Pete Shelley (vegetarian dog). I usually order it with carmelized onions and tomatoes. Recommended if you don't mind waiting in line. =]
