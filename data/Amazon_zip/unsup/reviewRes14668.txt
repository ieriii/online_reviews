Very solid beer selection and excellent vegetarian options. Fairly easy to get a seat (non-peak hours) and dig the fact they only have two TVs; kind of forces you to be social and get to know your neighbors. If you're down with that sort of thing. The Tempeh Rueben sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've had in the city. It's like a taste explosion in and around your mouth. Also, the Anti-Hero IPA will make you take your pants off.
