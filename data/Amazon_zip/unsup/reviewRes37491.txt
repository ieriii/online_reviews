This review is for the cafe... If you'd like to pay for some overpriced, ostensively gourmet sandwich that's lacks the gourmet-taste, you'd really enjoy this place. Just cuz you stick a slap of brie cheese on some rustic bread, it doesn't mean it's gonna be good! I was very disappointed by the turkey-cranberry-brie sandwich. The bread was dry, brie cheese had no flavor, turkey was lunch-meat turkey. I tried a bite of my friend's roast beef, blue brie cheese sandwich also and it tasted the same except lunch-meat turkey was replaced by lunch-meat roast beef that slightly stunk. Now...the good items on the menu: the spinach salad was quite delicious. Fresh spinach with sugar-coated walnuts, plump apricots, slab of goat cheese and some undefinable mushroom! mmmm... ok, I'd go back to this place for this salad. Finally, I gotta admit the lobster sandwich quite good. Flavorful lobster meat salad drenched in mayo on top of giant slices of gourmet bacon. But then again, when you got mayo and bacon AND lobster... it's impossible to screw that up. I agree with the previous review re the service. I thought the cashier was going to kill me with her stares when I asked if they bring foods out to the seats in the back. She grunted an answer that could've been either "yes" or "go screw yourself." Lovely.
