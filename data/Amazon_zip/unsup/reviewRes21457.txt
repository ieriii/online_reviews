I went last night. The food was good! I had a seafood soup that was spicy and very interesting. I didn't like the setup - we ordered food at a counter and then were given a table "number," but then were seated along a counter even though there appeared to be ample tables available. Not exactly cozy. I'd go again for the food though.
