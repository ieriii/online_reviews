I've been wanting to try a Rick Bayless restaurant for as long as I can remember. I really find his enthusiasm for Mexican cuisine inspiring and I knew no matter what I ordered, I'd like it. I was with a group of seven and we enjoyed a spread of appetizers: guacamole, ceviche, quesadillas, and chicken taquitos. There were two salsas. I only tried the red, which had a deep, smokey flavor. The chips were very light and worked as the perfect vehicle for the dips. I made the mistake of ordering something rather boring: pork tacos. Now, these were no ordinary tacos, but if you're going to a Bayless restaurant, you should really think about spreading your wings a bit. I'm disappointed in myself for not thinking about this ahead of time. Because seriously, Chicago has tons of authentic Mexican joints where you can get a great taco. However, I will say I'm glad I got to try the house made tortillas...WOW. There is a real thoughtfulness that goes into this menu. The Gold Margarita was perfect and I heard lots of compliments on two of their fancier versions. I somehow managed to squeeze in dessert, the pistachio ice cream topped with hot fudge. Damn...that's one combination of flavors. I'm really happy I finally got to see what this place was all about and it did not disappoint.
