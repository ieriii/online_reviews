My fiance surprised me with a proposal and a room here! Loved it! The hotel is historical and gorgeous, as expected. The staff is impeccable. The room was old school, but had an amazing view, great amenities, and obviously was perfectly clean. Perfect location to walk on Mich Ave, or shop in the gold coast and feel like a million bucks. Had the breakfast buffet-was good but I'm a brunch fanatic and have had much better in Chicago. The bar downstairs has really cool historical drinks, but the crowd was really eclectic, so not so romantic for a date night. Also, I think they have 1 waitress working the entire thing. Overall, loved the hotel and the restaurant/bar were okay.
