Third time here, although this place is good, I am not quite sure it deserves as much attention as it seems to get on yelp. They do have a delicious fish soup for $7, but other then that I think these prices are just silly for the size of the serving. There are plenty of BYOB sushi restaurants that will serve more, charge less, and be great quality. Whats a perk to Coast? The service has been really great every time I come - friendly and attentive.
