Falafal is yummy! Love the kefta kabob sandwich. Good sized portions. Will go back for the salad bar one of these days. And to try some baked breads and pastries sold along side the check out line. The only frown face is due to a lack of chicken kabobs on the menu. The chicken option is chicken shawerma, not my fav. Cash only is also a slight frown face, but I will remind myself to carry some cash just for this place!
