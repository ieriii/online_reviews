In 20 years I have never-NEVER-had a bad meal at Sabatino's. Amazingly fresh meat and produce. Superb escargot. Love the chateaubriand for two. (They flame it up at table side!) Everything on the menu has been divine. Wait staff sometimes hit or miss, but overall very good. Lines can be looooooooong on the weekends, so make sure you've made reservations--and then still plan on having a drink and waiting about 20 minutes at the bar. Owners tend to be on site and perhaps that is what makes this such a great place to dine--especially in those little private booths that make you feel like you're far, far away somewhere in Italy.
