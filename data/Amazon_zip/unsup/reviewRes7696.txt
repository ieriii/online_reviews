Growing up in an Italian family, I can tell you that Chef Anthony brings the authentic cuisine of ALL the regions of Italy to life in his neighborhood Bistro. The atmosphere is very reservations-only but you can really drop in like a favorite neighborhood place - the perfect balance and a #1 Choice to impress visitors! Don't miss the Gnocci!!
