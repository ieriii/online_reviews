We stopped in at about 2 pm on a Saturday, and the comfortable but somewhat cozy dining area was pretty full. This was my 2nd visit, so I had a bit of an idea of what to expect. I would give the food 3 1/2 stars, but a few other aspects of our visit bring down my rating. The oatmeal-banana shake I had was outstanding. My fiancee had the mango-banana which was tasty, but the texture was a bit grainy. Hers was soy-based, which I noticed cost more. When we ordered it, we were informed that the soy shake was also smaller. Wouldn't you think that the price increase would compensate enough? Pick one or the other, but don't charge me more AND reduce the size. I had the Arroz con Huevos, a mix of rice and scrambled eggs, served with avocado and plaintains. Excellent dish. She had the potato stuffed tacos, which came out much more similar to chimichangas. They were good but not great. In the middle of our meal, it also got very drafty in there. Seems like there might be ventilation issues or something, perhaps someone was opening a door to let fresh air in. Overall, it was a good experience, and the staff were nice enough, but it turned out to be a little pricey for everything we got, imo. I'll go back, and would recommend it for the oatmeal shake, plantains and Arroz con Huevos.
