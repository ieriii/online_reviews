This review is strictly for the Red Velvet cupcake at Fox and Obel's bakery. I think that I have been to every bakery in Chicago, and this place has THE BEST red velvet cupcake in the city. It's huge, it's $2, and it's... just the best thing you could have in your mouth. :) Really really really - if you know anyone who thinks they have had the best red velvet cupcake/cake somewhere else, they haven't tried this one. YUM-O.
