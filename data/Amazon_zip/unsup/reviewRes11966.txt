A pretty simple place that you can't mess up as long as the ingredients taste good. They brew their own beer, and you can order your pizza with red or white sauce, or plain (no sauce, just olive oil) sauce, and with as many toppings as you like. They only make thin crust pizza, though. The large comes out on a huge baking sheet like the ones bakeries use to bake dozens of cookies. We ordered two large pizzas, and it fed 8-10 people. The pizzas start at $11 for a small, $14 for medium, and $17 for a large. All ingredients besides cheese are an extra $1.50 - 2.50. The only gripe we had was the lack of cheese on the red pizzas. There are also a couple other options for salads, sandwiches, and desserts, which I wouldn't bother ordering because I'm happy enough with the pizzas.
