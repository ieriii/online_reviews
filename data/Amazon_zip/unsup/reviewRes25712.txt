We went there the other night with a fairly large group (8 people) and had a blast. The atmosphere was fun and lively, The drinks were good (and strong) and most of the food was very, very yummy. My favorites: the meatballs, flatbread with shortribs, grilled steak, and the chocolate croquettas. Didn't like: the bacon-wrapped dates(have had better at other tapas restaurants), and the service was somewhat slow. Overall, it was a bit over-priced for the portions, but everyone seemed to walk away with a full belly and a smile on their face.
