Wilde has always been one of my favorite places for dinner, but their Sunday brunch was always just a little bit lacking. However, after a major overhaul of their Brunch menu, they have completely outdone themselves. With a new 'design your own' style of omelette, and some of the most beautiful, and tasty entrees - you are certain to find something that you will just love. Many others restaurant-goers have become aware of their new gastronomic creations and Wildes is once again packed with happy, satisfied customers, which does tend to slow down the food just a little, but they so kindly offered delicious cinnamon-sugar muffins to tie us over for the wait. Everything we had was phenomenal, and I'll definitely be adding Wilde to my new Sunday Brunch locale of choice.
