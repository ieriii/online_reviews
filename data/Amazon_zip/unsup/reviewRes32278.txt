I love you Chicago Diner!!! I'm surprised to read some of the reviews here, as I have had nothing but wonderful experiences at the Chicago Diner. Sometimes I want to move back to Chicago just for this place. I must hit it at the right times, as I've never had to wait, even on weekend evenings, and have always had an amazing meal with great service. Yesterday's lunch of a shared Nacho Appetizer and Gyro Sandwich filled me up for the rest of the day. I'm also a fan of the BBQ Wing Appetizer, and the Po Boy Sandwich. Really everything I've tried here has been delicious. My meat-eating family also enjoys a meal at this place. The atmosphere is quaint, and the outdoor patio out back is very pleasant. And, free parking to boot! Superb!!!
