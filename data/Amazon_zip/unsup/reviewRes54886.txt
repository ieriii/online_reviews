Best beer selection that I've found in the city. I loved it. They try to serve as much as possible in the actual glass for the microbrew.The bartender put a little too much head on all of the beers, so I felt like I was always being gypped, but all good beer should be aerated, so I guess I can't complain. When paying $8 for 12oz of beer, I don't want 3 oz of foam.Getting a table large enough for our group of 10 was painful, but at least we didn't mind the extra drinking time. The food was pricey and I thought that they had a poor selection. I didn't even like it when they brought it out. My wife loved her CB&J (cashew butter and jam). She still raves about it to this day, so that's why I still give this place 5 stars.I will definitely go back there, but will definitely go with a smaller group.
