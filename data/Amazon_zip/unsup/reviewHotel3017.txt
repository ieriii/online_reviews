Was truly disapointed!! it has GREAT lake views and of navu pier as well but thats all it has going for it. The rooms were okay - quite open concept with a window in the bathroom which opens up ito the bedroom - not sure why you need that? LOL! the lobby and hallways are dark and loud - the W way. We got carded at the bar upstairs and downstairs which was annoying - we were old enough to buy a room there but not a drink! really?
