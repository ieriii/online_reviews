Downtown isn't much for noncorportate good eats so thank goodness for The Gage. I've been there several times during my lunch hour and for work related dinners and have consistently enjoyed everything EVERYONE ordered. The service is great. The ambience is upscale pub with lovely emerald green tiles and dark wood trimmings. Its on the pricey side at dinner with an impressive drink menu, but I'd recommend lunch for a more reasonable price. Their wild mushroom sandwich with truffle oil is my all time favorite. If you're not into the sandwich you can order the mushrooms as a side. Its really incredible. Otherwise the menu is heavy on the meat side with a gourmet twist to traditional pub fare. Although I wasn't entirely impressed with their burger, their other dishes are spot on with clean flavors and savory goodness. They support local farms and as a result you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I'd be a regular if I had the cash!
