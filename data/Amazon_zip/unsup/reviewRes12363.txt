Cafe 28 is a Mexican/Cuban joint with lightning fast service, but incredibly overpriced food. I rolled in with a group of friends, surveyed the menu and settled on the ropa vieja (choice flank steak slowly simmered in a garlic tomato and bell peppers sauce until it falls apart). It came with white rice, black beans and sweet plantains. I ate it, it was good, but I was still hungry. With tax, that dish alone ran over $17.  Seventeen dollars is not a crazy amount to throw down if I'm going to have a good, filling meal. But if I'm going to eat what was essentially a disassembled Chipotle barbacoa burrito (minus the tortilla), $17 seems a bit extreme. In fact, I could have bought two of the aforementioned burritos and still had $3 leftover... and I would have been way more full. On a side note, doesn't "ropa vieja" mean "old clothes"? Nice name for your dish, Cafe 28. Bottom line: The food is good, but not great. The service was awesome. But the value just isn't there.
