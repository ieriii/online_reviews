Greek Islands is my go to for Greek food in Chicago, I've tried most of the other Greek restaurants on Halsted and this one is my favorite. We've visited many times over the years with small parties of 2 and larger parties of 10 or 12 and the food always leaves everyone happy. Service is always fast and efficient. Today I had a pork special but I usually order a combo of two different things, pastichio (Greek lasagne) is always good, gyros, or a lamb dish. Start with an order of saganacki (flaming cheese) or fried calamari and save a little room for dessert, they are all tasty. The restaurant is enormous so there usually isn't any trouble getting a seat. Valet parking is free.
