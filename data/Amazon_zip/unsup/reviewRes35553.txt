For dining in you can't beat the BBQ meat dishes on rice for $4-$5 a serving - though in the case of the duck, we're pretty sure the "meat" is basically hacked up duck neck - not that it isn't quite tasty. And while I have no problem with dining in here - we prefer to just buy the whole duck ($12) and just say NO when they volunteer/assume you want them to hack it up for you - that is unless you want to have a very authentic experience and like to chew tiny shardsof meat off of craggily bones.  Once you get the duck home, cook up a big pot of steamed rice and stir fry all of your favorite fresh veggies (make sure there are lots of greens (season to taste with whatever you like.) Slice or dice the duck to your suit your preferences and toss in with the veggies. Serve over rice with your favorite condiments . You'll have a feast for 4-8 friends depending on how hungry you all are.
