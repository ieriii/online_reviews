This place used to be better. Now they rush you through like you're part of an assembly line. It was a little reminiscent of the Seinfeld "Soup Nazi" episode last time I was in there. I miss mom ringing and son slinging. Now it's just a rat race. The quality has suffered a bit, I asked twice for spicy last time I went and my nose didn't even run when I bit into my falafel. What's the point? Still some of the better falafel I've had in this fair city of ours.  The salad bar is a nice addition, nice selection. Not really relevant to the cuisine (or maybe it is and I just didn't know it) but I imagine all the cool vegans in the 'hood enjoy it.  A solid lunch value if you don't mind waiting in line and having to repeat your order 3-4 times once you finally get to the front.
