Doug is a culinary genius. He manages to find an excellent flavor combination for even the most exotic meats. It's refreshing to see someone who understands the subtleties of a particular meat or cheese, and who finds new and interesting ways to bring those subtleties out. I can gush and gush for pages, but there's really no way to accurately describe it, you simply must go there and taste for yourself. The menu on the website is ALWAYS up to date, which is something that I really, really, really appreciate. They take several vacations a year, which are always posted well ahead of time. It's an extra step that most eateries don't take, and it really shows that he's in it for the love of encased meats, and not just for money. BYOB, which would be even more awesome if they were open for dinner. Smallish, purposefully kitschy building with a small outdoor patio. Huge crowds from the nearby offices at lunchtime (so get there before noon!). It's the ultimate Chicago sausage experience. Get thee to Doug's!
