What a great experience! I went to this restaurant a few months ago for lunch. I started with the insalata di pere (pear salad) and had the spaghetti neri con gamberi (black spaghetti w/ shrimp) for my meal. The food was delicious even from the fruity olive oil, crusty bread, and beautifully flakey parmesan cheese! I can't wait to go again for their brunch buffet or dinner.
