The Scotch egg is a revelation. What more to say? I've always enjoyed super-delightful service and though I've had a few clunkers ( a delicate but bland fish and chips, so-so strozzapreti), the winners have always been five-star champions. The mushroom soup, tomato and polenta dish, and housemade sausage: wowza.
