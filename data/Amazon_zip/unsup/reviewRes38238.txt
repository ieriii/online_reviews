I am so thankful for Hopleaf being in the neighborhood! This place never disappoints for a laid-back, casual spot for friends to hang out. The dining area is not as crowded so it might not be so bad for a date night either, you can go upstairs until your table is ready. The downstairs bar area gets packed first but the upstairs fills up too by 9pm (at least on the weekends) The beer selection never disappoints. Every time I go, I am always able to try something new and different from the extensive list. The staff will usually let you try something you have never had before so you don't have to make the full commitment blind. The staff is always helpful and keeps the mood of the place calm, despite people being shoulder to shoulder at peak times. Defintely a must try for anyone new to the city, even if you don't live directly in the neighborhood.
