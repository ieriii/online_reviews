It weirds me out a little that the Chicago Diner is the "go-to" restaurant for out of town vegans. I've had plenty of friends visit from afar who insist on going here and won't be told otherwise. I guess it is pretty great, if your town doesn't have a whole lot of vegan options or something. Don't get me wrong, the Chicago Diner isn't a bad restaurant. It just isn't good. Nearly all of the dishes revolve around fake meat, which is a little disappointing, and very little of it is more than "just okay." The mac and cheese has a vomit-y aftertaste. The daily specials are uninspired (and by uninspired, I mean you can tell that they are only the daily specials because they have a lot of extra crap they need to get rid of). The desserts are delicious, but are way overpriced. I'd recommend the BBQ wings as an appetizer and the french onion soup as a side, but there are no entrees here that I enjoy enough to mention by name. They all seem pretty hit or miss. Two stars for average food, one star for attentive and friendly service.
