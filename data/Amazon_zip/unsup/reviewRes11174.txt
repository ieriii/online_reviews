First and foremost, I've been here plenty of times so the issues over waiting and price have not influenced my opinion about The Bongo Room. This place puts on a clinic on how to bring the A game to the breakfast/brunch crowd. I love a good battle between savory and sweets and this place does both real well. I generally get a two egg breakfast so I can squeeze in a single piece order of the Chocolate French toast. So both sides win in my book except for my stomach but that's the price to pay at a trip to this place. The only knock I have with this place is that they are more creative with their sweets than their egg dishes and I would love to see some crazy creations from the kitchen. It is a small knock cause they are solid in that area but I had to be a bit fair somewhat!
