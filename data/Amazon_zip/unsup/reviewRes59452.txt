Great deep dish pizza, fresh ingredients and consistent. Wait staff tends to play favorites on the weekends. The atmosphere inside could be upgraded a bit to match the level of food, but it's still a pizza place you know? Do you come for the atmosphere or the grub? Overall nothing to really complain about but a few small improvements can be made. You'll get over it once you start eating.
