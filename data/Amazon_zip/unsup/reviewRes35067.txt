One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago--amazing food, excellent service, and great ambiance. It's tough to get right, and they do. it feels incredibly decadent to dine here, though it's on par with other restaurants in its category price-wise. If you're familiar with the Tadich Grill in San Francisco, you have a feel for this--and if you know Jeff Ruby restaurants, this is what they should aspire to. Don't miss!
