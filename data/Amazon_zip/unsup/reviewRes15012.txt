My friend and I were walking around our neighborhood and decided to check out The Violet Hour. We were lost looking for this place... there was no sign or anything and we pretty much had tourist written all over us. We were in the general vicinity and we saw a crowd of people around this door. Ah ha, we found it! The bouncer checked our IDs and we were immediately escorted to the bar. Jim, our bartender, overheard our conversation and knew we were from San Diego. He took care of us all night and gave us his recommendations for our trip. It's very amusing to watch him make drinks... not just the typical shake and pour. More like a dash of this, a drop of that, a slice of this, and a sprinkle of that. I tried the Juliet & Romeo and the Slaughter Flowers. Both cocktails tasted exquisite and for $12 a pop, I think they were very well hand-crafted drinks. The atmosphere here is very cool, intimate, and a bit secretive even. It's a trendy spot and the food wasn't half bad either. My friend and I tried the gnocchi and it made for good bites to nibble on while we enjoyed our drinks. I must say that it's a good place to take a date and enjoy a night out. Sit in the bar in front of Jim, he's awesome!
