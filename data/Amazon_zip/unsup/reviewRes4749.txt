I don't know what the hype is about this place. I think it has been over rated. It's not bad but it's not great either. We had beets with goat cheese, bone marrow, calamari, and pork shoulder with mashed potato. The bone marrow actually had no taste. It was just greasy. Thank god for the salt it came with. I like fresh organic food, as well as tapas. This just wasn't special. I must say that we did eat later at 12:30 after a show so maybe they were more concerned with getting the food out so they could start cleaning up. Also they served the dishes one at a time, just as they were ready but the meal didn't really flow well.  We would not go back and would not recommend it to our friends. We were disapointed after all the good reviews.
