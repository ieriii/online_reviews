I ate at this place twice last year and it was good. Great ambiance. Great food.  The reason I'm revewing it now is because Graham Elliott had a tent at Lollapalooza and served the BEST food. Lobsters corndogs, chicken with PBR bubbles, portabello mushroom satay. mmmmmm All of the food was delicious and somehow Graham Elliott managed to prepared it in a tent. If I didn't believe in the genius of this man before, I do now.
