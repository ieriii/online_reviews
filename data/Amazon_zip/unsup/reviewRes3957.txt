the quality and quantity are a 5. the actually restaurant is not really impressive with its picnic benches and decor.whats with cash only and being closed on mondays? the crisp BBQ chicken wings are amazing the sauce is tangy and sweet but not a normal BBQ sauce. the steak bowl was also very flavorful!!
