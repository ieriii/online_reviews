The bf and I went here for brunch to celebrate us winning our fantasy football league a few months ago. I had read and heard this place was good, but no one ever said it was THIS good! The decor was styled like a 1950's German beer hall which I liked. Since I was feeling festive I got a mimosa and the bf got the Publican mimosa(which is Belgium beer and orange juice). We split the pecan sticky bun, which I never knew a sticky bun could taste this amazing. I was amped up for my main course which did not disappoint. I got the Monte cristo sandwich which was delicious (I see it is no longer on the menu, hopefully they will bring it back into rotation.) Since I prefer to drink my desserts I ordered a bloody mary to end the meal. I D.I.E.! I don't think I ever have or ever will have a bloody mary as good as this. It was fresh, spicy, and came with a beer back of your choice (I ordered Gumballhead). A perfect way to end a great meal.
