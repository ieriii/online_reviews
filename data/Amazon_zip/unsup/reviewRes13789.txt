I am not much of a yelper in that I don't really post many reviews. However, I'm still beside myself about the poor waitress service my friends and I received at this restaurant a few months ago that I had to write a review. A few months ago, a group of our friends decided to get dinner and drinks at Revolution. After receiving the bill, we paid in cash and left the restaurant. As we were all saying good bye to each outside in front of the restaurant, the waitress comes running out of the restaurant saying that we didn't leave as much of a tip as she wanted. She fanned out the bills that we paid with and said something to the effect of "there is no way you meant to only tip me this". All of us were stunned as we tipped her more than 20%, which she didn't even deserve. (She neglected our table and was rude at times). As it turns out, she mistook one of the bills for a $20 bill instead of a $50 bill. She didn't even apologize for that.
