Sorry, I'm not feeling it.  The food is not good. Everything else is very good, but a restaurant just can't overcome mediocre food. I think I'm going to skip Nana in the future and head down Halsted to Amelia's. There was no crowd at Nana when I went, so that doesn't figure into my rating. So basically their thing is that they're only open for b'fast and lunch, and also that they emphasize organic, local, etc. I guess the biggest surprise is the heaviness of the menu. They seem to be trying to prove that this type of food can be bad for you. Lots of emphasis on chorizo and ground beef. We tried 3 different things, and the final product is even heavier than the menu would indicate. Our dishes definitely could've used some fruit or veggies or something to lighten them up. Instead, them came with fried potatoes, potato salad, or cole slaw.  Excellent price on the grilled cheese: $6 for gooey cheese on toasted sourdough and a side. Unfortunately, the cheese was almost flavorless. Most of the other items are around $8 or $10. A glass of juice will run you around $3.50, but a bottomless cup of coffee is less than $2. Weird. Service is excellent. The room is beautiful: exposed brick, lots of wood, open kitchen. Street parking can be tight at some hours. Yeah, definitely skip this and head for Amelia's . . . or Healthy Food, the Bridgeport Diner, Ramova, or Stages.
