The exterior is plastered with a huge tacky banner that is about as subtle as a punch in the face. Which makes the interior such an unexpected treat. Everything from the music to the dcor establishes Sprout as a cool setting for a 3 hour dinner on a Friday night. Even the trixies that pepper the crowd have a tad more flair then your average Lincoln Park fare.  We bypassed the $60 three course prix fix, opting for a la cart, since the options are the same. Bonehead move, as the cost ended up being comparable. Everything we got was complex and flavorful, and worthy of winning some sort of Elimination challenge. Dale's specialty, the short rib, was the most memorable. A risky but thoughtful amalgam that you won't find anywhere else. The octopus and scallop also pleased. Dessert is a bit foggy, but am recalling something involving chocolate, a wafer, hot chocolate, shoe salesmen and ice dancers that made me happy. Not sure which were actually ingredients on the plate versus imaginary friends.
