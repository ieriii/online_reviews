Fabulous Indian not on Devon? Indeed! I could scarcely believe it either, but there it is: one of the consistently best Indian buffets I've ever had, wonderful onion kulcha, succulent tandoori chicken, papdi chat, a lovely chicken reshmi kabab, and paneer makhni - in short, everything to take me to blissland. Plus the standard other 100 choices to keep things diverse :-) In reality this is probably 4.5 stars, but with my affection for it so, and the number of times I've had a truly standout dish, I feel that of 4 or 5, I have to err on the side of largesse. Especially for a lunch buffet in River North, this is a great place to drop in and have a meal on the spur of the moment, without resorting to a chain or a tourist trap.
