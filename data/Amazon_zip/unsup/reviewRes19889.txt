Brought girlfriend here for her birthday. Note that I told the staff we were coming here for her birthday. Yet, despite the request, we were initially seated at a table by the bus station. If it's one pet peeve I possess, it's being seated next to a bus station, especially when I requested a nice, intimate table. However, after this small hiccup, the experience was wonderful and just as everyone had described from fellow Yelpers to Metromix and Chicago Magazine. Armed with 2 bottles of Otto's Dream Sauvignon Blanc (one of the finest wines I've ever tasted and a great option with sushi), we got a nice intimate table in the back after waiting an extra 15 minutes. Because of the prior inconvenience, we were given complimentary Miso. The rolls here are unlike those of generic sushi place. The ingenuity and originality that the chefs here put in is truly untouchable minus a few of the other sushi elites in the city. We tried a spider roll, which exceeded expectations, really packed a punch. Then we had the unique "ceviche" roll which was better than we expected. Finally, we finished with the oyster roll - also great, I had never had oysters in sushi. At the conclusion of the meal, the waitress brought a trio of complimentary ice cream scoops. Coffee, green tea, and cinnamon (I think...) - all delicious and a cap to a nice evening. This could possibly be the best BYOB in Chicago.
