I ordered the half-small salmon platter for Thanksgiving and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. The wonderful smoked salmon also came with eggs, capers, onions, tomatoes, a side of creme fraiche and an array of breads. Super fresh. Loved it! I poked around the store while waiting for my order. They have a nice selection of fine wines, meats, cheeses and other delectables that can't be found just anywhere. I bought some sushi for later and it was just alright. All in all, a great experience. I will definitely go back... I especially appreciated the basket of sweet treats they had out for people waiting for their orders. YUMMY! I normally shop at Treasure Island which is just a few blocks from me, but I will go to Fox & Obel if I'm searching for something extra special.
