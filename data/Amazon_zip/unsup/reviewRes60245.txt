Just ordered our first delivery pizza thru FoGo and their delivery service - it was terrible - 45 minutes late and completely cold. Had to contact http://zuppler.com (delivery service) and were told that they had to contact restaurant to get it redelivered. It's like paying for delivery and getting a frozen pizza. NEVER AGAIN - we learned our lesson.
