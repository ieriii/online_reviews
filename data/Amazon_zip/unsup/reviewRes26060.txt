Worth every penny. Their standard meals come with a cheese, oil, and chocolate course as well as coffee. I think it's like $25 for the chicken and the vegetarian meals. It's incredibly romantic and the service is wonderful. It's darkly lit with beautiful decor. My only complaint--I went here for my birthday with my fiance and my parent wanted to surprise me and pay for my meal. They called Geja's and gave them their credit card number. Well, it never happened. We ended up paying ourselves. I made a reservation, so they did have my name. I'm not sure what happened. I've only been there on a weekday, so I don't know about that weird reservation policy they have on weekends.
