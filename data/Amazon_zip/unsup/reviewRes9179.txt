I really like this place. The interior is way corny, complete with plastic tablecloths, but it's like eating in your grandmother's kitchen. Every meat dish I've seen looks very authentic. Not much for vegetarians, though. But the vibe and smells are very satisfying. Take a good friend there, but split the "side" of dill rice. It's gigantic.
