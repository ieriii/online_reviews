I dined there yesterday with a group of 4 people. They sat us at a table in the middle of the room, with constant traffic going around us. Ambience: Extremely loud. Could barely hear the waitress, let alone the person across the small table from me. After a while you get more used to it, but it's nice to not have a headache after eating. Service: It started off slow, but after a while it became top notch. Food was delivered promptly. Couldn't have asked for more. Food: I only review really based on the food, and this was fairly uninspiring. We had the beef lollipops, duck bao buns, filet mignon, and multiple sushi rolls, including the lobster/wagyu roll. None of the food really made me think, "Oh wow that is delicious I need to try that again." We sent back a sticky rice chicken wrap because it was bland. In all, I won't go back to an expensive, loud dining place unless there is at least 1 item on the menu that I can honestly say I loved. Unfortunately, that was not the case at Sunda.
