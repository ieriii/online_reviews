Mmm, my husband and I stopped in a picked up a few slices from Art of Pizza on Friday night. The pizza was definitely tasty. Crust was flavorful, just enough cheese, sauce was tangy and the pizza had just enough greasy sausage to make my belly happy. Service was very fast considering the amount of people going in and out to pick up their phone in orders. We had been in there before to pick up a menu...quite a change from the last time we were there. The place expanded and has quite the phone room set up. There's about 4 guys manning the phone to take orders...quite the set up. The dining area itself is pretty big, lots of families, the plasma screen tv they have mounted to the wall takes a bit away from the cute mural but all and all nice place to stay and have a slice. Art of Pizza...I'll definitely be back soon!
