I've been to coast twice and both times I had to scratch my head because I'd heard many people rave about Coast, but couldn't quite get what the hype was about. Yes, it's BYOB. Yes, the atmosphere is trendy and a bit elegant. But the sushi for me just isn't as inventive or flavorful as other sushi places I have been to like Tank. To me, signature maki is always what I prefer and their signature maki list is really short (9 rolls compared to my Beloved Tank's 25). I think the redeeming part is that the 9 rolls they do make are really good and the ingredients were fresh and high quality both times I went. If less variety in speciality rolls doesn't bother you or if you are more of a classic maki or sashimi kind of sushi eater, this place is good. The bottom line is I think the BYOB nature of this & the atmosphere are good but to me they eclipse the sushi itself. It's good for a 1st or 2nd date when atmosphere generally outweighs culinary exploration, but if it's more about the sushi eating experience and less about atmosphere, I'd probably go elsewhere.
