What a wonderful selection of beers. I also loved the food.  But the wait staff acts like they're in a five star restaurant downtown. It's a beer joint! A really really good beer joint! It would be great if the staff had some of the enthusiasm and joy of a beer joint. This is NOT a good place for groups. I can't imagine why they are listed as such on Yelp. The hostess did not want to seat us until our whole group was there; but as a professional networking group, we couldn't say when we would all be there. The group got a double table, and as more people trickled in, they joined us - only to be lectured by the hostess that we had too many people at the table and we'd have to sit people at a different table. OK now, so we asked for a bigger table and were sternly lectured; then we're sternly lectured for having too many people at the table? And yes, there were tables available. Had we been trying this at 7, I'd understand, but at 5 pm, they simply weren't that full in back.  In short, I'll probably drop in with my partner for a beer and a snack; I'll go to the Science Talk nights. But I won't make this a regular stop despite the excellent beers and fun food. I don't need waggling finger mom tone of voice badgering with my beer and mushrooms.
