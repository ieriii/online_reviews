The food melted in my mouth. The wine selection was extensive and friendly to all palates. The service, outside of a very small instance at the hostess stand that the manager quickly corrected, was phenomenal. Our waitress was very attentive yet not overbearing. Her server assistant was just as helpful and happy as she seemed. I was at ease. They seemed to always be a step ahead of what I needed. I wanted to take my desert to go, it had frozen cream and could potentially melt. While I was contemplating this the assistant asked if I needed some ice in a larger box to help me make it back to my place with my dessert. I enjoyed myself.
