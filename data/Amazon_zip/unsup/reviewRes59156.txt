I live just off Diversey and I CRIED when the Sushi X near my apartment closed. I'm not exaggerating - we're talking big, fat, little-kid-just-lost-her-favorite-teddybear tears, as it was the BEST sushi in the neighborhood (out of like 20+ spots) and I was addicted. I would go every week for the happy hour and eat my fill of delicious half-priced fancy rolls on the teeny tiny patio and wallow in delight.And then it was gone.And I walked by weekly in hopes it was just a remodel, but no dice.SO my friends and I schlepped our sushi-loving asses all the way down to West Town to give the sister spot a try, because once you have had CRAB RANGOON MAKI ROLLS in your life, trust me - you cannot live without them. You crave them. You toss and turn at night wishing for them to get in your belly. No other food creation will do.We had high hopes...but the experience was kind of disappointing. The menu was pretty much the same (minus the martinis - as this one is BYOB), but the atmosphere was lacking. This place is just as tiny as the Diversey spot, but with no patio and no windows for people-watching.  There was no happy hour, though we were more than willing to pay full price for our favorite rolls that we had so longed for. But they just weren't the same.Maybe my expectations were too high. The sushi here is still pretty good, and the roll creations are more innovative than your run of the mill sushi joints. But I miss MY Sushi X. Please come back to Lakeview :(
