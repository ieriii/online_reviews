All i can say is YUMMO!!! I went here for my friend's bday brunch. I had never been here and had no clue what to expect. They had a buffet that was very nice! Duck & potatoes.. o m g! Everything tasted great, down to the buffalo chicken and waffles. I will definitely be back here! After brunch we stopped at the rooftop bar which was nicely decked out and has a nice vibe.
