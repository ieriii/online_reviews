Its a great Hot Dog. Very carefully thought out, and the tastes that envelope you are not what you might imagine. It actually tastes healthy in a way, not too salty or bland but almost gourmet. Actually it is gourmet, It's worth the wait and you will have fun talking to the people in line, I met a couple that was from British Columbia that had heard of it...
