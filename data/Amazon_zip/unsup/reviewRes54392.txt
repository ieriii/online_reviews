Maxim named this best pizza in Chicago. I'm going to have to agree that i was very impressed. You can smell its awesome aroma from outside. I've only had the non-stuffed, thin crust pizza. It isn't your typical thin crust, it's more like a handtossed or pan crust. I recommend double the cheese and sausage!!! Outstanding!!! Great service, even when you are arguing about what toppings to get on the pizza :-) It's moderately priced.
