While it may be the topped ranked US restaurant in the San Pelligrino World's Top 50 List, Alinea (ranked world's sixth) is not the best food that I've ever had. In fact, I've had several meals where the food was better and at considerably lower price points. However, before you burn me at the stake for heresy, it was definitely the most unique dining experience I've had to date. In short, eating at Alinea is surreal. To simply say everything was visually stunning is an understatement and belittles what one experiences from dining there. A restaurant where presentation extends beyond just presentation and flavor into how the diner interacts with the creations is a vital component of what Alinea is. Interactions range from the relatively obvious to the surprising. For example, at one point a device was arranged on the table and we were instructed to guess its purpose. In other cases, we were provided instructions on how to consume the food. For one dish we assembled the "conveyance" for the food out of what appeared to be nothing more than a decorative trivet. This is food you contemplate; sustenance for the intellect as well as the senses.
