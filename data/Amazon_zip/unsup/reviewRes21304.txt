Old fashion drive in atmosphere, order taken at at your car by a 80 year old grandma through a speaker.  "Hi-ya thanks for stopping can I take your order" Total crack up. Order brought to car by a car hop who is not quite as entertaining but polite enough. The menu is varied so something for everyone. The hot dog does taste more like a sausage but with no snap. Love that there are many choices for toppings. Crinkle Fries are very good: crunchy, good flavor, not greasy. Served in a small box where they pack in the hot dog, fries and with a pickled green tomato which is a nice touch. Only problem it mushes the bun. Not a classic hot dog so if you are looking for the best Chicago Dog this isnt it. Not worth the drive but if you are in the area and want some fast food its another choice 2 hotdogs 1 small drink $13+
