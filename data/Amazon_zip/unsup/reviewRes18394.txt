These guys are wonderful. I go here as much as I can! Everyone is super friendly, the food is always excellent, and the atmosphere is always warm and inviting. I really appreciate this place tucked away as it is. Don't try to get reservations unless you are ready to book months in advance. I have been here with very small parties and with dinners of up to 14 people and they have been incredibly accomodating and delightful. Thank you Caro Mio- see you soon!
