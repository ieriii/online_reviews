Lub this place bigtime. Feel like Dexter Morgan when I come here straight out of Miami. I always tend to gravitate to the bistec sandwiches with chicken soup. The meat is deliciouso and difficult to top. The staff are simple and cool without the typical snooty 'I'm too good to be working here' attitude lots of popular joints tend to adopt.
