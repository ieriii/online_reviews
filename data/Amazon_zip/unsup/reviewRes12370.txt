I brought my family to Piece last weekend since its just a couple of stops away from me, and I figured we could do some window shopping in the area. We had my niece with us, so I thought that might be a problem given that a few college games were going on...but everything was cool. The waitress was very accommodating..she gave my niece chopped up meatballs to eat. We ordered a salad with balsamic dressing and fresh mozzarella. It was really good. You could tell the cheese was of high quality. We ordered a red pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The crust was nice and crispy..and the toppings were very good. If you are a fan of super thick pizza with tons of toppings, you might not like the pizza here. Did I mention they make their own beer here? I'm not a connoisseur of micro brews...but if i were, I would have plenty to choose from here. If you are looking for a night out for good pizza, beer, and sports....Piece is your place.
