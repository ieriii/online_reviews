Exceptional. Great service, awesome food. Valet parking was a bit costly, but thats to be expected in the area where Fogo is located. The Top Sirloin was a crowd favorite, followed closely by the bacon wrapped filet. The top sirloin guy and I are now best friends. Great place for date night to impress someone you have been dating for a bit (not a first date place! think about eating 9 servings of meat....not good on date #1) or good for business folks. Have been there with both types, and everyone has walked away impressed!
