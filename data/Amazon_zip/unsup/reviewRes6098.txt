I live near Little Italy, so I am so happy that there is an awesome new restaurant right down the street from me and in this area!  Unfortunately no reservations! The bartender was attentive, and our server was also very sweet. I love that they have to bring their wine list out on a gigantic wine bottle, although I'm sure it bugs the servers every now and then to have to do that. At first look, I thought their menu was confusing because it's very concise -- but I think I was also brain-dead because I was starving by the time we got there. Love the decor here - lots of different types of tables and light fixtures - I think they designed the space very nicely. We were seated all the way in the back where the tables are sorta squished back there so you are pretty close to the patrons next to you and could probably eavesdrop if you wanted! There were some other tables in the middle geared towards slightly bigger groups that don't seem to have this proximity. Not a big deal though either way! I loved:  **the Focaccia Di Recco (I think this is good to serve 4 people, so you can each have 2 pieces) **Truffle Egg Toast **Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori (aka rigatoni with sausage and tomato) Less remarkable: crispy pork belly (you can definitely find more tender and savory pork belly elsewhere -- but this dish is good for 2) Need to try: the burger!!! I keep hearing about how delicious it is. Mondays in particular would be a good day to go - they currently have a $9 Burger & Beer deal going on that I really want to take advantage of. Loved it - I am going back.
