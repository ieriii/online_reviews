I think this place is just that, a pizza place, and nothing more. I didn't get pizza, which was my first mistake. My companion did, and he seemed to really enjoy his. I decided to get a meatball parm sandwich, and I think I am still upset that I did. The meatballs were disgusting. Sure, I'm italian and so it's kind of hard to please me, because mama always wins, but these were so salty, dark dark dark brown (they even seemed old) and rubbery -- as if they had been heated up in a microwave. There was barely any sauce on the sandwich, which is good because it tasted burnt and old. I am going to give this three stars because a piece of my friend's pizza that I had, was delicious.
