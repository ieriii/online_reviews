We went here last week for a girls' night out and it was fabulous! I'm not a fan of spicy foods but I told the waiter this up front and he was most helpful in suggesting entrees which would suit my tastes. The food was fresh and delicious. I got the pistachio encrusted chicken served over mashed potatoes. It was awesome! We also had several rounds of yummy mojitos. I highly recommend.
