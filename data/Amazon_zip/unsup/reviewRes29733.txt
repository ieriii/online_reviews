Of course Chicago Diner gets 5 stars!! It was the final deciding factor in my move to Chicago a few years back.. after visiting a few times, eating at Chicago Diner every time (sometimes multiple times) I thought.. "I'm moving here..." lol. My love affair with Chicago didn't last.. but my passion for the Diner did. On my latest trip, we stopped here 3 times. The menu had changed a bit since I left town.. but the changes were all good. I got tostadas the first night and a vegan cookies and cream shake. On our next visit I got the grilled cheese and veggies sandwich.. (there's a clever name for it.. but it's just a grilled cheese with fresh veggies on it) and mashed potatoes and gravy.. oh and the caramel torte or whatever it was called.. caramelly, crunchy pie-cake. haha. And on our third visit... I got another sandwich and mashed potatoes... but this time I ordered the berry cheesecake.. I've had some really good vegan cheesecake in my life, so I had to try it. The mashed potatoes and gravy just blew everything out of the water. Sweet Jesus that shit is good! I also really liked that grilled cheese sandwich. make sure to specify that you want daiya on that sucker though. The cheesecake was so-so. Good enough that I had to TRY not to eat the whole thing to myself. Anyway.. I love this place. I especially like that it's become more of a vegan establishment and not just vegan friendly. Although you should still be sure to specify "vegan" during your order. If you want to split the check, you HAVE to tell them before you order. And the typical wait for a table or booth is about 15-20 minutes.. but they've mastered the fast, friendly, get the fu-- out service.
