Underwhelming. For $13 I need to be blown away with amazing. The chilaquiles did that. They have a great sauce as well as a distinct flavor. The apple-gingerbread pancakes, however, tasted just like normal pancakes. The butter they give that apparently should bring the gingerbread melted, and what I could use didn't bring any zing to the table. The apple chunks were crisp and sweet. The eggs are okay, like any other egg. The coffee isn't as strong as I like, but it is alright. Service was a bit off, but it's a small busy place. We has three different servers our whole visit. So, this place gets a solid three stars, because it is 'A-OK'.
