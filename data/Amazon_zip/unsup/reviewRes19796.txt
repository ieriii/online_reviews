So delighted to find this was near my hotel on the 1st night. We popped in after a long day of work to enjoy hot chocolate & churros! The set up was a little confusing- order in line, wait to be seated. They goofed and made our order to go and it was sitting around waiting to be picked up and we were seated in the back. But who cares- the churros were amazing and I loved my hot chocolate. It was very dark and rich. It's no nestle; that's for sure. To go with the sweet treats we got a side of very dark chocolate sauce and also amazing ice cream for dunking. Bacon, maple, and caramel were involved. AND we also had a slice of a chocolate cake flan. Bottom line- a must try. And all the "real" food looked & smelled amazing too.
