Admittedly, I had forgotten what schnitzel was. I really just wanted some ham, very desperately, and it seemed like the best choice. And at the Publican, at brunch, on a glorious Sunday morning with some lovely people, how could anything go wrong? In truth, it turned out to be less scary than it could have been -- but it was still a deep-fried, breaded, Fred Flintstone-looking piece of pig. It came topped with a fried egg (Surprise! (not)) and a sauce that elevated it from brauhaus blah to butchershop bravo. Daniel rightly ordered the red wine poached eggs on sourdough. We had this last time we came for brunch, and it pleased then, too -- tart, beautiful poached eggs on great sourdough accompanied by arugula and prosciutto of the most perfect age. Liane's dish, however, took the table by storm. The dirtiest rice provided a bed for outstanding shrimp (and I, let it be known, detest shrimp). It was great. One wee complaint must be mentioned -- the tea. Liane ordered a barrel-aged pu-erh that, when served, was a pinch of tea leaves that barely colored the water in the pot. I had a similar problem with my samurai chai, though the peppercorny punch still came through. Have I been using toomany tea leaves all this time, or was the teatrayer too stingy? Since a lackluster brunch at Nightwood made me question its position as Best Sunday Brunch in Chicago, I've been on the lookout for a new place to bid farewell to the weekend. Perhaps the Publican is the place.
