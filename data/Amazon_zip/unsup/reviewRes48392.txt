What can I say about the Publican? Well, the Publican is basically the reason I joined Yelp. The Publican is why I enjoy good food. I went with a group of seven, including: my girlfriend, my roommate celebrating his birthday, two friends moving to Portland, and two new pals. An exciting group that enjoys good food and good beer as much as good laughs. We started with the chef's selection of oysters, some pork rinds and a Belgian-style beer. We shared so many plates I forgot the names! I'll list some stand-outs: the potee plate, pork belly, little gem salad, frites - complete with fried eggs, radishes (a table surprise-favorite), pickles, olives and suckling pig. I may be losing my mind, but the sea salt they use at the Publican is the best I've ever had. Now I eat a lot o' salt, but the little things make a restaurant for me. The menu changes regularly (daily?) and I would have loved the steak tartar, but the tongue and head cheese filled the void! Our waitress was perfect - especially for a sharing-encouraged restaurant. Answered our questions perfectly, brought us lots of drinks, asked about our meals and then left us alone. I love that. Best comment of the night: "You don't bring a first date to Publican. You bring a 10th date to Publican." Our bill was about $55 each with tip, a healthy tip at that. At least $20 LESS than I expected to pay.
