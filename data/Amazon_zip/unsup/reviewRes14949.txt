My husband and I had just had a wonderful dinner out and decided to stop in and see what all the fuss is about concerning Violet Hour (We have lived 4 blocks away for 2 years and had yet to go). First of all, we both despise bars. There is little else that I hate more than having to yell at someone to get them to hear me. My hubs feels the same way. Violet hour is different. In every way. First of all, there isn't a sign saying "Violet Hour." to let you know where it is...you just have to know or be told where it is. A guy checks your id and tells you to wait to be seated after going through the 2 HUGE and BEAUTIFUL curtains. Yes, no standing around, no yelling drunk people. It is a nice and classy establishment with beautiful booth-like seats coupled around the room and a bar area. Huge and beautiful curtains deck the walls from a very vaulted ceiling. Beautiful. The music was loud, but not shouting level. We could easily converse. Drinks are GREAT, but are a bit pricey. 2 cocktails cost us $24+. So, good for special occasions. No problem getting seated on a Sunday night at 9 :)
