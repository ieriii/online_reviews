bad food and even worst service. to make it easy let me just say a few words. we were a group of 6 and we tried to order food., the server said we had to order drinks first. he would not take our food order. we started to order drinks and after 4 people ordered the server walked away and left the 5th person talking to himself.when the server finally came back and took our food order and we recieved our food it was horrible. the bbq pork sandwich was super dry. no sauce on it what so ever. we asked for a side of bbq and after waiting for ten minuted the server came back with italian dressing instead of bbq sauce.BAD FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE.the beer selection was the one thing that did look good until i ordered one beer and the server came back with something different because what i order was all out.
