Holy giant wings, Batman! The 5 piece Wacky Wacky Wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce (or something to that effect) were fabulous. A good crispy wing and great flavor, plus you are actually getting 10 wings because the thigh and leg are attached as one wing. (I think those are the right chicken parts anyway; clearly I am no expert here!) Everything else was just okay. The burrito with Bulgogi was not as spectacular as I had hoped. Kind of plain. And really, they give you these tiny minature dipping sauce containers that are only enough for about 3 out of the entire basket of fried mushrooms. Oh well. (side note - I was actually dining with a companion, lest anyone think I always consume this much food by myself in one sitting.)  :) Note: We didn't realize it was cash-only until we tried to pay, but the guy was nice about it and we were able to leave and hit the ATM next door before running back to pay the bill.  There are still things on the menu I'd like to try, and as my fiance says, you can't really rate any place definitively unless you have been there 2 or 3 times, so perhaps an edit is in the future for Crisp. Until then, I have to stick by my 3(.5?) stars. Edit: 3/21/08 - Okay the wings alone are truly worth the trip. I can't help it. It's the Seoul Sassy sauce. Plus the second time we brought beer, and that was just delightful. I'm bumping up my rating to four stars.
