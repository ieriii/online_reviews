THis place is really different. It was like 19? courses when I went. I can't believe it used to be 26. Anyhow, it's not so much a meal, as it is an interactive experience. Some of the dishes require you to put in a little work not a lot, to put it together. Everything is pretty small. THe most impressive part was the dessert, which they make onto (literally) your table, and you eat if off there. So you should go here under the following conditions: Big time foodie (not me) Super special occasion like anniversary or getting married or something (again not me) Really really rich with nothing better to do (not me) Friend has a gift certificate and you're going to be moving out of CHicago soon (me) Anyhow, surprisingly laid back, I thought it'd be super uptight, I felt like I was just in someone's really fancy contemporary home. I had a good time. Didn't try any cocktails other than their juice, so I can't really comment on that. The only downside is I was still kind of hungry afterwards and ate when I got home, although I eat a lot. Also it's expensive at 200, although for ultra fine dining it's pretty low. Make a reservation wayy way way in advance.
