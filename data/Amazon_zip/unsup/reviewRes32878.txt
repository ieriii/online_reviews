I love the Asian flavors and unique variety of offerings on their menu. The Rock Shrimp, beef lollipops and brussel sprout salad are my favorites (I know! I can't believe I'm writing I love something made of brussel sprouts!). I'll pass on sitting on the bench - totally uncomfortable, unprivate and very loud.
