The food here is amazing! We typically get the lamb and the saganaki. The food is at a great price point and the ambiance of the restaurant is great- very lively and fun. The servers are friendly. However, the bussers were so annoying! They were constantly at our table just to fill up our glass of water even if I only had taken one sip out of my water glass. If there was one crumb on the table someone would come and clear it away. It's nice to have an attentive waitstaff but this was seriously obnoxious. If I was not actively chewing on something a busser would come over and ask if he could take my plate even if I had only gotten my food ten minutes earlier. At one point in time 3 different people came to the table within two minutes to try to take away my plate! Two asked me if they could clear my plate and the third person just took it when I was not done! It was hard to have a conversation with the people I came to the restaurant with because we were constantly interrupted. We were not taking a long time to eat. We were only there for an hour and we went in the middle of the evening; not right before it closed. It's disappointing because the food was great but the waitstaff ruined our experience.
