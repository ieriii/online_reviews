So I've been wanting to try Q for quite some time and finally had my opportunity. It was a very underwhelming and disappointing experience. We started with the hush puppies and for entrees one of us had the beef brisket sandwich and the other pulled chicken with a side of fries, cornbread, and mac and cheese. Cubed beef brisket on the sandwich?? Usually beef brisket is sliced and tender, a little odd and not very good and the chicken was nothing special.  I will say that the mac and cheese and cornbread were delicious but I don't spend $80 for good sides. Service was good. Very overpriced for the quality of the food served and we left very unsatisfied. Definitely won't be returning and wouldn't recommend to anyone.
