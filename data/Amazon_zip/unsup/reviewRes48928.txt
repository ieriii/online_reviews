This restaurant is interesting. On the outside the restaurant is very chic but on the inside it looks medieval. The tables are just a couple of very long tables so you have to sit next to people you dont know. They have lights streaming all over their ceiling and its a great place to chat and has wonderful ambience. Regarding the food, it was ridiculously expensive. So my friends and I ended up sharing a bunch of meals. The only memorable meal I ate was the ham. I just remembered eating very little and pay a lot. I also saw a few famous chefs dining their, so it's probably because we didn't choose the best because it was so expensive.
