I don't like steaks that much, especially if its bloody, but then my friend invited me over and I was feeling very adventurous so I decided to tag along. Anything free tastes delicious right? Well maybe that night, I was in the right state of mind because I actually enjoyed the medium steak porterhouse that I got that came with creamed spinach, we also got shoestring fries and the tomato mozzarella salad . My friend got veal ravioli and some New York Strip. the meats were spiced ok, maybe a bit too much but i guess it needed it. Who am I to judge, I'm not a steak afficionado. I can say though that the service was very good, very good attitudes which is a big plus, because in any business its a also a deciding factor, something that shouldn't be taken lighty. You wither have to be good-neutral or good and upwards, onwards. Never below or you'll lose your clients - customers. Here they treated us well and made us enjoy what we had, I might say that depending on these reviews the service might be better than the food. The meats were tender and hot and cooked enough(again -I might have been in just the right mood) and the sides that were suggested really did complement the main course. It seemed we were ravenous because we had to sit out the fullness of our stomachs and let the wine, and steaks settle down before heading out. During that time we ordered chocolate mousse cheesecake and creme brulee to occupy the table and give companionship to the food in our stomachs. Once I have the money again i may come back to try some more.
