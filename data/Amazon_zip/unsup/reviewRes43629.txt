Tried this chop house for the first time last night and thought it was great! While the Prime Rib I got and the Delmonica my husband got were delicious, the best part was the service. As newcomers to different types of steaks, the server (Tom, I think?) brought all of the steak cuts out to us and not only showed us the difference, but explained the different types of meat to us. Very knowledgeable staff along with great food! We'll be back for sure!
