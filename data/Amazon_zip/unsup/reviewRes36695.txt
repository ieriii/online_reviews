by far... my fave brunch spot in the city. the wait can be long if you get there between 11 and 12... but if its a nice day out... the wait on the sidewalk isnt that bad. the jelly and and the honey butter provided with the toast is to die for. absolutely worth it just to sample the jelly. **sidenote** my brunch date named her newly acquired beta fish, "Jelly", after our experience there. def recommended. food was delicious. service was good. and the atmosphere is very cozy. i was fortunate enuff to be subjected to some sunday morning EDM while enjoying my meal. can't beat that.
