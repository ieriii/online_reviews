This is a fancy foodie place. You cannot order off a menu, they serve solely a tasting menu. Some of the courses tasted very good. My favorite was the scallop which is cooked in a buttery sauce and served in a seashell. There was a weird hot sauced infused fried oyster. It was very odd. Then there was a course called the 8 tastes of summer -some of these bites were ok, others were downright bad like a little cooked egg rolled in something - seaweed dust? It was horrible. There was a lotus fruit bite that was pretty good and unusual. A tuna bite that was fine - but you've had it before.  There was a pork centered course which was pretty good. But honestly I've forgotten most of the other courses which says something considering you are dropping over $100 per person (and without liquor bc its BYOB but probably not for long because they are expanding and they will likely get a liquor license). The food is beautiful. The service is good. The atmosphere is cool. Some of the food is good, some not so good. And, at the end of the 8 courses I went home slightly hungry. I really wanted to love this place, but overall I just didn't.
