Dinner was ... surprising.  The short version: Food = decent, but not worth the price.  Service = impeccable Hostess = terrible First, the food was not great, but good, and certainly very interesting. But there was not one outstanding or memorable dish (in terms of taste). We had the (8?) course tasting menu. It was all decent, but again, I actually can't remember a single dish. Nor did I once say, "my gosh! that was fantastic!" And for those prices, you really should say that at least once. Also, they brought us the wine menu before bringing the food menu, which is where one learns about the wine pairings available with the tasting menus. BF was immediately upset upon getting the food menu, as he would have liked to have selected the wine pairings with the tasting menu, but we had already ordered and opened a bottle of wine before we knew there were pairings available. Throughout the meal, the service was impeccable. Last but not least, we were seated at a table that was very uncomfortable. It was right in the middle of the floor by the bar. As there was almost NOBODY there, I asked if we could be seated (literally) anywhere else. Hostess said no. We debated for a minute, she stuck to her guns and said all the other tables were reserved. Every single one. It's too bad that 3 hours later when we left, many of those tables were still empty. And we certainly won't be helping to fill them in the future.
