I've had Fogo's pizza and their chicken special many times. Their pizza toppings are pretty phenom, but it can get pricey when your eyes are bigger than your stomach. They have some great premium toppings, just be strategic! The 1/4 chicken dishes with 2 sides, a pita, and soda is a great deal. I think it's under $7 if I remember correctly. You can choose between dark or white meat and order beans, rice, corn, slaw for your two sides.
