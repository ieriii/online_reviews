This place is super cool! Parking is a bit hard to find but we got lucky and found a spot right on Damen about a block away......Actually the spot was hard to find also as there's no signs lights nothing.....it sorta looks like a abandoned factory from the outside with just the address in the front which caught my eye.....so we entered walked threw the 12 foot purple curtains made a right and walked threw another set 12 foot purple curtains and we are immediately greeted by a friendly host and then given our table with a set of very comfortable high chairs and 2 candles on each of our tables.....Dimmed lights and mellow nice music playing in the background....Pretty well set up with great decor.....Our waitress was also super sweet.....The menu was a little confusing because page after page just had the type of liquor...were its from.....and how old it is....not whats in it....lol....I had the Bula Mai Tai which was made pretty strong and had a stem of mint in it.....very tasty....my friend had the Vodka Cobbler....quite tasty....her second Cobbler was actually much better then her first as you were able to taste fresh strawberries in it.....This place is open till 2....good spot for one on one convo action.....great place in a great location....bucktown....
