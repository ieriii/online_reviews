I like the upstairs more than the downstairs. It's more casual and a great place to get some rice and a dessert late night.  I want to make a note of how nice one of the bartenders there is. Cute little girl that gave my blind date attitude when he showed up fifteen minutes late. Thank you!  He ordered a bottle of champagne and she filled his flute higher than mine each time she lifted the bottle. Good Lookin' out sweetie! I've had dinner here downstairs with a large group of friends and the service there was excellent as well. Good, fresh food. The bathroom is upstairs and nothing to note.
