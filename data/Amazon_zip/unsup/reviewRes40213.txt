I love this place. I love the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe. I love pretty much everything I've ever eaten here. You know what I don't love? Having to overhear obnoxious foodie conversations at the next table. And I super-don't love having that juicebox at the next table lean over and tell me how Epic the scallops or whatever I ordered are. Seriously, want some advice? Stop using that word. Never say "epic" not in reference to, like, the Kalevala. Never ever. Moratorium. Always never be saying that word. So yeah, that seems to happen here way too often, but it's not really anyone's fault and other than that the place is tops.
