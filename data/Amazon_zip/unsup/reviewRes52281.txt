I don't know why people are so crazy about this place. We ordered delivery and the pizza arrived in less than an hour and piping hot. That's awesome. But the sauce is plain, the cheese is rubbery, the deep dish crust is too doughy, the think crust is not crisp and the hot wings are too salty. I wish it was better but this is really my experience. I think Giordano's is way better.
