We waited in line for an hour and a half to pick up our dogs. Worth. Every. Second. We had the duck fat fries (which came in an enormous portion); Buffalo sausage with bacon-garlic mayo and horseradish cheddar cheese; and foie gras and sauterners duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris. The duck sausage was out-of-this world fantastic. It was simply the best thing that I've ever eaten for under $10. This place is amazing. And it's really a must-go-to spot. I will happily wait in that line again.
