Not much more I can say about Frontera or Rick Bayless that hasn't been said in the 233 previous reviews: yes, the food, the drink, the space and the service are that good. What I CAN add though, is a suggestion: a weekend brunch or lunch instead of a dinner is a great deal here, and a fantastic way for us pedestrian folk to experience the delicious love without having to break the bank. Don't forget to call (way) ahead for a reservation!
