This Westin really does a disservice to the brand. My husband and I are loyal SPG customers and tend to stay on points whenever we travel. For a two night stay in Chicago in June 2010 we were choosing between the W and the Westin and we really chose poorly! The room was barely passable, the bathroom was moldy and the service was indifferent at best. There are lots of great hotels in Chicago - do yourself a favor and stay at one of those.
