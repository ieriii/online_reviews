Worst service in the history of service. I was so excited to finally find a vegetarian joint, a place to call home, a place to visit over and over again. Instead I got lectured for seating myself in a half empty restaurant with no host and no 'please wait to be seated sign'. After that I just stayed for my own amusement to observe the insanity. Later another woman came in and seated herself, but this time Mr. Crazy controlled his emotions and kept his mouth shut. I was proud of him. The food was eh, and I felt ill for the rest of the day. Maybe I should have just left.
