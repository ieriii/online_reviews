- An experience you need to try in your lifetime. Before going there, you may think paying that much money (cost $520 for 2) is a mistake even if it is the 7th best restaurant in the world, but you'll soon see you are mistaken! I even thought it was cheap when I left there! - The staff were friendly and I didn't expect that. I thought everything will be super formal but it was not like that. - I went there at 9:30pm (the latest time they accept you) and were there till 1:00am on a weekday. It was a mistake. Reserve an earlier time if you want to fully enjoy it or go there on weekend. - The items are small but there are 20 of them. Don't eat anything beforehand otherwise you'll regret it. - There is no sign saying valet parking or anything like that, but you'll see the guys on the street who will take care of finding a spot for parking. Just tell them you are going to Alinea. - The menu will be given to you at the end. If Grant Achatz the great chef is not there that night, give them your address with the menu and he'll sign it and they'll mail it you.
