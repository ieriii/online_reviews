This place is great. From their specialty tea all the way to their mixed drinks. I had the vegetarian Shirin Polo. I would have never guessed you could get that many different flavors in rice, vegetables and mushrooms. It was amazing.  Not too heavy and the flavor was outstanding. My girlfriend loves the kabobs.  The place can get busy and it's a bit awkward waiting for a table as their really is no designated waiting area and you always feel like your standing in someone else's eating space. No one really wants to stand next to a table full of people eating. Overall this place has some of the greatest food I've ever had.
