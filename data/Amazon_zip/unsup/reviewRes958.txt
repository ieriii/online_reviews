Overrated. Sorry - these better be some goddamn amazing hot dogs as there were people waiting in line at 10:00 AM. They open at 10:30 AM. Chicago = cold. We got the foie gras dog, the Chicago dog, the Rib-eye dog, and some chicken sausage dog. We got fries. Man, I was not impressed by the foie gras dog - I thought it was going to be totally awesome and it was just a hot dog with some cold foie on top. I liked my Chicago dog a lot better. I thought the fries here were pretty awesome, though. Pretty freakin' awesome. I would've given this place three stars if it wasn't for how good the fries were and for how chill the workers were. Is it worth the line? Does it live up to the hype? Not in my book - but it seems like a cool touristy thing to do.
