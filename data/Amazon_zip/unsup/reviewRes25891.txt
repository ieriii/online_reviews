So, it had been awhile, Simply It. But for me, pho is a cold-weather food and that's what I primarily order here. The other night, as I'm luxuriating in full flannel PJs parked in front of my TV, my first pho craving in ages struck. I ordered a bowl along with some lemongrass chicken and received my meticulously-packaged pho (it's a bit of a b*itch to transport, I know) in under than hour. Also in the package? A complimentary Thai iced tea, a container of fresh plums, and a handwritten note from the owner acknowledging that I hadn't ordered in awhile and they were happy to have my business. Now THAT's customer service, right? Love.
