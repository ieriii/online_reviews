I came for my first-ever poetry slam, and enjoyed myself a lot. The venue has all kinds of atmosphere, as other reviewers describe. One person in my group didn't like it though. Both the atmosphere and the slam itself are a strong taste that won't appeal to everyone. Not a good date unless your date is cerebral. Also, the f bomb was dropped constantly on stage. I'm fine with that, but not everyone would be, so be aware. I don't drink alcohol, but for what it's worth, I had the best ginger ale with lime here. They put in a lot of lime and the sweet puckery taste was great. A friend had an apple martini and said it was very sweet but very good. The slam itself ran from 7pm to 10pm. I'll be back, and I'll probably perform next time.
