What more can really be written about such an iconic restaurant? Not much, but... Simple confirmation that you can go with kids, without dealing with the many members on here that bitch about kids (they probably know to avoid it); You can get a really good burger; You have the option to explore their historic salad bar (which, has more of a reputation rather than being anything exceptional). Basically, go for a good burger.
