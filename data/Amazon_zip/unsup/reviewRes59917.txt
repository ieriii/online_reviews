Sign me up for some more of those core fusion classes at Exhale because I stuffed my face last night with the biggest red velvet cake ever. And I enjoyed every minute of it! I probably should have stopped at the cupcake, but nope. Decided to have some of those coffee flavored tarts as well. Believe me- they were well worth the calories.
