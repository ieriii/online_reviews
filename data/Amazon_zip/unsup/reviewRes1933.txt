Hot Doug's!!! I visited you twice and had to turn away because of the RIDICULOUS minimum 2-hour long wait. AAARGH I am shaking my fist to the sky! In fact, I'm so frustrated, I might start my own hot dogs business RIGHT outside your restaurant. Me and my hot dog cart will make a KILLING while you make people wait for hours and hours and hours for some supposedly crazy-delicious dogs.
