Recipe for a "proper" Costa Rican meal: 1) Food should include some combination of the following: - Pineapple - Beef (or other protein if beef's really not your thing) - Beans - Lizano sauce 2) Bring friends. Bring wine. 3) Eat. Be merry. Enjoy. Eat more. Pura Vida! P.S. Make sure to add a side of gallo pinto to your order. Trust me.
