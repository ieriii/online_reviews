The place really impressed me until I tried the food... I really wanted to like it because it was a godsend to have an organic restaurant in the neighborhood, but everything was just "okay". I had the burger... the beef was just "alright" and the bun completely fell apart as I ate it...not cool. I had the grits as a side...it was interesting for the first couple of bites, but then I was quickly over it...I didn't even finish them and I am a pig that usually finishes off everything! Anyway, it was bad enough that I don't think that I will try it again...
