As I was thoroughly enjoying all the delicious food here, the thought crept into my mind: "Why is it so hard to find good, affordable, unfussy authentic Italian food in Atlanta?" And I realized it's because there just wasn't--and probably never will be--a large Italian immigrant population there. And, as I was stuffing a mouthful of ooey gooey burrata cheese and molten roasted tomato, laced with perfectly seasoned basil pesto into my maw, I lamented this fact. I hadn't had soulful, seemingly effortless Italian food like this since Sicily. But was it damn welcome. Got the aforementioned burrata salad, risotto (very good - you can tell they toast the arborio first), and the pizza with pork belly, also quite tasty. Their pizza definitely isn't their forte, but still quite competent. They were out of the sea urchin linguine...yes, I pouted a little. Wish I had room for dessert, but glad I left a "happy" full, rather than a stuffed full.
