Always on the look out for good steakhouses. Ruth's Chris rarely disappoints. Then again, I order the same thing..haha. This place is consistent, to say the least. Everyone puts their unique twist on preparing their steak. Ruth's Chris is all about the butter sauce & piping hot sizzling plates. On my last visit, I had their Three Course Meal for $33 deal during Restaurant Week. The mixed salad was OUTSTANDING! Large portion, light honey balsamic vinegarette dressing. My dinner companions and I ordered the 8 oz FILET MIGNON & 12 oz RIBEYE. The chef cooked the meat perfectly.  We had 3 choices of side dishes. The MASHED POTATOES and CREAMED SPINACH were the best. Share!! The small cups of fruit custard and chocolate mousse were sub par.
