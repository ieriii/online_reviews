It's the best Jerry, the BEST!  I will be frequenting this establishment in the future, many times. We four had the peking duck dinner. Expertly carved tableside, served with hoisin sauce, scallions, pickled veggies, baos/buns, duck fried rice, and duck soup. The duck soup is meh, but a bowl of soup on the side is always a nice treat. The fried rice is tasty, not terribly greasy, and it has little hunks of duck. I could eat hundreds of the baos ($3/order of six), and they make a delicious sandwich medium for crafting duck w/ scaillion sand wiches.  Other highlights, busboy hustle, $3 beers, and open kitchen in front
