I definitely have to be in the mood for sushi. That being said, when I have been in the mood and subsequently eaten here, I have been pleased. They have a big menu, they're not too pricey, and they serve fresh and delicious sushi. However, it is very busy and you almost always need a reservation. Parking is also a pain. I think this place is hyped up and overrated. I think you can find good, reasonably priced sushi almost anywhere, but I'm no expert!
