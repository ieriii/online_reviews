I don't like to wait, so I checked out Revolution on a Saturday at 5. OK, I'm not 90, I promise, but I just have a thing about sitting down to eat when I get to a restaurant. I guess I could have checked if they take rezos, I just didn't. In any case, we got there at a perfect time, it was buzzing, the bar was pretty full but not packed and we got seated right away. My friend is a beer snob, so he was pretty happy with the dark and sticky choices. He doesn't ever have to worry about me stealing his beer, I'm more of a light and refreshing gal. We both enjoyed our selections. We started with the PEI mussels with hard cider, apple, leek and blue cheese. OMG. I loved them. I have never tasted blue cheese used the way they did. It wasn't overpowering, more like a broth with kick-ass flavor. I wish they would have provided me with a loaf of bread to use as a vehicle to get that goodness into my belly. He had the buffalo chicken pizza and while some say chicken has no business being on a pizza, Revolution has done it well. Spicy and delicious although could have used a bit more sauce. I had the hombre burger. Good, but it wasn't spicy at all and was seriously lacking salt. The blue cheese potato salad was awesome. Service was spot-on. I wasn't wearing head to toe black, so I didn't fit in as well as I might have otherwise. There were a lot of beards.
