I have been waiting a while to try Uncommon Ground and decided to give it a shot for breakfast. I had my dog with me and I sat outside and they were very accommodating and even brought her water. The food was good but for what I got, it was too expensive for breakfast/brunch. They have a $14 BLT?! I would like to go back and try it again for dinner to see if there is more of a value for the money.
