The location was excellent and the staff was wonderful. The staff was friendly, professional, and met every expectation. The room was adequate, but not special in any way. There was a whirpool tub and a shower stall. The shower stall was very tight (and I'm slender!), but the water pressure was amazing. Some rust on the hinges in the bathroom and discolored rubber molding in the bathroom showed its wear and tear. I have not seen a TV that old in a hotel room since the 1990s. The beds were only double, while the industry standard is now queens. If you asked the right question you received internet access for free, otherwise there was a daily fee. A decent place to stay all-in-all, but not as good as I expected.
