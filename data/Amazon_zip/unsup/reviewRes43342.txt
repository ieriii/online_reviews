#1 rule for art's --- DO NOT GET DELIVERY!!! it is completely infuriating to wait for your food as long as it takes them to get it to you. just do yourself a favor and call for carry out or go pick up some slices to go. delivery=the devil here. terrible. the pizza is great and $2.75 for a huge filling slice isn't a bad deal either. we usually go and pick up about 5 slices (2 for me, 3 for the bf) and get a free liter of pepsi product with it. there is always a good selction of slices available to go. i'd recommend the art's special or anything w/ spinach, shrooms, peppers, and onions. great crust, tasty cheese, sauce with great flavor. another good menu choice is the chicken parm - comes with a good sized salad and garlic bread as well. is enough chicken parm to feed two people, a good deal! can't beat art's if you go pick it up yourself! there is parking, but watch for crazy huge SUV drivers in the lot. there are for some reason always lots of them and it's a pretty tight space to manuever in!
