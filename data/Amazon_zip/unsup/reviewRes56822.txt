Amazing pizza. I love this place so much. I have taken friends, family, out of town visitors...and it is always delicious. It never disappoints. Also, the owner of the restaurant is often kind enough to hand out free samples of this or that while you wait. When my mother came from out of town he treated us both to a sweet limoncello. Also, when I once spilled an ENTIRE glass of red wine on my favorite jeans the waiter was more remorseful than the guy I had come with. He immediately brought me towels and a stain stick. The stick was a bit small for the stain (which we had a good laugh about)...but I used it anyway and the whole thing came out in the wash. I agree with others here that the pizza is the real deal. And I'm sorry but, it sure helps to have a great waitstaff as well...
