So I have gone to quite a few sushi bars in my day, and now living in Chicago it seems there is one every 10 feet. Coast has now become my local spot to grab some late night sushi. I have been there a half dozen times now and other than busy weekends I have always been seated quickly and politely, also I like the ambiance of the whole place. It's dim-lit, comfortable and even though you are sitting really close to the table next to you, it's still enjoyable. The fish is always tastes really fresh and I think that the prices are pretty affordable, especially since it's BYOB and theres no corking fee. Unfortunately, you can only bring one bottle of wine per 2 people. My favorite part though is that they serve until midnight, so when that late night sushi craving hits, away I go.
