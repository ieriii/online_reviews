This is truly a dining EXPERIENCE. We had a party of 5 and we all opted for the "Tour", which was 27 courses. The other 4 members of the party all have many years of experience within the food/restaurant industry (3 restaurant owners and 1 executive chef) under their belts. From the outside, this restaurant doesn't appear as anything special, as it is situated behind an unmarked entrance. Upon entering, there's a narrow, dimly lit corridor. At the end, another door automatically opened, allowing one to enter the restaurant. The kitchen was full of artists, carefully leaned over the stainless-steel tables, creating their masterpieces.  The service was excellent, which was up to par with what was expected. They were extremely attentive to the activity of the table, as no course was served until all parties were present at the table. When one person left the table, it was almost as if everything was to cease. Their knowledge of everything being served was impressive, as they were able to explain each course served. The food...a-mazing. There were certainly some flavor combinations to which I was not accustomed, as each course offered something different, inventive. These are flavors and "results" which have been carefully considered of the fusion created. The food isn't cooked in the sense that you just taste a blend of everything mixed together. Rather, you an taste each of the specific flavors involved in the individual course. The courses were surprising, as some were solid foods, while others were purely liquid, or even simply in the form of foam. I did manage to taste every single course, which were all delicious, against my stomach's wish to be pushed to its limits.  Highly recommended, as this will open your eyes/palate to food as an art form and more.
