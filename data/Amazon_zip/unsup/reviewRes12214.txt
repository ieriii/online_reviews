I probably get Piece more then any other pizza. A big part of this is that I live very close, and the pizza is still very hot when I get it back to my house. The other reason is they have the best thin crust in Wicker Park (though a Santullo's slice hits the spot).  Tried many of the beers on the tap, and have enjoyed almost all of them.
