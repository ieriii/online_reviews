Went to Nana for the third time for dinner last night, second time experiencing the Sunday Supper. For $22 p/p you get deviled eggs, mac and cheese, biscuits, fried chicken, house slaw, veggies, and dessert. Add on a cocktail or coffee and its the perfect end to a Sunday. My favorite parts of the meal are the slaw, vinegar based not mayo based, and the chicken. I swear they brine that meat in something serious before frying so it stays super moist. Desserts are always great. I've also been many times for breakfast and brunch. My go to items are huevos rancheros, the stuffed french toast, any dish that comes with the house lemon curd (that stuff is amazing). Yes it isn't cheap, but well worth the price. Staff has always been nice. Especially that time I face planted the morning of my birthday brunch. Fun times! :)
