We're new to the neighborhood and were thrilled to discover Calo. It's our favorite standby. The menu is very expansive, the prices are very fair, and the service is always attentive and friendly. We LOVE the thin crust pizza and have some great luck with a few pasta dishes. I have been disappointed by their fish and chicken... so head somewhere else if you craving a big plate of protein. I wouldn't describe Calo as being upscale, as some other reviewers do. In my opinion, it is very comfortable, casual and friendly. Almost like a supper club. A perfect place for a easy-going and yummy meal!
