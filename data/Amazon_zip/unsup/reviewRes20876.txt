By far my favorite sushi place in the city. I frequent sushi restaurants because I follow a gluten free diet, so I have been to plenty of sushi joints. The rolls are always great and I have yet to try one of the specials that I did not like. Also, every once in a while they have a flourless chocolate cake on the dessert menu that is very good. The only things keeping this place as 4 stars instead of 5 for me are below: 1. Parking can be a bit dodgy. I recommend getting a cab or walking if you live nearby. 2. Crowded. If you know you are going to go there to eat, be sure to make reservations well in advance. 3.BYOB policy. They changed this a couple of years back. Instead of being able to bring whatever booze you wanted you are now restricted to either 1 750ml bottle of wine or six pack per two people. You can get around this by simply asking the hostess or manager when you arrive if you can bring in more. They do not enforce the rule very hard and I typically bring in a bottle of wine and a six pack of gluten free beer every time I go there with my fiance.
