I heard Grand Lux shares the same owners as Cheesecake Factory, and it shows in the food, prices, and decor. Like Cheesecake, it's a huge restaurant! Grand Lux has a huge foyer for waiting and a long escalator that takes you up to the actual restaurant. It's a great tourist spot because it's right along Michigan Avenue. There is always a wait here. And if you can stand waiting 15 extra minutes, you can be seated in that round window room that overlooks Mich Ave. Both the food and service are fantastic, I even love the salad dressing! I like to get the half sandwich/bowl of soup/salad combo for $9. It is just enough food, and the chicken salad sandwich is heavenly!
