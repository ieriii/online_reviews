Went on a Saturday night without a reservation and my husband and I were lucky to get a table right away. We weren't super hungry so we ordered the cheddar bacon hush puppies, a pulled pork sandwich, and mac and cheese. The pork was the highlight of our meal. It was tender and yummy and came on a pretzel bun (with fries). i thought the hush puppies were good (but super dry) and the mac and cheese was a little looser than i like my mac and cheese. our total- with a beer, a cocktail and a coffee was $50 which seemed like a great price for good food and such a busy atmosphere. I'd go here again but i wouldn't consider it to be super amazing.
