A pleasant find!! Wonderful combination of bar scene and excellent restaurant; we had a 7 pm Saturday reservation (which I recommend - amazing how many young and not so young professionals are in the loop on Saturday night...which is great!)...we were seated in the back / which we asked for...away from the noise / bar so my 62 year old ears could function)....very friendly / prompt service....they had Two Heart IPA on draft - so my night was complete before we began....Marty had a good white which seemed expensive until she noted is was an 8 ounce pour...great idea...they also offer half pours if you're just testing... She had the fish and chips....which were wonderful and even too much to eat...I had the risotto of the day...also very tasty with a wonderful texture... Bottom line....very good...will be back...
