This two star rating is the result of poor service. The food was good-- cucumber salad was delicious and the rolls we got were good as well (though perhaps a bit overpriced.) My sister and I went for dinner around 6:30. The small dining room was about 1/3 filled so we got seated right away. But then we sat there for at least ten minutes without a server taking our order. I finally asked if we had a server, and someone came over to get our drink orders. There were about 10 people flitting around the dining room and everyone else appeared to be taken care of, so this may have been a fluke. If i go back and the service is better I'll change the rating.
