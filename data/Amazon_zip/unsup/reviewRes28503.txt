Ive been looking forward to going to Graham Elliott for a while and although it was good, it didnt knock my socks off. Our reservation was for 9:15pm and it was packed but they got us in right on time. The appetizers for our table of 4 were great -- lobster corndog, tuna sashimi were great -- wings were spicy hot but in a good way. The entrees were where it all fell short. It took an incredibly long time to get our food and when it came it was obviously reheated. The steak with root beer BBQ sauce was a bit on the sweet side and the beans definitely tasted reheated. My whitefish was ok but lukewarm and the beans were cold. Pretty sure they werent supposed to be!
