Went on a Wednesday for All You Can Eat Lunch Buffet. Went to taste same at Klay Oven the following Friday for comparison. India House: Pricey but more variety; Overall Tasty; some dishes a tad watery; basmati rice high quality, perfectly cooked and fresh; Tandoori Chicken served separate from buffet had great presentation but not as tasty as Klay Oven; DO NOT arrive "late" for buffet as they frown on this and as a result service may be less than friendly. Mostly I felt rushed and like my patronage was unwanted even though the place was practically empty. (I showed up 20 minutes before 2:30 pm which is when they shut the buffet down) Klay Oven: Very Reasonable but little variety; Overall Tasty; Tandoori chicken really good; rice did not seem to be high quality basmati and was a tad sticky; very nice and attentive wait staff; felt at home. I give each of them 4 stars. The differences balance these places out. Granted I have never been to India and don't know what "authentic" tastes like but I do love, love, love me some good tasting food. The black bean dish at Klay Oven was really tasty. (sorry can't remember name). Loved the chicken tikki Masala (not sure if this is what they called it but it was similar to this) and the mushroom vegetable dish (again sorry I don't remember the name).
