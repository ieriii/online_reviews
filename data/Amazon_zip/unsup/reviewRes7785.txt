Great food at reasonable prices. Nice Chicago atmosphere and very good wait staff. The food was original and good. Not overly salted to hide flavors. Good wine list with some reasonably priced gems. Nice place for a family dinner. The only negative for me is that the noise level gets a little loud because of the narrow space. Honestly, pretty place, good food, and excellent service
