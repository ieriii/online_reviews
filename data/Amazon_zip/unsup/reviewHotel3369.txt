THIS PLACE IS A GEM. On a last minute trip to Chicago - we booked this hotel. The price is super reasonable considering its prime location - located on Michigan Avenue - its right across Grant Park and in walking distance to museums and other tourist attractions. Their hotel staff is polite & courteous and helpful in giving directions and suggestions.  The hotel room is pretty tricked out. I mean, the Essex is much smaller in comparison to the other hotels on the block, but first walking into the hotel room, it was dec'd out pretty nice. The room we got was furnished with a queen bed and a full sofa, mini fridge and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was kind of small, but you never lost the feel of a 4 star hotel. For those not accustomed to traveling into big cities - paying for parking is standard. So its just something you have to calculate into your budget. The perk is, that although some hotels require you to park / walk to your own car - the Essex services valet into that cost. I'm definitely staying at the Essex Inn the next time I'm in Chicago!
