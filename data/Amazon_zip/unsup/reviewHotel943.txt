I'm giving Red Roof Inn 4 stars if only for the fact that I was one block away from Michigan Avenue and only had to pay $120 a night. That being said, the rooms are the sizes of small dorm rooms and how they fit 2 full sized beds and a dresser in there is beyond my mental ability. No joke, there was about a foot and a half between the foot of the bed and the wall. The bathroom wasn't much better, though it was clean and that was my only concern. I have to say that while this Red Roof Inn was run down, it wasn't dirty or grimy. The staff was non-existent. That's good if nothing goes wrong, but if you had any needs I don't know if that would be a plus. $33 a night for parking is a crime where I come from, but like I said, you're getting a steal with the price of the room.
