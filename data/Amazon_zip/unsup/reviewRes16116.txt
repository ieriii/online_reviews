I have never had a bad meal here, food is great, well priced and big portions......only some bad attitude from the host/hostess/manager I usually always make a reservation......the last two times I went, they said they had no reservation...and the guy looked at me like I made the mistake....saying " There is no reservation " in a very accusing manner.......not a way to treat someone who is walking into your place of business and wants to give you money ........ As someone in the business, I think the correct thing would have been, not let me know they screwed up and say " Oh yes sir , right this way " The place was not busy, there were plenty of tables available..... I guess my point is...treat the customer for who he is...someone supporting your business ......
