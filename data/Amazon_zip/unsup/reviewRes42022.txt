Favorites here were roasted bone marrow on toast & grilled duroc pork belly entree. On Toast: The bone marrow was so flavorful and came with this delicious caramelized onion on the side that complemented the bread so well. We also had the foie gras & pork liver mousse on toast & the steak tartare on toast as well. These were also good, but not as good as the bone marrow. In addition, the later 2 entrees came with sandwich sliced toast vs. a thick loaf of bread slice that comes w/ the marrow. In fact, the steak tartare was better eaten without the toast since it took away from the tartare flavor and since it's not too salty, it can be eaten without the toast.  Entree: Duroc pork belly was amazingly..each bite was juicy and full of flavor. So tender, it didn't require a knife to cut. It sat on top of braised kale & a smoked chili sauce which complemented the pork belly, but did not overpower it. Sides: Crispy Kennebec fries came w/ a garlic aioli dipping sauce. Fries were thick and CRISPY. I asked the waiter what "Kennebec" was and apparently it's a type of potato that guarantees crispiness when fried, which stayed true to its name. Only downside is they salted the fries a bit much. Especially with the yummy sauce, it didn't need that much salt sprinkled on it. Pasta: Truffle pasta w/ handcut noodles: Truffle flavor was apparent and pasta had small slices of melted cheese on top. The pasta is done "italian style," where the noodles are on the "harder" end (boiled less)...which I like b/c I don't like soggy noodles. Good for sharing as a side, but wouldn't eat this as an entree b/c it's so rich, it would become too much after a few bites.
