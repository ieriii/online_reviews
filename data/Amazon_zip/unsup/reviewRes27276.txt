Does Rick Bayless need my positive review on Yelp? Ummm, noooo, but he's agonna get it! Haha Hands down the best tamale I ever had-- and it was with goat meat, go figure. We walked in, no reservation on a Friday shortly after open. We could wait 40 minutes for a table or be seated immediately at the bar. We took the bar. A pleasure! Everything was wonderful! It was a pricey lunch for sure (I got the most expensive entree on the menu, plus we both had an app, and shared a dessert) but it was a special occasion and a unique dining experience. So excited to have had my first Rick "Top Chef Masters" Bayless experience!! Yay! P.S. Make a reservation. Don't go rogue like I did!
