I've been here multiple times now and each time is more disappointing then the previous visit. After coming back from a recent trip to Italy and have great experiences, the pizzas here at Spacca are bland. Another reviewer described it as pita like and would agree. The service is generally good overall, but in the last visit, we felt rushed. Every 3-4 minutes someone came by asking are you done? can I take your plate? When I'm holding a piece of pizza in my hand eating it, figure it out - I'm not done eating. I don't think I'll be back.
