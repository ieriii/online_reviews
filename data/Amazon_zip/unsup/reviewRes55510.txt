Easy to find, just a 2 minute walk from the blue line station. I sat at the bar. The waitress was extremely nice. She accidentally spilled infront of me a bloody Mary that she was preparing. She apologized repeatedly and gave me an employee discount. Woohoo :) I had a vegetarian egg croissant which was good. The best part of it was the croissant itself which was delish. I also had the pretzel white chocolate pancake which was superb. I will probably need the recipe.
