Ricotta lemon hemp pancakes are delicious, though presentation could use some work. Try serving the fruit ontop, perhaps... Chilaquilas were also very tasty after getting over the lasagna style square cut. We'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. Others might not find the food presentation disagreeable, but all will agree on the overall great tastes!
