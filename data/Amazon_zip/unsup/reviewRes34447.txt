You can't go wrong with Yolk. Everything here is fantastic. The service is FAST. The breakfast and lunch are FABULOUS. It is ran by a nice Greek family, but I disagree with the comment that it is a tarted up Greek diner.  Yolk has a number of creative takes on breakfast classics! The orange bread French Toast and Huevos Rancheros are two popular items. The coffee is FANTASTIC! A word of caution. The line sometimes is out the door on the weekends (30-45 minute wait). Go early or grab a muffin from their case to nibble on if you are really hungry. Trust me, the wait is worth it!!!!!
