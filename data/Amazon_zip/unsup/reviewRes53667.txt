I'm normally not that into food preparation and all that jazz, but this impressed me its almost worth all the reservations pains. They've got some really weird dishes, but well executed, you'd think there was these dishes made up from long ago. Well made, weird dishes is what I can say. Quail Egg Ravioli = win.
