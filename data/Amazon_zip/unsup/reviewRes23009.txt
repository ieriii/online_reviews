This is one of those joints that you might walk by a hundred times and never notice, but it is worth a visit or two. Serving up Costa Rican and Caribbean specialties, Irazu is probably best known for their stellar shakes. Every flavor is excellent and especially refreshing after a trip to the gym or working in the yard. Everytime I've eaten here, I feel like I empty a bottle of hot sauce to contrast the bland, but hearty servings. The service is extremely friendly which more than offsets the average food. NOTE: They only take cash, so make sure you hit an ATM beforehand.
