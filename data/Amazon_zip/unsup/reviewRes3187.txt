The food is pretty good, if you are into fried food, and reasonably priced. However, I find the interior to be very awkward. At busy times, there is hardly space to wait for your food. The communal tables sound like a cute idea, but I think they could seat more with smaller tables. And I have gotten stuck across some messy strangers that kind of killed my appetite.
