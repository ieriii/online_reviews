Very inovative. I heart this place.....great atmosphere, inovative food, byob! I have eaten at some the best restaurants in the world and the food here is fabulous and at a great price point. I also had some things I have never eaten before...jellyfish anyone? By far my favorite dish was the antelope with the white chocolate sauce and the kona kompachi. It is definately worth dining here and I will be back. I gave it 4 stars intead of 5 because I felt some of the flavors in the amuse and artic char roe weren't balanced..some ingredients were overpowering.
