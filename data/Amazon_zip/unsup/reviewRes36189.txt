I have eaten at Sun Wah for more than 30 years. I moved to the West coast and returned today to lunch there. Kelly, Eddy's (the owner) daughter and her 2 siblings are running the place. The new digs are spacious, clean and well appointed. I noticed wine being offered. The menu remains the same, The BBQ are always fresh (all cooked on the premises) and outstanding. I love the roast port, soy chicken and roast duck. Their menu offers are also excellent with fresh sea food in a tank being offered. Their dry flat rice noodles (hor fun) with beef is outstanding. Never been disappointed. Service was always good for me. Good for lunch and dinner. Caters to large group as well.
