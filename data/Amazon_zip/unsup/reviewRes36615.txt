This has always been a staple in my delivery food. Really reliable with a wide variety on their menu. Typical Thai and japanese dishes mixed in with some of their own creations. The Sashimi platter is really nice for those doing low-carb. Lots of large pieces. Wonderful crab rangoon - I get an order everytime no matter what I am ordering. Huge props on presentation which is difficult on take out. The only reason it is not a 5 was last night I ordered the Chili pepper stir fry which was just ok and I like my entrees to be two meals, which theirs is just one.
