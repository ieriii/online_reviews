Not that this place really needs more reviews, but legit cheesy wonderful deep dish pizza. Some people think there's too much cheese -- those people don't like cheese as much as I do. If you're dining in, expect a long wait on the weekends. They do let you put in your orders while you're waiting though, which (slightly) speeds up the process once you are seated.
