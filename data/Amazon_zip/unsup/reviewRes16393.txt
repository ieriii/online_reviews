I have never had a meal at Carnivale that I didn't enjoy! Working down the block, I get to enjoy this trendy, but unique little gem, formerly known as the Drink, for lunch and Dinner. The benefit is that They have two completely different Menu's! Dinner, you can't go wrong with the Pernil, it's a rum glazed Pork shoulder over a bed of dirty rice and fried plantains. AMAZING! The Beef Appetizers are to die for! I am not much of a ceviche guy, but even I enjoyed them, they are well known for their ceviches. For a Cocktail, I would highly recommend the Raspberry Mojitos, I never drink anything fruity, but this is a very exquisite beverage. Made from scratch right on the spot, it is even a bit of a thirst quencher.  During the lunch hours, I would recommend the Milanesa Sandwich, breaded chicken breast with milanesa seasonings on a toasted roll, awesome! The Guacamole is excellent as well, they have an entire bar devoted to the making of Guac! How could it not be great!?! two people just sit back there, and make Guac to order! Their home made chips are very unique and delicious as well. The servers are all unique, my personal favorite is Carlos, or Carlito, he has been my dinner server several times, and always comes through. The managers are all very helpful and everyone is knowledgeable.
