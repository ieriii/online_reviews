Went for weekend brunch. The food was still great. We got there at 11:15 and waited for them to open since they open at 11:30, apparently, so everything was fresh. The buffet was steaming hot and had a really good variety, with popular favorites like saag paneer and then other items I didn't know (or like!) as much such as fish curry. However, the place was a zoo. The service was nowhere near as good as it was at dinner, and the atmosphere is diminished when every table is full, with people up and down out of their chairs (yes, it's a buffet) and talking loudly. I did, however, leave my wallet there and the manager delivered it to my house, so major kudos there. In future, although this remains my favorite Indian restaurant in the area, I will stick to the quieter and more relaxing dinner hours.
