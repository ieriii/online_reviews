Ok, I have to give it 5 stars...the only thing I was disappointed was that I didn't have enough room in my tummy to try everything on the menu. i was so stuffed. The food I did get to try was the beef burrito, all 3 flavors of wings, the mushrooms, onion rings, and bi bim bop. Wow! was it all tasty. I was sweating so much from the spicy but tolerable wings. I can't wait to go back for more. The group of 7 friends and cousin's I brought with were very happy as well. The owners' Jae and Doug were very friendly and helpful in making our visit a memorable one.
