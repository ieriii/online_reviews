The first 5 star rating I give goes to Purple Pig. Wow! Everything we had was excellent. But the one that was over the top was the bone marrow. It was like bacon butter served on delicious bread. But let's be real it could have been served on anything and it would have still tasted great.  Can't go wrong with this place.
