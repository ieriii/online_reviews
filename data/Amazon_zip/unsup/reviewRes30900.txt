I know this place has been around for ages, but I've only recently had the chance to try it. What's not to love? This place is great, especially if you're a vegetarian. And since I don't always make it to the north side, I have to say it's another one of those places that I wish could get to more often. The space it's in is clean and cozy. There are wooden booths that seat four all along the south wall. Then a middle aisle of chrome-edged diner tables and chairs, and then another set along the north wall. The place was half-filled but not at all crowded on a Thursday at lunchtime when we went. We were greeted with a smile and seated right away. The room is sunny and pleasant and made more cheery by about a dozen hanging plants (both real and fake). I love the variety of things onthe menu. They have a menu of specials and drinks and then a larger menu of all their regular items. They had things ranging from burritos to burgers, meatloaf and "chicken"--all meatless of course, and the items with cheese can be made with either vegan cheese or dairy cheese. As an appetizer, I had an order of the seitan hot wings, which came with celery and ranch dressing. The sauce was dead on exactly what you would get on hot wings. the seitan came in sticks (not pressed into any wng shape or anything) and were very tasty. As my main course, I got the "bacon cheeseburger" and a side of sweet potato fries. Very, very satisfying, all of it. Sometimes even a vegetarian craves a bacon cheeseburger. The one I had here came pretty close, thought he bacon was not as crispy as it could have been. Nonetheless, the Kaiser roll, sprouts, grated carrots, onions and lettuce that came on the burger were just terrific.  This place is terrific. I can't wait to return and eat my way through the menu!
