Back again and this time brought the husband for a taste of Pig. I read through some of the other reviews and had to laugh when people were complaining about the lack of non-meat items. The place has GIANT pictures of PIGS on the wall - come on. Do your research and know what you are getting into. Anyway, things are just as good as the last time I was here in the summer, if not better (since fall lends itself to some really creative hearty foods). This time we were seated by the front windows and it made me sigh in relief since I think whomever would have been next to the husband at a communal table would have been short on space given his shoulder span. We ended up ordering the pork rinds (Still delish), three oysters (mine), frites, the taste of three hams (IA, VA and Spain tonight), the cassoulet (mine) and the suckling pig (his). This was plenty of food and we enjoyed it all. I could not come close to finishing the cassoulet, but really wanted to, it was that good. The husband loved the VA ham and his suckling pig and had a few Trappist Ales and a whiskey from the list. I went with the demi sec cider on draft and a port (SO STRONG!) with dessert - the perfect waffle. I made the husband eat half of the waffle telling him he would not believe how expertly it is made and he agreed. All of this indulging was only $160 before tip, which is really reasonable when you consider how many different things we had and how top notch the service is. I truly love this place for its laid back and fun experience - very different from some of the places just down the road. And - we walked over and saw that they are opening a butcher shop just across the road to the east! Fabulous idea - I will definitely be a customer there! Now I have to get over here for brunch...
