Hopleaf has an amazing selection of beers. The only reason it gets four stars is because you have to order your food at the bar if you sit in the front and it gets a little crowded on weekends. I enjoyed trying new beers and enjoying the genuine bar atmosphere. The steak brisket sandwich and fries were on the higher end of what I would expect for bar food. Definitely a spot to revisit.
