Having eaten here over 100 times, I can write you an honest review from many angles. 1. The Pizza - some of the best I have had in Chicago, despite being from New Haven, CT. It is thin crust, and the flavors are a mouth massage. Usually I get their traditional red sauce pizza, but sometimes I get crazy and have the white pizza with sausage and banana peppers. That is one of the best pizzas I have EVER had. Often I get extra cheese, because they don't slop a ton on there and well I like mine cheesy. 2. The beer - AWARD WINNING for a reason. My favorites are the Dark n Curvy and the Worryin Ale. They also have a great bottle list in case you want to have something outside of their own brew.3. The appetizers - a very short list, but the warm spinach and tomato dip is very tasty.4. The atmosphere - busy, for a reason. so show up, put your name in, and stand by the bar with beers while you wait for your table. There are plenty of TVs with sports on. Thursday and Saturday they have karaoke, and it's good stuff. For big groups they have a lower area up front so if you want to throw a party they will hook you up.5. Takeout - right next door, call ahead and it will be ready to go!6. Staff - very helpful and friendly.50 stars in my book
