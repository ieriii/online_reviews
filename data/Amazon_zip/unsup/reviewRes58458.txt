Man, what a bummer. I saw all of these great reviews and I thought this is perfect for my sister's birthday dinner of 10! However, I'm no dummy that is just going to plan a whole group dinner based on strangers reviews, so I went there tonight Friday at 6pm. We were both starving-would have thought anything was great. (let me also preface this by saying we do have good taste in food and I cook very well myself.) The bruchette which the mgr recommended was extremely full of garlic. I could pick large chunks out. Next we chose the grilled vegetables which my boyfriend believed must have been from a frozen bag since he works for a restaurant and knows the difference-however these were not bad. After that I got frutta del mar which is clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari with lunguini. Very OK-I really didn't like it much. My boyfriend (who loves pasta got spagetti-how can you mess that up. He said it was over cooked and filled with garlic. The name of the restaurant should really be garlic. No itialian music, definitely not owned by italians. I think the only reason people go there is because its BYOB. I'd rather pay for over priced wine than over priced and over hyped food. Worst part is that I had to cancel a 10 top for Sunday and have to find a new restaurant for my family(
