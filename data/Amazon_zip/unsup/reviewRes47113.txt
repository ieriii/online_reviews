Visited for the first time because of the Open House Chicago event. Wanted to see the roof top garden and we decided to have brunch/lunch. Extremely fresh ingredients with an unusual combination of ingredients with delicious results (pasta special with squash, spinach, pine nuts, reuben and brunch special with tortilla, chorizo, eggs +++). Topped it off with a s'mores tart and brownie w/ice cream. Delicious. Will return to try other dishes. Staff was extremely courteous and helpful...like visiting family you want to spend time with!
