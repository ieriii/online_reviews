This place is a hype and needs to go. All of my fellow Mexicans agree that this place is tasteless and expensive. It's a busy spot but i feel like its people that are naive to good Mexican food and once they have good Mexican food they will realize how awful this place is. Go to Cabana de Don Luis on Lincoln and Foster. Its much much better.
