I've had dinner here a couple of times and both times, I was extremely impressed with their famous "entrana" steak. It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and the bland sides strangely worked perfectly with it. The servings were extremely generous and the food came out promptly, given how insanely crowded the place was. There was a bit of a wait for a table (it was a Friday night at 8:30), but ordering a pitcher of their delicious, expertly-mixed sangria definitely alleviated the wait! The next time I come here, I will definitely skip out on the appetizer, which is why I am giving Las Tablas a 4 instead of a 5. We had the empanada combination platter, and all three (chicken, beef and cheese) were relatively unappetizing. They all tasted like fried greasy mush, and unnecessarily filled us up before our delicious entree's. Overall, this is a great place for delicious but affordable night out!
