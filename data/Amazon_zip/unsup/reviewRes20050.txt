I had to review because I liked the Scotch egg and the mussels Vindaloo so much.  For apps my group and I ordered the chips (fries) with curry gravy and the aforementioned Scotch egg. If you are ignorant of what qualifies as a Scotch egg then try beloved wikipedia provided here: http://en.wikipedia.org/  The egg came with a side of some of the best coarse mustard I have ever tasted. The curry gravy was quite thin and a good accompaniment to the nearly perfectly crispy-not-too-thin chips. I devoured my enormous bowl of mussels. They were presented in a bowl full of a vindaloo sauce; which was very Indian tasting (curry again, perhaps) and an elongated slice of salamander toasted (french?) bread. It was superb. The sauce could be slightly too strong for some , but it was spot on for me. I ordered a side of fire roasted mushrooms, which were the 2nd best mushrooms I have ever had-the first being at Arco de Cuchilleros tapas ristorante.  I also tasted some of the pesto goat cheese risotto, which was extremely rich. Possibly the richest risotto I have ever had. I had some of the hangar steak, which was ordered too done for my liking to begin with. However, it was served with some pickled veg of some sort and was quite good. I imbibed a Goose Island Matilda, and was far too full to even consider ordering another brew. The bill for everything was $87ish dollars. Which was relatively reasonable.  I have read some complaints about the pretentious atmosphere/patrons/servers, but I did not perceive anything to be as such. Perhaps if you are looking for something to come across as pretentious then it will.  I will go here for the $13.00 mussels and a beer again, soon, very soon.
