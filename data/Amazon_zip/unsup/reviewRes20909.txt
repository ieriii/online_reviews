ceviche maki roll. sunrise maki with mango. spicy salmon and crunchy tuna maki. yum! yum!  this place was great. it's rather large but i am sure that it is packed on the weekends. it is large and has a very swanky, posh style, so i thought that it would be quite pricey. it wasn't. the maki rolls were between $6 and $12 (there may be a few more expensive rolls). and you could tast the freshness of the fish and crab. good quality sushi.  the appetizers also sounded delicious too. our server was excellent and made some good recommendations too. it's byob and if you spend more than $15 a person there is no corkage fee.  every sushi lover should go here.  every sushi virgin should definitely go here
