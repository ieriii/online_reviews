I hosted a bachelorette party here because the bride-to-be was looking for a laid back venue with good food and beer. Piece was definitely the perfect place for our party! Beer/Pizza lovers, you HAVE to come here. Beer is 5 star craft brews, and the Pizza is 5 star quality thin crust NY Style. Some of the best I've experienced in Chitown for surrrrrreeee! PIZZA - I prefer their red sauce pizzas over white but that was a personal preference - my other friends loved the white as well. For the red sauce pizza we ordered with Spinach topping. For the white sauce pizza, we piled mashed potato and other random things on the pizza just for kicks. When the pizzas came out, our eyes were bulging out of our heads -they were HUGE! I think we ordered either mediums or larges, but they were the size of large baking pan. The crust was thin crisp with gooey cheese and sauces on top. We were in heaven. Even with 5 people, we had a lot of leftovers from these juicy succulent goodies. BEER -Our group of gals had anyone from IPA lovers to Guiness lovers. And whatever we drank, we loved! For Guiness & Porter lovers, I recommend the Dark & Curvy - smooth, strongly flavored, an excellent brew. Let me recommend NOT coming here on weekends at nights - several attempts to come back here have ended in 2-3 hour wait times with huge loud drunk crowds. Piece, please open more locations!!!
