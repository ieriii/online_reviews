There is so much wrong here... For one I got there about 3 minutes before their posted closing time, walked in, and then was asked to leave although I was in line and there was no one behind me because they simply said they were closed. I also think it's pretty arrogant to only be open at certain times slinging gourmet encased meats. It's all hype... nothing there is worth going out of your way for... and yeah duck fat fries... they may be ok, but what a disgusting concept. I would rather give a business that cares to be open for it's customers the money. Not a business that tries to create popularity by limiting its availability.
