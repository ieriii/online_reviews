If your looking for great spicy Chinese food this is the place. A group of us went before our union meeting. We go once a month and pick a different restaurant in Chinatown to visit. This month was Lao Sze Chuan which was put on hold last month due to the fire. New decor is modern but the plastic patio furniture chairs felt like they would break under us. Started out with the House Special HOT and Sour soup and if you are a chili-head than this is for you, the hottest I have ever had. The spring rolls and pot stickers are good but not much different than other restaurants. We had Dry Chili Chicken (Great), Mongolian Lamb (tasted like the beef), Kung pao shrimp (Good), House Fried noodles ( not as spicy as we thought), Dragon and Phoenix ( OK). Most of the customers were having the hot pots so next time we will try that. Overall a great experience.
