I honestly didn't think i was going to like this place. Seafood places always seem to disappoint me, but i have to say that Shaw's was freegin' phenom. We had a party of 4 and EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing! APPS: Calamari:  Crunchy goodness. But it tasted fresh, if that is possible with something that is deep fried. yummy. Crab Leg Bites:  sweet, juicy leg bites that'll make you weep. Clam Chowder:  rich, creamy goodness MAIN: OvenRoasted Whitefish: moist yet crispy. Big portion and awesome Lobster:  we had 2 whole lobsters and they were what you'd expect if you're a lobster lover.  Bone-in Filet Mignon:  As good as any cow you'd get from a high end steakhouse. SIDES: Creamed spinach, mac and Cheese, Potatoes Au Gratin: ALL of these sides were spectacular.  Well, probably not amazing for my ass, but amazing for my mouth. Very naughty, but comfort food at it's absolute best. DESSERT: Raspberry Pie, Key lime Pie. The Raspberry pie adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream was pure HEAVEN on a plate. I could've eaten a whole pie of this. I personally am not a key lime pie lover, but those who were, raved about it. Overall: i'd come back to this place in a heartbeat. Yes, it's a bit on the pricier side, but i've been to so many pricey seafood places and left sorely disappointed. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!
