One of our favorite places we've visited all summer. This is a great Indian buffet, maybe the best we've ever been to. The place is beautiful, the staff is attentive, and the table has a lot of variety and intriguing dishes. I'm a meat fan, and there were delicious curries with chicken, lamb, and salmon...salmon!!! I also loved this creamy corn curry, another thing I'd never seen before. We got back to the table with our first plate and wondered why there was no bread. The waiter, just as we were about to ask, came by with a warm basket of bread and a sizzling plate of tandoori chicken. The bread was good, but the chicken--which everyone gets as part of the buffet--was the best tandoori chicken ever, hot, spiced well, and very tender. Nice selection of standard desserts, too, with mango ice cream, kheer, and gulabjamoon. Did I mention the lunch buffet is only $10? We like Indian and have been to a lot of buffets, but it's going to be hard to go to any other after eating here. We can't wait to go back.
