I had the pork belly torta and a delicious agua that had lemongrass and something else. They no longer had take out soI ate in and read while I waited for my food. The place is a bit small and the music a bit loud but I liked the food and the staff was very friendly. I thought it was cool that the staff told me they were going to change the agua del dia because Rick Bayless had been in earlier and it was not up to his expectation. Nice to know that Rick is making sure everything is up to his standards.
