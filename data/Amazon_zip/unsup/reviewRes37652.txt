Oh man, do I ever love beer!! BUT, I must admit that some of these Belgium beers aren't my taste. I think they almost taste soapy sometimes to the point that they're not too enjoyable. Besides that, the selection is unbelievable. The mussels served in a huge pot are a must too if you like shellfish like that. The ham and cheese sandwich has gotten amazing reviews from Timeout Chicago and others, but I have yet to try. Definitely hit this place up if you like Belgium beers and good atmosphere. This place gets crowded fast too. Enjoy!
