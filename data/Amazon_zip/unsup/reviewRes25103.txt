Located inside of the Blackstone Hotel, NOT your typical hotel restaurant! During our stay, we ate at Mercat twice -- for brunch and early'light dinner. The ambiance, drinks, food are very authentic and creative.  What's good: -Complimentary Brioche toast with tomatoe garlic spread served during dinner -Served only during lunch, most sandwiches come with Pom Frites (read french fries), drizzled with a spice saffron aoili sauce -- yum! -Eggs Benedict with Truffled Hollandaise Sauce -Lunch: their chicken sandwich -- amazing according to my friend -THE VIEW! Windows oversee Grant park -- beautiful! -Red Sangria  Not so good: -Serving sizes (if tapas are for sharing, how can you share a dish with 5 small raviolis in it???) -Snooty attitude at the door and too much attention to how and in what order items should be eaten. -Do not order the potatoes at dinner, or 6 tater tots will come out and tease you the whole night. Instead try the french fries at lunch. Come on an expense account or during lunch.
