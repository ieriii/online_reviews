My (new to me) SUV, 2008 Iron Man Explorer now has a crappy crack and the cover of my hitch is pulled away from the bumper. I'm disappointed, the response from management was to be expected - they will not be responsible. I drove away this morning since I left at 6.30am, and just looked at it when I arrived home in Michigan. I absolutely know that my vehicle was only parked in the garage at the Hampton Inn during my stay. The rest of my visit, someone was in the truck at all times. Right before I left home to visit Chicago, I worked with the hitch for the trailer I am about to purchase to ensure I saw how everything should be connected. At that time, (two days earlier) there were no scratches, no cracks and the bumper was flush with the hitch cover. I paid $42 per day for parking and the care of my vehicle was crap. Do not park at this hotel. Additionally, my room was noisy (I heard every conversation down the hall at all times) although the hotel staff was mostly pleasant. Altogether this was an extremely disappointing visit. Park across the street if you stay here. I lived in Chi Town for 2 years so I'm used to the fire engines/ambulances everywhere but cannot stomach the horrible care of my vehicle.
