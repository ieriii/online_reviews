if you are looking for a very stuffy place where you have to wait in line to get a $12 weak cocktail, this is the place for you! I NEVER wait in line for bars since there are so many to choose from, but we were curious. It is sort of like a bar you would see in L.A. or Vegas...not Chicago. Cool atmosphere, but would never go out of my way to come back and certainly not if we had to wait in line.
