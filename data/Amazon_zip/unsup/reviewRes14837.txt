Biked up here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with my lovely lady. I think we both were pleasantly surprised to find lots of outdoor seating. With a quick look over the menu I knew I had to order the Cubano sandwich to find out how it compared to others I have had in the city. Wanting to try something else we also ordered the Lechon. We gave our name and headed outside to take a seat. As we were sitting there we saw all these people with shakes, not knowing they had shakes we had to go back in and order one. The food came out pretty speedy. With only one bite of the Cubano I knew there was something great here. The Cubano sandwhich here is as wonderful as my favorite one from the Paramount Room. What makes this one stand out is that its much lighter than the Paramount Room one and it is a lot cheaper only coming in at $7. But the Lechon puts the Cubano to shame. The roasted pork tasted even better on here then the Cubano and the sweet plantains took it to a whole other level. Overall the food rocked and service here was amazing, they were so friendly. I can't wait to go back.
