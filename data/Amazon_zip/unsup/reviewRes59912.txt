Alliance is fabulous. They made our wedding cake - and it was PERFECT. I've never been to a wedding before where people actually enjoy the cake - and I'm still hearing about how delish it was. Peter was very easy to work with - as was the designer. Cake tasting was fun and delicious - they delivered the cake to the reception on time, and in perfect condition. Best part about Alliance is that when we got back to our honeymoon suite, there were cookies and a gift certificate in our room from them for our 1 year anniversary cake. If you're looking for a wedding cake baker - definitely try out Alliance!
