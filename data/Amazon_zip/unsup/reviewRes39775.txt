I hate this restaurant not because of the food, i like the food, but i wont go again. Last week we have a group of 7 people went there for dinner at night, the food was good, but the service is very bad. We finish some small dishes and ask the waitress to fill up, never fill it, we need pop, it take a 10 min to get it, i know they are busy, but they should hire more people, and the worst is they charge 20% of the tips, that's crazy, we get bad service, why we need to pay 20% of tips, wont go there again!!!
