I was here with a large group for a 5:30 reservation time on a Tuesday. Although our group didn't all arrive simultaneously they seated us as we arrived and began drink orders. Our waitress was awesome! She offered suggestions on her favorite drinks and got our drink order in and out quickly. I had the dark and stormy, which I love as a refreshing summer cocktail.  As with any group of ladies out to a weeknight dinner, we kept our ordering pretty light, but we did split the garlic and olive oil on toast-- it was an excellent dish to split and a great dish to whet our appetites.  I was thrilled to see they have bucatini on the menu, as I have spent many a minute on yelp scouring for the best bucatini recommendations. I loved it- perfectly al dente, salty, delicious. I also sampled some of the other pasta dishes, and the orrechiete was another favorite of mine.  For dessert the waitress recommended a slice of chocolate cream pie for the group to split. As I dairy-free pie believer (mmm strawberry pie), I loved this. The piece of pie was huge- we split it amongst 10 girls, and all had a few delicious bites.  One last tip- their glasses of house wine are $4, and to my unrefined palate very passable.  I slightly regretted my $12 cocktail (however refreshing) when thinking of how I could've had 3 glasses of wine for the same price.  Excellent bucatini in Chicago= amazing
