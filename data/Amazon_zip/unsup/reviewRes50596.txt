As far as breakfast goes, this place does it fairly well. The reason for my rating is due to the fact that I go here occasionally, but don't crave it. As with most breakfast joints on a Sunday morning, you have to wait about 30-45 minutes if you arrive between 11 and noon. If you don't like waiting, try and arrive early or about 12:45/1.  There are a lot of catfish, crab and shrimp items on the menu. To me, these don't necessarily spark interest as breakfast fare. As I avoided the traditional creole dishes, i did end up with something I was pretty happy with. The Red Eggs was two eggs any style (poached was my preference) served with black beans and chili ancho sauce over corn tortillas. For as busy as it gets on a Sunday morning, the wait staff does an excellent job and is extremely speedy.
