It helps to know people here. After waiting and waiting in the cramped entry or out on the sidewalk, several times I've witnessed people walk-in without beeper and be seated immediately or at the next-available table. Topping that, is the hostess' attitude. There is one hostess who always works weekends and she is without fail, always rude to me and my husband. In reading thru other reviews, it appears her attitude extends beyond just the two of us!While the food is fresh and delicious (why else would there be such long waits!?), it is also served fast, which is what draws me here. Getting past the long waits and rude treatment by the hostess, the remaining wait staff is charming and sweet.Meli wont' care about my review, but don't say you haven't been warned.I've taken my business elsewhere. There are plenty of great breakfast places in the city that don't serve you a cup of coffee with attitude.
