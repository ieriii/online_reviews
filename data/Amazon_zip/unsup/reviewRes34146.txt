Absolutely love this place! yes there are other places in the city to get delicious falafel, but this place is cute, cheap, and fast! This is one of my top picks when it comes to favorite restaurants. The medium spicy falafel sandwich along with lentil soup is just divine and I would gladly eat this as my last meal on earth! The staff is fast and always friendly. The prices are super cheap. I can get a sandwich and soup for something like 5 dollars and some change. I could talk about this place forever. I never get sick of the food. I love the atmosphere. I just love Sultan's Market. Gotta get me a shirt!
