It would get 5 stars, but the waits are just ridiculous. While reading some of the reviews, I have found myself envious of people complaining about a mere 45 minute wait. The last few times I have been here, I have waited well over an hour to place my order. And yes, I have tried to go on "off hours" and "non-duck fat days", but there are no off hours here.  That being said, there really isn't a better hot dog on this planet. I am not talking about the standard Vienna Beef dogs, polish, etc, there are many who are equal, and some maybe even better. I am talking about the Specials, or the five-star fine-dining experiences somehow morphed into the form of a hot dog that are selling from $7-$8.  If you see the words "bacon sausage" on the menu do NOT hesitate! The fries are also worth some room in your stomach, even the ones not fried in duck fat (Fri. & Sat. only). In the future, I will try phoning ahead for take-out, but if you must eat-in, be prepared to: 1) take 2 hours to complete this experience 2) wait outside for an hour, even in sub-zero temperatures!
