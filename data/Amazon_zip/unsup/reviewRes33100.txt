So I decided to take advantage of the free limo service for a going away party for my friend. They were on time, and it was so much fun. I will admit the 10 point turn in the middle of a 5 way intersection could have turned deadly - BUT we made it and enjoyed the adrenaline rush. We were treated like VIPs at the door, the owner carried me to the table. We enjoyed a feast and some Babs karaoke and gypsy music. Delish sangria! They were even nice enough to drop us off at Lincoln Karaoke where we continue the bizarre evening.
