So many people have mooned over this place in their reviews and while the food is ok, it isn't anything amazingly special. (1) the hummus - to me, this is the measure of a Middle Eastern establishment's true culinary delights. SM has bland hummus. It could use a bit of a shot as far as the garlic and lemon go. As it is served now, it is just bland chickpea paste. (2) the Jerusalem salad - watery, and where's the flavor? I love Jerusalem salad normally, but this just lacks anything beyond a mouth full of cucumbers and watered down milky liquid. (3) the falafal - it depends on the day; some days it is delicious, well seasoned, with a good consistency; other days they are like dry little rocks. (4) the pitas - ok, they are always good. whoever supplies them makes them really well.  Overall, this place is just ok, and I must wholeheartedly disagree with the other reviews. If you are vegan, then your options are limited, or if you live in Wicker Park/Bucktown, then it is quick and easy, but don't make it a destination or pay for delivery. Definitely head up to the Albany Park area for some much more flavorful, diverse cuisine.
