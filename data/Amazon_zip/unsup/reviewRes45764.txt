Ok, I was totally amazed the first time I ate at this excellent new bar/ restaurant in Lakeview. I had the Chicago burger and it was AMAZING!!!! Wow, I have only had a few burgers that good in Chicago, and it was unbelievably good. It was a little pricey, but the price did match the quality of our meal. The inside decor is really really nice as well. It has a lot of dark wood surfaces and looks like it probably cost a lot of renovate and remodel. I would highly suggest going here for lunch, but I"ve never been here for late night fun or for dinner (I"m sure it's just as good). Someone told me that there is a large gay population here, but I didn't notice that when I was eating lunch...Nontheless, I would definitely come here and try their food.
