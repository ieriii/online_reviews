I haven't been to many steakhouses, but I always love the flavor and quality of the steaks, burgers, and desserts (the pecan cookie skillet is AMAZING!) at Wildfire. And you can call me ignorant for not liking Morton's (my steak tasted so plain)! The high tables at the front of the restaurant near the bar are good for if you just want it to be a casual experience. That atmosphere is warm with a lot of dark wood and dim lighting. The service is always wonderful, and I must say again that the desserts are FAB!
