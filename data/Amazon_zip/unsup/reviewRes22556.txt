Fabulous!! The empanadas and the oatmeal milkshakes are musts! The people were very nice and helpful in ordering. There isn't a ton of indoor eating space, but they have a nice enclosed (but with windows) space with plenty of heaters. Very easy to get to via CTA (you can see the restaurant from the CTA line).
