was gonna go to david burke's for my chicago steak fix, but was told the steak here at ruth chris would be better by my local friends. while i never got to david burke's, i was more than happy at ruth chris. my ribeye was cooked to perfection. you could have cut this thing with a butter knife. it was so good and tender.  service was excellent. all in all, i couldn't ask for more from a steakhouse. it had everything i wanted.
