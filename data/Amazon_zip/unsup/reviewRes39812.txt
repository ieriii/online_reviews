God I remember the good ol days when I would come here and my group would only be 1 of the 2 groups in the entire restaurant at 12 a.m. on a saturday night. Those days are long gone. This place has been found over and over again.  Yes everything is good here. Yes it is probably the most visited Korean restaurant in Chicago. Yes the waitress will try to hurry you up when it's busy. Yes they have every right too. If not you I'm sure someone would be happy to fill your void.  Anyways if you're a newb or an old vet like me try the marinated beef short ribs first. I always get that and a order or bo ssam(cooked pork that you wrap in napa cabbage with hot radish and oysters) sounds good doesnt it? here are some tips 1. leave as much clothing in the trunk of your car. I strip down to my undershirt whenever I go here even if its 15 below. It will stank your clothes up and its not so attractive when you go meet up with people who didnt have dinner with you. 2. Notice I said trunk of car. Dont leave valuables in plain sight! This area is still rough around the edges especially if you park in obscure spots because the "parking lot" (bs excuse of a parking lot) is always full. 3. make sure you get 2 orders of any kind of meat. That way you get to cook it on the table. Theres no fun in someone cooking it in the kitchen for you it loses all the flavor. 4. there is a reason why they give you over 15 "side dishes" you are suppose to try everything. Dont ask for refills of all 15 they will hate you instead pick out 3-4 max of the ones you like the best and have it refilled at max 2 times. 5. tip well the ladies work their asses off. 6. be patient when waiting its worth it. Dont cop out and bust out your iphone and look for another korean restaurant. trust me i am your friend.
