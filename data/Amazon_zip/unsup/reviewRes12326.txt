A date suggested this place and I was absolutely enthralled with it. Great atmosphere, great location, amazing food.  I haven't had cuban this good since I was in Miami, which short of Cuba is as close as I will likely get. It's quiet, well lit and spacious; and yet still cozy and quiet. I can't help but wonder where I'd be if we just kept coming back here for each date :-p
