This review is for delivery only. They were on time and the pizza was hot and fresh. However, I just don't really like deep dish pizza I've decided. Wayyyyyy too much half cooked dough and cheese going on. Yuck. I ate this the eve of the Shamrock Shuffle 2012 (smart move...not) and the next morning at the run I felt I was going to have to be sidelined from the stomach pains brought on by this rich and over the top stuffed pizza. I am sure if you are a fan of the deep dish you will find this to be just wonderful.
