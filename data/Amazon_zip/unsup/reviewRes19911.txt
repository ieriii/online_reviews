Every time I spend a lazy Saturday in the house, I find myself watching Rick Bayless on channel 11, and I sit there drooling, wishing I could taste his food. My one and only birthday wish was to go to XOCO to experience one of these delicious creations, and it came true! I hear this place gets crowded, and unfortunately they don't take reservations, so if you're like me and are dying to go, try a week night. We went on a Wednesday and got in no problem. It's a very casual place, but the food is FANTASTIC. I had a wonderful soup, which was a meal alone, a chicken torta with avocado, pickled onions and some kind of delicious red sauce, and I had the famous churros which are to die for! I loved everything I had. I highly recommend XOCO.
