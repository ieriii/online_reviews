Geja's Cafe is really a special restaurant, and I absolutely love it! I was a fondue virgin the first time I visited Geja's, and there is just something about the fondue experience that just makes dinner more fun. The atmosphere of the restaurant makes for a very relaxing, romantic night out. The prices here are a little out of my everyday price range for food, but it's worth it for a special night. *Like the night I got engaged here!*
