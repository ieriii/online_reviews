Fan-dang-tastic!! We went here for a girls-night out... the bar menu is wonderful, with a pleasing array of wine by the glass and well-orchestrated flight. The cocktails flow smoothly here with TOP-Notch service by Julie, Brit and all of the other bar staff...even the bar keeps are fantastic. Its fairly hard to fall into the experienced and agile hands of an amazing bartender who can take what you are "feeling like drinking" and pouring it right into your waiting glass. The atmosphere is grand: with a warm gas-lit fire, comfy chairs, stools, and great-looking people. Very contemporary-chic-rugged-elegant decor. We revisited this atmosphere two nights of our three night trip... We didn't have a chance to eat there, but we surely will when we return.. And also can't WAIT to get in on the outside bar area!! Come on, summer!!
