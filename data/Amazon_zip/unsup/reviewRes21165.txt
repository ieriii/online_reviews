Why a lot of people ate in this dirty place. I don't understand the Hispanic guy who made my burger and fries last week didn't even wear gloves? Did this pass the Sanitary Inspection lately? Or maybe people these days love bacteria or microbes in their body. or maybe that's how the food taste these days nowadays...hands free..no gloves..unbeleivable.Or maybe people are allergic to latex nowadays that's why they encouraged their workers not to wear any protective devices..well..it's healthy I suppose..eww..
