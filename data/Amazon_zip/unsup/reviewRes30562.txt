This place has seriously amazing food. A minimal wait plus street parking. I wasn't sure what to expect since it was in Bridgeport but my friend promised it was out of the world. Organic, locally sourced, and more suited to Lincoln Park than Bridgeport. We went for brunch on Saturday. Found parking immediately and were informed of a maximum 15 minute wait. Five minutes later, we were seated in their second room, near the windows. The restaurant had a very warm vibe, with exposed brick walls, wooden chairs and tables, and hardwood floors. We ordered the lemon pound cake french toast and the english muffin breakfast sandwich. The french toast was divine but very heavy (pound cake after all!) and something worth eating at least once in your life! Accompanied by the fruit mousse and conserve, every bite was well worth savoring. As it was three long slices, I took one home and had it the next morning. Still good! (Side note: The sandwich bread was slightly burnt and potatoes overcooked but was still rather good) The downsides: The service was exceptionally bad that day. My friend said it was unusual but we had to wait 10-15 minutes to order our food, and was unable to flag down someone to get our bill, which was eventually handed off to the hostess. She didn't check on us once while we were sitting there, which I find disappointing. Understandably, it was busy but I find service to reflect performance and unfortunately Nana's was subpar.
