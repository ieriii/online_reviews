Took my parents here for Mother's Day. I sort of picked blindly, but the reviews and menu convinced me to make a reservation, and I'm glad I did -- what a great place! The name and the exterior might not sound that appealing (screams greasy spoon), but appearances are deceiving. The interior is cute, for one thing. It was super crowded but still very pleasant. The servers were all very friendly, but what really matters is the food... - The four of us split a candied pecan salad to start. It was very good, with lots of bleu cheese, hard boiled eggs, cucumbers, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc. and easily served all of us. - My girlfriend's Eggs Benedict looked great and came with a potato pancake; she was full and happy. - My dad got a reuben; I think he liked it (they had real horseradish) but he gave me half to take home, though I haven't eaten it yet. - I got their signature meatloaf sandwich, which is topped with barbecue sauce and cole slaw, plus lettuce and tomato; it was huge and tasty and fed me twice. - Best of all, my mom got the Alaskan halibut with bleu cheese/horseradish sauce; she loved it and it was probably the best fish I've ever tasted. - Hot Brownie Cake split between the four of us, served a la mode; my favorite kind of dessert, warm and gooey and chocolate-y. The prices are pretty reasonable - most sandwiches and breakfast items are $7-$9, while the fish specials are a bit pricier. The halibut was $21 but so worth it (plus I'm glad my mom treated herself on Mother's Day). Not to mention that, at the end of the meal, an owner/manager (Glenn?) came out and gave her a $10 off coupon for "her" next visit. Which she gave to me, since I'm around to use it! Plenty more on the menu to try.
