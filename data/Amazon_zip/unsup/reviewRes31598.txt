For years, I would cringe whenever I picked up a guide book and saw Chicago Diner listed as the only vegetarian restaurant or when the Boystown spot would win magazine awards for best vegetarian. Obviously, the people writing and voting for these awards hadn't delved deep into the vegetarian/vegan spots Chicago has to offer. It's not that I thought the food was bad, but best vegetarian in the city? No way. In the last few months, I've revisited Chicago Diner and I've been pleasantly surprised. The build a brunch is off the chain, especially the yummy French toast and tempeh potato hash. I love that I can go in there and get exactly what I want, plus a fresh carrot apple ginger juice to start my day. Recently, my boyfriend ordered the panko crusted tofu and it was so yummy I couldn't believe we were at Chicago Diner and they've really stepped up their vegan dessert game. There's even a daily raw special! But honestly, what I really love about Chicago Diner is that they have a few different options with tempeh. My naturopath (a holistic doctor) told me I should lay off of so much tofu, because all the estrogen in the soybean curd may be throwing off my hormones and such. However, fermented forms of tofu, tempeh and miso, don't have as many hormones and are actually considered better for you. So I love that I can get both tempeh strips, a tempeh sandwich or miso soup here. So, while they're not my favorite overall vegetarian restaurant in the city, they get points for having a large brunch selection, great vegan desserts and for being around for so long! Meat free since '83 is no small feat in this meat and potatoes town.
