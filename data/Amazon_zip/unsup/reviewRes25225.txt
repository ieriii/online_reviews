Very good food and fun atmosphere. We have ordered the tasters menu a couple of times and always a wonderful combination of foods. The wine paring, highly recommended if you like parings. If not the sangria will work just fine.  My only complaint is I usually leave less than full and have spent a bunch of money but the wife loves it so there you go.
