THis is one of those places where I'm giving it an extra star because it has a special place in my heart. For some reason, I really found this place to be very interesting. For those of you who are "old enough", you know this is the old "The Drink" nightclub spot. This should give you an idea of how big this place is. Maybe it's the grand double levels decor, or the amazingly tasty menu, or the charming staff that earned the extra star from me...regardless, I would highly recommend taking a date to this place. It's guaranteed to be a fun experience.
