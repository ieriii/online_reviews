I finally made it to 90 Miles last night. It was a beautiful night so I figured I would skip out on my list of to-do's and get some Cuban. We had a great meal. I got my obligatory Cuban sandwich and my friend got "Vaca something" (a huge portion of pan seared beef and onions with equally huge portions of rice, black beans and plantains). His "Vaca something" was fantastic! I think that alone will get me to get off the Cuban sandwich kick and try other things -- although it was one of THE BEST Cuban sandwiches I've ever had. We also got the Yucca Rellano. YUM! It was about the size of a large baked potato and we could have easily eaten two or three more of them. They were that good. If you like spicy sauces, ask for their hot sauce. It's delicious and we put it on everything even though each dish was perfectly flavored already. The service was really blow-you-away good. Every server greeted us when we arrived, we were seated right away and our server was super friendly and helpful. They were just as gracious on our way out.  Also, it's one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been in. The decor is really nicely done, too. I loved the murals, particularly the woman field worker with the stoggie. Very cool. It looks like a popular place for groups, too. We were one of several couples there (guys, gals & dates) but there were at least 3 or 4 large groups that came in before we left. It was pretty amazing how large that palce really is on the inside.
