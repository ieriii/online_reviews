Classy and elegant yet tasty and filling food. Le Colonial definitely lives up to it's image. We had the goi cuon as an appetizer, which is basically a spring roll. It was nice and fresh. We had the ca nuong salmon dish, ga xao cari curry dish, and tom xao sate. The salmon was okay, not too special. The salmon was kind of bland and the portion size of the noodles and vegetables was too big compared to the small size of the salmon. Plus the noodles had no taste. The curry was really good, not too overpowering, the balance of the ingredients perfect. The shrimp was also really good, just crispy enough, the sauce was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. We had the banana tapioca pudding and the huge macaroon thing. The pudding was good but the macaroon wasn't so great. Really overpowering and not in chords with the rest of the menu. The food in general was fresh and delicious but not overpowering and greasy. Only minus was that they had our table so close to the one next to us that we were sitting literally back to back with the people from the next table, not good. Definitely will return though.
