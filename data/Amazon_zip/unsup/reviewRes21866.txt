i had pretty big expectations for xoco and was pleased with my meal but my mind was not blown. i had to wait for over an hour to order and when i finally got up there, they were out of the cubana torta i had been thinking about for 60 minutes. total bummer! i ended up with a cup of hot chocolate with almond milk, a churro and a chicken torta. the flavors in the torta were good but some of the chicken meat was really chewy and i had to spit some of it out. the chocolate drink was very good but so rich i couldn't finish it. i dipped my churro in it and it was perfect! the churro was worth the wait! i can't imagine that i'll be going back again but i'm glad i went!
