One of my first restaurants that I ate when I first visited here. I have to say that Chicago style deep dish pizza is a little overrated. We ordered the large deep dish pizza. Took 45 minutes. (I'm not complaining). We were informed that it would take some time so we ordered the fried calamari and split the house salad. The portions were very generous there. The pizza came out really hot and good. Unfortunately the crust tasted very dry and mealy. I would definitely try a different pizza next time. The rest of the restaurant is great to look at though.
