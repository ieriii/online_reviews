Can I have your attention please?! I have a very important announcement to make. Cafe 28 is now open for breakfast Tues - Friday 7-11am. Too good to be true? You betcha, but for early morning risers, like myself, this is totally awesome! I went in today and ordered their green shake which I can only describe as the best wake-up juice for non-coffee drinkers ever! Then to go along with my awake shake I decided to try their handmade pastry, Mallorca, with ham and swiss cheese. It was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced as well.  Then, when I thought it couldn't get any better they gave me a voucher for a free small coffee with a purchase of breakfast or pastry item, which I thought was totally cool of them to do. I will be back for more!
