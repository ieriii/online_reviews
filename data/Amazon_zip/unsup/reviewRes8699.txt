what a hidden gem! i've been here twice in the last month; i'm so glad i was introduced to this place, since it's so close to home. right next to the metra tracks in ravenswood, this place looks small from the outside, but there's really a lot of seating once you get in! if you're planning to go during dinnertime, ANY day during the week, it's best to make a reservation- it fills up fast and it's a good environment for lingering. the flat crusted pies remind me of the east coast and new haven. cooked perfecting in their huge stoves, with a glass of wine, this is the best meal during the winter when cooking is just not in the cards.  comfortable and clean, this is now one of my favorite neighborhood staples!
