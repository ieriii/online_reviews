We recently had Fox & Obel cater a cocktail style reception for our wedding. The food and service was fantastic: 1. Our sales rep, Pamela, was so nice, responsive, and helpful. I felt like we were in the best of hands from day 1 all the way through the wedding day. 2. Personally, cocktail hour is our favorite part of any wedding, so for our wedding, we skipped the whole formal sit-down thing. However, we still wanted our guests to feel satisfied and like they got a full meal. We did a combination of passed hors d'oeuvres and an hors d'oeuvre buffet and there was plenty of food! No one left hungry and we received many compliments about the great food. 3. The day-of catering staff was absolutely outstanding, especially the supervisor who kept the whole evening on task.  4. Fox & Obel was very accommodating for allowing us to purchase our own alcohol and desserts.  5. I only got a few quotes from caterers, so I don't have much to compare Fox & Obel to as far as pricing goes. Fox & Obel was a bit more economical than the other two quotes we received, and moreover, with Pamela's friendliness and level of service, Fox & Obel was the obvious choice for us.  Overall, our expectations were met and exceeded. I wouldn't have changed a thing.
