I usually avoid Italian places because I am a vegan for health reasons and talk about temptation alley .... Italian food is hard to enjoy without all the cream and cheese and butter and meat and ... well, you get the idea.We were invited to go with a group of people so I couldn't say no. When we walked in, immediately we were greeted with smiling friendly faces. The front room is so beautiful. It is quaint, comfortable, elegant and not too stuffy. It feels like a neighborhood Italian place should feel ... like home.And since I am a sucker for great ambiance and don't expect Italians to know what to do with my eating restrictions, I was happy with a great little glass of wine and my company. I truly did not expect to eat more than maybe the bread ... boy was I wrong.The waiter was exceptional, not missing a beat. He was friendly and his service style was polished without any attitude. Furthermore, the Chef heard I had some restrictions on what I could eat and prepared food just for me! I didn't even order! He just brought me what he thought I might like. And it was truly fantastic. This place gets real service. Never did they treat me like a was a pain in the butt. They were happy to accommodate my needs. How cool is that?Good or bad for them, I am now hooked. They have earned a new customer forever.
