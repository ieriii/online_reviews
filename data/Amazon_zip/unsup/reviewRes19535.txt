Ugh. Just UGH.  First of all, the snootiness of the place nearly smothered me to death. The servers and my fellow diners had a strange delusion that their shit smelled like flowers. The atmosphere was so lame. It's so obvious most of the guys there were looking for some pootang from the barely naked women with bleached hair and cellulite-infested thighs who were busy being on the prowl for moneybags doctors and lawyers.  It was so painful listening to some of their conversations, which were along the lines of: "Ohmigosh, Kellie, you SO cannot believe what I found at Louis Vuitton for only FOUR HUNDRED BUCKS! [voice purposefully heightened in order to capture the attention of Dr. Pretty Boy sitting at the next table.]" "That was only four hundred?! Like, that's such a steal! That trashy Coach-wearing bitch at work must be soooo green with envy! [Enter some obnoxiously shrill shrieks.]" While it's not the restaurant's fault that it attracts such airheads, it IS at fault when their food is bad.  Best sushi in town? Please. I've had WAY better sushi elsewhere. Don't waste your time there. They need to get over themselves. Don't feed their ego by spending your money there when you could save half of it by dining at a classier place with better food.
