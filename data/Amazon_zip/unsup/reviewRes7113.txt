This place was pretty good. We had BBq Lemon Shrimp and Grilled Polenta appetizer, which, as our waiter had warned us, was nothing special. I enjoyed it, but would not order it again. The pulled pork sandwich, on the other hand was quite tasty. As were the beers that accompanied it. My table-mates enjoyed their meals even more than I did. Our waiter was extremely helpful, patient, and friendly. I'm not sure if it was because he works for tips or wanted to hump me, but either way, he had a strange look in his eyes.
