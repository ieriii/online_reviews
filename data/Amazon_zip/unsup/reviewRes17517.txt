The cocktails are definitely unique. Unlike anything I've ever seen. I had never even heard of some of the ingredients. I tried the winter sangria and it was worth the $11. There was so much depth to it. The sammies were so-so. It was so dark that we couldn't tell which was which. The potato blini was good, a bit greasy, but good. Otherwise, this place is THE PLACE for a quiet, candle-lit, romantic, chill place for an $11 cocktail. 1 star off for service. Hint: Sit at the bar if you want good service.
