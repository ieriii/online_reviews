Have wanted to dine here for over 10 years and finally made it, yesterday. Cutting to the chase, the food was delicious. Although in keeping with the previous reviews, the wait was long (around 30-40 min.) as we stopped in during prime brunch rush hours. GO EARLY is all I can say about that.After being seated, I must say our waitress was an absolute sweetheart. She was very attentive, even though buried in tables... I had the BLT eggs benedict, b/f had an order of eggs, chicken sausage and 1/2 order of white chocolate/caramel pretzel pancakes and his son had the chocolate tower french toast.My egg dish was very good, eggs poached just right with plenty of yummy hollandaise. But the star of the meal were those pretzel pancakes. Unbelievable! The white chocolate-caramel sauce was truly drool worthy...rich, flavorful, fantastic. The cakes themselves were very substantial, no doubt because of the pretzels in the batter. The chocolate tower french toast was as decadent as it gets. Wonderful dark toast with banana slices, white and milk chocolate curls and a to-die-for chocolate/banana puree sauce. You just can't find fare such as this at your average backyard breakfast nook.I thought it was all worth it and would consider going back if I can get there as soon as the place opens.Here's a tip: Be very nice to the host and hostess and you'll be rewarded with a table sooner than you thought, as well as their appreciation when you walk out the door.
