Nice place, but still has some bugs to work out. The wait for the roof patio was strange to say the least.  It was nice up there, but I don't get the hype with it. We had reservations in the restaurant too for 6 and had called a few days before to add 2 more friends. Were told that they were all full and there was NO way to add, and yet they sat our party of 6 at a table of 8!  In fact, there were at least 3-4 empty tables around us. Another strange moment.  Wouldn't you want to go out of your way for more business?  We were disappointed with that as the table was huge and we had a hard time talking to each other and enjoying the company. The food was pretty good, but again a lot of hype.  The harvest table had some good selections, kind of felt like the salad bar or prepared foods at Whole Foods. The meat selections were good and we asked for something prepared well done and that it was---probably the highlight of the whole night.  Overall, wouldn't go back again.  Neat concept, but again, a lot of bugs to work out. Too bad that the service, the food, and the attitude are too into themselves and not the customers.
