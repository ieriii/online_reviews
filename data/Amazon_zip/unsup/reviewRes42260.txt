Have you ever been to a place that friends and/or family rave about, but you think is ordinary? To me, that is Tank Noodle. I just don't get it. I don't understand why this place is so popular and well reviewed. I don't hate the food; I've never had anything where I've said to myself, "I'll never order that again." Conversely, there's nothing that's made me say, "I've got to have that dish!" I can't remember most of what I've eaten at Tank Noodle. That pretty much sums up how I feel about the place. I've been there several times because it's a favorite of a good friend of mine. I go for the company more than the food. It bothers me that I'm eating food I get little enjoyment out of when Sun Wah is about 100 yards away. I'm no expert on Vietnamese food, but I fail to see why anyone would be excited over the food at Tank Noodle.
