Atmosphere - fabulous, trendy with a modern vibe.Service - no complaints.Food was amazing and inventive! The favorites of the night were the oxtail potstickers, beef lollipops, and the crispy pata. My girlfriends and I ordered dishes and ate family style so we could try multiple items on the menu. Sushi was fresh, but not the best in the city - would definitely come back here again but to try more of their entrees. Cocktails...my gf absolutely LOVED the Kung Pao Mango. Had a sip of it and it was very fresh tasting.
