So disappointing!!! Honestly, I never write reviews but this place was such a disappointment. The hostess was abrupt and downright rude as if we were bothering her by walking in the place. Both my husband and I had to wait for coffee refills. The toast was cold. We each ordered an omelet and they were average at best. How hard is it for a breakfast place to refill your coffee cup in a timely matter and serve warm toast with an omelet?
