This would be my favorite steakhouse in the City, for sure. The prixfixe special is great but even without the meat selection is fantastic. Great service, great calamari, great steaks, great desserts, great wine selection.  I went there for my birthday with some good friends and had a fun time. Good food and good drinks make a great birthday...unless you have too much of either one.
