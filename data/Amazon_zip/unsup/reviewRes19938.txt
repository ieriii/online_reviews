I read somewhere that this place was named the best sushi in Chicago so decided to give it a shot. I read several reviews and noticed there were many complaints regarding service. I actually went on a Sunday so we were seated promptly and our server was attentive.  I'm a huge fan of ordering makis because you can really get a sense of a restaurant's ingenuity and creativity through their makis. I ordered some signature makis and thought that they were phenomenal. Although I raved about them all night, my boyfriend had their nigiri and thought they were average. He also felt the consistency of the rice was too mushy. If I do venture back, it'll definitely be for the maki rolls. Side note: Don't be put off by the decor. We were in tshirt and jeans! It's actually extremely romantic inside. [edit]: This is Jane's bf. I'm the one who had the nigiri and I didn't like it at all. It tasted alright, but the consistency was pretty bad - the fish didn't feel fresh, and the rice was like a mushy ball of shame and regret.
