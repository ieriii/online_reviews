Great service from Caitlin and the others. Food is excellent, with interesting choices and combinations in the crepes. I've tried three of the savory and one of the sweet and all were excellent. The place looks a little boring from the outside but the interior is much more vibrant. It is well worth a trip even if you don't think you are a crepe fan. These are not your typical French crepes, they are inventive and out of the ordinary.
