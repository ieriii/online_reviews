Since writing this review, I have become a semi-regular at Longman & Eagle for both brunch and dinner. I love taking guests and friends here. My veggie friends aren't big fans of the brunch, unfortunately, but have found it to be vegetarian- and pescatarian-friendly for dinner, which was a nice surprise. Everything is delicious!!
