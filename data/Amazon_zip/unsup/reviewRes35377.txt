Hands down one of my favorite spots for Chinese style BarBQue in the city, and it's not even in Chinatown! I do find that the Chinese food in uptown actually meets my taste preference more often than the places off Cermak. There are just slight variances in flavors and preparations that just sets them apart. They have always been spot on with the roast duck and soy sauce chicken. The roast pork here is especially great for the fact that the meat is actually flavorful but not overbearing with the bean paste. Often I find that a lot of places I buy bbq meats from have inconsistencies with seasoning. Some places are way too beany or went crazy with the five spice powder. There's a great balance achieved here. Let's just say I took a friend to eat here; pre-SunWah she was not a fan of duck in any preparation but post-SunWah, she's a believer! The peking duck dinner is a great option if you're into that. My family absolutely loves the seafood/pork stuffed tofu casserole. They do black bean clams great as well. The menu has great variety and they have many noodle soup choices too. Don't you dare change your quality or prices SunWah!
