I hadn't been to Garcia's in at least 2 years, and then this past week I went twice!!! A lot has changed at this restaurant... it's a lot more fancy now! Not over the top fancy, but super clean and much nicer all around. Everything else is the same from what I can remember... great chips and salsa, and great margaritas!! This is a great place to go if you want good Mexican food, but not overpriced and not a hole in the wall. We made Friday night reservations for a big group of 16, and the service was great - and the Hubs and I came here for lunch on Tuesday, and the service was great. Consistant, friendly, well-priced. A-OK.
