Purple pig has some great small plates and is accompanied by an upbeat crowd. If you're looking for pig-related food this is your spot. Definitely not a huge spot so take your chance with actually getting a seat, unfortunately not a great bar area to hang while you wait either. Worth the wait though. Try the St. Lucia dessert, absolutely amazing. I had the opportunity to be the first to try a fresh batch they just made too. Had it twice now...amazing!
