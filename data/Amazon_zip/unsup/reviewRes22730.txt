I finally got to try the restaurant that my Chinese friends have been raving about and it was a good experience. Service was great and the food was delicious overall. We had the broiled fish in spicy sauce, Tony's chicken and the eggplant in garlic sauce. I was in love with the broiled fish as it was spicy and just absolutely mouth-watering. I would just pour that over my rice and just gobble it up like the Kirby that I am. The Tony's chicken was quite good as well in its own right and I later found out that it was even better as leftovers and made a great midnight snack. I was not too fond of the garlic sauce in the eggplant unfortunately so I think I'm going to take my leftovers and add to the sauce. It wasn't bad but compared to the scrumptiousness of the other two dishes, it didn't compare.  Basically if you like spicy oily dishes like I do, you would love Lao Sze Chuan.
