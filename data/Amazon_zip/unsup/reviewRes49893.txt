I don't know what mutant chicken they used but the wings here are huge. There's only like 5 different sauces which was a bummer but sometimes less choices are a good thing. They also serve great thick cut sweet potato fries with an interesting molasses type sauce. This is a great place to catch a sporting event as they have a bajillion TVs inside, but don't expect to hear the person next to you though as it gets pretty loud in here.
