Nestled between warehouses and meat-packing plants, The Publican is casual eatery that serves seafood and pork - more importantly the pork. I firmly believe that pork, when done right, will trump beef, lamb, and any other red meat out there. The Publican does well in presenting an impressive resume for our swine-y friends (check out the paintings). The pork rinds goes great with a cold drink. Perfectly seasoned, the flavor of the pork is not overwhelmed by the cheese powder on top. The charcuterie plate displays a wide variety of pork "tapas", another excellent partner to the many beers and ciders on the menu. This was the highlight of my meal. The sweetbread is comparable, but perhaps not as good as the one at longman & eagle. Delicate and juicy, the sweetbread is a great representation of how good pork can taste. The Publican does this well. The vegetable that I had were the sunchokes, a curious vegetable that has a great texture. A root vegetable that resembles the looks of ginger, this vegetable completely defied my expectations and tasted great. The small bowl was just not enough. However, some of the pieces were not cooked through, and was still slightly raw. It was difficult giving this place a 3 star and not a 4, but one of the reasons was the price. It was a lot of money, for not a lot of food. When the headcheese arrived as a slice thinner than a penny, I was slightly disappointed. In all, still a good place that one should visit, and a great place to have great beer with good pork.
