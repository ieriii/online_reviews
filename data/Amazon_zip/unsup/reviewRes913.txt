aka "The Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium" If you're ever in Chicago, this place is worth checking out :) We tried - The Black and Bleu (dark beer and blue cheese pork sausage with Guinness stout mustard and garlic-cheddar cheese spread) and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (with truffle aioli and foie gras mousse). So fattening but so good! They also have cheese fries and duck fat fries! I couldn't really tell the difference between duck fat fries and ordinary fries though - although I think my arteries would have begged to differ :P Note: If you want to get the duck fat fries, they only have them on Friday and Saturday
