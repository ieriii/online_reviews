If it was good enough for Oprah and Obama the night before, it certainly is good enough for us.  We ate 3 baskets of truffle popcorn before we got our first dish. For the first half of the tasting. we ate a basket between dishes. Yes, they are damn good and addicting. All items in tasting menu were delicious but would like to call out the Corn Bisque because I almost didn't get the tasting menu because thought I could get something better for starters. However, the biggest surprise was the corn bisque, especially that marshmallow in it.  Don't underestimate corn bisque.
