Alright, after my last visit to the PP, I have to up my rating to 5 stars. The service was great, and we were able to grab a table outside on the patio, which I found to be less cramped than the inside. This time I was able to try a few new dishes including the olive oil poached tuna with Greek lima beans, the salt-roasted beets, and a few of the meats and cheeses. It was all scrumptious... our table was definitely "mmmm'ing" our way through the meal.
