Love, love, love this place. Always have and always will. I loved in in Vegas and now I love it in Chicago. Can't go wrong with the menu, everything is wonderful, reasonably priced, servcice decent, etc. Only drawback I would say is waiting for a table and if you go during peak meal times or weekends expect to wait 45 minutes. Bar area is first come first served so if you have a smaller group (less than 4 people) then hover over the tables in the bar area and you may get lucky. I like it way better than the Cheesecake Factory.
