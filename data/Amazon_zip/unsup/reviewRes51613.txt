The best cheap Mexican place in the city PERIOD! The Chips n Salsa are great. The chips are nice and crisp and fresh tasting. The best thing is it's cheap and the food actually has taste. Lots of small Mexican places have bland food. At Garcia's you can taste the cheese, meat, chicken, etc... They even have Cherry Coke! It's not fancy and usually busy but quite good when you're in the mood for cheap food! I really like the Chorizo tacos.
