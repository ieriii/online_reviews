I was so excited to see Top Chef Dale that I nearly peed my pants! Ok, not really. But I was really excited! I was also really excited when it started snowing! Anyway, hubs and I went of the prix fixe. Scrumdilliumptious! My favorite part of the meal was my corn dessert - truffled sweet corn brioche bread pudding with crumbles of popcorn and kettlecorn. I wanted seconds, thirds, and fourths.
