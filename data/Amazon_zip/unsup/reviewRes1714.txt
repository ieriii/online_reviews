Dear Doug, Although I will cherish our friendship forever, I must say good bye. I'll always remembers our days of bratwursts, tall boy old styles and the Cubs over on Roscoe, but alas I just can't stomach the lines. The last time I ate at Doug's there were 2 camera crews there doing 2 separate stories. Good for Doug and Good for People who don't mind the wait. Btw, just get a hot dog there. It's the best in the city. Love always, Dan S. (I don't know how I feel about the fact that my hot dog vendor knew my name)
