Shaw's is a Chicago staple for crabs and seafood. The restaurant has a bit of the old school steakhouse feel to with white table clothes and dark wood but if you look at the walls you see some of the cheesy seaside decorations you'd expect to find out on the east coast. The service goes along with the decor - the wait staff wearing jackets and ties. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and daily specials. They also kept our wine glasses full the entire evening - which was nice. Crab is the star of the show. My wife had the Alaskan king crab legs and they were perfect. The meat was sweet and just melted in your mouth. The warm butter was not even needed. I had the bay sea scallops which were very sweet but a little overcooked. We had the spicy popcorn shrimp for an appetizer which was good - although I did not expect the Asian spiciness for the dish. It still worked. The seafood gumbo was hearty but could have used shot of tobasco sauce. Between the food and the service, we had an excellent experience at Shaw's and will certainly be back to enjoy the crab legs.
