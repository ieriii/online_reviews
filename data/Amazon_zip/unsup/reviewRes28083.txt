My boyfriend had been telling me that this was supposed to be a good place to get food in Pilsen, so we tried it out last week. We went on a Wednesday for an early dinner and it was pretty empty inside. However, the service was super fast, which is what we wanted, so that was great. Luckily he had cash on him, as they do not accept debit/credit cards. I thought the food was good. I had the enchiladas and he had the tacos, so it is hard to go wrong with either. They brought out a meatball and potato dish before the meal which was maybe my favorite part. Overall, decent Mexican food for cheap, but don't forget to bring cash!
