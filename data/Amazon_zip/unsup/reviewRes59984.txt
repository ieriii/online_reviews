I have gone to las tablas at least 8 times since i have lived in chicago. I do have to admit, their older spot across the street was MUCH better. It was much more cozy and had a really nice "family style" feel to it.now let's get to the newer spot....I was there on a Monday night not too long ago and it was dead. Our table of 2 and two more tables of 2. We ordered the empanadas and they were good as usual. The server took forever to come back to get our order. We then gave him our order and it took over a half hour for the food to get there (two steaks). Server never filled our waters and never came back to check on us. We tried to flag him down for our check but he disappeared. It took him almost 15 minutes after we ate to get our check. If you don't serve your customers, they wont come back. period.
