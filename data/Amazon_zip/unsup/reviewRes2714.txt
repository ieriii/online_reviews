Initially I was a little skeptical about Tru, some had told me not to go as it was dated and there are better places, though I persisted. I wasn't disappointed. Service was excellent, some of the best I've had, very attentive, almost over attentive but not quite. Decor seems a bit dated but simple.  The Caviar course was amazing and a great way to try different types. Had the Grand tasting, every course was virtually perfect. Flavors were spot on. Everything was cooked perfectly. The pace was quick (which I like). You were never waiting too long before your next course. The wines were paired meticulously as well and really accompanied the meal.  We had an amazing dinner and will definitely return. Personally I think they deserve at least 2, if not 3 Michelin stars...
