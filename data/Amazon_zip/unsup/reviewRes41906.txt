Gilt Bar not a restaurant an experience. Let's begin with how lovely and amazing the decor is? Dark and seductive...or maybe that was just my date. Seriously I am a fan of cozy seating. I like being close without being on top of fellow diners. It's very European! They also have a great couch table section that would be good for groups. Mostly cute small tables set for intimate conversations.  Now let's talk food. Best best best Brussels Sprouts that I have ever tasted. I opted for the Mussels as my entree...huge portion with a baguette to soak up all the delicious juices. Washed it all down with a PBR in a fancy glass.  Side note: the ladies room is burning COBigelow candles...smelled Firewood scent and ran out to buy out the store.  My birthday is coming up and I can't wait to put on my fancy heels and fill my belly again at Gilt Bar...it impresses!
