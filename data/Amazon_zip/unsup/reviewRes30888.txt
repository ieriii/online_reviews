my favorite breakfast spot, thanks to DDD for pointing it out to me. this has been my favorite sunday spot for quite sometime. It can be a wait but I try to get there early to avoid the rush. The chicken and waffles are a must-have whenever they are on the specials menu. Their homemade chorizo is perfect and I have with just about every dish; my wife loves the soyrizo so they clearly know how to season food. what separates nana from the rest is their consistency, commitment to high quality ingredients, and the family-friendly service.
