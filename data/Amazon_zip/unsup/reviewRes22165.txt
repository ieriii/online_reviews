I had a Superdawg with everything and cheese fries. The dog had a really good flavor and was a nice size. And yes, size does matter. I could have had more fries with my order, although they were a bit too overdone. The cheese sauce was absolutely terrible though. It was runny and had a weird taste. Overall, very good dog, but skip the cheese fries.
