I'm probably the minority in this (and not because I am Latina), but I was born, and raised in Pilsen. Still live in the area. Nuevo Leon has not been good to me nor to my neighbors. The service was crappy and the food all tastes and looks the same. The tacos look soupy. I don't know. I have been in this place numerous of times to give it a chance, but it's just not happening. A girlfriend of mine, who also lives in Pilsen, went there with her family and saw a roach! She told the girl at the front desk and they apologized. Ok, no big deal she thought. Yeah right! She saw another roach and took a pic of it! She asked for the manager and he was just rude to her and didn't care that a customer saw a roaches. She refused to pay her bill. He then got very mad at her for being rude to him. She then told him that she is going to share this lovely pic of the roach she saw to everyone. He then said, fine, don't pay the bill. He never apologized. Well needless to say, I never been back since this incident. Also, they have been cited a few times by the city for not following cleanliness guidelines. This was made public. Comales on 18th St. is the place for me! Sorry to those who just love this place. But this Pilsenite has had much better food and service at other Pilsen Mexican Restaurants; and Nuevo Leon is not in my list..
