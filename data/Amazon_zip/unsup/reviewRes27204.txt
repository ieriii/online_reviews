I was so looking forward to dining at Graham Elliot's and I must say I did leave a tad disappointed. We had a great server...so this review has zero reflection on him.  After we were seated, we were brought out a comp dish from the kitchen. It was served in a shot glass...looked interesting. However, when the bus person explained what it was, we couldn't understand a word of what he said. I asked him to repeat and he did...still couldn't understand him. That to me is a huge "no no." Wait staff should be able to communicate with patrons, particularly if they are explaining something that is unusual. Neither my husband nor myself cared for the flavor of whatever it was that was served. It also left a horrible aftertaste. We then ordered an appetizer (pic included)...crab cake. It was a pretty presentation. I wasn't sure what part to eat...so I only had a little bite. On to our entree...I ordered the swordfish and it was way way undercooked...maybe that is how it should be, but I have ordered SF at many other highend places and it was always delish and cooked. The waiter was very nice and offered to bring me something else. I declined. I didn't want my husband to be finished and then me just starting. My husband ordered the skate which he thought was good, nothing extraordinary, but still tasty. Wine was great. We didn't order dessert. For the amount of $$$$ we spent, there are many other places I would rather go. I guess I am glad that we checked it out, but we will not be going back.
