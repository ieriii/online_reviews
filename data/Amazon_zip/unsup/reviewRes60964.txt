The food is decent, it's a big menu of bar food- who can really complain about that. The other night we were hungry, started looking up places that delivered in the neighborhood and Fifty/50 came up! 'Hey that's cool that they deliver' I thought. They make a big deal about ordering online and delivery on their website too. No business should promote a service that they don't have systems in place for- case and point: We had to call to place the order cause online wasn't working. Talked to bartender, she had a hard time hearing so went in the other room to hear better- smart move- she was very thorough taking the order, guessing because she usually is getting drinks and not food orders, no problem- I'm pretty patient as a customer. She says great it will be there within the hour, probably sooner cause it's kinda slow tonight. So after about 75 minutes I decided I should call to check on the order. After being put on hold several times they revealed to me that the order was never given to the kitchen, but they could get it right in and have it over in a little bit (the order was for a half chicken, and it's now 10:30- so I know that's not possible). I said no thanks and that I just would rather cancel the order. They could care less. My first thought was that a manager would get on the phone to apologize and offer a discounted cost. That type of customer service ended in the 90's though. Fifty/50 earns it's name. It's definitely a hit or miss place. (We enjoyed the late night menu at Benchmark though).
