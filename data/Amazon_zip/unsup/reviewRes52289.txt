Eh. It was okaaay. I'd probably dive into Ginos East if it was in front of me, but probably not the best Chicago deep dish ever. Quite the line formed outside on a Thursday evening, but we luckily walked right in and snagged 2 seats at the bar. We had the deep dish with the sausage patty, since that is what was recommended. The crust is more cornbread-y and I prefer the pastry flakyness, deeper dish, taste and less schlopyness of Giordanos.
