I stayed here on a mini vacation to Chi-town with my husband in February and I really loved this hotel. Other hotels around it were all glitzy and overpriced but this place was just what we wanted: small, clean, luxurious, quiet and comfortable. We got a standard room and it was lovely and rather spacious for a big city hotel. The location is great and I found the staff to be super friendly and helpful. The concierge made spot-on suggestions for all our requests, from cheap(est) places to buy wine, great restaurants and even help us find some cool independent book stores. Every time we left, the doorman asked if we needed a cab or directions. When we called down to the front desk to ask for a mini fridge for leftovers (and to chill our wine, of course), they sent one up within 10 minutes. It's true, the elevator is on the slow side but not a big deal. We also didn't try the room service but that stuff is never good anywhere and you don't need it since you're in a major metropolitan area where restaurants will deliver right to you at all hours if you don't feel like hitting the town.
