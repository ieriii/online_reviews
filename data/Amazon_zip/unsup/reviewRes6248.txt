When I see a bartender freshly peeling a rind for a drink, I get excited. I just wanted to sit and drink at the bar all night. Great wine list with good prices. Cold beer in iced mugs. The hibiscus martini was off the charts. I am glad I did move to a table. We ordered 6 or 7 items to share and had a great time. I would not suggest any one with a hearing issue to visit in the evening. There are many social people having drinks and eating, so the volume gets loud. This is a must for a visit to Chicago. The vibe in this place was great!
