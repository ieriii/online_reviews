Omg. The pizza is to die for. I want it right this minute!! Great beer selection (anyone care for a Camel Toe? Watch out! They are dangerous!) Live band karaokee is sooo muchhh funnnnnn. It can also be incredibly embarrassing if combined with tequila shots. They have a limited, but good, selection of songs. The band is great! The singing talent varies, so don't be shy, give it a try! They give you a sheet of paper with the lyrics on it (no fancy shmancy monitor) so be sure you are familiar with the song you want to sing!!! Very crowded, though, so be prepared to stand or wait a long time for a table! They don't take reservations! You can reserve the sunken lower level area for parties, which we did for my bachelorette party. It was a perfectly perfect fun time! The prices are great too. It felt like we ordered so much, but our bill was super low!
