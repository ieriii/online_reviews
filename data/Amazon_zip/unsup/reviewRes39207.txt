If you are looking for good Korean BBQ, this is the place for you. They are open ridiculously late, 5AM, or so the sign says (I'm never going to be able to try this). As many have mentioned the parking lot is small and the spaces are VERY TIGHT. If you have an SUV it is probably better to park on the street than risk getting your door dinged or even worse parking like an A-hole. The real reason to go though is the food. The small plates are fantastic and you can ask for more of your favorites. The Korean BBQ isn't from some cheap gas grill, they use real lump wood and you can definitely taste the difference. I liken it to grilling on a propane grill vs. a charcoal grill -- you just can't replicate the flavor. DO NOT go here if you are wearing your Sunday's best! You will leave smelling like BBQ. *Pro tip* Fact, guys cannot resist a beautiful lady who smells like BBQ. Service was great, but if you don't have patience to decode a little accent then you might think otherwise. Overall, this place is really good and I highly recommend.
