Chic ambiance (deep leather chairs and benches, dim lighting, modern chandelier bursting in embers, white painted brick wall), welcoming and attentive staff, decent noise level to hold a conversation.  Highly impressed with the cornbread. Must have. Also had the muscles and was satisfied.  Would recommend highly for a cool, swank venue downtown.
