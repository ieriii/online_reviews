This place is terrible. I placed a large pasta order and was later called back to say that they weren't willing to deliver my order because I was four blocks out of their "delivery range." I even offered to pay the driver extra to drive the 4 blocks! I live in Lakeview, it's not like 4 blocks is a major inconvenience. It's such a shame that Pasta Bowl doesn't believe in making loyal customers. Where's the customer service? Spend your money at another cafe or restaurant that will respect you and your dollars.
