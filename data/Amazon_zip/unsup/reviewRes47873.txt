This is the only Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been too, so unfortunately I have no standard of comparison. On it's own, I thought the place was great. The buffet portion (Harvest Table) was super, with a massive variety of interesting and delicious choices. The atmosphere is top notch - the place is very, very well decorated. The meats were wonderful - very flavorful, and good cuts. I would recommend.
