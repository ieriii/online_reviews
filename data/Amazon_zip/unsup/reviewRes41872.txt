This place is great -- coming from the Bay Area where there are a lot of authentic Vietnamese pho restaurants, particularly in San Jose, I consider Tank to be just as good. Their pho is still my favorite dish -- the broth is flavorful, the noodles come without that raw or overcooked consistency, and the beef slices are fresh and tender --I always get the pho with just sliced beef. Their other dishes were a little less impressive, including the banh mi and the cold vermicelli noodle dish, but still fairly good. Their shrimp spring rolls are definitely worth sharing as a starter. Was also unimpressed with their sweeties (I've had better, but I also prefer solid ice cubes over shaved ice in my triple color drinks). However, their smoothies can be good if you're looking for something fruity to complement your main dish. If you have a large enough party, you can call and reserve a table. Other than that, I've had pretty good luck getting a table without a wait when coming here before 630 PM for dinner. Service is good -- our waiter automatically asked us if we wanted individual checks or were comfortable splitting -- and they take up to 2 credit cards per table. Would definitely recommend coming here for a quick warm pho during the Chicago winter cold.
