VERY VERY GOOD!!!I arrived a bit early and waited for my boyfriend at the bar. This was just the beginning of what was to come. The bartender" Fritz" was a great bartendeer, taking the time to suggest different drinks as I was unsure of what to have. He explained to me all about cachcasa and the Brazilian drink that is made with it. A great combination of lime and suger- delicious. When my boyfriend arrived we sat with him a few more minutes as he suggested wines and told us all about the restaurant.When we sat down, the hostess could see from our expression that the area was a little crowded and moved us to another table by the windows. Our waiter came over and explained to us all about how a brazillian steakhouse is with the chips for the gauchos and the rest of the pertainent information nessescary. HIs name was Chrisanto and I would reccomend asking for him if you go.The salad and appetizer selections where plentiful to say the least. I loved the mushroom rissoto and the seared tuna was an unexpected surprise. The meats were tremendous. I think I tried a litle bit of everything. It was seasoned perfectly,we thought we were in heaven.The restaurant decor is beautiful. We really had a nice time.I don't usually write reviews for restaurants but after reading some of the things other people had said I felt I should say my piece as well. People are very quick to critisize but few compliment. I loved this place and would reccomend it to anyone.
