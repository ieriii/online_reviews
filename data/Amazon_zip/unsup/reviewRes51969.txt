Came here with my girlfriend, a Chicago local, after doing some research to find me an introduction to Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. She'd heard good things, and yelp showed lots of 4 and 5 stars, so we figured it'd be a safe bet. The line wasn't bad, the servers were nice, and the garlic sticks were tolerable. Expectations were high for my first Chicago deep dish. I've never been so disappointed in a meal. The crust was hard and dry. The tomato sauce tasted like a bad fast-food Italian place's spaghetti sauce. Bland is an understatement for the "famous" sausage - I can't say I've ever had sausage that could accurately be described as tasteless. The spinach did not seem fresh in the slightest. Entered starving, couldn't bring myself to finish a second slice. (Handing over 40 bucks for 2 sodas, an app, and a medium pizza didn't feel great after that.) The pizza was overpriced and sub-par (if par is Papa Johns), didn't live up to high expectations, whatever, that doesn't warrant a one star review. That one star is directly related to the prayer I sent out on the way home, begging the highway gods to speed us home before my stomach emptied itself into my girlfriend's car. The food here isn't the worst of the worst, but as far as I can tell there is no reason to ever choose Gino's over any other pizza place you could find.
