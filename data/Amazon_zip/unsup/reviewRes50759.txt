My perception of the American south and southerners is that of slow, drawn-out processes. We waited a long time and then waited some more. The servers were especially kind, I am assuming because everything takes so long. I had a striped bass special, my wife had grits and shrimp. She wasn't especially impressed with her plate, but i liked mine. The cornbread served at the beginning of the meal was great- the best I've ever had. All cornbread that I have for the rest of my life will be judged against theirs. 3-star review for being very slow.
