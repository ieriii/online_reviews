Man, I am a big fan of Nueva Leon. I love Mexican food and this place always hits the spot. Nothing you haven't really had before if you live in Chicago and frequent Mexican joints, but for some reason this place stands out. Maybe it's the little starter they bring out with your chips and salsa that is always changing.... who knows.  What I do know is they have Nachos Dias, and they are FREAKIN AMAZING!!! Like little quesadillas, smothered in ranchero sauce and topped with guacamole and sour cream... ohh BABY. If you go here you must try them... Oh and by the way, how can people say this isn't authentic? For years, a Mexican friend's mom made dinner for me on an almost daily basis... and I've been eating Mexican food in Chicago since I was a child... I know authentic Mexican food, and let me tell you, this place is pretty authentic. Maybe because it is a more northern style restaurant people think it's not?... And don't give me that BS about this place only being liked by white people... NOT TRUE! People need to stop hating.
