This was one of my fave places in Chicago! The food is super yummy & the service I received was always good. I had an amazing piece of cake once for my birthday that I shall always remember- Ziggy Starfruit I think they called it...ammmmazing stuff! This place is a definite must for vegetarians in the Chicago area!
