You must come for brunch at Mercat! For $25 you can enjoy 4 tapas brunch items (like chorizo baked with eggs or favorites like dates wrapped in bacon) AND an unlimited alcoholic brunch beverage of your choice (sangria, mimosas or the divine build your own bloody mary bar). Our server was super friendly and attentive, but problems arose when the tapas arrived at the table. Each person ordered for themselves but the food runner said the name of the dish and put it on the table. It would be helpful for the item to be placed with the person who ordered them to avoid a vegetarian eating a dish containing meat. Just a small change that I'm sure would help the busy brunch staff!
