How could I not like this place? Its Capone's old hangout...haha The Green Mill is conveniently located close to the red line and Aragon ballroom. Its the perfect pre game or after party place when you are going to a show at the Aragon. They have some great live Jazz bands playing and have PBR on tap among other cheap awesome beers. My typical game plan for an Aragon night is to hit the Hopleaf for dinner, then party like crazy at the Aragon, and then go relax at the Green Mill after the show while I wait for the L platform to clear up...since its a 5am bar theres plenty of time to chill so just grab one of the super cozy booths and listen to some more great music.
