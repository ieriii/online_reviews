This restaurant is enormous! My fiancee has a theory that all of the restaurants in Greektown share a secret underground kitchen, but I think that Greek Islands stands out among this neighborhood. I adore the saganaki and the taramosolata. I have definitely gone here with a big group of friends and made meals from the appetizers. It's a fun place for a giant group, or just for two.
