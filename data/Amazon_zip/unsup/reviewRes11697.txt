Now... I like breakfast, and Chicago's north side has no shortage of great places to go. I had heard about this place, the red velvet and pumpkin pancakes, and well, it did NOT disappoint. Easily my favourite place for breakfast in Chicago. I came here with a friend around 12:30 on a Saturday, and waited for about 45 minutes. Given that there isnt much room to stand, we made use of the time by shopping at some of the resale shops nearby. I ordered off of the Weekend Brunch menu, a burrito that was a spinach flavoured shell, filled with pureed sweet potato, black bean, avocado, scrambled egg, rice and cheese. This flavor combination was A-MAY-ZING!!!!! the potatoes were also tasty and well seasoned. The coffee was well balanced, fresh, and strong. Just the thing to get over a rough "last night". Bottom line: GO!! Well worth the wait!
