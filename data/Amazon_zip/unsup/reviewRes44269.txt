HOLY MILK CHOCOLATE PASSIONFRUIT MACARON. (um, the happiest flavor party of September 2010 in Yanyao's mouth.) You should also probably get a chocolate creme filled banana cupcake as a side because moist banana cupcakes rule the world. My body is thankful that I do not live remotely close but my mouth and heart are already itching for more sweet treats. Total bakery swoon.
