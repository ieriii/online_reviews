After having passed by this place in my neighborhood about 500 times, I decided it was time to check it out for myself. I was pleasently surprised. Although we arrived a little before the kitchen closing time, from the moment we walked in (group of 3), our server was attentive and friendly and did not try to rush us at all. A quick confession - I stay away from anything "pumpkin" with a passion.....none of that pumpkin latte and pumpkin pie stuff for me (peach pies are the way to go!) but I decided 2011 should be about adventure and excitement and so I take a huge leap of faith and try the "pumpkin ravioli with a butter sage sauce"....and good heavens it was simply delicious!!! I mean had I been so wrong all these years? Had I judged pumpkin too soon? I'm still trying to resolve those issues...but in the mean time go check out this place! I refrain from a 5 star rating: only because the gnocchi could have been a little better. I know I have had better. The prices are a bit steep for the quantity. I get the fresh food, gourmet meals concept and all...but a little extra quantity for the price would be nice! Overall a very pleasent experience, friendly staff, dim lit, romantic ambience, excellent wine selection -that seems to be close to everything that I would expect from a good neighborhood Italian restaraunt!
