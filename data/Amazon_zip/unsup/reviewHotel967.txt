The Amalfi Hotel is a great choice when staying in Chicago. Located just north of the River, you get around pretty easily either by foot, "L" train or car. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and check-in/check-out were effortless.  The room was very nice. There was a much in the way of space and amenities as a person could want. The TV was fine. The remote has a tiny delay but, that doesn't set me back. There was plenty of space. The bathroom was fine. The double faucet in the shower was a personal dream come true. We even had a pretty good view of the city from our room. Every morning, there was a generous continental breakfast that was maintained pretty diligently by the staff (who were also really nice). Each evening there was a cocktail party in the Ravello Lounge on the top floor which is always pretty popular. The house cocktails (the Amalfitini and the Sorrento Sunset) and pretty darn tasty! I won't lie, it's a pretty sweet set up they've got here.  I plan on returning to the Amalfi. I also recommend it pretty freely. We were treated well and left making plans for our next visit.
