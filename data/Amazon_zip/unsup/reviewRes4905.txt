This place was alright. I went during lunch time by myself and sat at the bar. I kind of got the feeling of being ignored. I waited a while to order and when i finished my drink it was a good 15 minutes until i was able to get the bartenders attention to order another one. I went to try the bone marrow and they didn't even have it on their lunch menu. The food I did get was good but really expensive for what it was... glorified fried cheese balls, and a meat and cheese board.
