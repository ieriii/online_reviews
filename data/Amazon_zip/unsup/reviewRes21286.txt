Ever had a bad day at work, trudged through the snow or been pistol whipped by the Chicago winds and the last thing you want to do is heat up a frozen pizza to warm your seasonally depressed soul? Mayan Palace has a warm, homey vibe with kindly, attentive service, and after a few strawberry margaritas, you'll be magically transported to a Mexican beach with food that warms your belly and your spirit.  We were able to walk in on a Friday night without a reservation. Some of the best salsa we've ever had. Even the hubby, who is not a salsa person, raved about it. My pork in tomatillo sauce was tender and savory (I'm eating the leftovers as I type, and the only thing it's missing is a giant spoonful of that delicious salsa), and my husband enjoyed his chicken and steak fajita. My strawberry margarita was creamy and outstanding. The only gripe I have is that I thought it was a bit pricey even with our http://restaurant.com coupon (most dishes are around $16). Maybe I'll be back on a half priced margarita night.
