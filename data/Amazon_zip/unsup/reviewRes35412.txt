Restaurant- Huge space with decent decor. Food- Yummy as usual try the pei king ( I think thats how you spell it) duck its pretty good and crispy. Get a roasted duck & pork while your at it as well, the skin ( now this is a hit or miss sometimes at this restaurant) on the pork are so crispy, so delicious that you can hear the crunch half a mile away (just kidding...but take my word for it, it's very crispy) Service- OK..ish. they came 3 times throughout the whole time we were there. First to take the order, second to give us or food, and third to give us or check..I don't expect much from the services but I would really like it if they refill my empty shell of a water glass, and tea cup. :)
