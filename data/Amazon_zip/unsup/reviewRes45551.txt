+1 Great atmosphere with large booths to accommodate large groups (8+ people). +2 Half price beer on Wednesdays. -2 REALLY BAD SERVICE. It took the waiter 15 minutes to bring my friend his bottled beer and the place was empty. We also had to take the check with payment up to our waiter while he was standing around by the bar because we were tired of waiting.
