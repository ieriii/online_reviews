Lao Sze Chuan is awesome. Tommy the doorman is hilarious. He recognized my family from back in the day where we used to eat at Triple Crown Seafood in Oakbrook., where he also worked as a doorman there Either way, he gave us great tips on what to get and we followed. This is one of those places where the page says "house specialty" and it actually means house specialty. We got chilled spicy beef tendon for our appetizer, garlic on-choy (we have to have vegetables, even if it is slathered in oil), steamed fish with ginger, hot pot, and the special chili chicken. Oh the spices were just right on the beef tendon, hot pot broth and the szechuan chicken. It had the numbing spice perfectly done. It was just the right. For those of you not used to numbing spice... its a great feeling of a small electric current that's just addictive. The chillis are native to Szechuan, China. It really adds an umph to any other spices and flavors on it. Its a little more hard to find than other typical chinese places, but Lao Sze Chuan offers it and specializes in it. However, I think my dad was a little ambitious when he ordered hot pot on top of what normal families would consider gluttonous amounts of food. The hot pot was awesome. We got everything from beef to intestines and kidneys. All of which were tender. This place even did a fancy cut/score on the kidneys so it even stayed tender after cooking. Its the little details that count. We killed the hot pot and only ate... a third of the other dishes. The staff was extremely friend and readily boxed our food and extra rice. I'll be enjoying my left overs for days.
