I really, really wanted to like this place.....but it just didn't happen. The staff was great but that was the highpoint of our meal. Had the guacamole and a vegetarian burrito, which the menu says is award winning. All the food was BLAND! The burrito was dry and way too starchy with no real flavor and, though the portion of guacamole was very generous which is usually a welcom thing, we left a lot behind. Just not worth eating!
