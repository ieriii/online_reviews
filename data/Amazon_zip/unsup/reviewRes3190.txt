Finally! I have found a Buffalo chicken worth writing about! After trying Fifty50's "Best Buffalo wings in Chicago", I was ready to abandon all hope of finding that right combination of spice and tang in Chicago until I was introduced to Crisp. The chicken itself is moist and tender with great batter to boot! I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is remotely interested in buffalo chicken (or just wings in general). PS- The rest of the menu is fantastic as well, my GF likes the BBQ beef burrito and their own house wings are great too!
