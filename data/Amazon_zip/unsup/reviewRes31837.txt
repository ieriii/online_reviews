I went last night with 4 girl friends. The place is beautiful - perfect place for a girls night out, and I bet it would be great for a date night too. First I have to say that I am the only one of us that doesnt really care for seafood, but I wanted to see my friends so I went anyway. We ended up getting a bunch of appetizers and sharing everything. Almost everything had seafood, which I wasnt going to eat, but all my friends were raving about how good it was, so I had to try it. And too my surprise I really enjoyed it. So if I thought it was good, then seafood lovers (like my friends) thought it was great!  Also, you have to order the special brussel sprout salad - I know I know, it doesnt sound good. But OH MY GOSH it was totally awesome. Its not on the menu, so you need to just ask for.
