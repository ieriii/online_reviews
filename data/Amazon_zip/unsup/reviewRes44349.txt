Not the best cupcakes I've ever had, but they are pretty damn good. I actually recommend the raspberry oatmeal bar or the pecan caramel bar - they are rich and delicious. The specialty coffee drinks are delish; during the winter they have a Mexican Cafe Mocha that is the perfect drink for anyone craving chocolate and coffee.  There is free wifi, but the adjoining room gets pretty crowded and the furniture could be a bit nicer/more comfortable.
