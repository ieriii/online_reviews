- if i could give this a 3.5 stars i would - honestly, REALLY good food. was with three others and everyone LOVED their food - drinks were also very delicious (again everyone loved them & bartender even made a fun drink for my friend who doesn't drink alcohol) - Negatives: (1) i was expecting more of a speakeasy/fun decor. The decor was hip, but definitely nothing special and way underwhelming. (2) wish the menu had had more choices. In sum: Hip place, good for cocktails and a delicious dinner, but nothing super special or memorable
