I am shocked at the amount of great reviews this place gets. All that tells me is that people have no idea what real Middle Eastern food should taste like (yes, I know it varies from nation to nation, but America is not a Middle Eastern country). THIS PLACE IS NOT IT. The shawerma is bland. It doesn't have any of the flavor that real, succulent, tasty shawerma should have. The hummus also lacks flavor. The falafel isn't the best, but it is probably one of the menu items that is OK. I've been to this place a few times and the food has never been really good.The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because their catering is decent. I don't understand why, just because you are catering to an event with primarily Arab people, it is only then the food is good. It's a shame that restaurants assume that non-Arabs will like Arab food better when it's watered down and not authentic. If you like a very Americanized version of Middle Eastern food, you'll love this spot. If you want something authentic, Sultan's is absolutely not the place.
