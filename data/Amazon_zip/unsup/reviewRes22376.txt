This place doesn't accept cards which is annoying. The food is good but simple, it's comfort food from Costa Rica. We had a large plate of ceviche with patacons as appetizer. It was good, the issue is that it only has a type of fish. For main dish we had pork chops and el Tico. The plates are large and they have lots of different things (rice, beans, salad, plantains...).
