One of the top sushi restaurants in Chicago (second only to Toro Sushi in my opinion). This place is consistently delicious and they have a wide selection of rolls. They offer BYOB, but I think they limit the amount of booze you can bring in, presumably because this place is always busy and they need the tables to be turned over in a reasonable time frame. We have also ordered take out a few times and it has been as good as when we have dined in. Whether you are having a "date night" or going with a group Coast will surely please.
