I have never had a bad meal at Indie before. I've eaten there about, oh, I don't know, 90 times because I went to school at Loyola Chicago, and it's just down the street. Now every time I go there,1) I try something new, and 2) I bring someone new.Recently I had a sushi-off with a friend from Lincoln Park; she brought Toro, I brought Indie, and we mututally decided that Indie is the better choice. For those of you who don't know Toro, it's the decent sushi place in Lincoln Park that has lines out the door every night of the week.So for sushi that's better than Toro without the riduclous wait time, go up to Edgewater and have some Indie Cafe. I recommend the Dragon and the New York Maki. Oh, and their mochi is excellent, too.
