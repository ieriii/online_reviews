can't help you with the beer as i am not a beer drinker but i can say best brunch ever! the servers are always so nice and accommodating (i'm a notoriously picky eater). i've only been once for dinner. i had the burger and mashed potatoes. my burger was good but mashed potatoes were sublime. for brunch, i always get the steak and eggs and it's always perfect. i will be back again and again and again.
