I'm afraid to post that this place is so great because I'd hate to go and find it too busy to get a seat, but this place is truly amazing! My boyfriend and I always try something new and we've yet to find something we didn't like. We order the Grilled Lemongrass Beef appetizer almost everytime because it's my fave and fun to get to make it ourselves. Simply beef is so tender and delicious. Prices are great, staff is friendly & so happy to have our business, and best part is they serve free fresh fruit for dessert!
