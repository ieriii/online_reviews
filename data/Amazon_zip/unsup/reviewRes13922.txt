My husband and I went here for breakfast in April and we were pretty unimpressed. My husband's cajun burger came with a mayo sauce that wasn't listed in the description of the dish, and since he doesn't eat mayo, he had to send it back to be re-made without the surprise ingredient. It took forever to turn the order back around, so I was done with my meal by the time his reemerged. Coffee mugs were filled once and then sat empty for the remainder of the meal. As a capper on the experience, when we finally got the bill, we'd been charged for both hamburgers, so we had to wait while the server corrected the error. The whole meal took way too long, and for the price, was pretty disappointing. I wasn't even all that taken with the much hyped potato pancakes.
