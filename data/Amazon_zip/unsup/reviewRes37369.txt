Three weeks ago, I came from New Jersey to find an apartment in Chicago. My apartment broker realized that I was a food lover and he told me about Fox & Obel, which he described as a fancy Whole Foods. Since I'm a Whole Foods Whore, I made sure to put it on a place to visit when I moved to Chicago.  It wasn't until a week later did I discover that the apartment I selected to live in is located two short blocks from F&O. When I took a preliminary walk-through of the store, it quickly reminded me of a place called Market Basket in Franklin Lakes, NJ. This market does sell some of the same brands as Whole Foods, but those are few and far between. The rest of the food is gourmet quality, and I had never seen or heard of the brands anywhere else. The delicatessen inside even sells foie gras! The prices are rather reasonable for a store of that caliber. Be sure to follow the store on Twitter as it often tweets deals. So far, my favorite items to buy are the thick cut American pork chops and the fresh baked artisan breads. I don't think I'll be buying my pork chops from Whole Foods anymore. The pork chops at F&O eminate a glitter of freshness, and I love the high-fat content...simply delicious.
