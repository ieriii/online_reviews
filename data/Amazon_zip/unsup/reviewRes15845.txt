I'll pass on this place from now on. The guacomole and chips were absolutely dynamite. BUT everything else left much to be desired. I ordered a raspberry mojito and expected a fantastic drink but was disappointed instead. It lacked flavor. My entree was just ok, and LOADED with garlic. I do enjoy garlic but also want to taste something else!
