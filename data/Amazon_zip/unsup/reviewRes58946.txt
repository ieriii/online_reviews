Staff is super nice, the food is really enjoyable and light with unique flavors, and the atmosphere is upbeat and just fun. Bar is a little pricey but also has delicious unique cocktails. I am somewhat boring and like the shaking beef (it's paired with a lime sauce that works perfectly) but the soup dumplings and beef lollipops are also great. Sushi is not normally my thing, but I enjoy it here.
