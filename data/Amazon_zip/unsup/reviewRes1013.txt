If there was a dislike button on this review, I'm sure plenty of yelpers will downvote me for this one. The reason for the 3 stars is because I dislike foie gras and had 4 huuuumongous chunks sitting on top of my duck foie-gras hot dog. Alright, so I completely admit it was my fault for a poor choice in ordering. But in my defense, I thought the foie-gras was mixed into the hot dog itself. My disappointment could also be from the fact that I've been trying to come here for the past year, and finally paid a $60 round trip taxi ride for a $9 hot dog. I would give it another shot if I'm in town on a weekday, but refuse to wait in the 2 hour weekend line.
