The only good Ethiopian place in the city, in my opinion. Our dinner started with the absolutely hilarious host showing us to our table, chatting with us about Fight Club. Our waitress was pleasant and helpful, and the beers and honey wine came quickly. The food was AWESOME. All the usual things were good - yebeg alitcha was tender, the kitfo was really, really good and flavorful. A lot of the food had a sweeter taste along with the spiceness, which was unusual and excellent. On the less common end, the chickpeas were berebere sauce were just fabulous. Portions and price were great too. I can't wait to go back here - highly, highly recommended.
