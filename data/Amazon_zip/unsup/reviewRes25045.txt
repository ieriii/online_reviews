So I came to Mercat on Friday with a few buddies. It was my birthday, so we decided to get the whole pig. We ordered it 2 days in advance, and were really anticipating our visit. Unfortuantely, I was not impressed by the pig. The pig came out, looking quite delicious, it was carved up and served to us. It was soft, juicy and tender. The skin was crispy, but I felt it was way too salty and overall too much of a good thing can be bad. The sides were also extremely filling and not particularly amazing (white beans, potatoes, spring onions and spinach). And for the price of $45 a head, it was defintiely not worth it. On the other hand, we had the bacon wrapped dates, which were extremely tasty. The chef's selection of cheeses was also very delicious. I think if you do come here, it should definitely be for the tapas. Looking around at the other tables, the tapas definitely looked more appetizing. The decor was great with high ceilings, and colorful decorations and the service was perfect. I'm only upset that our big meal ended up being quite disappointing, and therefore 3 stars. If I did come here for the tapas, 4 stars for sure.
