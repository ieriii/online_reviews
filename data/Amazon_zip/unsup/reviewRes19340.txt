I think I've found a new favorite sushi place! Service was excellent and the food was amazing. I came here with a group of 10 for a friend's birthday party on a Saturday. One friend was familiar with the menu and ordered a bunch of appetizers and rolls for the group, so we were able to try a little of everything. The asparagus beef, jalapeno miso soup and scallops were my favorite apps. I think the scallops had a garlic/butter/spinach sauce...whatever it was was so good! I didn't want to share. As for the rolls, I don't remember exactly what we had but they were all delicious. I am already wanting to come back and try more. This place is also BYOB and they will let you drink in the waiting area which is cool. Most places won't let you drink while waiting which is lame!
