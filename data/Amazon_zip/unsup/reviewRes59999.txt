This place is a joke.Over priced, cheap cuts of meat, without any flavor. Served with bland potato and yucca, that was so unimaginative, it was simply over done in the oven. If you are looking for any sort of flavor in your steak, other than the salt licks they serve here, go elsewhere. If you enjoy cheap cuts of over priced meat, soaked in oil, make your reservation now.Sometimes I wonder how some places as bad as this, last so long in Chicago. Then I remember that most of you come into this place, see how the skirt steak is the house specialty on the menu, then the waiter reiterates this, and you sheep lap this up.
