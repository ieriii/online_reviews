So I have been here before and loved this place. This time... Not so much. First off the staff told me there was going to be a 30 minute wait for brunch and they would call me when they had a table ready..... They did not. We had to go up to the staff and ask, and her response was " oh, we have a table for you.".  Food was ok but not great and it's kinda pricey.  Should have gone with our first option and gone to Tweet. It's a long trek to Andersonville for subpart food and pretentious staff.
