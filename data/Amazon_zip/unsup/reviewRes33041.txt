Sultan's a few years ago was great, but it's dropped in quality over the years. It's just pretty average these days. The staff is friendly, and service is usually pretty quick. However the quickness shows in the food quality. The rice is dry, their falafel lacks flavor and a lot of the entree plates are very bland and pretty slopped together. Always having to ask for pepper spice and olive oil on the hummus gets old too. Besides the convenience for a fast bite, there is much much better out there!
