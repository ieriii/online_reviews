I tried this place out on a recommendation. First of I personally don't get the whole organic thing as a whole, but hey I hear it's good for you so why not. So this place's theme is organic food and if this is what it is I'm a little more convinced. I ordered the Nana chilaquiles, which were fantastic. They are different from the traditional style chilaquiles that I am used to, but these were delicious nonetheless. The service was really friendly with a great decor. Not that decor matters I mean you got to a restaurant for food not to see how pretty the place is. As far as the service goes I received great service. I can't imagine any business wanting to offer bad service. I can understand being busy. I would be more concerned with a place being, which it is, and the food being good, again, which it is. The coffee is great. All in all I would definitely go back and recommend
