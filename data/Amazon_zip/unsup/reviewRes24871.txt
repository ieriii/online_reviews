OH MY! Amazing. By far one of the best restaurants I've been to. Right from the start with a very courteous and responsive staff, to the amazing food this place has to offer, Geja's is simply perfect.  I took my girlfriend here for a nice romantic dinner, and the place definitely didn't disappoint. Starting off with a distinct selection of margaritas at the bar, this had a good "feel" within the first 5 minutes. Candles everywhere, light music in the background, dim lighting, and to top it all off... very comfortable, private booths. Add to this the (make yourself) fried chicken and shrimp... cheese AND chocolate fondue... topped off with a smooth bottle of wine and you can't go wrong! This place is perfect for couples looking for a place to just relax and enjoy each others company (well... as long as you don't get too intimate! :o) ) Highly recommend the place!!! (BTW, if I missed something its because its already talked about enough in the other reviews... soo keep reading!)
