Three words: Duck. Fat. Fries! Is there any other combination of words in the English language that is more exciting? Ok, that's not all this place is about. It's about affordable gourmet. It's about trying something new. It's about Doug himself working the front counter, encased meat god as he is. With weekly rotating specials of various kinds of sausages ranging from duck to boar to just about anything with four legs and sounds tasty in a bun, there's always something different to try. And with toppings ranging from foie gras to blood orange reductions and crispy onions, this place just gets crazy! Not in to mood for fancy? You will not be disappointed with the normal dogs. Try the Keira Knightly (spicy Hot Dog) or the regular old Chicago dog, everything is quality here. But diners beware, the line goes out the door and down the block...even during winter! But! the line moves at a great pace, so don't expect to wait too long, and it is very, VERY worth it.
