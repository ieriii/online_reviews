This place is awful. I love sushi and have eaten at many a sushi establishment in Chicago, but this was by far the worst.  The presentation on the plate was terrible and lazy - looked as though someone just tossed a garnish on the plate as an after thought. Sushi is an art - rolls come to your table for you to awe over. Not at Sunda. The rolls tasted terrible! The Firecracker roll was a pile of mush on the plate. The "manager" came over and asked how everything was and I explained a bit about my disappointment. In the middle of my explanation - and I was nice - she looked away. She did not care. Nothing was comped or not even a "I'm sorry you are disappointed" Nada. I had a gift card - thank goodness. But save your money - go elsewhere.
