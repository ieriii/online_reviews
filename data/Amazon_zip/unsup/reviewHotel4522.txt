The Palmer House is a large, old, but still grand hotel in Chicago's Loop. Although it has been surpassed by newer and brighter properties with larger rooms and shinier amenities, this place has one of the finer hotel lobbies in Chicago. Take a look at the ornate details on the walls and ceilings of the second floor lobby, perhaps on your way to get a drink or use the public bathrooms. The guest rooms are rather standard in size, and those along the "L" tracks can be a bit noisy.
