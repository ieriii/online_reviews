First off, I would like to comment on the great space and the fact that they use C.O. Bigelow hand soap in their washrooms. Call me corny but those small details do make a differnce to my dining experience:) enough about handsoap .....lets get to the food part. I visited the publican for brunch with a friend and I was quite impressed by the service ( our server was rebecca) and the food.  Here's the rundown on what we had for brunch: Yummy #1: Red wine poached egg with la quercia prosciutto and sourdough bread. Yunny #2: pork cheek sandwich gruyere with roasted tomato remoulade.  I have to agree with most of the reviews that this restaurant gets an A+ for service and food !!!!!
