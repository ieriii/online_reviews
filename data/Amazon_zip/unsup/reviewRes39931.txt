Great korean place! Just went there tonight!!! TONS and TONS of side dishes! (i'll post pics later) 30? and the service was super fast. All the side dishes ive never had before. There was a 30 min wait but it ended up being a lot shorter and the whole time we were there, there were people coming in and out. The service was great since the bus boys were going back and forth and taking and replacing items the whole time, the waitresses were all helpful in checking up on waters being refilled, napkins, refilled side dishes, and etc. The korean bbq is great here and the meat is not too fatty. There were tables that sit 2, 4, and also big booths that fit more people and you take off your shoes and step into them with a more traditional setting. The japanese rest next to it is part of the whole set up. Only complaint is the parking lot that fits prob 12 cars and is wayy to tight to be a real parking lot. BOO for this. People love this place though and do not mind walking in the freezing cold to this place from other street parking.
