4 stars for the cost and location. Check out expedia and you can get a room for right under $100 a night. Considering it is about 1/2 block off of Michigan Ave the price is right if thats the area you want to stay in.  Room itself is decent sized, looks just like the pictures and the bed was comfy but nothing amazing. The bar on the top floor is way overpriced and has a horrible atmosphere. However, there is a pub connected to the hotel on the bottom floor. Great food, good drink and a great atmosphere. Check it out.
