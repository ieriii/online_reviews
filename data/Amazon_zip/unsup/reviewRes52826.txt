When we came, we were certain we'd be getting good food but uncertain of the service bc of all the reviews we had read. However, I think 90 Miles also has Yelp and has been taking some constructive criticism! Service was great! Everyone was friendly and tentative. We ordered the lechon dinner plate and ropa vieja sandwich. The lechon was crispy and delightful. The ropa vieja sandwich came out as... the dinner plate! When our waiter saw it, he apologized for the mistake and charged us for the price of the sandwich (like $7 less than the dinner plate) bc it was the kitchen's mistake. What a nice guy! The ropa vieja was just as good as that of the Versailles Restaurant in Miami and even came with peppers (quite the plus!)
