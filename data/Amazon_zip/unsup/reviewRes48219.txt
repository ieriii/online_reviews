I'm very glad our waiter...well he was kinda like a waiter for people who were waiting for a table...had made drink suggestions for us, it was very helpful since the list was quite extensive. We ended up getting the suggested cider that was on tap and some kind of beer. I really don't remember the name of it but I do remember it was good! It took about half an hour to get seated but the time went by fast since they sit, well actually rather stand, you at a bar-ish table so you can mingle. They have huge pictures of REALLY FAT pigs hanging throughout the restaurant and made for interesting conversation. We started with the pork rinds. It was sprinkled with powdered cheddar (or at least that's what I'm guessing), and some kind of vinegar. You could really smell the vinegar but the two made for some tasty pork rinds. Okay the main course...I think we totally failed here cuz we got the chicken. Honestly, why the hell did we decide to get chicken?! Who goes to a place like this and get the chicken? It was a lot of food but when it comes down to it, it was just chicken. Maybe if it was cooked with some kind of sauce it would have been good but it was oven roasted, or brick roasted? Either way, it tastes like just roasted chicken, nothing special. Learn from our mistake and don't get the chicken (unless you are picky and only like to eat chicken, then I guess you can't really do much about it).
