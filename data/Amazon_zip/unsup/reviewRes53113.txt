came here with one of my besties after rehearsal last week and we were both super impressed. he had some sort of shredded meat-bacon-rice situation and i had a veggie sandwich and sweet plaintains. delish. one star each for: 1. super friendly and laid-back service 2. awesome outdoor patio 3. the hot sauce! smoky and spicy and awesome on everything 4. byob- we did not take advantage of this but i definately will in the future. i'll go back!
