I've stumbled into Garcia's drunk many times and walked away with a paper bag full of burrito. I was never let down yet I was always drunk and therefore my standards lower.  A couple nights ago my roommate and I went there stone-cold sober and actually had a sit-down meal. Hell. Yes. Chips and salsa at no extra charge. Cheap, delicious burritos. Pacifico.  At one point I asked for salsa verde (for my burrito) and the server brought out an entire bowl of it and another basket of chips. Eat here.
