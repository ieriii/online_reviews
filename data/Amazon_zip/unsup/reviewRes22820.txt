I could ALMOST give this place four stars. First things first, the bf and I went here about a week ago. We walk inside and are greeted by a frantic pigeon flying around and the workers attempting to shoo it outside. I was so nervous it was going to fly right into my face. I got out before this could happen, and shortly after they succeeded in coercing said pigeon out the door. We decided to sit outside because it was a warm sunny day. The staff here seemed friendly enough. When our server approached the table with waters and menus, he fumbled a bit and ended up splashing an entire glass of water into his crotch. I told him that he had some good karma on the way regarding all the bad stuff that was happening for him. I ordered the potato tacos with guacamole and black beans. I was disappointed with the guac. as it was very bland; I think it was just mashed avocados. I did enjoy the cabbage and cilantro salad, but my body later didn't appreciate it; i ended up with some hefty heartburn--it hurt a lot! Overall, it was pretty good, but very simple. I wish they could offer just the main part of the entrees without all the extras. I would have been happy with some soup and just the potato tacos themselves. I also had a pineapple shake with water (you could choose between milk, soy, or water). It was tasty. Maybe if I ate meat I would like this place more.
