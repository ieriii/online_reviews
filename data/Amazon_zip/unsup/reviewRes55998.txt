We happened upon this place yesterday as Mercat la Planxa was closed due to the reopening festivities at the Blackstone.It's a great little spot, with a brasserie style bar that's comfortable yet sophisticated. The fondue appetizer with grilled bread was incredibly tasty. My friend had a smoked salmon sandwich with bacon that was also delicious. My lunch was marginal at best...I ordered a sandwich that had a medley of mushrooms that were far too woody to be in a sandwich. Also had the cauliflower soup du jour that was rather cold and had an odd consistency. The reason the place gets 5 stars is the customer service. I mentioned the food issues to the waitress and the owner came over immediately, apologized, comped the entire lunch...which consisted of several glasses of pricey wine. I'm guessing the bill would have been around $120-140. He also offered to comp our next meal there or give us a gift card. Absolutely refreshing to see such courteous service.
