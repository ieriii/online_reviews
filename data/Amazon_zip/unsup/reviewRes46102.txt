Grand Lux Shit-Hole is an accident waiting to happen - I wasn't concerned about the average 45 min wait time to be seated; rather, I was concerned about the dining room, which was filled to capacity and the floors were extremely slippery. One girl walked past us and fell flat on her face. Management didn't even bother to put a sign up saying that the floor was slippery, or even try to wipe it dry. It was slippery EVERYWHERE! Plus, food took FOREVER to arrive. Entrees take 1 hour to arrive. Desserts, about 45 minutes. Are you frickin' kidding me? I should have went to Baskin Robbins down the street instead of waiting so long for a dessert. Also, we had 3 different waiters during the 3 1/2 hours that I was eating here. Hey Grand Lux Shit-Hole, this isn't Lawry's Prime Rib House where it's actually high-class eating and service. It's diner food! Come on! Treat us with some respect!
