Recently had a chance to experience this place and I fell in love. I felt as if I had gone back in time to a 1920's atmosphere but with a dash of modern chic. The dim lighting accented the fabulous light fixtures that culminated in the chandelier centerpiece on the first floor. I was lucky to catch some live music the night I went which was reminiscent of old school New orleans. On the second floor there is a quaint speakeasy that just adds to the laid back smooth vibe you get when you come here. The drinks were great but I plan on coming back to try the food which I hear is equally as great.
