delicious, but stressful. It's noisy and there's so much going on in there- which is really fun if your in a hyper, party group of people, but there is seroiusly action everywhere and people around you bringing you things. Maybe not the best for an intimate meal, but did I say... soooooo delicious. Very fine meat. I had mine medium rare, velvety texture and such good flavor.
