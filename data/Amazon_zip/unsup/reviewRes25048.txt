I had the most romantic dinner that I have ever had at Geja's. It is the perfect place for a romantic evening. We sat in a large booth and it truly felt like we were the only 2 in the whole restaurant. Because the booth was so big, it blocked out all of the sound and we sat there for over 2 hours talking, eating, and drinking wine. The food was very good, I mean, who doesn't like fondue. Plus they offer BOGO coupons all the time which is totally worth it - no need to be ashamed to use a coupon if it saves you $35! With or without the coupon, this place is definitely worth going to if you are looking for a romantic dinner for two and you like fondue.
