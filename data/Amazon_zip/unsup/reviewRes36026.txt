The owners of this place are awesome. Serving up delicious Asian BBQ with friendly service and cheap cheap cheap prices. The Peking Duck is the best I've ever had, and they know a thing or two about preparing pork as well. A Definite don't miss place in the Argyle neighborhood. The new space is warm and friendly, quite an improvement over the previous location around the corner.
