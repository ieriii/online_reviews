I had a great time here! We got to the restaurant around 8pm on a Saturday night. GF had been here several times and she warned me that we probably would be waiting 45 mins for a table since they do not accept reservations. Luckily we were seated inside of 10 minutes. The place is bustling with conversation and wonderful aromas. The bright red walls are decorated with many little whimsical framed pictures. We were seated in the main dining room and right behind us was a picture window opening to a small banquet space. As close as the tables were to one another you didn't feel like you were crammed in next to your fellow diners. At the start they bring you fresh italian bread and offer you garlic and red pepper as a topping. We started off with the insalate caprese and the portobella al gratin. The juicy tomatoes and fresh mozzarella balanced well with the oven-baked giant mushroom smothered with homemade sauce and melted cheese. She ordered the Lobster Ravioli entree in a yummy cream sauce and I had the Lasagna Caro Mio, piping hot with meat sauce. BYOB so we brought a bottle of Sangiovese and a bottle of Grappa (we went all in). For dessert I had the tiramisu and GF had a Chocolate Tartufo (sp?) something or other. Service was very prompt and courteous. We were never waiting long for the next dish. A very pleasant dining experience.
