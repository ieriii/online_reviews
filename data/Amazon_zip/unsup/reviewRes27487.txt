Don't even think about it! My boyfriend heard from a couple of people that this place was good, so we decided to try it. I ordered the barbacoa dinner and he got the skirt steak burrito, and also guacomole and chips. The burrito is cheap, $6, and it also tasted cheap. My barbacoa lacked flavor, I had to add sauce to have it even taste somewhat decent. The guacamole had NO taste and was expensive ($5 for a small), i had to add salt just so it can taste edible, and the chips were dripping with oil. Oh, they don't take any credit cards, so make sure to bring enough cash, but they do have an ATM located in the restaurant, conveniently. All in all, if you're looking for GOOD flavorful mexican food, you're better off going to Chipotle...
