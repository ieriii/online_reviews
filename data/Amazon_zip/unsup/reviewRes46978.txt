I have only been to U.G. one time, my last day/lunch in Chicago just recently.. I can only say one item that I remember and probably the main reason we went there: sweet potatoe fries. double fried with the last round being dipped in rice flour. CRISPY sweet potatoe fries... 3 days later I was back in SF and got the sweet potatoe fries at Zebulons.. nuhuh.. not cutting it. back to the old soggy notion of what sweet potatoe fries usually are. At U.G.? not the case! mmmmm mmmm i miss you
