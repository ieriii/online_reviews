Man, is this place overrated. I was hungry after the union meeting in Bridgeport last night and drove up north to this joint expecting something pretty good; I got a slice of thin crust with cheese and a slice of deep dish with cheese and sausage. The thin crust was too thick but tough and cardboard like without the bready, chewy texture of thicker thins like Salernos. If it were a steak it would be the cheap T-Bone at Waffle House. The deep dish was soggy mess; undercooked with medicore sausage (and not enough of it) and gobs of overly sweet sauce. The crust lacked the texture of deep dishes like Malnati's, Uno's and Ricobene's and the flavor lacked the pungency and layers of those places. It's like a deep dish for 9 year olds. Speaking of Ricobene's that's where I should'a stopped; their deep dish is a respectable Uno's clone far better than Art's and their thin crust is in another leauge.
