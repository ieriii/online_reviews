Much like several others I took a table of 10 to this place for a special occasion. I had been once before and that atmosphere and food were good so we decided to give it another shot. Pros: Most of the items we tried on the menu were very goodThe atmosphere - very cool and invitingCons:ServiceInability to take action and change the service experienceUnwillingness to accept responsibility for the service experienceLet me preface this by saying that I rarely complain at restaurants about the service (possibly two other times over the course of 20 years). In addition 90% of the review I post online are positive experiences. To better explain the service issue, this was a two+ hour dinner in which we were offered drinks upon arrival and once during the meal. Once the order was placed we only saw the waitress at other tables, she never came back. I flagged down a manager and explained the situation but nothing changed as another 45 minutes went by. Eventually I complained to the manager at the front to which they offered a free desert. They had three chances to change the attitude and level of attention. At that point the desert was not good enough so no thanks and I will never go back. The kicker - at first they would NOT remove the mandatory gratuity for a table of ten. After several discussions on this and reasonable explanation, they finally took it off. What was supposed to be a celebratory evening was turned to a waste of $500.
