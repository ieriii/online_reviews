This placew was pretty good. Im not a vegetarian but my friend is and I went because she always ends up sitting there eating bread everytime we go out with friends. So I really though I would puke up whatever I order and run screaming to the next steakhouse. Surprisingly the food was really good. I was not expecting the taste to be so well seasoned and flavorful. Way to prove me wrongKudos!
