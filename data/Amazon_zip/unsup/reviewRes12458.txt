I have visited piece out twice and i really liked my pizza. However i am big on service. Usually if your service is half ass then so is how your business either puts together food or operates. Piece out has horrible service. On one occasion a male server was being a little rude to the table next to me and and also to us....when i said what a dick..he changed his methods and gave better service the rest of the visit. Yesterday we went for lunch again and there were many employees walking about but they were so involved with talking drama with the pink haired girl that our drinks took forever..a coke and a beer..so we paid our bill and walked next door. There were 4 female and 2 male employees but they failed to leave the corner by the bar well stop talking amongst themselves and serve. All in alk maybe 5 to 6 tables in the bar so i think if they paid attention they could handle it. Try the pizza next door fast service thin crust pizza.
