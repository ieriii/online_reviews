This place is great as an afternoon/early evening restaurant/bar especially for sporting events...Everyone on here complaining about the DJs on a Saturday night must have gotten the wrong idea. LOL. There are 50 places within 2 miles you can go hear music and dance, this is not the place. However, if you want to watch a game and get good drinks and food, this is the place. Great patio that is ideal for people watching.
