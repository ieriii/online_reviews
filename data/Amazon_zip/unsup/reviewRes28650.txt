Always good ... ALWAYS! And even though it's a bit on the pricey side for Mexican food, every plate is well worth it. The atmosphere is also nice for close to any occasion.  If it was just food I would give it five stars, but I've had more than one run-in with a rude hostess. In the defense of the establishment, as soon as who seemed to act as maitre'd heard my group talking about said hostess on one occasion, he asked about it and quickly apologized.  And, Rick Bayless is regularly there working with everyone else in the kitchen! Well done, Rick!
