One of the best places for thin-crust pizza in Chicago! The white pizza with arugula is out-of-this-world...completely simple ingredients, but somehow it's perfect. The arugula gives the perfect bite to the fresh mozzarella di buffalo, and the crust is light and crispy on the edges, while chewy on the inside. The pizza with spicy pepperoni is also delightful.  And don't miss the fancy Italian peach tea--it's wonderful! Once we came to pick up an order, and the owner gave all of us waiting (and there was a huge line) little complimentary glasses of Prosecco, which I thought was a really gracious gesture. Prices are a tad high here, but totally worth it!
