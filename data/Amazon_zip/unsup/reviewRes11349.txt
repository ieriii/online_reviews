Today, The Bongo Room disappointed me. I think I had previously allowed myself to be sucked in by all of the hype surrounding it, but to today my bubble burst and for no particular reason either. The food is tasty. So that's not the problem. The prices are a problem, I think the food is very over-priced. Our waitress was friendly. So that's not the problem. However, she withheld the fact that they were out of the chocolate tower french toast until my fiancee tried to order it. That's a problem because I think she should have been more upfront about what she couldn't serve us. The coffee - kinda weak - that's a problem. But more so, for the prices that Bongo Room charges, I would at least expect real milk for my coffee instead of the creamer packets on the table.  Probably the thing I like least about my experience today is the fact that their menu still reads "fall 2009." It's March 27th, 2010. Not even winter anymore. It's spring. Me thinks it's time for a menu change - Bongo Room, and a change of scenery for me. Next time I want brunch on Milwaukee, I think I'll head to Cafe con Leche.
