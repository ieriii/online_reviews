This is THE best place to have a hotdog in Chicago! They have an assortment of gourmet dogs. Anytime I have someone in town I take them to Hot Doug's, and they always want to come back. I have had almost every dog on the regular menu and assortment of the specialty dogs. My personal favorites are the uber pork and buffalo sausages.  It is cash only and if you are going Friday or Saturday be prepared to stand in line for an hour or two, but it is more than worth the wait.
