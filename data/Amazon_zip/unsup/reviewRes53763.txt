One of my absolute favorite places in the city to grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere of a bygone era. So classy and lovely yet so comfortable. Great little joint. Bring your romantical partner, get there early to grab a seat, and enjoy some jazz by candlelight. I love dirty gin martinis and this seems like the perfect place to enjoy them!Sure, they may shush during the performances, but this is really a place you come to sit back and enjoy the music. There are so many bars where you can go to chat, and I think they do a great job of maintaining the integrity of the place and really making the music the central focus.My fiance and I were here last winter on the coldest night of the year, and it was so cozy and perfect. Definitely will return, hopefully sooner than later!
