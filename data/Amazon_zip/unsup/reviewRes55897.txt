I love the food here, I've come for both lunch and dinner. The lunch buffet is great and the tandoori chicken is to die for.  All of the food here is so flavorful. I've never ordered anything I didn't like from here.My only complaint is the buffet price. With tip it's over $20 a person, that's pretty expensive for a lunch buffet, so unless you've got the money to spend, it's not for everyday. I definitely still highly recommend it.
