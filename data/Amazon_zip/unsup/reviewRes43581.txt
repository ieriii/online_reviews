I was in town in Chicago for a concert and of course I had to have a taste of some deep dish pizza while in town.. I use yelp to find a pizza place close to the venue and found this place. I didn't want to order a whole pizza on my own so this place was perfect if you just want to have a piece of two. It was great.. For a Friday night at 7pm, there was plenty of space inside to sit. You order your pizza by the counter and you can have it to-go or to sit in their seating area. There were some parking spots left even though there were a lot of people dining in still some seats available. The pizza wasn't the best but it was good. It might have something to do with sitting in front of food warmers. I'm sure they'll taste better when you order them fresh. Overall, I'd go back again to have a quick taste of their pizza but if you want the best, I suggest you call ahead for a whole one.
