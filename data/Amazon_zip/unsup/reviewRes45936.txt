Went here for dinner last Thursday with an old college roommate...we got in in ten minutes, which was shocking to me, since every time I've walked past this place, there is a line wrapped around the corner! We had an awesome waiter, but he kept bugging us about the 30 minute desserts (which he said he would when he introduced himself, but geesh!)...I wasn't really hungry and I thought most of the entrees were pretty pricey...I order the Chop House burger (I think that was the name) and ate less than half of it...not because it wasn't good, but because I had no appetite...The fried were dried out, like they had been under a lamp light all day...I don't get that about French fries at a restaurant...they bring you a fresh burger and old fries! I can only think of two places that I've ever gone where the fries were just a fresh as the burger...Ruby Tuesday (believe it or not!) and J. Alexanders. My friend had the salmon and i saw some steamed veggies and some mashed sweet potatoes on her plate. She enjoyed her meal. We skipped on dessert... All in all being here reminded of me being at the Cheesecake Factory, which I'm not a 5 star fan of (menu is WAAAYYY too big)....the ambiance was cool, nice view of Michigan Avenue from where we sat. Going to the bathroom was like going on a journey! I don't know that I would go back, if I did, someone would have to be treating me! I certainly didn't feel like this place was worth the wait....
