The food. Oh god the food. I know its typically hard to screw up a hot dog and fries. But for some reason when you combine and pack the two inside a small cardboard box, some magical process occurs inside that blends them in perfect harmony.  On a side note, why is it that every time I eat here it is raining and windy? Just once I would like to have my windows down, music blaring (not so loud as to disturb the other cars), and vanilla shake flowing. Instead I get wet napkins and condiments and me trying to consume my food as fast as possible so I can roll my window back up.
