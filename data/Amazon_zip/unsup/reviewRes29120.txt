This is hands down my favorite thai restaurant in the city! I have been coming to Opart for as long as I can remember, and have never been disappointed by the food. The staff is friendly and fast, and the food simply speaks for itself. Thai is one of my favorite types of cusines, so I have tried pretty much every restuarant in the city, and rarely anything can compete with Opart. The only downside: because of the recent up-and-coming aspect of Lincoln Square, it has a tendency to build up a bit of wait on weekends, which was never a problem before. Thankfully, they recently expanded an entire store front and seem to handle to flow of people traffic rather well. If you know and love thai food, or just want a good first experience with it, try out Opart! Don't forget: BYOB
