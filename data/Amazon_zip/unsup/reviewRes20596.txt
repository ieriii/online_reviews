Saturday morning is the the time to hit it! No line, no waiting at 9:00 am. The empanadas were to die for. Light and flaky with a nice, spicy filling. The Azteca hot cocoa was a lovely accompaniment. Had the chorizo stuffed breakfast torta. Will probably just have the empanadas next time. These seemed to have just too much going on to really dial in on a focused taste. Surprisingly, the chorizo was not spicy at all.  But darn it, dig those empanadas!
