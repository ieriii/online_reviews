originally wanted a reservation on a saturday night but they were fully booked, of course. instead we got a 9pm reservation on a friday night. thank goodness we took a taxi b/c we would have never found it. there was no sign! our dinner turned out to be 4 hours b/c there were 4 of us and we were eating slow. but it was worth it all. the money. the time. the increase in inches around the waist. originally i thought there were two menus, as noted on their website, but now there is only one fixe prix menu for $185/person. for a michelin rated restaurant, is a VERY reasonable price. also it was name the #1 US restaurant in the top 50 restaurants in the world.. http://www.theworlds50be the wine pairing price changes daily as the food might change, causing the wine to change as well as the amount of wine consumed. its pretty expensive so we decided not to do the pairing. however since only two of us were drinking we went with the half bottle. we were about 1/3 into the meal and was about done with the bottle. so we ordered another. the sommelier was very helpful and knowledgeable. the food was wonderful. there were so many plates that came out and of course not EVERY single one can please everyone so there were some that were better than most but each has a very different and unique taste. each plate was like an art piece. i love how they play with the taste and presentation of each dish and many of them involved human interaction. i think most of us at our table agreed most that the lamb was the best. definitely definitely would recommend this place.
