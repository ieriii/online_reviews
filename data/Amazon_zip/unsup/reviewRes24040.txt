The chile rellano and the rice are delicious! The seasoning is just right, and everything is prepared properly. This is the best place to get a soy oatmeal shake.This is how good homemade costa rican food should taste like! This place is always packed, and the line is long on the weekends if you want to get a table. Everyone there is super friendly, and even with the commotion and packed room, they still managed to be polite and smile. I only wish this place were just a little bigger so I could get a table once in a while!
