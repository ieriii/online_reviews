With so many pizza joints around it's tough to stick out, but Spacca Napoli definitely does! This pizza is one of a kind in the city and is definitely worth a trip. We started off with the zucchini salad. It was a unique dish with a little vinegar and lots of fresh zucchini slices (sauteed I think). Also they offer a handful of glasses of wine (I don't usually order a bottle) from pretty unique grapes you don't find most places. The pizza is definitely the star of the show. The crust is chewy and charred and unlike any other thin crust I've had in Chicago. They use buffalo mozzeralla which adds a nice touch, and the tomato sauce is sweet and tangy. We ordered the mushroom pizza and the mozzeralla with arugula. Both pizzas were perfectly prepared. Yes at about 15 dollars per pizza the price is steep, but you have to pay to get quality. I will definitely make the trip back to Spacca for great, neopolitan-style thin crust pizza. And to top it off, it's down the street from a great dessert shop called Margie's Candies.
