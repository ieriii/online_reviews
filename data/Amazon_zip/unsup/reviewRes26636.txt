Awesome. Food was tasty, I had pork and girlfriend had flautas. Cheap too! Total bill was $18, including an horchata and an awesome fresh squeezed lemonade. Ill come back for sure :) Halfway through our meal some mexican music came on, not too loud, not too soft. Was fun. Service was friendly and on time
