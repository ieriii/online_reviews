I'll admit it. Before Superdawg, I questioned whether the Chicago dog could compete with my favored NY hot dog. After tasting the Superdawg, I can see why people love Chicago dogs and Superdawgs in particular. The dogs snap at the bite, the relish and onions flavor things up, and the pickled green tomato and sport peppers just seal the deal with their tastiness. They also make a mean crinkle fry with a nice crispy outside and a creamy potato core. I'm still not saying that the Chicago dog beats the NY dog, but its definitely a formidable opponent....Especially if that dog happens to be a Superdawg. I cannot wait for the next rematch.
