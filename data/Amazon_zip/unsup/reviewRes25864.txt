Absinthe....yes, they do have absinthe here. I know it may not be excting to many, and I know it isnt nearly as potent as what you would get in Amsterdam...but hey, I got a bit perky! They did it right too, with the communal ice contraption- dripping over a sugar cube. The space is drop dead gorgeous with high ceilings and grant park as a backdrop. Love the location, and the funky colors and paterns throughout. The food was right on, esp. the churizzo flatbread thingy...party in your mouth! I walked out the door onto Mich Ave with a smile on my face...hmmm, did the absinthe have anything to do with this?
