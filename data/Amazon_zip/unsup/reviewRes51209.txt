The restaurant itself is very cute - great ambiance, interior decor, etc. However, the food was just mediocre, at best. They give you their 'homemade' cornbread, which are basically a flattened thicker version of a pancake with whole corns - Sweet Tomatoes has better ones. For appetizers, my friend and I shared the Cheddar Herb Croquettes. There were three pieces, and they're not the typical croquettes you think of (ie, Japanese cuisine) - more mushy, not much cheesiness, but with the sauce, it kind of works - it seems kind of bland, regardless. For my entree, I had the Shrimp and Grits, which were shrimp in a house tasso (spiced ham) gravy with organic hominy grits - the grits were okay, and the shrimp were a considerable size. Again, the flavor wasn't doing much for me (the lack thereof). My fiance had the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich - pretty much the worst pulled pork ever. The Gumbo Ya-Ya, as my friend stated, would probably be better in small portions (as a cup size) - the sauce was way too potent with the smokey spices. I still think Heaven on 7 has the best gumbo, Cracker Barrel has the best grits, and Udon West has the best croquettes. If you want a cajun/creole/Southern cooking, either go to Lagniappe or Heaven.
