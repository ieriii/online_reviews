I had the best Filet that I have ever had at Ruth's Chris in Chicago last night. The ambience was nice, and the service was great. Our server Petra made it a nice evening. My girlfriend and I ordered the 39.99 three course special as well as the blue crab cakes appetizer. The blue crab cakes were to die for. The filet was perfectly cooked. It is was so good. I spent quite a bit of time slowly savoring every bite and flavor. The sides of squash, and garlic potatos were cooked to perfection, and our dessert with flan and exotic fruit was prepared just right as well. My girlfriend tried one of the their famous back cherry martini's. Suffice is to say, she loved them both. I give Ruth Chris kudos on every level. They blew it out of the park last night. Thank You!
