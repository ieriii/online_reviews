This place was everything I hoped for. I had eaten Ethiopian before in another city and had been eager to try Demera. The food was delicious! I ordered the vegetarian/meat messob in order to get a little taste of everything. The service was super friendly but very slow. The crowd was a mix of dates, family dinners, and friends enjoying the experience. Eating with your hands was an entertaining experience. I highly recommend Demera for a great break from the norm.
