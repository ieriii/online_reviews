I made plans to meet a friend for dinner at the Mayan Palace. I called Saturday afternoon for a same-day reservation and had no trouble at all, which was great. When I arrived, I was directed down a long, narrow, creepy hallway. I sort of felt like I was being sent to my death, because there's a dining room in front and the person who practically pushed me through the door into the hallway didn't offer any explanation and closed the door tightly behind me. The hallway (or tunnel) did eventually lead to a secret dining room. Once I was certain I was going to live, I perused the menu and ordered margaritas for my companion (who was running late) and myself. I am very partial to Cesar's margaritas, so I was prepared to be disappointed. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Patron margarita, mango flavor. It was very smooth and quite tasty, but for $12.50 I could have gotten twice the margarita at Cesar's. I ordered the chicken flautas, which were good but a touch overdone. Not tooth-chipping hard, but a few seconds less in the deep fryer would have made them that much better. The rice and beans had fantastic flavor! My friend had a quesadilla that she seemed to enjoy. We finished up by sharing the fried ice cream, which was pretty comparable to, say, Chi-Chi's (does that place still exist?).
