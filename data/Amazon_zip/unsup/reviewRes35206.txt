I've never sat in the dining room, I always sit at the oyster bar. It's one of my favorite places in the city. Every 3 months or so, I get a hankering to get my butt on one of those bar stools. You want a bloody mary? There's a big ole' shrimp on the side, along with a pickle, celery, lime and an olive. I've never had anything less than extraordinary. This is the spot to bring out of towners, it's amazing service and food, yet still comfortable enough to have a good time. Today we had buffalo shrimp, oysters, crab claws and champagne. Nothing makes a girl feel like a baller more than shellfish and champs.
