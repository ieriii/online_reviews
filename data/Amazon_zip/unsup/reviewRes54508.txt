Didnt even wait around to pay an absorbent price for meat-less meatloaf. You could cook any of this food at home, why tolerate the ABUSIVE service. I was REFUSED service because I was checking my voicemails on my cell phone, waitress, and waiter were both so RUDE that I left despite the hype this place has. In my ten years at eating out in chicago i have NEVER experienced a more rude of an experience than I had at the chicago diner. Not even at the weiners circle could you experience such condescending levels of nastiness to patrons, from smug wannabe hippies. Grab your fixed gear, and your colored bandanas and please ride off into the sunset, these types of staff and establishment are ruining our fair city.-the food allergist(eating healthy for more important reasons than you are.)
