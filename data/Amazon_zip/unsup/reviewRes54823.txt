I love love love the beer choices here. Every time I have friends in town, this is a must visit. Whether we end up in the dining room, upstairs, or in the front bar, I enjoy the food and drinks. The last time we went, we sat up front and joined a regular with a friend from Charlotte, NC. We enjoyed the addition and he shared his table. The beer choices are always amazing and slightly overwhelming. The mussels and fries are always a favorite to share. Even their glassware complimenting the beer is extensive. The only draback can be the noise level, but I am sensitive to that since I am blind and hearing is important when you can't see.
