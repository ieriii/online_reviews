I'm sorry to give this restaurant two stars because some of the food was good and the space is nice. However, the service was seriously horrible. Horrible! From the hostesses, the bartender, our servers (we had two - one awkwardly passed us on, mid meal, to another server who had no explanation for the switch. Weird!). Our first server acted annoyed and exasperated when we asked for recommendations and was defensive when we asked questions about the restaurant and how long he'd been there (juts making small talk, dude). Our second server could not make eye contact with us. The vibe was really, really off. I went there expecting a total package and a great experience. Instead I felt snubbed and rushed over. Unprofessional. What a waste. I'm not going back.
