With a place named after part of an egg, it better be "egg-cellent." As tradition with new brunch places, the eggs benedict is always my rule of thumb. Make a good one and I shall come back; fail to do so and you will experience my wrath. It turns out "Yolk" boasts the "best Eggs benedict in town." Bold statement indeed. Perhaps it was THAT statement that heightened my expectation. The eggs benedict was your typical one so I won't go in detail (if you don't know what it is, shame on you!). It was good but was it the best? No. My only gripe? It was way too salty (the top of my lip started to tingle...did they put MSG?!). Though, kudos to their fresh squeezed strawberry orange juice.
