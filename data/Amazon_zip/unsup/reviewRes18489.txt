I have now been here twice in the last month. I have been looking for a great Italian BYOB place. And this is it!! The first time I went was with a large group of 10 people. They sat us within 5 minutes of our reservation (and the place was packed)! We were expecting to wait but did not have to. It was great. I would recommend making a later reservation for a large group so you don't have to worry about being rushed. (We were never rushed, but we did have an 8:30 reservation--so there was no reservations after us). I also went last night with 2 other people...completely different scene. The place was not that crowded.  On both occasions the service was excellent and the food was delicious. I am lucky to go with people who like to share. I have tired the alfredo, gnocchi with spinach and gnocchi stuffed with asiago cheese, lobster ravoli (super yum), calamari (melts in your mouth), brushetti with fresh mozzarella, and the list goes on. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on this menu.
