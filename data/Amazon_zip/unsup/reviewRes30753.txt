If I could eat here 3 times a day I'd easily go vegan. The food is scrumptious. I'd highly recommend the potato skin appetizers and the shepherd's pie, which is so filling and satisfying you won't miss the meat at all. The desserts are so decadent and delicious. Try the carrot cake or the mocha mousse cake. The food here makes you keep saying over and over to yourself "this is vegan?" The service is really friendly and quick, there is parking in the alley next to the restaurant and the prices are right. What more could you want? I just wish this place was bigger and that there were more of them in every city across the nation. People need to see for themselves how delicious eating vegan can really be.
