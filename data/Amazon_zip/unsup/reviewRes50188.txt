Didn't eat but enjoyed getting some drinks here the other week. They have a good selection of drinks and the food menu looks tasty. We ended getting bottle service since they have decent prices on bottles here. It was a good time and actually a pretty good deal for a liter of vodka. They have multiple floors to help space the place out. The bottom and top floors seemed emptier on this night and are more there to get a table and chill out. On the main floor, they cleared out the tables in the middle of the room to make more room later in the night. Overall, I liked the vibe of the place although we had a slight issue with the bill with our waitress, I would definitely go back.
