Not in the mood for a crepe? Feel like testing the range of the Icosium kitchen after several years of reliably satisfying crepe-eating? Looking for something to warm you up during a cold snap? Go for the tajine. Sure, it costs twice as much as a crepe, but between the cup of soup, pita and cous cous on the side, and the sizable crock of Algerian goodness, you will end up with enough food for two substantial meals. Plus they bring the entire tajine itself to the table, adding a moderately festive element to your dining experience. Oh, and it's absolutely delicious too. Big kudos to server Tessa for handling the entire dining room, including a demanding table of twelve, by herself last night--with congeniality to boot.
