This guy does not no how to make an authentic Italian pizza! All he knows how to do is buy quality ingredients and be nice. Learn how to season...... a hint....... maybe some salt and pepper. I say this because ALL THREE PIZZAS WHERE COMPLETELY SOGGY. Ingredients falling off. Gross! People who give this place five stars don't know a thing about pizza and have never been cultured because they are use to eating fast food pizzas. You need more than a brick oven to make great pizzas! Its talent. I gave it 2 stars because the staff was nice.
