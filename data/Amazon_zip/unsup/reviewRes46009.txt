Do what your mom always told you not to do - get dessert first. Here, their desserts are baked to order and take about half an hour to prepare, so these babies will be ooey-gooey goodness by the time you're done with your entre and ready for some sugary lovin'. My lovin' came in the forms of their Crme Brulee Duo and their box of warm Homemade Chocolate Pecan Cookies. I probably could've finished all that by myself and then spent the rest of the day with a stomach-ache, but my friend and I split the Crme Brulee Duo (one was chocolate and one was vanilla and both were delish) - we each got to crack the top to one - and we saved most of the cookies for home (I say most because they looked so so yummy warm that we HAD to try some, of course). Right, working backwards, the entree! They serve very healthy portions. The Miso Glazed Salmon was great! It came with jasmine rice (not that cheap long grain stuff that you find at many other restaurants that's really dry) and their stir-fried vegetables actually tasted like the stir-fried vegetables my mom makes. While the sauce on my salmon was a tad on the strong side (very bold), it was perfect when eaten with a bite of rice. The location and atmosphere of this place is awesome - right smack dab in the middle of the Mag. Mile and within walking distance of the John Hancock Center and Millennium Park if you have the afternoon to spend wandering downtown Chicago or to show out of towners. Plus, the service is always fantastic so try it out (even for just a drink and a box of cookies if you wanted).
