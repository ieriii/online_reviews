Well, this place has the most interesting decour of the uptown Ethiopian places... But the food is not as great. It's more expensive and not quite as good as Dashen or, particularly, the Diamond. Please get some better live music than lounge lizardish type of stuff. I'm trying to remember exactly what we had, and I just remember more oil and less flavor than other places farther up Broadway. This place isn't bad - it's just average.
