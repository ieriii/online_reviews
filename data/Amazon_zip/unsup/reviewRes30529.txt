Went here last night for the husband's birthday and really expected something more exciting to be going on food-wise that just never happened. Although I have come around to steak, I will never be the fan that the husband is, so I look to him for the ratings on the meat. I had hoped for some decent shellfish selections, but other than the crab and lobster usuals, there were none as an entree. I was interested in the lobster roll on the sushi menu, but with red onion in it, no thanks. I also thought the crab and black truffle gnocchi sounded great - until they told me it was covered in alfredo. And, to top that off, my cocktail, a strawberry mule was SO strong, I had to trade the husband for his Goose Island Sofie. On to the main course. I did not know this was one of the places that thinks that serving on a 400 degree plate is cool. I find it ridiculous. The meat was good, mine was a petite filet and his a bone-in filet. Wet aged, but there are better steak houses out there without the side of spitting lava plate. Husband had a wedge salad that he liked and the french fries were plentiful and without crazy seasoning. He also had a chocolate coconut(?) cake that they threw in because it was his birthday and that was enough to share. Funny part was they never asked me if I wanted something else (i would have ordered at least a port) or whether either of us wanted coffee! Maybe it was an off night for service, but there were other slips like this (left the menus on the table for 10 minutes after we ordered), didn't check back on us often, lights so dim he had to use his phone light to see the menu, made a joke about the place liking their drinks strong when she had asked why our drinks were switched and not offering a new one....and we were there right when they opened - not a busy time at all. Just not that thrilling.
