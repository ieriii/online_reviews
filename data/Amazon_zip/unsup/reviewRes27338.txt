This is Chicago dining in full force. What do I mean by that? I mean an urban, design-oriented space, well-executed dishes and impeccable service. In Chicago sometimes the food is a bit too "messed with" for my palate, but generally creative, and served in very "design-y" spaces with excellent table service. Fluke tartare - flavorful fresh fish, transparent, well married flavors. Excellent. "Game birds" - squab breast w quail egg - don't remember the preparation very well, but I remember thinking "how clever" and "how delicious" in quick succession Deconstructed ceasar - tight bundles of romaine hearts in three neat stacks, one atop a "brioche twinkie" and all of them topped w a tiny little anchovy fillet. More clever than delicious, but still good, and will definitely elicit a chuckle Chicken noodle - was almost over a cold, so figured this would be perfect. It was. Chicken stock reduced till thick poured over small packets of flavor, such as a carrot "marshmallow." Delicious and clever. Sweetbread empanada - love me some empanadas, and these were no exception. Possibly the best dish of the night -- certainly the most beautiful. Plate once again peppered with little flavor packets that kept you guessing but never unhappy. Delightful. Hog cheek - the only dish that may have been a bit overdone. Flavors seemed too concentrated, too salty, and not in balance. The wine list showed immense creativity and broad knowledge. One of the most interesting lists I've read in a very long time. The beer selection is also deep and fascinating. Some dishes were paired with beer rather than wine (appropriately), which showed ingenuity and expertise. The one cocktail I had wasn't great, though the liquor list seemed well chosen. Service was unobtrusive and prompt. I could find no fault. Despite a few missteps, my overall experience was exceptional and memorable. I would recommend this place enthusiastically.
