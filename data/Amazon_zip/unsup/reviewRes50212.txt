Fifty/50 only gets 2 stars because it is only good for a few months out of the year when the patio is open!! The food is good, love the little slider sandwiches and the cheese fries are awesome! Service has always been good. The inside however... yuck. Agree with all the other Lincoln Park comments. This place is a nightmare on the inside on a Saturday night!
