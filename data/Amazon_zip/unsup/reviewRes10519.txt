I've been twice and I really want to like this place since the patio is probably one of the best in the city but I can't. I have tried 5 different things on the menu and they were all forgettable. On my last visit, I tried the faro pasta which had mushrooms, asparagus and truffle oil and it sounded amazing but it wasn't. Anything with truffle oil in my book should taste nothing short of heaven but I had to put salt in my dish. I should never have to do that for a pasta dish. The only highlights are the patio and the great wine list but I don't think I will be visiting this place again. Not with La Scarola down the block and Richard's bar. La Scarola blows this place out of the water.
