Some of the best italian food in the city! Very authentic and lots to choose from. I highly recommend the cheese stuffed gnocchi with chicken and spinach. The best gnocci I have ever had. And the saffron risotto is like my fiance remembers having at his Nona's. Remember it is BYOB. A very small place, so be sure to call ahead and make sure there is not a long wait. The place delivers too.
