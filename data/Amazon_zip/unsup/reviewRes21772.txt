You don't come to this place expecting to buy a burger. It's SuperDAWG, damn fool! The fries are smashed into a rectangular cozy box with the hot dog and the dawg is served up Chicago style. That means no ketchup. And please, for the love of all that is holy, don't put that crap on your hot dog. It wasn't meant to be. The pickle and pickled tomato are something to be desired... but like I said, it's Super"DAWG". It should probably be called Super"Shake" too. So buy yourself a dawg and a thick strawberry / chocolate shake for about $10 and enjoy on a nice fall day in Chicago.
