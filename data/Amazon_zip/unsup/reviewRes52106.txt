My meal at Gino's sticks with me more than a year later for two reasons. One - it's delicious. And Two - this is one of my most recent memories in which I ate way beyond my means and felt really morbid afterwards. The place was absolutely packed on a Thursday afternoon and we spent our 20-30 minute wait at the lobby/bar area. (You know a place typically has a long wait when the bar is literally in the lobby). But after a couple of beers, I was even more hungry and ready to eat anything. So pizza definitely didn't disappoint at that point. Though, next time I'm in the windy city, I'll be hitting up one of many other chicago pizza-houses to get the big picture.
