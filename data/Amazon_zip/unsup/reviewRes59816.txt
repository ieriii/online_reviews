I have to start by saying that I'm a picky pizza eater. I'm not from Chicago and have a really hard time with "Chicago style" pizza. This pizza place is by far the best I've had up here. Their pan crust is awesome, and the toppings are fantastic. My favorite part is that the pizza isn't swimming with sauce. I also like that you get a free liter of soda with orders over a certain amount of money! I will definitely be ordering again.
