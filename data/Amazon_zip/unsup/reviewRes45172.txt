My wife and I ate at Antiprima for the first time last night as we were strolling through Andersonville. Saw the cute place and took a chance. We were thrilled. The food was deilicous and the service was excellent. My wife is doing her best to get me into more neighborhoods to enjoy the diversity that Chicago has and one of the benefits is finding these kind of places. Lucky we got there early (5:30 approx) because by the time we left, the place was packed. Would go there again in a heart beat and highly recommend the place for its' food and character.
