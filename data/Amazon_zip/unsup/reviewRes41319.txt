After reading several reviews, I decided to take a chance and make reservations for my husband's birthday. Maybe we went on an off night but we were not impressed with this place at all. To start things off, we were running 5 mins late so we called to let them know only to be told we should rush. Our reservations were at 5:30pm! When we arrived there was only one other couple seated in the entire restaurant. Where did we get seated? Next to the front door! Now, I am all about maximizing space but when my husband can literally open the front door for other guests to come in there is seriously a spacing issue that needs to be addressed. As the evening progressed, we noticed other couples were allowed to pick their own seating. To make matters worse, they kept switching waiters on us and none of them were consistent with their description of the courses. The table next to us was told one thing while we were told another. At one point, I even made a joke about it to the waiter but they didn't seem to think it was an issue. Ok. At $200 (tip not included), I expect much better service. As for food, good quality but very small portions for the price. There were a few courses here and there that had an appealing presentation or unique taste, but overall the menu fell drastically short of what we expected from a fine dining experience. Most of the dishes came out luke warm which also turned us off. They did accommodate our diet needs. If you a bring craft beer, expect to get snuffed and don't expect them to provide a chiller. Ambiance - boring. The place is in a U shape so the majority of tables are in a hallway or next to the door. For the exorbitant price they charge, please buy a sign for your restaurant - only clubs and lounges should get away without having a sign. This place isn't cool enough to do without. There are much better places to try in the city. If you're a foodie, try Blackbird, Publicans, Girl and Goat (best value for the $$). SKIP THIS PLACE.
