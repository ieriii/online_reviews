I went here with a large group after hearing such good things and was hoping for a slightly better experience then we had. I will say first off that the food was good, particularly the duck and those delicious steamed buns (I could eat those all day). My issue however was with the service. I found that with the amount of staff they have working there, it was difficult to get consistent service. We had to ask for everything (napkins, bottle openers, water) several times from several different people. At one point, one of the people at my table walked up to the main counter and brought back two pitchers of water. When it was time for the bill (prefixed for the group), there were some discrepancies that took time and further discussion to work through and some concerns that there was not enough food for everyone to be pleasantly full. I don't want to write this place off just yet because the dishes we tried were pretty tasty, and perhaps it was just an off night. I would like to try it again with a smaller group and see if that would make the experience more enjoyable. Service goes a long way however, so hopefully they can step it up.
