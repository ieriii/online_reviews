Great service: Our server really knew what he was talking about. He knew what types of fish they were serving that night (more than a dozen) and he also knew the different ingredients that made up the dish. Atmosphere: Not too trendy (which I liked), very pleasant homey feel. The seating is limited although there is an outdoor patio, but I didn't mind because you can make reservations which they promptly keep. Food: The all you can eat king crab (Tuesday nights) looked DELICIOUS. I had fish topped with mushrooms and bacon which was amazing as well. I tried a bite of the meatloaf sandwich which was seasoned perfectly and well cooked. Overall, great experience. Would go there again.
