We celebrated our wedding anniversary with dinner at Sunda and had a wonderful experience. The service and food were exceptional. Sunda has a lot of energy, which only served to heighten our positive experience. Our server was talented in his service, and engaging on a personal level--he made our evening special. We were encouraged by our server to try some items on the menu that were unfamiliar to us, based on his personal experience and recommendation, and we we enjoyed each new item. The server took the time to ask/get to know our preferences, and made recommendations based on our preferences, together with his personal experience. In looking around the restaurant, it was clear to us that the customers were all enjoying themselves and also that Sunda had made sure that they hired the best and brightest for their team. We enjoyed every moment of our evening and can hardly wait to return. It was a wonderful anniversary dinner!
