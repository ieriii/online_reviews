We live about three blocks from India House and let me tell you - that's dangerous! The hubby and I have eaten here several times and always love our choices. A complimentary basket of naan is delivered to table with a dip of makhani sauce (divine). The menu is enormous, we always have so much trouble deciding which of the amazing dishes to order, but usually we end up choosing Chicken Makhani (him) and Kadhai Chicken (me). The Kadhai Chicken is just hot enough and uber-flavorful. Pairs perfectly with the Garlic Naan or Khurmi Naan. We always have enough left over for dinner the next night, and the leftovers are well packaged. The only thing to note is that you have to pay for rice, which is a bit odd. The food is a bit pricey, as "nice" Indian restaurants usually are. Service is quick and professional, food is delicious and hot, atmosphere is really laid-back. We love India House!
