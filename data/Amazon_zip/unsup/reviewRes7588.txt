I hated it. I went in there with high expectations based off of what my friends had said about it 3 years previous and was sorely let down. Yeah I suppose that the food was pretty good but the overall ambiance of the place sucked balls. Screaming babies, crowded rooms, you're constantly being bombarded by the servers waving their meat sticks at you (if i wanted that sort of experience I would go to Spin), and somebody spilled a glass of red wine on me because they were too drunk to stand up properly. Fuck you Fogo De Chao. I wish in the "Good For:" section there was an option for "a shitty time".
