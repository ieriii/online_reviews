I haven't been here in a while since I don't live in Chicago, but when I used to visit frequently I LOVED this place. Creative use of non-meat products that actually taste really really good. My favorite was the grilled "chicken" ceasar salad. I've taken my whole (meat-eating) family there and they've enjoyed it as well.
