Best oysters in Chicago! I usually head into the oyster bar and slurp down kumamoto or beau soleil varieties. They usually will have a dozen or so fresh oyster choices on any given day. The blue crab fingers are excellent and all the fish dishes I've tried have been great. However, I would not recommend the sushi-there's nothing exciting about it.
