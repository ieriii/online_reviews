Just had the most amazing night at Lockdown Bar and Grill. The atmosphere and the food totally rock!!!  The appetizers were great (starting with the great chips that arrive as soon as you sit down). We had the Prison Shanks which were so good I couldn't stop eating them and the Vietnamese sandwiches were so tasty. I had heard so many great things about the Mac and Cheese and it did not disappoint - awesome!!. Plus my friends and I shared several burgers including the Warden Burger and the Arson Burger. This is some of the best food I have ever had. Check it out, you will be happy you did.
