I love this place. I have driven from Rolling Meadows to Chicago just for a mango drink. I bring out of towners here and they love it. The only thing is, its small inside. Which is fine, but the bathroom is like IN THE RESTAURANT, next to tables. Which kind seemed weird to me at first, but hey, its a old building and Americans are a bit spoiled LOL Sit on the patio if you can, its awesome to sit in the sun and have empanadas. *SInce Zaggat made them famous, sometimes they get busy. Dont think its lost its awesomeness by being bombarded by zagget-ers. Its still incredible food!
