This restaurant is very good ! Definitely the best Italian restaurant in Chicago! We a had fresh imported burrata set on a finely sliced bed of culatello drizzled with a sublime quality of Olive oil.The main entree were fantastic. Risotto with asparagus, so creamy and tasty and home made gnocchi with fresh mushrooms just as creamy and earthy. We ended up sharing a wonderful order of grilled branzino fish with broccoli rabe on the side. The espresso coffee served with authentic home made cookies was amazing. I highly recommend it.
