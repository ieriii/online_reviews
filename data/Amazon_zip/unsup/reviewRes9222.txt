Whenever I told people that I moved to Albany park, they would tell me I had to try Noon O Kabob. I gotta say it's pretty damn good. The amount of delicious food you get is incredible! I was able to eat one of their dishes for 3 meals...and I'm the type of person who always cleans their plate .I've dined there a few times and had something different each time. I wish I could tell you what dishes I have had, but I don't remember. All I can say is that everyone I was with had a different dish and they all enjoyed it!
