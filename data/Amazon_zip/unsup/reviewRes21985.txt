I'm pretty much in love with the old-time drive-in feel of this location. The hot dogs are damn delicious too. I usually order hot dogs without anything on them but here, I get almost everything. Mmm! Now I'm craving some for lunch..... The only downside for me is that Superdawg only takes cash, which I don't often have. On the other hand, it just adds to the atmosphere. Now if only I could convert my friends from vegetarianism back to eating meat again....
