Simply put, this is the bar of all bars.  I travel frequently (no longer live in Chicago) and always end up in fantastic pubs (Brick Store Pub in Decatur GA, Toronado in San Francisco, Old Monk in Dallas, etc.). The Hopleaf is still my hands-down favorite. EXCELLENT selection of Belgians, knowledgeable staff, and expertly paired food. Looking for a recommendation? Ask Kate (if she's still there) and you can't go wrong.
