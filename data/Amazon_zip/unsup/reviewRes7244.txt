Absolutely loved this place!!! Went here after seeing the Million Dollar Quartet at the Apollo during the holidays and everything was very booked up, so we thought we'd try a new place, Sapori and were we surprised. The pasta was the best pasta I have ever had, and I have had fresh, homemade pasta before and this place beats them all. The restaurant is smallish but very cozy with very high ceilings. Wine bottles packed all the way up! It was packed but everyone had enough room, except maybe the waiters, who were just the best. We were a party of 5 and each ordered a different entree, Lobster ravioli, filet minigon with garlic potatoes, rigatoni with sausage, gnocchi and chicken marsala, which were all exceptional! (There was somethng there for every palate.) Well done Chef Tony! You were too busy in the kitchen to compliment, but we'll be back., just keep making that great pasta!!!
