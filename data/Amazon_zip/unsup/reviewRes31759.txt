Nana for me is a two sided coin. During a bustling brunch time I experienced great service, ambience, and even music, but their food was lacking. The three entrees my wife and I ordered were the tofu scramble, a breakfast skillet, and some French toast, but only the French toast was something I would ever eat again. The scramble was too salty and tasted of vinegar and the skillet was uninspired and plain. During a slow and empty restaurant dinner visit I experienced so-so service and an ambience that resembled a museum, but their food was delicious. The three entrees I had this time were a fresh peach salad, some crispy vegetable tempura with spicy aioli, and their cheeseburger with a fried egg and bacon. All three were unique, well plated, and very tasty. So, as you can see I've been to one restaurant and had two distinctly different experiences. I'll definitely come back a third time to try to see what comes of it but it'll have to wait. Their prices keep me from trying them out on a regular basis. Especially if I don't know for certain what side of the Nana coin will show its face.
