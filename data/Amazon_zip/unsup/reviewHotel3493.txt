We ran into a minor problem, but when we talked to someone they upgraded our room to their best in the house on top floor. Service here is impressive. The building is a bit old so the rooms are pretty small and ceilings low. I enjoyed their contemporary deco. The location is the best if you enjoy shopping and good food.
