I must add my two cents... I enjoy the cheese on my pizza to be what most would consider burned...I prefer to call it toasted and chewy. Anywho, Pequod's is a useful discovery for me because of their renowned pan pizza with its wring of carmelized cheese on the crust. It just adds another layer of flavor to their already yummy pizza. Though I prefer a saucier pizza, their fresh and puffy crust and generous ingredient amounts make up for the sauce deficit.  Chicago's pizza and pretty much any other type is for when you are drunk, rowdy, and trying to stop a hangover. Pequod's (and I suppose Malnati's is in the same ballpark) is for a sober night when you will remember the experience.
