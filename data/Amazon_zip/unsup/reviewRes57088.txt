OMG this place ROCKS. I am not a big beer drinker but this brew is making me think twice about beer. I had the Bacon, parm, and Basil Popcorn which was good and only 4.00 so I didnt feel like i was being taken. I had the Mussels with blue cheese, leeks, and apples. OMG it was the BEST. had to get more bread to suck up the juice but it was not enough....so, i ate it like soup. MMMMM. we also had the duck and bread appetizer and it was da bomb. I really recommend this place. It was great. The wait on Friday night was too long 2.5 hrs at 7:00 at night. So we went Sunday around 12:00 and its was very biz, but not too long of a wait. I cant wait to go back.
