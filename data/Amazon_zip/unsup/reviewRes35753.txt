I received a very nice call from the owner of Shaw's Crab House today. He was very pleasant and genuinely cared about my dining experience. There aren't too many that are in his position that would take the time to listen to my thoughts - especially since I am just one of many customers walking through the door. I would go back since there were parts of my meal that were amazing - only this time I'd order just the crab legs.  :)
