Have you ever read a profile on a dating site (let's just say OKCupid) where the striving dater (let's just say it's a 30 year old guy) starts his description by writing several hundred words (only three of which are used incorrectly) expressing shock that he's on a dating site, affirming that he's too cool/successful/smart to be on a dating site, justifying why he's then on a dating site, declaring that he's kind of forced to be on a dating site because everyone else is on a dating site, and finally asserting both your and his embarrassment that both of you have wound up on a dating site? This basically summarizes my feelings about Longman & Eagle. I feel like if someone I knew saw me eating here, I would pretend like I've never eaten here before and was just eating here to see what it was like, and just because other people eat here and... um, ugh. Yeah. And then I'd hope that they would do the same. Maybe if they did, then I could ask them to grab a chair. The truth of it is that sometimes we just have to face who we are. Even though Longman is the kind of place where all of the waitstaff spend multiples of their income pretending to look slightly unkempt, the fixtures creek under the weight of being faux reclaimed from a Scottish firehouse, and the pigs from which they source their bacon furrow their piggy brows trying to figure out how they will end up dehydrated and reconstituted into confit... I like it. A lot. It's good. At its basis, it's just a concept bar/restaurant (the hipsters who hate hipsters concept). But it's one that serves a good meal. And that's what's important.
