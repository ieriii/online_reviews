Currently, my favorite place in Chicago. Takes the gastropub idea to a level previously unseen. For a pork lover, it's heaven. Menu is organized top to bottom smallest portions to biggest. Constantly rotating which means you can go in 4 times a month and always have something different. A huge plus. Standouts are the pork rinds, mussels, charcuterie and sweetbreads, which are always on the menu in some form or another. Desserts are also a huge strong suit. They rotate as well so be sure to try at least one on your visit. It also has the second best beer list in the city besides Hopleaf. Some great hard to find European and American craft brews and the resident beer "sommeliers" do a great job pairing them up. Great atmosphere and staff. A terrific addition to the Chicago dining scene.
