Disclaimer: They claim to be small plates, but the portions aren't that small at all! Disclaimer 2: The wait is pretty long regardless of when you come. I came with my friend at 2:30 PM on a Wednesday afternoon and we weren't seated until 3:15. This place is pretty amazing! They have some really creative dishes and bold flavors that make everything an adventure for the first time. And for the most part, these are some of the best dishes I've ever had. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - 5/5 - Oh my. I wasn't sure what to expect and it was just amazing. The bone marrow is so fatty and soft and juicy and rich. Paired with delicious fried bread, it's an explosion of oil in your mouth, but in a good way! Every bit of oil and grease contributed to the flavor and the The capers are nice to offset all the richness of everything. Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette - 5/5 - I'm not the biggest fan of goat cheese to be honest, but this was amazing. The strong flavors of the beets and the goat cheese offset each other perfectly. And to top it off, they was a nice layer of pistachios to give some crunch to an otherwise soft dish in additional to the nuttiness. Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce - 4/5 - THIS THING IS HUGE. The turkey was soft and almost melted in your mouth. The one thing I didn't like about it though was that the flavor was too focused on being sweet. I kind of wish there was still a bit more savoriness to it. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - 2/5 - If you've had pig's ear not fried, you know how soft and gelatinous it is. They've deep fried the ear as strips and they taste a bit bland. I feel like the point of the dish is the crunch but the ears are just a miss for me. The crispy kale however was spot on and saved the entire dish for me. tl;dr - Bone Marrow and Beets all the way!
