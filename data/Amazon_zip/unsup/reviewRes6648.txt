I asked a foodie friend of mine for a restaurant that was fun and featured great people watching but wouldn't break the bank, so he recommended Davanti Enoteca, which I probably would have never checked out on account of the fact that I live a million El stops away from it. I'm so glad we tried it! We went at 8 PM on a Saturday night and were told that there was an hourlong wait, but were helpfully told to try the wine bar across the street, so we killed some time there and enjoyed the $5 sparkling wine special. The interior of Davanti is lively and cool but I didn't feel like it was too trendy or sceney. I had already scoped out the menu before we went so based on everyone else's recommendation we tried the ricotta and honeycomb. Wow. I wish I could eat that every day of my life--the creamy/sweet combination was fantastic, and the bread itself was so nicely broiled and chewy. We also tried the truffle toast which was nice and the wheatberry salad, which I loved. In addition (yes, we pigged out), we had the prosciutto and arugula pizza (which was good but I don't think it was necessarily much different from a decent pizza of the same style somewhere else) and the meat plate, which was an orgy of pig. Also, we had a nice bottle of wine. We weren't really interested in dessert after this but the waiter told us the desserts that were available and actually told us he didn't particularly recommend any of them, which I really appreciated. He wasn't just trying to sell us on some leftover desserts that wouldn't be as tasty as the rest of the food. I highly recommend this place! Definitely worth the trip if you're not in the area. I keep *almost* regretting how much I ate last night, and then I remember how good it was --it was totally worth the calories.
