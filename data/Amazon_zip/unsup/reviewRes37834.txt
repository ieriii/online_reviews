Restaurant Review Mozzarella goodness! Me and my wife were craving pizza this past week and ended up ordering carryout at Giordano's which was great given the online promotion for 20% off your order. The place was completely packed when we walked in and the wait time was over 1 hour so I was happy to pay for my pizza and run home to eat it while it was still piping hot. Our "pie" selection of the evening was deep dish spinach and sausage which was delectable. There is ample amounts of mozzarella with tomato sauce on top. The spinach was fresh with good amount as well. I would have to say that the toppings definitely trump Gino's, but the crust itself was crunch and lacked any flavor. Otherwise ranks in the top 3 pizza places in Chicago! Pro- fresh ingredients, on time pickup, ample toppings/cheese Con- long wait times if you want to dine in, boring deep dish crust Hidden deal- Order online for 20% off your first order. Pickup your pizza to save on tip!
