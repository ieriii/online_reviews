I will preface this by saying, I am normally a pretty healthy eater... This is probably the worst food on earth for you in terms of nutrition. But, when you got to have meat, this is your place. I had the game of the week when I went, which was an elk, venison, buffalo and antelope sausage smothered in a cherry brandy sauce and topped off with chunks of blue cheese. It was by far the best sausage I have every had--hands down. The duck-fat fries will probably take a few years off my life in the end, but it was worth it.  Yes, the line sucked; yes, the hours are a bit restrictive. Do I care? No!
