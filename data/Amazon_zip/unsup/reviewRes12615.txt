This is one of my favorite restaurants. I highly recommend the Honey Jalapeo Pork Chops. The first time I ordered these, and they brought out two huge pork chops with mashed sweet potatoes on the side, I thought, " I'll never be able to eat all this". But after one bite, I loved it so much I ate the entire thing ! Now it's one of my favorite meals in Chicago. I have been to the restaurant a few times and the service is always very good and the atmosphere is very relaxed. They only accept reservations for parties of 6 or more, but on my most recent visit I went with a party of four at 7 PM on Friday night and were seated immediately.
