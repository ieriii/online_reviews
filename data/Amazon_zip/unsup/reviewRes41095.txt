So how do you say "the chef is trying to hard" in French?  Apparently, 'Bonsoiree'. So I had no idea about this place until the Groupon came up, I got the Groupon and thought the wife and I would check it out since it had gotten nice reviews prior to my arrival. We went on a Tues night, my wife and I did the 4-course in about 90 mins (we were told the 7-course would take 3 hours). It was nothing special, first course was a seafood salad, second a vichyssoise, which did have some flavorful mushroom and nori sauce. However next came our entree, and what do you get for ~$60 a plate at an imaginative, french concept restaurant?-- a pork chop. I mean really a pork chop?  I don't know if it was some kind of magical pork chop, but I am not flying yet, so I don't think it was worth it. Then came the dessert, milk and dog biscuits, they called them cookies but they were dry, and flavorless. Even with the Groupons the bill came to $60 per person, if I had paid full price, I might have refused or at least told them a pork chop was not acceptable and to bring me a new entree. Overall the food was shockingly bland, almost no flavor at all, with the exception of the vichyssoise. The wine with the meal was excellent, it was called Paraduxx, but we brought that ourselves.
