Finally popped in here to eat after getting out of work early on a beautiful sunny Friday afternoon! Service was kind of slow, but it was lunch time and I wasn't in a hurry so I don't know if it's always like this. Only thing I didn't like that I ordered was the empanadas. They tasted kinda like ones you buy in the frozen food section. The Chifrijo (an authentic starter of black beans mixed with fried pork and diced veggies), served with chips was very delicious. We ordered the small and it was huge. I definitely had more than enough to take home with me. I went with the Pepito sandwich which is one of their specialties. It's a steak or chicken (your choice) sandwich with sauteed onions, cheese and this delicious spicy Lozano sauce. Food is good, prices are reasonable, it's BYOB and has a nice vibe. CASH ONLY! I'm a fan and look forward to coming back to try some more of the food on their menu.
