First time in Chicago, what better place to stay but the W Hotel. Right? I don't get it. It's like pulling teeth to make store employees in Chicago to say "HELLO" or just plain out help you. I got this here at the Hotel. Isn't Concierges suppose to help you. WHENEVER AND WHATEVER? That's the W HOTEL MOTTO. When I asked for Car service to take me back to the airport, what did the chick do, instead of calling for me, she wrote on a piece of paper the phone # and had me call myself. Asked her to print out my itinerary for my flight, she was having a hard time, since she didn't read the paper correctly to notice that I was flying a different airlines on the way back, she had the nerve to say " Was this a frequent flyer ticket for free?" making me sound like I was from the ghetto. I had a great view, since they upgraded me, but the service sucks there. I can do without the attitude
