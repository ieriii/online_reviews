The raves are justified -- totally. From being voted by Chicago Magazine as one of the Best New Restaurants of 2005 when it opened to the frequently full dining room(s), this restaurant lives up to the hype. The combination Japanese/Thai menu is the best invention ever. If you're not in the mood for sushi or tempura or noodles or curry -- then what good are you??? There is something for everyone. I try to order a new dish every once and again, though I have my favorites (drunken noodles with tofu, veggie tempura maki, tofu steak teriyaki), and I have never been disappointed by anything I've ever ordered -- in fact, I ususally end up with some new favorites. Presentation is a huge plus at the restaurant: the sushi looks like art, and it really elevates the whole experience. Service is wonderful, sweet, and charming. Another biggie: BYOB. If you forget your wine, there's a Dominick's across the street. Phew! Their take-out is really fabulous as well -- the quality of the food comes through and nothing is lost in transport or translation. With the recent expansion of the restaurant, the space has really opened up. The new seating area is very well designed, clean and modern, great lighting. The original seating is still comfortable and intimate as well. You can't go wrong with either side -- and with more space, hopefully there will be less waiting time during their peak hours. Oh and the prices -- un-freaking-believable. Sometime I'm going to really go nuts with appetizers, sushi, and dessert, and maybe then, just maybe, the bill might fit. Otherwise, you won't believe the deal you're getting!
