If I could give this place 6 stars I would. I LOVE THIS PLACE! My friends make fun of me for constantly talking about "noona", but i just cant help it. I can eat their chicken kabob meal over and over and over and still eat it the next day.  I have been coming here since this place first opened, and never had a bad meal! Basically anything you get there is guaranteed to be good, but the lamb, ground beef, and chicken kabobs are wonderful. Also their rice -both white and dill- are so flavorful. Yum yum yum!
