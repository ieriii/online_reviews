Big Jones just improves on knowing, and after my visit last weekend with mom I decided an update was in order. We arrived Sunday at prime brunch hour, to find Mark (one of the owners) up to his eyeballs with patrons, both walk-ins and the more organized reservation types. I volunteered us to sit at the bar, Mark hesitated, said he could offer us a table in 30 mins; mom, from out of town, replied that she had a packed day and needed to get back on the road ASAP. Mark asked for 5 minutes, after which we were seated at the very busy bar with the caveat that "we were going to become very familiar with the restaurant business in these seats."  What happened next was that the bar staff (one of whom was in training) was superlative, simultaneously making drinks and serving brunch while being personable and funny - never once showing any sign of stress. (Maybe they drink Hurricanes on break?) Warm beignets and coffee served promptly, mom was in love. Then came brunch: The Country Breakfast for me (which included "straight up collard greens" - which I ate and LOVED), and Corn cakes (think pancakes) with black beans, sour cream, eggs etc for mom - absolute heaven.  Will go back, again and again, because the food is great and the people here clearly love what they do and their clientele. Highly recommended!
