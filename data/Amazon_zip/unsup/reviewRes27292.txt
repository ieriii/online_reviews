3.5 Stars... Mexican food happens to be one of my staple go-to "ethnic" foods... so much so that my diet has convinced my body that it's a primary food group. As such, I'm often willing to cough up ten bucks a week to swim in a platter of rice/beans and cheesy enchiladas... I was very skeptical when friends/coworkers suggested that we dine at Chicago's finest upscale Mexican eatery.... "upscale" Mexican food? HUH? But, like a natural foodie, I was open to trying & tasting just about anything. After putting my name on the waiting list... the 'fabulous' male host said - in what seemed like extra slow motion - "Theee waaaiittt willl beeee THREEEE HOUURRRS." I'm sorry. WTF did he just say? Anyway, we waited. The bar around the corner was our saving grace! And three hours later, we were seated... starving, and happily ready to order our food. A few things... (1) Not really "Mexican" food. It is fusion, inspired by Mexican food. (2) Their fusion food was average. Their tortilla soup, above average. (3) Portions are small. (4) Mojitos are stellar. (5) DON'T COME HUNGRY. You'll die starving. And all things considered, this place deserves a 3.5 (even with the omg 3 hour wait).
