Finally. A place that has a very good breakfast!  I went here with mixed expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. I had the "create your own" omelette, which was very good. The "home fries" were well seasoned and fresh (unlike the left over potatoes that many restaurants serve), the toast was even fab. A very, very good breakfast! Yum.
