Wowzer....this place is fantastic!!First, I must say that the ambiance of the place is spectacular. We went on a Wednesday night and had a fantastic time. The space is warm, inviting, and comfortable. The service is unlike many other restaurants in the city. They are very attentive-from managers, to servers, to bussers-all stopping by to make sure all was taken care of. Our server, Jonathon, was fantastic and made our experience both satisfying and fun. He was very knowledgeable and helped guide us to the perfect wine and meal-all with a bit of wit and charm!The hush puppies were amazing!! I'm still thinking about them. We split the Comp St Louis and the pork and had never had better tasting meat-incredibly tender, flavorful, and juicy. The bbq is good but honestly, it's not really needed.We will be back!
