Quite often I have done take out from here, so I never felt I could give a proper review. Now that I have dined there I can! This is a great little place. The food is always tasty and the margarita's are great even by the pitcher. It is a tiny but quaintly decorated place and I know on the weekends it can get pretty busy. Service was good, friendly and prompt. The prices are sensible. It is a solid fun place to go with a few friends and a have some fun!
