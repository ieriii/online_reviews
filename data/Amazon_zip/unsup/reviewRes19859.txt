Attended a recent function here and was surprised at the vast alcohol selection. I know how to pour myself a drink, glass of wine or an imported beer, but I will seldom make myself mixed drinks; Therefore, I took advantage of the open bar to sample some of their selection. I confess I tried some of their fruitier concoctions such as the Maestro and The Ward 8, which were decent. The Hors d'Oeuvres selection was fair, if a bit insubstantial - sampled the "shrimp-on-a-fork," ceviche on a cornchip (housemade I think), portabello on a potato chip (housemade), scallop, fries & curry dip, roastbeef & horseradish puff, oysters on the half shell, toast and melted cheese as well as a petit fors type selection - scallop was the standout item. They offer dinner, and the executive chef is of some renown in Chicago. The bar scene itself is interesting - very homogenous crowd. A few attractive people here and there, if that's important to you. Very "after business hours" work crowd - a mix of ages. Incongruous mix of techno/house music playing for an "Irish pub" - maybe I'm not hip to the current modern Irish pub scene. The decor is very subdued, dark woods and leather. Service was attentive. Only true minus was that they "lost" our reserved room to another party - I'm sure it was simply a matter of economics, but the substituted area we got was not great for a meeting, being right off the bar area, but was OK for checking out the rest of the bar and getting a good idea of the place.
