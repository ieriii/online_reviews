I'm kind of weary to try falafel because it seems to be one of those foods that is either delicious or disgusting, never in the middle. Sultan's falafel is delicious, quick, and cheap! That's all there really is to it. When you go here make sure to note the Pete Wentz signed photo on the wall as it is really funny...to me.
