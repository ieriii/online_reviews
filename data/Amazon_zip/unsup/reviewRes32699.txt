Id rate Sunda a 3.5....Trendy locale, courteous and knowledgeable service. The chef at one point stopped by our table to introduce himself and ask how we enjoyed dinner. Most of the dishes were superb in my opinion --the dragon sushi was fresh, and beautifully presented. The loompya was just O.K. I prepare at home by rolling the ground pork, beef, shredded carrots, potato, chinese cabbage, ginger, peppery Philipino filling in a thin lumpia wrapper. What was served was more of a sausage consistency rolled in a thick egg wrapper...not horrible, but not as moist and vegetable/meat describable an appetizer as I would have liked. The dipping sauces were tasty. The seabass was off the chart --flaky, moist, flavorful but not over powering of the fish. I could eat the seabass dish every day! The pureed cauliflower just didn't do it for me. I wished there was more flexibility in the menu to allow the guest to substitute the side items rather than be forced to order based on the 'chef's plan' as described to us by the waiter.
