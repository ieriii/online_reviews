This place has received a good amount of praise from my foodie friends. I can see why. I was a little concerned about the "Takes Reservations: No" part. Of course, this is just one data point, but there was no wait on a Wednesday night at 6:30. Makes me consider running more errands in the city after work during the week. Could just be beginner's luck, I suppose. I got a small plate of porcini with veal heart and the pork belly confit as the entree. Oh my god. I wanted to lick the plate when I was done. (I didn't) It's food that my mom would probably like, and that's about the highest compliment a restaurant could receive. You see, she's oldschool Chinese, so she cooks a mean meal and just doesn't see the sense in going out and paying more for "restaurant food," especially once you factor in the value proposition. She would normally balk at the prices of any restaurant with more than one dollar sign on Yelp, but I feel pretty confident that I could take her here and she would love it. To sum up, top-notch food, casual atmosphere, thoroughly enjoyable. Longman receives my unquestioned endorsement.
