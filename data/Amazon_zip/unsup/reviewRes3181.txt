I was extremely excited to try this place after receiving great reviews from friends. I ordered half the chicken with the seoul sassy sauce and the other half with the bbq sauce. This place is not bad besides that it was a little too salty. I guess I had high expectations after the scrumptious korean chicken I had in NYC. Everyone should definitely give this place a try, **Update*** I went back to Crisp with a group of my friends. I didn't order the fried chicken this time. I ordered their bulgogi burrito and was rather satisfied. Especially considering I walked in with a mindset that everything there was going to be salty (after my first experience). I would recommend ordering the fried chicken in addition to a dish that contains rice. I tried a couple pieces from my friend's order while eating my burrito and found they balance each other well. I'll admit. I like this place a little more now... =)
