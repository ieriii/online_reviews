Exclusive, speakeasy-style lounge in Wicker Park. The concept is a New York transplant and it shows. This perriwinkle curtain clad-hipster mecca is doing the old stuff right: the menu is ripped from the pages of the Savoy Cocktail book- Sazeracs, Negronis, Pinm's Cupp, etc. They source some of the best product available in the US and make the majority of their mizers and bitters.... result: a Pimm's Cup No. 1 variation that you cant have just one of.  The atmosphere allows for just the right amount of pretension: strict policies on cell phones, seating, and behavior, coupled with swanky staff and darker than dim lighting. The bartenders are true service professionals, complete with an impressive Japanese hard shake.  Downside: We usually sit at the bar. I understand that it's alot easier for the staff to maintain composure in service when your seated at a table, barseating is essentially in your "server station". But, when one bartenders starts a expletive- ridden tiff with another about "stealing shit from other people's setup", it destroys the vibe for the kid's on the other side of the bar. Take it in the kitchen, please.
