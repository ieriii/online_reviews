mia francesca is pretty darn good. i really enjoyed francescas forno for brunch over in wicker park, so was excited to try another restaurant in their group. ended up here last night w/my aunt and roommate and we had a great time! had no trouble walking right in at about 6:30 (though it does look to get quite crowded around 8 or 9) and picked a wine right away, a red on special...and very tasty...we wound up having 2 bottles! the staff is very helpful with wine choices, since most are from italy, so likely somewhat unfamiliar. when it came down to ordering...i got a caprese salad and the 4 cheese pizza (very unique cheeses, btw...which was nice. bleu cheese, goat cheese, mozzerella and one other i cannot remember), my roommate got a caprese sandwich and the mussells and my aunt got the house salad and the roasted half chicken...and all of us walked away stuffed and satisfied. all of the ingredients were extremely fresh (esp the mozzerella & tomatos in the caprese salads) and everything else was just great! i hope to visit again when the craving for italian food strikes!
