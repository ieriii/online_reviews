Gilt bar, you have answered my prayers!! All that I have been longing for...I stopped in over the weekend for a cocktail with friends and was blown away by the dark, seductive interior. Tiny lights twinkle like the night sky in dining room, above salvaged tables and tufted leather settees. Loved the thoughtfully conceived drink menu; they also had an impressive draft list, as well as some interesting wines by the glass. The bartender was well versed AND friendly (big plus!). Dinner plans at a friend's prevented us from ordering food, but the menu was definitely tempting. Approachable share plates like a shaved veg salad, roast chicken, burrata, meatballs... Yum.Gilt bar is set to fill a void we've had here in Chicago for a long time. Finally a vibrant late night locale with ambiance (great music!), interesting drinks and a menu that looks simply delicious. I will definitely be back soon for dinner...and then some. Hallelujah.
