I must go back as I was fascinated with the menu, I tried the Sassy Seoul wings. The wings were cooked to perfection but I really did not care for the sauce. Luckily I was able to douse them in Sriracha. But with chicken that good, I'm sure my next venture trying suicide buffalo wings will please me more.
