A shout-out to Katie and Kimberly for allowing us to host our going-away brunch at Publican! It was amazing! You guys are wonderful! And by far the thing we miss the most about Chicago are Publican's oysters, pork, and beer... and BRUNCH! We have yet to find a brunch in London that can compare. The eggs are always poached perfectly (in red wine, of course!); the smoked trout is to-die-for. It's all so sumptuous and decadent, just like dinner. If you haven't gone, do yourself a favour and go soon. Take your in-laws, take your in-town and out-of-town friends, take your kids... they will all thank you for the experience!
