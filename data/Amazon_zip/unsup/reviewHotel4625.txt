*** woo-hoo, back in Chicago for one last vacation nite. *** so i decided to check out this spot since the location is cool (River North), price was right ($110/nt) and it's new (opened 3wks ago) ... besides i generally prefer boutique-style hotels. i think this place is perfect for those who wanna go clubbing. this area is club central. there are about a dozen clubs within walking distance. i'm thinking of selling off my kid as i'm typing this so i can go out tonite ... haha, j/k ... i think i will keep him, lol. anyways, Hotel Felix is charming.  it's only 12 stories high and the rooms are the size of a shoebox, but it's perfect to rest your head - free wifi, continental breakfast comp'd, fitness ctr and bar is tight. barring any unforeseen events, i'd definitely ret'n for a solo stay. *** overnite valet is $42 but plenty of street prkg. got quarters? ***
