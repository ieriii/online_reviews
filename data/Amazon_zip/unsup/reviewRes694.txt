I was a frequent diner at Trio when Grant was there, where I was a great fan of his innovation, execution, and playfulness. When Alinea first opened I was there the first week. While it was very impressive, it somehow did not rise to my soaring expectations. Of course it was the first week, and I would not hold it against them. Finally, years later, I had the chance to come back. I have no hesitation in saying that it was the BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE! The playfulness I remember from Trio has returned in full force, but is now mature, sophisticated, and complex. And the classic courses are not only perfectly executed, but they are so fresh and exciting that you feel as though you could be eating them for the first time in the early 20th century.  If there is a restaurant that absolutely deserves your hard-earned dollars in this economy, THIS IS IT!!!!
