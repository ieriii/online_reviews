Every time I've gone to Piece I have left a happy customer (except for that time when my friend's wallet was stolen by a straggler who snuck in). I'm a big fan of the White Pizza, it's actually the only type of pizza I really enjoy when I come here. All of the beer, including the You Will Fail Ale, is incredible and not extremely pricey. It's insanely crowded on the weekends and gives off a sports bar vibe, but aside from that it's an amazing restaurant.
