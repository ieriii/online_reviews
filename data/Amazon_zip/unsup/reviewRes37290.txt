As promised, I returned to Hopleaf again as I showed up as soon as they opened. My buddy and I thought we were there early enough to get a patio seat, but nope, they were filled. We got a seat in the dining area which was fine. My pal has been telling me about their delicious sandwiches for a few months now so mouth was watering and all I was thinking about was the Duck Rueben and the Cashew butter & Jam (CB&J) sandwiches. For beer I ordered the German Ayinger and a Jever. I got the Duck Rueben which came with fries and my buddy got the CB&J. We decided to switch half of the sandwiches so we could enjoy the taste of both. The Duck Rueben was really juicy and flavorful and the CB&J was outta this freaking world!!!! These sandwiches really lived up to the hype and my day was made! Hopleaf, I am gonna make you my new backyard, Understood????!!!!!
