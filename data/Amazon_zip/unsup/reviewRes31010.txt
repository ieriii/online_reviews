The portions were generous and the veggie/vegan concoctions were thoughtfully created (two different rueben sandwiches to choose from!). They've been around for decades, and the menu also included a variety of specials.  The sweet potato quesadilla was great. The chicken-fried steak was good and the side vegetables were perfectly-cooked and well-seasoned. My dessert didn't excite me as much, but my friend's shake was quite good. The trendy-looking waitstaff was patient and helpful. If the weather is good, go for the outdoor seating.
