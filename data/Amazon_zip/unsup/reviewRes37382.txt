Stopped here for lunch. Had a fantastic sandwich and a cup of coffee. I had a quick look around the store and it had lots of specialty items that I would have loved, but would have been unable to take on the plane home (it is never worth checking a bag!). If you are heading down to Navy pier, stop here and get some good eats.
