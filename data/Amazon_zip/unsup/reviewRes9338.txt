Restaurant week 2010 rolls along nicely. Everything here is delicate, well-balanced, nicely spiced and a lovely bite of food. The Pho is the best in the city as far as I am concerned. The beef is so tender and perfectly cooked. Banh Coun were perfectly cooked dumplings, asked for some chopped chile because lets face it Vietnamese could be hotter than this French inspired take would have you believe. Bun Thit Nuong, was very a very well presented plate. Everything on went well with all the elements in the dish, the balance was superb. Food 17.5/20 Ambience/Decor/Service 18/20  $$$ 16/20 Execution of concept 19.5/20  Pleasure of the experience 18/20 Overall 89/100 Among the elite.
