I was very happy with my experience at Piece. The beers are good, the pizza is really good, and the prices, for Wicker Park, are pretty amazing. I went there for lunch today and had an individual pizza with two toppings, a flight taste of their seven microbrews, and a pint of one of those beers for about $15 which, to me, sounds like a pretty good deal. I have been to alot of these microbrews types of places and this place probably had the best consistancy in regards to beer. They also have enough beers to satisfy any palates. As for the pizza, it was really good, especially for 1.Microbrewery, 2. a bar, and 3. tough compeition in a town like Chicago. They make a very nice thin crust with plenty of options and toppings. It also came out nice and hot, which is kudos to the service! The service was actually pretty good as well for a place that had the look of perhaps ok service. Our server was knowlegable about the beers, was helpful, and knew her stuff! The only downside of this place that I could see was the parking situation (but hey, its WIcker Park) and the menu is really not very expansive outside of pizza and beer, but if you want some good locally made beer and pizza, come to Piece! I bet you will not be disappointed!
