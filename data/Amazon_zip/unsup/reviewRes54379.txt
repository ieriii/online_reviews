Theyre pizza is good. Definitely not a bad deep dish, just dont think its amazing...or the best in the city. But it is really really good. That said ive never been disappointed with Pedquods. There consistently good. They also have a good selection of beer and a great lunch special. I would recommend this place to frieds for sure.
