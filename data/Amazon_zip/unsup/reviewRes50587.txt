So, after numerous attempts, and I mean numerous, I cannot seem to replicate the delicious-ocity of their southwest corncakes.  These little breakfast treats are like a cross between a savory pancake and johnny cake. They pack them with green and red bell peppers, onions and a blend of seasonings that add a perfect touch. Drop an over-easy egg on top of that and dip it all in the creamy southwest sauce and I swear this will be a meal to write home about. Thier rice and beans breakfast comes with dirty rice with red kidney beans, eggs how you like them and chicken andoulle sausage.  Heck, throw in a bisquit. All of it is to die for. Comfortable, fresh and full of flavor all served up in a bright and whimsical environment. I don't believe that I've been there any other day of the week aside from Saturday and Sunday, and thats probably because they have such screwy hours. If you go to their website, you'll see the schedule and it'll make you do the whole "if a trains leaves Boston at 3pm going 85 mph and the reverse commute train from Jackson is 6.89 miles behind it due west at 2am, when will I be able to sit down and eat a meal at Wishbone restaurant?" sort of thing. My rule of thumb is to just not go after 2pm.  So, should you indeed make it there during their open hours of business, you will wait for brunch on the weekends and have to dodge through stroller mania, but it will be well worth it! Give a try and don't forget the cheese grits.
