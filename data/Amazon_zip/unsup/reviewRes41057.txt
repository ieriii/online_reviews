My fianc made reservations for June 28, 2012 in celebration of my birthday. I was extremely excited because I have never been to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. As we arrived and checked in, the staff was extremely friendly! However, as I began to look around, I noticed that the bar area and portions of the dining room was under construction. At this point, I whispered to my fianc and asked him if they had informed him when he called to make reservations that they were under construction and he told me no. I was extremely disappointed that no one informed him of the construction. I assure you that we would have visited your restaurant when not under construction! The waiter and the food was amazing! However the atmosphere ruined my birthday. My fianc paid $300 for an atmosphere that was intolerable. I just wish that the receptionist would have told us about the construction. Please keep in mind that customers have the right to be informed about the atmosphere! I hope no one has to experience what I did on their birthday. Thank you for listening. Vanessa Gonzalez
