Judging from the fact that there are always lines down the block for brunch at this place I assumed that they must be serving crack or something... I mean rain, snow whatever people WAIT to get in this place with a fevered excitement unmatched since the last time Justin Bieber was in town. So I had to check it out - the restaurant itself was nice, sort of European flavor, I sidled up to the bar and was presented with a very well thought out menu - in fact it was hard to chose what to eat. I am a freak about crepes, but i always think a Benedict is the measure of a good breakfast place. Especially because I am a freak about how I like my eggs cooked. I ordered a ginger carrot orange juice - that would have been delicious , except that it was warm, which sort of grossed me out. Coffee, which truly earned a 10, GREAT coffee. I commenced to attempt to order my Benedict from the only quasi English speaking waitress (German maybe?) within moments I was ordering Benedict with no eggs, Benedict with hard boiled eggs, Benedict with three eggs. NO - what I said was I like the whites pretty firm, but the yolk still runny. ( I hate it when the whites look mucousy) I finally gave up and just said bring it regular. Which means mucous - just saying blech. The Benedict was ok, generous portions, the home fries were slightly undercooked red potatoes. Average. But what will keep me from coming back was the obnoxious owner ( at least he acted like the owner) who sat to my left fussing at the chef and harassing him over soup, while he ate a different soup and basically excuded grumpiness. His demeanor made my average comfort food brunch a hurry up and get it over so you can get out of here experience. tsk tsk.
