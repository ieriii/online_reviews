After seeing my friend perform with her ballet company, a group of us were feeling sophisticated so we thought we'd stop in The Gage for a couple of celebratory drinks. The bar area had an older crowd (30s-40s) so we decided to move our group to a table. Little did we know how sophisticated this Gage place was. With his hands tucked behind his back, our waiter explained the specials for the evening. We looked at each other nervously because all we wanted were drinks. We ended up ordering appetizers and frustrating our waiter because no one actually wanted to order entrees. We ordered scallops and were shocked that 3 scallops would cost $16! The cheese selection, also $16, consisted of 4 small cubes of cheese, little dabs of marmalade and jam, and a few nuts. Between the 6 of us, we shared 3 scallops and 4 cubes of cheese. Feeling pressured from our waiter's disdainful looks, we ordered another round of scallops. (Keeping track? 6 scallops for $32.) By the end of the night, our drinks and appetizers came out to be $180. It was totally worth it though. They were just about the best dang scallops I'd ever eaten...
