I loved it!!It was a great surprise to have your food come out without even truly knowing how it was going to be prepared. Try the octopus appetizer- I thought it was going to be a hot (warm) dish but it's not, it's served cold and delicious. I was there with 3 friends and luckily we all ordered something different for appetizers, entrees and dessert. Everyone loved their own choices, though we all tried a bit each others. The lamb , which was cooked in duck fat was my favorite dish of the night. We were, also, lucky to try the rabbit ravioli, which was served for the first time on Thursday evening, the night we were there.The room is simple and yet attractive.The organic cocktails were plentiful and the apple-cider cocktail was yummy.Kudos to the chef and the staff for making our evening fun and tasty.
