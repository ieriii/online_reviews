Well, I just got to milk and honey, all the umbrellas and patio was set up with water outside along with the door open so I walked in. The girl was very rude saying they were not open and I had to leave, I asked if I can just wait inside an not order since it was 645 am and already 95 degrees outside, she said that's not allowed. Too bad I am having a business meeting otherwise I would have taken my money elsewhere. The last time I was in there they weren't too friendly either, maybe it's a wicker park thing!
