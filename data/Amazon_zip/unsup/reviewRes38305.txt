I will unequivocally say that this is the best beer bar in Chicago, if not the entire country. Sure, other bars may have more taps, but what's the point if half of them are devoted to the big 3 breweries and/or the most popular imports? There's more love for beer here than just about anywhere. A hand-picked, frequently-changing selection of about 25 Belgian beers and 25 non-Belgians on tap, along with a bottle menu bigger than the food menus of most Chinese restaurants, ensures you'll be overwhelmed. The back dining room is incredibly attractive, and features a real wood fireplace in the winter and a beautiful garden space in the summer. The front bar is refreshingly free of televisions and thump-thump-thump music. The food is impressive, especially the mussels, fries, and aioli. When I can be convinced to stray from the mussels (which is not often), the Hopleaf's chef does great things with duck and makes a pretty faithful rendition of a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. Suffice it to say that whenever I come here I have a blast and feel thoroughly satisfied. Why the missing star, though? The crowds. Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster, the crowds. I'm at the Hopleaf fairly often, but it's been about a year since I've come in and found a seat in the front room (unless I show up after 11 on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday). The back room is not much better. Friday and Saturday you'll invariably be quoted a 1.5+ hour wait for dinner, and even on weekdays a half-hour to 45 minutes is common. Just about the only time you can get seated immediately is during Bears or Cubs games, provided it's early in the season and the teams haven't embarrassed themselves out of the playoffs yet. I did see an expansion permit in the front window recently, however, and I only hope that a larger Hopleaf will better be able to handle the crowds while keeping up the phenomenal quality.
