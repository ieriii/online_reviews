We went on friday for my birthday - just for cocktails, not dinner. When we arrived we just walked to the bar and were waiting to order when the hostess came over and asked if we'd like a seat in the bar lounge area - we would since there would be 12 of us and the bar was full. The lounge was great: awesome server - Colin, great drinks, delicious snacks, great ambiance. My only complaint was that it was ungodly hot - our entire group was noticeably sweating and we weren't moving around. Overall, great first experience - will definitely be back.
