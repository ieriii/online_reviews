I really like this place. You can be as fancy as you can be and order the (whole) peking duck. Or being as cheap as you want (or should I say, simple?) and still walk out with a full tummy and a big smile on your face. The typical huge lunch plates (meat on rice, lo-mein, etc) would cost you about $5. When we were here the last time, we decided to be a bit more *sophisticated* and ordered the peking duck that everyone and their mothers have been raving about. I L-O-V-E peking duck. The crispy skin, the juicy, tender meat. Umph!! And I love the fact that this restaurant serves every single part of this poor duck: First, they slice the skin with the meat, and you suppose to eat them with these plain chinese buns. Then they shredded the leftover meat and tossed 'em in fried rice. If you think they're done, you're highly mistaken. Then, they use the bones for the soup base. Definitely worth your $.
