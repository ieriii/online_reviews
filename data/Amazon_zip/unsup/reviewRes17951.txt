The Violet Hour is a magical place! Perfect for catching up with a friend or sharing some time with a special someone. The drinks are pricey ($12) so I usually only stick around for a drink or two, but they are delicious. I recommend Juliet and Romeo! The popcorn chickpeas and sammies are really good too. The staff is great. I would get there before 8 pm if you don't want to wait line.
