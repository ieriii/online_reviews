You know, I'd really like to give this place more stars but I just can't do it. I want to love it, I really do, and I keep going back - hoping that it will redeem itself....but it doesn't.  Oh Xoco, what can I say? Your breakfast is pretty damn good - the chilaquiles might be the best I've ever had and the coffee is strong and opinionated. However, your service just doesn't do it for me. That "we will be busy whether you come back or not so we don't really care" attitude that permeates this place makes me nauseous and, to be quite honest, angry.  This place NEVER opens on time, although I can always see them bopping around, avoiding unlocking the door. Once you get in, no one is in any kind of rush to do anything and you basically take your own order. The coffee never makes its way to the table, unless you go and nag them at least 2-3 times, which makes you feel annoying. It's 8am and I have to go to work for a miserable 9+ hours... why you gotta fuck with the coffee, xoco?? anyways, i won't lie and say the food isn't good, because it is. but sometimes it's just so-so, and the service doesn't make up for it. i'm sure i'll keep dining here, mostly for the chilaquiles and guac, but I'll probably bitch the whole way through. sighhhhhhhhhhhh
