I went here with a friend on a recent trip, and we were very satisfied with our meal. I would've never found this place, but a Groupon piqued my interest in Geja's. Located close to Lincoln Park Zoo, Geja's is truly a hidden gem in the neighborhood. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately. The menu has some fondue options which include a cheese fondue, selection of meat and chocolate fondue. Or you can order each of these things a la carte. We decided to order a three course option. The cheese was high quality and one of the best cheese fondues I've had. The chicken and steak I ordered were pretty standard, but it came with eight dipping sauces and a platter of veggies. We were pretty full by the time the chocolate fondue came, but couldn't resist eating it. The entire meal was delicious and would be worth the price even without the Groupon. Our service was impeccable. The server was friendly and took our Groupon even though we forgot to mention it to the host (per the Groupon's terms we had to mention it prior to being seated). Our waters were always filled. They promptly replaced my plate and silverware when a piece of raw meat fell on my plate. We went on a Monday night and they had a live guitar player, which added to the intimate atmosphere of the restaurant. Not sure how often the guitar player is there. My only complaint is this place is cramped. The location isn't terribly amazing. I am hoping to go here on a return trip to Chicago and would recommend to anyone looking for a good fondue place.
