I finally got to try this place out with my husband for our anniversary. The place definitely lived up to all the hype, which was good for us as our last fondue experience at another restaurant in Chicago was not at all what we expected. As everyone says, the restaurant had a very romantic feel. My husband and I lucked out with a table that was against a wall and so was away from other tables. It felt more intimate due to the low lighting. We greatly enjoyed our meal and it was definitely enough food to leave full. Our service was amazing, as our server provided us with all kinds of tips and recommendations from how to cook the food to wine suggestions. The restaurant as expected is a little pricey, but we had a groupon that we had saved for the occasion so our food was totally worth what we paid. However, since we have been to the restaurant we have received a couple coupons via email, so it is possible to go to the restaurant and get a good deal. If you are looking for a restaurant to go to for a special occasion with a spouse or partner, I recommend Geja's.
