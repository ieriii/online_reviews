Piece & I are lovers. Everytime I'm in Wicker Park, my stomach does a little dance to a little song I like to call, "An Ode to Piece Pizza & Jack Daniels." This song and dance is usually one that I cannot ignore, so my best friend and I wander on over to Piece. I've never gone here without hearing a song a love and resisting the urge to start singing my little heart out. Yay, Piece, I'm a fan. Love Always :)
