My favorite restaurant in the city! Great bang for your buck, great service, great seasonal food! These guys can cook.  Last Spring, I had rhubarb and asparagus salad, poached egg, black truffle vinaigrette, and pork belly with english pea risotto, morels and ramps, nuff said! The only thing that sucks is that more people keep finding out about the place and it makes it harder to get a table.  The menu was so good it made me giggle like a little school girl, exactly the kind of food I like to eat and cook! This place is about the food. Just the food, not the decor, stemware, or china. I mean that as a compliment. Just gritty enough to keep out the yuppies and idiots from the suburbs. Great food in a laid back place. I could eat there every night. It's great to see a good restaurant in my old neighborhood of Logan Square. Enjoy!
