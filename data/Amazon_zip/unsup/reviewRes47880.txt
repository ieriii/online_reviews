OK, So i have been to the outdoor roof a bunch of times and dinner here once and here is my 2 cents... The Rooftop- Usually for one reason or another, there has been issues. Either a. they are In the process of closing it because they need to close it by 10 pm (I know, really early...) b. It is really busy and there is a line. c. Its the middle of the day and its not that busy or fun. The good thing is the waitstaff and bartenders are friendly and the drinks are good. Also, the ambiance is pretty cool, its a really modern set-up and usually has a good crowd. Besides that, the app menu is pretty lame- there are about three choices. Basically the only choice that looked good were the mussels that were smothered in garlic (which ended up being a bad choice for a night out). There is also this really mean upstairs hostess that is unnecesarily rude and condescending to people trying to get to the roof. She sucked. Dinner I actually really enjoyed eating dinner here. The service was really good. The meats were delicious and they offered fish selections as well. The Salad bar was really tasty and I liked the antipasto selection. I also liked how some of the tables are set up for larger groups.  Although its a pain in the neck sometimes, I do like this place and think its worth it if you go with a little patience.
