Damnit, foiled again! I am still searching for that go-to Thai restaurant within pickup distance of my home. I've tried nearly a dozen but they're all so mediocre. Opart was one of my last few hopes but their bland performance has narrowed the field even further. I tried several dishes but none were standouts. The pad thai in particular was the lamest version of this dish that I have had in years. The spring rolls barely register, the tom yum koong soup is satisfying but standard, and the yum plamuk squid salad has no flavor other than heat. Probably the best dish was the one that my wife always orders--in Opart parlance, pad paak roum mit, a.k.a. stir-fried vegetables with tofu. So, the plainest dish was the tastiest, which says everything that you need to know about Opart.
