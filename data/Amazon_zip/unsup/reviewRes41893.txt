I am not sure what has happened to standards and the art of dining. I feel places like this so called steakhouse and steakhouse chains have lowered what used to be a fine a dining event. I went here for the first and last time in January. It was a cold day and of course I looked on here to get an idea for the attire. It stated dressy. Now I've been to many steakhouses all over and dressy means no jeans and t-shirts. Here however it appears that is not the case. For the prices they are charging and for what many on here consider the "best steaks" I would have to say its all over priced. The steak was good but there was no value. I have had better, in higher end place, at lower prices and in a more refined atmosphere. I feel that for a restaurant to have a sign at their hostess station suggesting proper attire required but allowing people in wearing tshirts, jeans and a baseball cap is a place I cannot respect. If one wants to dress like that then they are more than welcome to go to outback. I'm disappointed with a place that can't even enforce its own standards, you have lost my respect and business.
