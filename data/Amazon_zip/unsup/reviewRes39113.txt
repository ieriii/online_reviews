Okay. I've been around in the food industry for a while now. We strolled in to L&E on a late Thursday evening and were sat immediately. Sweet! Drinks were super duper tasty. $3 alcohol, cool I'm all for it. The food was disappointing. Especially after everyone had told me such amazing things about this place. Now, I know it was late and people were probably tired, but one of our entrees never came (we weren't charged for it either -phew) and the three that we did get were seemingly mediocre. The sardine was tasty with a Meyer lemon puree which went nicely. The marrow was super difficult to get out of the bones despite the fact that there were demi-spoons. Also, I've had better, less fussy marrow elsewhere. The Buffalo sweet breads were probably the biggest disappointment. They just tasted like franks red hot. That's it. Nothing more and nothing less. Also the portion size of that was insanely small. Small is sometimes okay, and I suppose I am glad that our least favorite thing was the smallest but.... I was expecting more from the Chicago food scene and Longman & Eagle in particular. I will say that I didn't get sick and the food was edible, so three stars for you L&E, kudos. Shoot, I was ready to come back to Detroit to get some good food, however weird that sounds.
