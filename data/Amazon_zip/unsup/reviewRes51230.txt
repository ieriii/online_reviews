I was warned I would get sick, but who actually thought I, my boyfriend, and my boyfriend's sister would get food poisoning from Wishbone? This restaurant has been around a long time, a neighborhood favorite, and has done well enough to have more then one location- I would think they would be safe, but friends and co-workers have told me horror stories. I should have listened. Note to Wishbone owner: Focus on quality, not quantity.
