Let's just say that I dream of Piece Pizza on a monthly basis. This place always delivers a great "white" pizza. I like mine especially with goat cheese, spinach, and some basil. Mmm, can we say mouth watery?? I had my first official yelp even that I threw together for live band karaoke. Boy did it turn out to be a fantastic time! The hostess Katherine did a great job setting up the fellow yelpers and their friends to right stage to watch the talent show of fun lovin' singers. Our server Emily was fantastic as well, keeping everyone drink in hand as she kept checking our table. The talent was flowin', the pizza drippin' with yumminess, and the beer was cold. What more could a Chicago girl ask on a Saturday night? If you are looking for a rockin' good time, come here on Saturday nights, you won't be disappointed.
