I absolutely love the ambiance of this place it's so sexy! The fireplace the decor just makes for a great look! A few friends and I went here for drinks and I had a few mojitos (ok several) and they were absolutely delicious. My friend had different drinks and everyone was satisfied. One of my guy friends got a appetizer that was some type of kobe beef burger thing and I had a taste they were very yummy. We had gone on a Saturday night and it wasn't too packed but there were quite a few people there. I really want to check out the rooftop sometime!!
