I ordered a pizza at 7:09 pm and was told up to an hour and a half delivery. I said fine, I am in no hurry. At 8:52 I called and they said they are not sure how long. At 9:30pm I called and they said it is on its way. At 10:00pm I called again and the female said the driver left 40 minutes ago. She called the driver and said another 15 minutes. I said I don't want a pizza that will be sitting in a car for an hour. The person then said, well it is insulated. Seriously, who would want a pizza knowing that it sat in a car for an hour??? How about just not taking delivery orders if you do not have enough drivers or if you are that busy?
