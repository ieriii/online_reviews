Tons of great food. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last year. It was great. I think I like the concept and the variety on the buffet. But I would prefer a top quality sit-down meal, rather than a food coma inducing smorgasboard. Try it once. Great for meat lovers and non body-concious. If you forget to turn your card over, the meat will keep coming and you will have a hard time resisting a fresh piece of meat on your plate. At least I did.
