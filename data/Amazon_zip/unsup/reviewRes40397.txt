I have spent hundreds of dollars at Longman. I have spent countless hours waiting at Longman, squished into their bar, drinking their cocktails. I've been there with very small parties and very large parties. I've enjoyed the food. But I will never return. Because when we went the other night, we were told that our party of 7 was too large to be seated, even though we were happy to wait the requisite hours it would take. When we pointed out that we have been seated before with a party of 7, she said, "well, it depends." You know what? It shouldn't depend. If you don't take reservations, then either make it clear that there is a limit, or let us wait. Don't have a non-policy where decisions are made on the fly by the lazy hostess. It's a shame, because the food is decent, and our table would have (conservatively) spent about $1000. We always order too much, we tip generously, and yet if L&E doesn't want our money, then f**k 'em, we'll go elsewhere. I know they won't miss our money, but it's just bad customer service.
