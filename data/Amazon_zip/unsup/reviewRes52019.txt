I miss the old way this place was, but then I hear about health inspection issues too so it's a disturbing part of my former years in the Chicago area. Larger seating area and more efficient seating procedures are a nice welcome, and the pizza is close to how I always remembered it. I love the cornbread style of crust, and the fact that I can always get it with a pint of something from Goose Island.
