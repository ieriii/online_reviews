I recently went here for my cousin's birthday and we were in the thoughts that it was an Indian, Thai, and Sushi restaurant, but it was only Thai and Sushi. There were three of us and we ordered crab ragoon and salmon and spinach wrapped in crispy wontons. They were both flavorful and the salmon and spinach was definitely something different. We each ordered 1 Thai dish (Drunken Noodles, Red Curry w/ crispy noodles, and Basil Chiken) and 1 sushi maki (sunny crunchy, fried komodo, and shrimp tempura). The Thai dishes are yummy, but the Drunken Noodles portion was very small. The Red Curry had great flavor and went well with the noodles. The Sunny Crunchy and Shrimp Tempura Maki were delicious, but the Fried Komodo was okay. My cousin had ordered a Thai Ice Tea and it wasn't sweet so she asked for some sweetener (thinking she would get condensed milk), but instead the waitress was confused as to what to do and asked if my cousin wanted packed sugar instead. Really? The service was okay. The atmosphere was awesome but kind of tight. Definitely will work for a romantic date or just with a group of girlfriends!
