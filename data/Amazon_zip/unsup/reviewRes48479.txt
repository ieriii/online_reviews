The staff here not only know their food, but know their beers and pairings.  The food here is excellent. There is nothing I wouldn't recommend. It's a place to share plates, enjoy your company and eat really good food. Sunday's family style meals add another flair to the Publican. Something you won't get on the every day menu. If you have food allergies, are a vegetarian, or have any other diet restrictions, they are more than willing to accommodate. Even without the pork, the food is fabulous. The apple tart was simply baked to perfection. It wasn't undercooked, had color, and the flakiness of the tart was something very few restaurants can achieve.  If there's room for dessert, indulge.
