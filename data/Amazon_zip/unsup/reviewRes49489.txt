We went here on a Saturday night before a movie, with a Groupon. They only take reservations for groups that are larger than 6, and the hostess said that it might be kind of crowded at 8pm, so we went in at 7:30 to be safe and leave ourselves enough time to make the movie. Plenty of seating at that time. I ordered a sangria (fine), and my fiance ordered a mojito which he declared one of the best he's had in Chicago. We also split the grilled baby octopus which was also delicious - had a great smoky flavor from the grill. Everything on the menu looked awesome and we were having a hard time deciding how to divvy up all the meats between our two orders (these are important dining issues). Enter, the Picada Colombiana, which pretty much had all the meats and sides we wanted, for two. It did not disappoint. Every piece of meat on the cast iron plate they bring it out on was cooked to perfection. Super tender and juicy, even the chicken. The only thing that was less than satisfactory was one of the sides - we're still not sure if it was the crunchy green plantain or the yuca. It was pretty dry. Everything else was so delicious. We couldn't finish all of it so after numerous That's What She Said jokes about the meat, we packed up the leftovers. The car smelled amazing when we got out of the movie. Everything was still delicious the next day. If this place was BYOB on the weekends too, we'd probably be there every weekend. We're already recruiting our friends for the next visit...with a reservation.
