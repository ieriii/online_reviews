This place has great waitstaff and is able to accommodate large, loud groups. The restaurant is beautiful, and the food is good, but not great. However, it is consistent -- it'll taste the same now as it will next time you go and order it. They are able and willing to make accommodations for special diets. The prices are comparable to the other Greek restaurants in the area.  GI also provides valet service, which is a nice touch.
