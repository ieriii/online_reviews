I'm not sure what to say that hasn't been said... Expect to wait, expect that you will get some amazing, unique dogs, that are tasty and well priced and need to be rolled out. While we were waiting I was so skeptical we wouldn't get a table once we got in there, but they have a system, wait in the line, as you get close, don't take a table till after you order, and then you find a seat and your dogs are fresh and tasty.
