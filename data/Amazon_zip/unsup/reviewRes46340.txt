I'm just not overly impressed with Grand Luxe. I would give it a 3.5 if that was an option. With all the damn people waiting in the lobby you would think its really something to get excited about. As a Chicago resident I feel like a little bit of a sell out every time I go here, seems like a huge tourist trap to me. But I usually take visitors here. Basically it is like the Cheescake Factory with a slightly different menu and not quite as many dessert choices. The most recent time I was here I had a cobb salad that was very sub par. Nothing too exciting. Service is good though and of course portions are huge and I should give it an extra star for being affordable. All in all, not a top choice, I would rather walk to Quartino's a few blocks down.
