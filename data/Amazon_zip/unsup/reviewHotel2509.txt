I've stayed here now on two separate occasions- both were great Priceline finds for $75. The rooms look a little dated- but the location, the architecture make up for it. Within walking distance to Millennium Park, water, and one of my fave deep-dish pizza places of all time. Definitely worth it- if you can score a deal on Priceline.
