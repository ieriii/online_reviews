This is one of the greatest bars on earth. No argument. If the bartender is rude, tip her double. That's why she does it. If you go when there's music on stage, either stfu or gtfo. And don't complain when they tell you to stfu. If you need to blab with your moronic friends at the top of your voice, stick with Bennigans. Or throw yourself under a bus, conveniently located just outside the front door.
