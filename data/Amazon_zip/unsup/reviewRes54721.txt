Shaw's is a classic New England style seafood restaurant with great food and great service. It has been around for many years and each time we dine we come away feeling good. Their King Crab is great quality and plentiful. They have many types of oysters including my favorite, Oysters Rockifeller (cooked!). They have a nice wine list and good martinis as well. Shaw's is a comforting place a midst the come-and-go restaurants that are so abundant in Chicago.
