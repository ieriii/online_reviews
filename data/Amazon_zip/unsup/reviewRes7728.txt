Yelpers, if you come here be prepared to endure a meat-hangover as the amount of meat that you will eat will make your head spin. Tips: Skip the salad bar and save it for after the meat, the salad bar is legit but it will fill you up and reduce the room for the 16 kinds of meat. Some of my top picks: -Lamb Chops -Sausage -Filet Mignon -Pork -Rib Eye Also one of my favorite parts; the endless amount of the amazing brazilian puff pastry bread rolls and fried banana.
