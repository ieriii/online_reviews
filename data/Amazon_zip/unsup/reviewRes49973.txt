I hate to give a bad review but this place has been on my mind for awhile. Cool spot to watch the game,with tons of TV's. Cool place start a crazy night of drinking in the area. The burgers are good and the drinks are fair. My problem is I ordered 2 shots (Jamison) 3 beers and 2 burgers and my bill was over $100 bucks. Way over priced here. Our server was not so friendly to me and my girlfriend. This was a year ago, maybe things have changed. Honestly go next door to Small Bar for half the price.
