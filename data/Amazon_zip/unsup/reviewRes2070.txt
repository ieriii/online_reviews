I miss working in the city, we used to call ahead to order a huge amount of food and race back to work to eat. It was a Friday tradition. But alas the economy went south and I've been banished to work in Lake County (fuck Lake County!) and Hot Doug's doesn't do phone ahead orders on Saturdays. I am now stuck standing in line with everyone else. Damn you stupid economy you've robbed me of Hot Doug Fridays!!!!
