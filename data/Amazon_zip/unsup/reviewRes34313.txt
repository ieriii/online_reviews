I expected a lot out of this place given the other Yelp reviews and reviews from friends. However, my girlfriend and I went there for dinner and this place fell short. Atmosphere - We ate upstairs as the downstairs area was packed and a little noisy and hectic for our liking. I don't think it has a cozy/personal feeling to it at all.  Service - Mediocre at best. Our waiter didn't take the time to explain anything to us. He was curt with us the whole meal. He even started getting a little mouthy with my girlfriend when she didn't hear/understand something he said. Food - Everythign else can be forgiven about a place if the food can seal the deal. We were not sold on it. I got the roasted chicken and the gf got a pasta dish, both of which we could have made at home. Overall, I think there are cozier places with better service and food then this place. We would have had a better meal had we made one ourselves at home.
