The Allegro is one of the colorful hotels of the Kimpton chain. The hotel revels in its colorful flourishes throughout the property. The Allegro is a big improvement over its former incarnation as the Bismarck. The rooms are on the small side, but maybe you will forget about this fact with all of the wild colors swirling about you. The curtains, pillowcases, bedspreads are all very bright and may even be shocking to those not used to such unconventional designs. The "L" tracks run by the west side of the hotel. The lobby area is very lively, and many flight crews pass through on their way to get some rest.
