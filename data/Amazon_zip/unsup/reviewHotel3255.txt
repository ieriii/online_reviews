Excellent little bordering-on-the-boutique hotel. I believe it has 300-something beds, so technically it's not a boutique but it has that feel. It's located in the Carbon & Carbide building (which was built to resemble a green-glass champagne bottle- so cool!) and is in the perfect location downtown. It's definitely not as 'hard rock' as you would think. It's more minimalist/ dark modern with accents of rock-n-roll. They do have meeting rooms which are very, very nice for your next board meeting (top of the line a/v stuff). The sleeping rooms are very cool, sleek and outfitted nicely with soundsystems, Aveda products, etc. And reasonably priced! Great place to stay in the city.
