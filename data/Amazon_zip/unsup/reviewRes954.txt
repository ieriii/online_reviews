My second visit to Hot Doug's was bliss! We got the Chicken & Ham Cordon Bleu sauage with Dijon-Shallot Butter, Fried Prosciutto, and Gruyere and the Bacon Jalapeno Duck Sausage, with Blood Orange Mustard, Smoked Blue Cheese and Honey drizzle, and duck fat fries. The Cordon Bleu dog might not sound as interesting as some of the options, but it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The flavor was intense. Each juicy and crispy meat was showcased and it was smothered, but not subdued by melty gruyere. The Jalapeno Duck Sausage was dark, smoky and powerful, much like an excellent chili. We bit it with near-reverence, careful to portion a piece of creamy bleu cheese for each mouthful. Killer, killer food.
