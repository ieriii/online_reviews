LOVES: -the hotel itself is just majorly cute and has a great vibe -great concierge, Jeff, who will tell you where the hot parties going on that weekend are -car service available for hotel guests -awesome hotel restaurant (WE) for once!! -attention to detail and the overcleaning! notice that the floormats will change in the morning, afternoon, and evening! -everyone loves a W hotel room DISLIKES: -it's in the financial district. you are not in epicenter of things if you stay here! expect to cab it everywhere. -stores and restaurants in the area will close late  All in all, we were pretty happy with our stay but wished that the location was better (like the Courtyard Marriott) although it is super easy to hail a cab anywhere in Chicago!
