My family and I have been going to this restaurant since it first opened. Over the years, we have grown to know the owners and they are some of the kindest, most hard working in existence. The food is EXCELLENT. i have had persian food all over the world (including iran and los angeles) and this is by far the best around. we also bring our out of town guests to noon o kabob to show them real persian food and excellent service. thank you noon o kabob for serving up the best persian food ive ever had!!
