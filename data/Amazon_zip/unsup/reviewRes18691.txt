Hi. I'm Julia and I'm addicted to cheeseburgers. PHEW! That being said, I've been jonesing to try Bad Apple for awhile. I came. I ate. I loved. I came here for a girls night out (we're girls who eat) over the summer and again with the manfriend recently. Great burgers, great drinks, and ridiculous fried cheese curds. Seriously. Eff your diet and eat some. I tried two different burgers, but of course I'm not sure which. Mf had a spicy one but it was so spicy he couldn't taste anything by the end. We were warned that it was spicier than normal, but why serve that? I watched him pick entire jalapeno cores with seeds and all off of his burger. Come on Bad Apple, that's not cool. Service was ok and Mf was ok with his fire burger, but wants to try something else. Actually, he wanted to move in so he could try different burgers every day. Normal, right?
