I'm a Chicago native and I because I worked for Lettuce Entertain You I was able to come to Shaws knowing I could get $15 off right off the bat. I had only oysters, my date had the sushi, which she was really craving, and we shared a bowl of the excellent clam chowder. The Oysters Rockefeller is superb although it didn't come with bacon bits. The menu is pricey, but I've seen restaurants of this ilk charging much more.  They also didn't carry Goose Island Greenline which i put me out but overall GREAT experience and good service.
