Great fresh food. I have been here for both brunch and dinner. The breakfast/brunch food is delicious, but be prepared to leave stuffed. If you are looking for a light brunch, this isn't the place. For dinner I have tried the Sturgeon, which was good and also a couple of the pasta dishes which were also very tasty. This place takes reservations, which I would highly recommend.
