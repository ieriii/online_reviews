I only have two words to sum it up, CHICKEN WINGS! They are crispy, saucy, and tasty. I never ordered anything but the wings - why mess with perfection. Both styles of wings are good, but I prefer Seoul Sassy. The staff is friendly, the foods comes out quick, and it's the best wings in town. I used to come here weekly, but then went to rehab for my chicken wing problem. If you have a problem called wings, Crisp is your solution.
