My husband, 2 daughters and I decided to go here for breakfast on Saturday around 10am. It was about a 15 min wait (not bad at ALL!) and once we were seated and ordered... the food came out immediately! And it was all SO delicious and filling. I ordered a special omelette that had steak, portobello mushrooms, aged cheese and spinach- spectacular!! Every piece of meat was perfect, not chewy or fat. The potatoes were tasty but a little too much dill for my liking. My husband ordered a side of fruit which had a wonderful, fresh assortment (bananas, grapes, apples, oranges) and he ordered an apple pancake thing which was like dessert! So delish. We also has fresh squeezed, blood orange juice which was very tasty. Everything was great, the food, the ambiance, the servings, the service-- our waters were always refilled promptly.
