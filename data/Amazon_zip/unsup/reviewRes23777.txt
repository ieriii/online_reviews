It was my first time eating Costa Rican food and it was pretty interesting. I order grilled steak which came with salad, Sweet plantains, and rice. Second, I order their Flan which was heavenly! Probably one of the best Flan I ever tasted. Overall, the food is delicious. I will recommend this restaurant.
