How could I have not reviewed this place yet? Travesty!! Before I moved to Chicago I heard all about the greatness of the Green Mill from friends. My first weekend in Chicago I went there for my first time and would have pooped from excitement, but didn't want to soil the amazing 20s rehab decor. I LOVE their little round rocks glasses. I ADORE their history. Their bartenders are PERFECT. The music is DIVINE. Thursday night swing dances are GREAT. Sunday night poetry open mic and slam is legendary and SO SO FUN and inspiring. The drink are reasonably priced too.  It's a little weird being in there and not being able to cut the smoke with a knife. I mean...a jazz club without cigarettes? That'll never seem right, just never.
