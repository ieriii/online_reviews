I grew up with a dad that loved noodle soup, so having pho brings back such memories. I'm a big fan of the pho with meatballs, since I grew up eating the meatballs in chicken broth. I will agree with my fellow Yelper Sandy N. that the broth has a funny flavor to it, like a fragrance? I don't know if that's from the mint, but it definitely tasted odd. My most recent visit was with a group of coworkers and my boss, who happens to be Vietnamese. Because of this, I got a fairly thorough explanation on how you should eat everything, what you should order, etc. In addition to pho, we got the shrimp and pork egg rolls, which are huge and hardy, with a great peanut sauce. The crepe-like appetizer with pork is also very tasty if you add the right combination of mint and sauce. Even without, the friedness is just splendid. My boss says it's the best in the neighborhood, so you definitely have to give it some credit there. Service can be spotty, especially when the place can get crowded like crazy. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is a first-time pho-er.
