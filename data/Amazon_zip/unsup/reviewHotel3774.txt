The Dana Hotel and Spa provides each guest(s) an outstanding view, well named and appointed comfy king sized bed, a sauna and exercise room, waterfall shower, and balcony among other treats. You may or may not see evidence of cleaning stewards during your entire visit, and be prepared to pay almost $40 for 24 hour parking. It is definitely worth the upgrade to a corner room if you are able to!  We enjoyed our stay and will look forward to our next!
