Fun place to go with a bunch of friends. It's not your typical sit-and-be-served place. You actually cook your own food (well, meat, anyways) in front of you! They give you a small plate of meat, and a lot of appetizer-type plates with various foods (ranging from delicious to throw-it-away). The problem? Small portions of the stuff you like! For example, for the price, I expected more meat. I left stuffed, but only after I ate my petite friends' portions. Same with the small appetizer plates. Great food. Small portions. Come semi-hungry.
