I used to be a bartender, so I'm well aware that you can train a monkey to make basic drinks. C'mon. Vodka Tonic? It's not hard if you think about it. So, that said, I have nothing but admiration for true mixologists. It is an artform where a simple ingredient can really make or break a drink. My friends brought me hear this past week and thank god they did, I would have frozen outside the nondescript door trying to get a drink (alright, I said that for dramatic effect). But the inside was great with giant velvet curtains, and while we sat at the bar, the little booths look fantastic for cozy happy hours in the middle of January. It was just a super chill atmosphere when we went in, and it was great to really sit and enjoy their concoctions. As a whiskey guzzler, I would recommend the Woolworth's Manhattan. The root beer bitters are the perfect touch. And the bartenders had the traditional arm belt things. Are there real utility to those things? I guess it doesn't matter, they look badass.
