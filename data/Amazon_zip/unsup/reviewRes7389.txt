This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the city. My fiancee and I have never had a bad meal from here and we have tried about half the menu. The service is fantastic and Ricardo always makes us feel special when we come.  The lobster ravioli, mussels in red sauce, and the panna cotta are incredible!
