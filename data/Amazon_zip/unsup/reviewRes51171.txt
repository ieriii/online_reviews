Went for Brunch on Sunday, and it was excellent. It was roughly noon on the weekend, so the place was packed to the gills with people. Despite this, my fiance and I were seated quickly near a window. The service could have been a little quicker, but like I said- they were slammed, so I didn't mind. I loved the decor (the wooden roosters were especially near) and the food... I'm from Massachusetts, and I tend to think that the North is superior to the South in all ways except one. That one is the food. You cannot beat southern cuisine. I would take a Southern meal over a French, Italian, Japanese, whatever meal any day of the week. In particular, I had crawfish cakes with hollandaise, a biscuit, cheese grits, and two poached eggs. The eggs were poached perfectly, the biscuits and the cheese grits were everything I wanted them to be, and the crawfish cakes tasted great. The accent of green onion was particularly pleasant.
