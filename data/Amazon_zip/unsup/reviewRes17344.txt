Like I've said before, I don't like giving 5 stars, but I decided to round up from 4.5. I don't know how I have never heard of this place before, but it is amazing. I went in for lunch and sat at the bar. I ordered ropa vieja , mixed ceviche and a cheese platter. All the food was amazing. These three dishes, two beers and a mojito came to $50, which I think is very reasonable. In addition to the food, the bartender was very nice and entertaining. My only complaint was that the ropa vieja was not as hot (temperature) as I would have liked it. Overall, it was a great experience and I look forward to coming back with friends.
