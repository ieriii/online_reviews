My experience at the bad apple was great. This is a place where you and some buddy's hang out on a Friday night and swig a few beers down. But your typical bar does not have this good of food. First our group ordered the white cheddar beer battered cheese curds. Little prices of fried up cheesiness. It was so crispy and then you get that smooth cheddar taste, like nothing before. Then comes what they are famous for. The burgers. This burger was very good. It had a fresh butcher taste to it. They're purveyor is lafrieda's out of Miami and they are known worldwide. The toppings I had where the original ketchup tomato lettuce and cheese but it wasn't so ordinary as many of the burgers have some crazy topping choices. I will be back. It was great.
