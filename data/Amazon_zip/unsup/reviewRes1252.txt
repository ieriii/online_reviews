There have been so many reviews it will be hard to add any thing useful! But I just have to share my love for Hot Dougs... it would be so wrong not to. One thing I can share is that I am not a meat eater (well besides all those delicious sea creatures) but I swear I crave a trip to Hot Doug's for veggie dogs almost as often as my boyfriend starts feigning for their many varieties of sausage. It is just that tempting. So try it out.. don't be scared of the line.. it is worth it!
