I love wine, and this is a favorite place to try new ones in a classy but not obnoxious atmosphere. I love half-off flights Sundays - a perfect way to kill a couple hours with some wines and tasty snacks. The cheese selection is wonderful and the meals have been decent ; not knock-your-socks-off, but good nonetheless. Service can be spotty. We once had a very knowledgeable server who bordered on excellent silent service, and another who barely paid attention to us. Perhaps it was our attire? For the former it was winter and we were dressed stylishly upscale urban, and for the latter we stopped in before seeing a rock band at HoB next door and we were wearing the obligatory jeans and black t-shirts. Same person, same usual big tip potential, different service.
