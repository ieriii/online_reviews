I definitely feel that Sultan's Market is overrated. Their food is decent, but not really anything to write home about, IMO. I enjoy their falafel, so long as they hold the jerusalem salad... which is all runny and nasty... and also, the falafel balls themselves are quite good. The spinach pie is decent, but not amazing... and the chicken shawarma sandwich is good as well. The thing is, I have had better versions of all of these dishes at other restaurants around Chicago. However, the prices are reasonable enough, although no where near as cheap as Salam. I've managed to avoid scrutiny whilst I sip on my bourbon flask... so that has never been a bother to me. Overall, I like this place... but since I no longer work around there and I'd have to travel anyway to get there... I'd just as soon go to a place that I like more, rather than deal with the cafeteria style environment. That's my two shots of bourbon.
