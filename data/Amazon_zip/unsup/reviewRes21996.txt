Love this place! I'm definitely a regular. Atmosphere: Great, love the outdoor patio. Makes you feel like you're in Costa Rica :) .. Even in the summer you are sitting in an outdoor patio (but is heated) so it feels like it's warm outside! Patio chairs fit the theme. Food: Love the food. Everything tastes to fresh. Definitely try the Pepito sandwich with avocado, it's my regular order. If you are there to treat yourself, get the oatmeal shake. For an appetizer try the chifrijo. The chifrijo has a very fresh taste to it, and you can really enjoy a ton of natural flavors together. It isn't one of those "blow you away" dishes but is really just a nice relaxing, fresh tasting, refreshing appetizer. Service: The whole staff take full ownership of your experience. There is a definite sense of pride among the staff. I will admit that the service takes a bit long, but they give you some really good chips while you wait. I would not go to this place with the expectation of a quick meal though. The BYOB policy also helps the time go by :) I think it's an excellent place to take visitors for an inexpensive, yet tasty lunch. You can entertain them with chips and cheap BYOB beer, and then get a really good, unique meal while you are at it.
