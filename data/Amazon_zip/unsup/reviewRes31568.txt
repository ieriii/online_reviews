MY new favorite! Excellent food, cocktails, and service! We loved it! It is pricey so beware, but great for special occasions. The staff is excellent! Tried the tuna and steak. The sides especially the creamed corn and lobster mashed potatoes are great! Lemon martini was fab and huge! Like two for$16! The butter cake was great too. Its hard to get in so book your res now! Bravo Mastro's!
