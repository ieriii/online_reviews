To me Violet Hour is not a date place, it's where you take best friends for the best drinks in the city and hope you don't fall off your stool by the end of the night. The bartenders are fantastic, the music manageable and the atmosphere above par.  And why does everyone complain about having to sit!? Are you people crazy? I am so tired of standing 10 deep in a crowded bar/club just to get a crappy drink. I will wait whatever the amount of time to enjoy a cushy seat and whatever Michael's making at Violet Hour. On that note the waits can be long. My friends and I mostly go there now if it's past midnight and we aren't ready to call it a night. Unfortunately that usually means we're already tanked, but the bouncer is always kind and hasn't sent us away yet. We may be moving towards the early bird hours to beat the rush in the future. Not that we won't be in the same circumstance come 2am...
