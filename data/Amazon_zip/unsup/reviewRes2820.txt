Same review as all the other positive ones. If you're going to drop 6 bills on dinner, this is the place to do it and not regret a single dime (or $200 bottle of wine). I love that on your way out, they give you coffee cake for the morning after. I halfway expected our waiter to show up with a cup of coffee at 8 a.m. the next day. One thing, though, Chicago men: this is formal dining. "Jacket required" generally also means "don't wear a polo shirt under your blue polyester jacket." Put on a tie, dudes. Sheesh.
