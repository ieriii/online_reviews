I had a late lunch at the restaurant yesterday. They have a great selection of beer and whiskey, including one of my favorites Two Brothers Domaine DuPage. I had the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe which was phenomenal with leaves of sage making a perfect complement to the rest of the sandwich. I tried my friend's Pork Belly BLT. It was good but not as exceptional as my sandwich. Good atmosphere and friendly service make it a restaurant worth checking out.
