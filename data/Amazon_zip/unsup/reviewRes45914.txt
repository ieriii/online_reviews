I've been here many times, and each time I only have one big frustration: they don't take reservations. This particular time, I was with a group (of seven people) on a weeknight, and we were coming just for dessert after dinner (because I wanted the Creme Brulee Duo - Yum!) and was told it was a 1hr 45min wait. We all agreed it would be fine. One of the managers, Jimmy, let me know that if we were willing to split into two groups, we could be seated faster. I said that that would only work if the tables were together (thus really making one larger group), and noted to not split us. 30 minutes later, the buzzer goes off, and I come to find out that we've been split at two tables next to each other (with the high backs separating us). I was upset, and went to find Jimmy, who said he would see what he could do. Meanwhile, our waiter, Shane, came to greet us, and was really awesome and funny. He could see I wasn't in a good mood, and starting telling jokes to lighten my mood -- Awesome. In the end we didn't move, but GLC didn't do anything because of the error. But Shane, our waiter, was amazing, and alone fixed the mistake in opinion.
