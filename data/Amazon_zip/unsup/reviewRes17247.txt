Hands down, my favorite Indian restaurant in Chicago. There's a lot of them but what puts them at #1 in my book is the free naan and tomato sauce you get for dine-in. It's not free for pick up though, but I don't care. I cold just eat that for a meal. They have a great wait staff, great location, decent prices for the area...love this place.
