I almost passed after hearing that the wait was 40 minutes, but luckily my friends convinced me to wait. The food was amazing period. I had the chocolate tower french toast, which was absolutely divine. To be honest, it looked like it would be too sweet and rich, but that wasn't the case at all, you can tell they use good-quality ingredients. It wasn't the sweet that comes with 95% white sugar infused fake chocolate but the sweet that comes with natural chocolate. My friends had the tenderloin benedict and blt benedict, both were divine as well. The eggs were cooked perfectly, not overcooked and rubbery, but not raw either. They were just perfectly smooth and soft. We walked out of there without any of the yucky greasy feeling that comes with so many brunch places. The only minus point? The place was so packed and loud I thought I was going to choke on my food. Luckily, the food was too good to choke on.
