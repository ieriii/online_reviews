I consider myself a bit of an Indian connoisseur and wasn't thrilled with my visit to India House last night. The service and ambiance were fine.....consistent with other indian restaurants downtown. But the food was just OK. I went with my bro and we split the vegetable samosas. Average. Then he ordered the rogan josh and I got the murg tikka masala. They were just average as well. We asked for spicy and they weren't, and my chicken was dry. The naan we ordered was aloo paratha, and it was oily but delicious. Overall, it was a good but not great dinner and I won't be going back.
