It's been a month since I first spotted this truck and let my buddy Eric V. in on this mobile sweet station. This past month he and Anna P. have taunted me with their multiple emails about their multiple delicious visits, and I'd missed every opportunity to sample their melt-in-your mouth goodness. But not today- in yo face(s)!! :) These warm fluffy donuts are awesome. Definitely once they hit your mouth they disintegrate, much like cotton candy. I got to try the cinnamon and the "grandma" (honey and graham cracker), and the coffee. The donut guy in the truck says that this is a special kinda cuban coffee that they serve. All yum. So I'm glad this truck is making its rounds around my work hood, but also glad it's infrequent. It's pricey at about $7 a dozen, or $4 for 3 donuts and a coffee. This will probably not stop me from raiding the truck on a regular basis, however, eeek!!
