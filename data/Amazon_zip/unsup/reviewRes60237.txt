I don't understand why this place packs 'em in, especially on the weekends. Food is at best average with an unimaginative menu, and employees seem to treat most customers like they are a nuisance. What I do like is the outdoor cafe on Division St... it's very pet friendly and has big umbrellas to block the sun. For a better breakfast or brunch, I suggest jam around the corner on Damen.
