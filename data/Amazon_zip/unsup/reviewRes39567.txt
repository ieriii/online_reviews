authentic flavor comes with authentic service I'm fresh off the boat from S. Korea and I was craving some authentic K food. Luckily I was in the right neighborhood when my craving hit. I decided to take a chance on this place for lunch. I ordered the , YukGaeJang, also known as shredded beef soup with vermicelli noodles. The taste was identical to what I would find in S. Korea so I was pleased. What I found most appealing (and that's why im rating it 5 stars) were the side dishes. I was given 9 different side dishes including three types of kimchi. It was heaven. The taste was the same and they were all freshly made. The server saw that I was finished with a few and offered more to me (that's another reason I love dining Korean style (the banchan/side dishes are free!)). The prices were quite right for the quality and amount you got. Even the BBQ prices were not too high. I will definitely return. I read that some other people had bad experiences with the servers and customer service. The lady that served me was quite nice, especially when she found out I could speak Korean. She wasn't able to speak any English so the language/culture barrier could be one reason for misunderstanding. As far as the service goes...people in Korea use a buzzer when they want something. When I want something in Korea..I usually have to wave the server over or give them a shout of "Yogiyo!" to tell them I need something. Korean servers don't come to you unless called. Keep that in mind. don't forget for authentic flavor you will get authentic service ;) BTW, I've visited a few other places in Chicago. So far this place takes FIRST PLACE.
