I came here on a field trip for my Middle Eastern History class and really enjoyed it. Contrary to what I thought, there were a lot of vegetarian options for me, all of which were really great. There were a variety of dished covering all the food groups: grain, fruits, vegetables, dairy, protein, and of course, sweets. Noon O Kabab seemed quite authentic and had an entheusaism for middle eastern food.
