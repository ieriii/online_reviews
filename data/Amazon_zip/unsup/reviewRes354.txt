I feel like i understood his vision, and the service was probably the best i have ever had at a restaurant. My brother and I got the tour and both left happy. The frozen mousse presentation by chef Achatz himself left me in a trance. The only minor grumble is that i wish they spent more of their courses on savories instead of the 5 or so desserts. Although none of them were not overly sweet (and the bubblegum cigar kicked ass), i felt at the end that my belly was mostly filled with sweets, something i would normally not do. In the end it was tottally worth it and i hope to come back.
