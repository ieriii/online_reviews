This is a great location to stay I am not about spending a Lotta money on a room to store my stuff and to lay my head so for my money this place works Really I travel for pleasure so I don't need a gym or day spa or a pool even but I would use the pool if it is there :) if you want to save a few bucks so you can spend it on food and drinks this is the place to stay I like to find a place that has good access to the bus and train as I don't rent cars to often I like to use local transportation when in a different city and Chicago is easy to get around in the Red line is only 4 blocks away and the Blue line is like 8, then you have buses running up and down state and Michigan ave its about 4 block walk also to catch the Elevated Trains and you are only 3 blocks from a Harold's Chicken Shack !! http://www.yelp.com/biz/ Grant Part / Millennium Park are right across the street so if you wanna come to town for the taste or the 4th of July just walk to the park or hell if you live in the burbs and wanna come spend a weened in the city this place would work for you not too far from every thing and not to expensive I think we paid about 90 a night here
