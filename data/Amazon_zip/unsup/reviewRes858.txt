Alright Mr. Doug... after attempting to visit your establishment on at least 2 occasions and walking away frustrated at the ever growing line, I finally had a chance to visit you. Damn you for being so popular (1,960 reviews at the time of this writing)! I rather enjoyed the random hot dog and sausage paraphernalia (including the little Brewer mascots) and got a real kick out of the names for your hot dogs (one formerly known as the Britney Spears sticks out in my mind). While I did not get to try your duck fries (a victim of coming here on a weekday), the overall experience was 5-stars. Your regular fries were awesome (which makes me yearn for those duck fat fries even more...!) and the sport peppers were nice and juicy. Overall, I'm still a Portillo's fan when it comes to the dog itself, but your grilled option makes the 5-star review stick. Keep doing what you're doing, although I wouldn't mind if you expanded the store and started accepting credit cards. I guess it goes to show you, if you have a great product and people love you, you get to do whatever the hell you want.
