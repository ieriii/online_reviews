Ditto with all the other 5 star reviews. My first (and possibly only?) 5 star yelper review from Chicago. I've had the pleasure of dining here several times since their opening in 2005 and each time leaves me wanting to come back for more. If you want a fantastic dining experience and don't care to be doted over by a plethora of servers -for there aren't any (and part of the whole experience), call for a reservation (leave a message and be patient!), bring your bottle of white and go to Schwa. Flavor profiles you'd think would never work, but somehow at Schwa they always do. Chef Michael Carlson=genius. Oh, and the quail egg ravioli ... need I say more?
