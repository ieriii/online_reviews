Sun Wah was closed today (WAH!!!!!!) so we went across the street to Tank Noodle. It was decent. I liked it at first (the flavor WAS good), but as time went on I just wasn't being wow'ed. [In case you're wondering what I ate, I had #44 -- great tasting broth/noodles, mediocre selection of meat/meat products; threw some sprouts, thai basil and hot sauce into it, too] The service was great, though. They kept coming back and refilling my water every 3 minutes which was PERFECT after I ate a jalapeno pepper that I randomly tossed into my soup. I am the spicy food QUEEN, lemme tell you, but this was hell on my tongue. My eyes were getting glossy and I probably drank the equivalent of 5 glasses of water in less than 10 minutes. And I'd probably do it again, hahaha.
