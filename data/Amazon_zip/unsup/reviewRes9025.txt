Mmmmm...shirin polo....just the most delicious combination of flavors: orange, pistachios and almonds, carrots, with rice and chicken. It tastes fantastic, and I always feel like I'm doing my body a favor because it's healthful stuff! If you feel like red meat, try the chenjeh (rib eye skewers). Sooooo tasty!!! I've been going to this place ever since it opened years ago, and the quality is still superb. I've never had a problem with service, though I do carry out about half the time. I'm glad there's more seating now!
