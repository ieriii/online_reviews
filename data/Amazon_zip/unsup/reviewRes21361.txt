worth the wait and worth the wait. i have been wanting to come here since before it officially opened. then i read about the hour-long lines. i just can't swing that on the lunch hour, you know? so FINALLY, i made it here for post-work dinner and gabbing with my girlfriends. not much gabbing going on - we were too busy stuffing ourselves silly! i had the daily torta special - carnitas topped with guac, black beans and marinated onions and served with a side of green salsa. oh. my. GOODness!!!! juicy and flavorful. and the bread so crunchy yet soft. can i get some more? please??? they now have soft serve. too bad i was too full to indulge in that decadence. perhaps next time?
