I took 3 hungry men here for dinner after they helped me move.  We picked up some Coronas at the store on the way and all filled up on delicious guac, fajitas, and tacos. The waitress was attentive and didn't even mind when I practiced ordering in my pathetic Spanish. When the bill came, I had to double-check to make sure everything was on there.  It came to less than $30 for 4 people and we didn't leave hungry.
