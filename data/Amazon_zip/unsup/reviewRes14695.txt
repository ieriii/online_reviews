I'm really glad RevBrew opened up in the neighborhood. I've been a craft beer fan for some time now and its so very convenient to have this establishment just down the street. I know it'll be packed at the usual times, so we go during off peak hours, and its a great place to hang out for a brew or two. Service has been improving steadily since opening weekend and I haven;t had any issues to speak of so far. I've been here a few times for drinks and have only eaten once. The brews are consistently well done and always taste exactly how they should. They seem very 'safe' right now, and my only constructive criticism would be to venture a little further into the 'extreme' brew realm, but it's early and I'll reserve judgment for a later date. As far as the food goes, the wife and ordered a salad and pizza to share They were fine and both the pizza and the salad had fresh ingredients in all the right proportions. We had a hard time finding something without fancy ingredients as we are simple people with simple tastes. I'm a little disappointed in the gastropub movement thingy. I miss the days when you could go to a place like this or Goose Island and order nachos or some other snack that doesnt involve beer fed, open field raised, deep tissue massaged pork strips (aka, bacon) or mussels flambe. I guess thats just the way it goes. Otherwise, RevBrew is surely somewhere we will be returning to in the future, definitely for the fresh beer close to home if for nothing else.
