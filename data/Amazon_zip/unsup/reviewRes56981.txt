I am a big fan of steaks, and Texas de Brazil satisfied my carnivore fix. The selection of meat offerings were selective and great tasting. Unique way of serving steak though, so it was really enjoyable. Parking is a downside and the price might be a little over-the-top, but overall worth the experience.
