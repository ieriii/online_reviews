Is this place usually crowded as hell? Yep! Is there a reason for that? YEP! The food is fantastic and they carry just about every Belgian beer you can think of. It's a Belgian-lover's paradise!! The mussels, the frites, the trappists! It all reminds me of my former home! The tab can be a bit pricey, but they have plenty of beers in the more traditional $5 range and the snack/appetizer food is enough to settle a stomach so you don't have to spend a lot to get some bang for your buck! What impressed me the most though was seeing every single one of my favorite Belgian beers poured right into their appropriate glass, even the ridiculous Kwak (if you've ever seen a Kwak glass, you know what I mean)! Simply amazing. A new favorite!
