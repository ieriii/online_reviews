I LOVE TANK! I have had Pho at other Vietnamese restaurants and Tank by far beats the rest. I usually get number 47 =) and are always very pleased! The best part about this place is that you get so much food for only $7-8! Great place to go on a rainy day with good company. The place is clean and the service is always fast. Parking is not too bad either.
