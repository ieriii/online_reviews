What a great find, especially for a weary traveler looking for Chicago food beyond the four-legged kind. (But if that's what you want, there's plenty of that on the menu.). Great service, delicious fresh inventive food, no pretension, good art, delicious cocktails (particularly the Agropolitain, a cardomom-infused glass of goodness), laid-back atmosphere. I ate the sweet potato fries with goat cheese dip (nice), the spicy Thai fried calamari (delicious), and the house-made gnocci (pan-fried and dressed with vegetables, I loved it). My dessert, some kind of perfectly-made tart pastry with fruit and a giant scoop of the best vanilla gelato I've ever had, made me very happy, as did the after-dinner drink, the Frieda Kahlo. It was perfect; nicely chocolaty, a little spicy, and somehow only lightly sweet without the creamy heaviness you often get in after-dinner concoctions.  Our party of nine, including a child, stayed for three hours and enjoyed every minute.
