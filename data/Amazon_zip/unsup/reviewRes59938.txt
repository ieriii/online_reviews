I ordered a Superman cake to be delivered today, Monday, April 4th from Alliance Bakery. I live in Southern Illinois and ordered the cake for a friend in Chicago. I must say the cake was PERFECT, and my friend could not have been more thrilled. Alliance Bakery made his birthday extra special! From the person who answered the phone, to the person that helped me come up with an idea for the cake, I had superb service. I will without a doubt use this bakery again in the future for my cake-loving friend and hope to someday soon visit Alliance Bakery in person.
