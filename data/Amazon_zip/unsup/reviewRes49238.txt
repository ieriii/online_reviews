i spent most of this month working from home because i was sick of commuting downtown. every morning i'd get my tired ass over to alliance and get a coffee or a cafe au lait, sometimes adorned with a stuffed croissant (turkey and swiss, maybe ham and cheddar). i'd sit outside logged onto the net doing worky-shmirky stuff (or calling my assistant and making her handle everything) and enjoy some sun and scratching the scruff of some local puppy. staring across the street at starbucks, thinking it looked like the new soldier field (is that an alien ship or a starbucks?)...revelling in the intelligensia. the place is a killer mix of coffee-shop and bakery.  i feel like i might meet my future girl here.
