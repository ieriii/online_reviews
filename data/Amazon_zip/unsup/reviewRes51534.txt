Just came back from having a late dinner at Garcia's. This place is great. They got soccer matches going on in the bar at the back of the restaurant, and the food is delish!! And cheap. I'm certainly coming here more often (and would everyday, if it wasn't so darn cold!) The 2-taco dinner and Chicken Pullo burrita are my fav !
