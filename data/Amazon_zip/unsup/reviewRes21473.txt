How can you claim to be from Chicago if you've never been to Superdawg? This is a legendary Chicago institution that you should go to simply for the experience -- I recommend going at twilight so you can see the eerie red and blue zombie eyes of the hot dog statues on the roof searching your soul for a tube-shaped hole only a superdawg can fill. The hot dogs are as true a representation of the Chicago-style hot dog as you'll find anywhere. And, whatever you do, DO NOT ORDER KETCHUP on your superdawg - Maurie regards this as an "abomination" and will refuse. I'm surprised that there are any negative reviews... I don't know what those reviewers were expecting. In the end, its just a drive-in restaurant. But they couldn't have stayed in business for over half a century if they didn't do drive-in food well.
