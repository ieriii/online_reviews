Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck.... This Chinese BBQ joint is the crme de la crme of Chinese BBQ. My padre has been bringing home Sun Wah since I can remember, but we finally dined in as a family, with some friends, for a birthday celebration. We had 10+ and the kind folks at Sun Wah were more than accommodating. The place is HUGE. At a Chinese place like this, similar to restaurants in Chinatown, you have to order family style. So that's exactly what we did. But being a special occasion, we had to call ahead for their two duck dinners. They use every part of the duck to make wraps, fried rice, soup, the works. When our party arrived, we looked over the menu for other entrees. We wound up ordering like seven other entrees, veggies to meats. We had all covered. Everything, and I mean everything, was awesome. Even our unadventurous family friends, with a picky teenager mind you, found everything delicious. Parking is a pain...but you may be lucky and skip out on the meters by finding residential parking if you're willing to walk a block. Now back to my game of Duck, Duck, Goose. ...duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck,.....................no [Grey] Goose. Only beer and wine.
