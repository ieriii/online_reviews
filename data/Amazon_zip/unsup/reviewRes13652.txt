I liked their buttermilk doughnuts with coffee sauce  However my main breakfast which included homemade sausages, eggs and a biscuit was not very good  Two small pieces of sausages were very dry and chewy.  The biscuit was hard and had no flavor.  My husband ordered a reuben sandwich which was okay.  The service was good.
