First of all, I literally live three blocks away from here but never went in until now because there's always a line. So one day my roommate and I decided to try it out 9 pm on a Friday night. The line wasn't too bad... we didn't have to stand outside for long, but once we were in the corridor it was ANOTHER 45 minute wait. I understand that they're all hip and secretive and all that, but why shove people into a medieval torture chamber without giving them any idea of how long they have to wait? Also, did I mention that my roommate is slightly claustrophobic? Yeah. Since the two of us are in deep denial of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, we actually waited it out and got a table around 10. The drinks were everything and more. The waitress was appropriately attentive in the beginning, listening carefully to our preferences and recommending great cocktails. But then we had to flag her down five times to get more drinks and eventually the check. I really enjoyed sitting down, but I found the decor to be very uninspiring.  I'd probably come back again with an out-of-town guest when there's no line, but really not worth anything more than a 5-minute wait.
