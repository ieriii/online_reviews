Great service and fun food. We appreciated the fact that we never felt rushed even as the place filled up. I like what they have done in opening up the space from when it was Aigrie Doux. The only downside for us was,that while portions are nice for tasting, a lot of things on the menu were still very heavy sounding. Will definitely go back.
