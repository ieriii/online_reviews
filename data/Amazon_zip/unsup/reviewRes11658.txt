You can't go wrong with a high quality craft beer and thin crust pizza. I recommend ordering a casino style pizza with clams and bacon. That's right! It's absolutely amazing... I guarantee this pizza will not disappoint! Piece does get busy fast, so make sure you hop in early or make a reservation.
