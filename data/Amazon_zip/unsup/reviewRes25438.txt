Food is filling, and I loved that they made made a accomodation for my seafood allergy. Had lots of excellent vegies. I'm not crazy about the cheese fondue however the other dipping experiences were fun. My dinner mate seemed to enjoy by summed it up by saying it was pricey for a place that required us to cook the food ourselves...typical guy thing to say. :-) You pay for the ambiance and the music was great...waitstaff was fine although they let the oil on the table get QUITE hot and my mate was a little hyper vigilant about the flame...especially after we were both spattered by the oil before we even started cooking.  It was cool but I've known better.
