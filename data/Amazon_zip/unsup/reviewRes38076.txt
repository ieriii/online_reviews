This is my favorite place. The food is great. The beer is phenomenal. Yes, its crowded. That's because its amazing. I like to go really early (right when they open) or super late to avoid the crowd. But even when it IS crowded, I like the people there, so its all good. The waitstaff has always been great, and its so fun to experiment and get new dishes. The duck reuben and beef brisket sandwich are favorites of mine... I can't help I'm a carnivore. Get a different kind of beer every time you go! You will learn so much! And... I've eaten the mussels many times and never ever gotten sick!
