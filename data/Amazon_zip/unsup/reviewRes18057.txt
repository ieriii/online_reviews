Great food! The place is a bit crazy b/c of the long line, but the food is worth the wait. Definitely not a place for big groups or to even sit down and eat. When my friends and I ate there, we ate in silence for the first 15 minutes b/c the food was soooo goood that we couldn't talk lol :) The Ahogado and chipotle were a hit. Also, if you have room, get the churros with the choco dip. It is reasonably priced :)
