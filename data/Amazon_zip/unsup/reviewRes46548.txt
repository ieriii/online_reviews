Picked this place after a long night of drinking (a little hungover) and was not disappointed. Had just the plain cheeseburger (although they had a lot of specialty ones that I look forward to trying) and nachos. Both are awesome! The homeade chips are also amazing. It was a Sunday, so there was a brunch bar going on that looked good and seemed like a good deal.  The waitress was incredibly sweet and took great care of our table. And then there are the shakes. Soooo many flavors. And they'll make whatever you want, any combination. Had an oreo/banana/caramel and it was the best shake I've ever had. Really. The best. Try it. If you like those things.
