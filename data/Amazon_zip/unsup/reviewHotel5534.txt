I booked this hotel through Hotwire for about $150 a night, after tax, for a weekend stay. The Hotel had no parking, but there is a garage next door for $34 a night. We just parked our car in Bucktown on the street for free and road the train in. We liked almost everything about our room. The beds are very comfortable. One issue we had was the amount of shampoo we were given. Only one little bottle compared to normally getting shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. The maid didn't even give us a new bottle for our second night. The other problem with our room was the view, or lack there of. All we could see was an alley filled with dumpsters and trash cans. It was loud early in the morning when the trash trucks came as well. One big advantage to this hotel is the free hot breakfast. It was very crowded, but the dining room and staff seemed to handle the crowd efficiently. The front desk staff was helpful as far as directions and very friendly. Overall I think this is a nice hotel for the money. I'd stay here again.
