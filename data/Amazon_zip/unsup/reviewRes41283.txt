So...... Bonsoiree might be the best restaurant in Chicago. I came here for my fiance's birthday and was extremely satisfied. The courses were wonderful, the service was great. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great night out. By the way, I would stop by the cellar rat for some great wine recommendations to accompany the meal. If I had to sum up the night in one word I would say amazing.
