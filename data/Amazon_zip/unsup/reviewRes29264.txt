We got here a little before it closed so we got seated pretty fast without reservations. I even got to see Rick Bayless in the restaurant having dinner with his wife. I've been wanting to come here since he won top chef master. I told our waiter about how I wanted to try the mole, he actually brought over the three moles served at Frontera grill and then he went over to his restaurant next door and brought over the award winning mole! That made my night for sure, the moles were all AWESOME! The ceviche trio was delicious! And my chicken enchilada mole dish was delicious and my friend ordered the white mole with shrimp and the rice had this nice kick to it. But having the chips from the mole and the ceviche we were getting full. I had one more enchilada left and she had more than half her plate left. Our waiter asked if he could take the plates away so we had assumed that he would pack it up right? I mean most restaurants do that when they see plates still full of food... not our waiter, he trashed our food! He was a great server besides this incident! I was pretty disappointed that he did that, I wanted to speak with the manager but my friend said it was okay. I would of clearly gave this place a 4.5 to 5 rating but after you throw away food like that, thats just not COOL! Anyways, I had a great meal besides that happening and my friend who lives in Chicago said it was one of the best meals shes had so far in Chicago!
