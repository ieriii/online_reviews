I've been meaning to write a review but eat here so often that I don't have time to! Simply It is my little piece of home away from home. It's the best family-owned Vietnamese restaurant I've eaten at while living in Chicago, and you can sense the warmth and love that's prepared with each dish. As a Vietnamese I love how when I sit down to a dish it tastes like something my mom would have made me, rather than a Vietnamese dish made to be catered towards the general public (Mom if you're reading this I still love your food more, don't worry!) Uncle Tuan (as I like to call the owner) has done a fantastic job of bringing good Vietnamese cuisine outside of the Argyle circle. And BYOB WITH Vietnamese food?! Doesn't get much better than that (and Mom never allowed booze with dinner!)!
