one of my favorite restaurants! my favs: lobster bisque & fillet mignon w/ extra butter. the lobster bisque w/ their bread alone is rich, creamy and awesome! fillet mignon w/ extra butter always melts in your mouth. service is always excellent no matter which location! i wish i could say they're consistent with their food at whatever location, but this is not true. Irvine, CA still has the best taste/consistency
