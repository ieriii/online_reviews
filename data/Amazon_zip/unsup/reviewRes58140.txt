Basically good food, small to medium tasting portions and great service. We had the tasting menu without the wine pairings since we had cravings for mojitos. The traditional mojito is the best, but we also had pineapple and watermelon. Most popular but very limited in taste, stick with the traditional.The padron peppers were perfect, so was the head-on shrimp, date wrapped in bacon interesting (the almond in the center, a nice surprise).Patatas bravas, different try to eat them around the edges since it was very hot (temp) inside. I don't know if it was shaped with mash potatoes, but the sauce was not hot enough for my taste. Hard to do a traditional dish with a new twist and please everybody. All other appetizers were also very good, tasty with a small portions. After all it is a tasting menu.The lamb chop was perfect, rare and caramelized with a long bone to get a hold of it. So was the beef, very rare indeed. Which was fine for most of us. Did not miss the mint jelly with the lamb, as was my favorite.We had the vanilla ice Cream with expresso, wrapped in a caramelized sugar bowl. Nice presentation but we would skip it next time. Nothing else on the desert menu seem interesting to me, but I am partial when it comes to traditional spanish desserts, nothing beats my mother's home cooking by far. We left a generous tip 25% because of the superb service.
