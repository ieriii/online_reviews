Just came back from breakfast here today. I had the chocolate French toast tower (amazing, not overly sweet, and sits in a bed of banana foster sauce) while my mom had the black bean and sweet potato breakfast burrito (also delicious and comes with one of the best salsa verde sauces we've ever had). Both of us had to get to go boxes because the food was so good and good portioned we couldn't finish it all.Our server Maria was also the perfect touch. Very friendly, helpful and talkative when inquiring about the history of the restaurant.Would highly recommend this place for breakfast/brunch.
