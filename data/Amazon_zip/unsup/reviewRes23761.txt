Came here with my buds because its BYOB. Yay! I was really impressed with the food. Guacamole was absolutely delicious and fresh. I *had* to try the oatmeal milkshake- it was pretty good, not earthshaking. The food however, was absolutely delicious. My friend and I both got the casada, my boyfriend got something else equally tasty. My boyfriend and I proceeded to eat there 2 more times within the following week and a half. Im currently trying to space it out a bit, especially since the portions are so large.... but can't wait to go back. Downside-- cash only
