First time at Shaw's last night to celebrate 2 birthdays. We started off the evening with a bloody mary and pometini, and both were delicious. The Lobster bisque was outstanding - creamy with fresh tender lobster. We ordered Alaskan King Crab and a Crab combination dinner. Both entrees were abundant and delicious- we were unable to finish the Alaskan King Crab dinner. I absolutely recommend this place for dinner, and don't forget to ask for Luke - he was a spectacular server. We will definitely be going back.
