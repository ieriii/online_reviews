Dined here on 12/5/2010.  The meal, the experience, the evening was nothing short of amazing. When I first read about Alinea so long ago they offered two fixed menus, and even recently in reading reviews I have seen people mention a smaller course menu. Perhaps if we had asked about it it would have been an option but it was not mentioned. If I had to guess, they do not offer two menus any longer. No need to go over anything else. If you have the money, the time, and the forethought to reserve a table, you won't regret it. Some others have mentioned that this is an experience and comparable (monetarily) to other forms of entertainment or a night out. Whatever you need to do to justify the expenditure, do it, it's worth it!
