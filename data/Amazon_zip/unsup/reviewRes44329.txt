After reading all the great reviews, I'm a bit disappointed.  The sign outside advertised paczkis with ten or so filling varieties for Fat Tuesday. Exciting! The guy behind the counter was very friendly, but apparently he did not know which flavor of paczki was which because what I ordered was not what I received. And sadly, I did not find this out until I started eating.. at home.  I'll try them again if I'm in the area, but I'm a little miffed that my rose paczki is actually filled with pineapple because these special treats are only available once a year (they do have custard-filled year round). Edit: The owners contacted me to apologize after they read this review, and I thought that was sweet. Also, the rest of the paczkis I tasted were very tasty, so I upped my star count.
