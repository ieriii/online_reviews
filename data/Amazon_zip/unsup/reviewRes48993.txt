All in all I had a great time. The food was good, ambiance great, great beer and wine selection and friendly service, but there were a couple of quirkly things about the place. To set the stage I was meeting friends there on a Monday and arrived at 5:45PM, the place was about 25% full. First, for some reason I had it in my head there was Happy Hour so when I asked the hostess where I should sit there was a bit of confusion of sitting vs. standing and I didnt really get an answer until I asked the waiter to bring the food menu and what the Happy Hour specials were. Tthat's when he said I had to sit if I was going to order food. Why didnt the hostess just tell me that off the bat.  When we tried to transition to a table we couldnt just sit at one of the empty tables the waiter had to get the hostess and the hostess had to confirm we wanted to eat. Then she left and returned to seat us at a table in a high traffic area, right at the end of the bar next to the trash. Strange for being more than 50% empty and a whole lot of steps for wanting to sit at a table in a restaurant. Next time I'll know better.
