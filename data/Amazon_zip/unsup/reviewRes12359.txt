Goddammit! I put all my review sh*t on http://opentable.com. Now I have to write it over again for yelp. Ugh, here we go. There's not a lot of Latin influenced "date-worthy" dining choices in the area and I'm not a huge fan of Las Tablas so Cafe 28 got the nod. My date and I arrived at 7:30pm, place seemed to just start to get guests. Had a short wait to get our table, despite the place being less than half full. Whatever, we'll just order a drink at the bar while we wait. Hmmm... Let's see... $10 cocktails, F-that, we're drinking water. Ok here we go, our table. They did a good job of keeping us secluded through most of our meal with a nice spot near the window. Waitress was garbage. Handed us the menu and said, "our specials are on the menu." Alrighty then, what about the bathroom b*&%? Can you tell me where the-F that us at least? Geez. She was probably a noobie so I'll forgive her 24-hour-diner-level service. I ordered Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops with sweet potatoes. Those were some serious ass chuletas, not the square plate mincy ass ones. These sh*ts were the size of my hand... and there were 2 of them! My date ordered the Rib Eye. Feels strange to focus on this but the black beans were mufuggin delicious, seriously. The steak itself was also good with rice, plantain, and yuca (Cuban standard). Overall good, had enough food for lunch the next day. Oh! Almost forgot... F-the appetizers, skip that sh*t. Empanadas were tasty, but not tasty enough. The shrimp dish is underwhelming. Probably will return, but I hear "Picante" on Elston a coupl of miles miles west is good too. 2 peeps, a few (3) drinks, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees was appx. $80.
