omg. so delicious. my friend had the reuben sandwich and it was massive and not too salty. i had the french toast - the special that week w/ walnuts and some kind of fruit (can't remember) but it was really good. not soggy at all, the bread was moist and it wasn't drenched in too much sugar or anything
