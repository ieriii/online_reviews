I am sad about having to write this review. I have been to Graham Elliot a few times before and I loved it. It was fun. The food was delicious as well as creative and whimsical.  Instead of bread they served amazing truffle popcorn.  It was great. So last night we saw there were open reservations and decided to bring our friends to try it. I will go into more detail, but I left just depressed that the great restaurant that used to be there is essentially gone. To begin, you now may not order a la carte, which I usually have no problem with, just noting the change, and in this context I have a bit of a problem with it because it is somewhat inconsistent with the fun, somewhat casual experience I had at the restaurant before. Also, I can't say for certain that nothing on the menu is the same, but I can say that all my favorite dishes are gone. No Caesar. no cheddar risotto. As mentioned before, no popcorn. Much more importantly, the food was just totally uninteresting. Instead of being creative and whimsical it just seemed overworked-complicated for it's own sake, not because it added anything to the dish. And honestly it just wasn't good. It was boring and under seasoned. At some point I just started leaving food on my plate because I just wasn't particularly interested in eating it.  Overall, I just went home sad. I loved this place, but it's a completely changed. It seems to want to be a standard fine dining restaurant, but the food, aside from not being what it was, is just not good. I will not be going back.
