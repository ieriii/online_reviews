We were staying in the hotel and made reservations at Mercat on a Sunday night. All in all, it was a decent experience. The room had a bit of a clubby feel to it with the music, which isn't our scene...but surely appeals to some.The food is good. There are many different menu options ranging from lobster to more traditional tapas. My only complaints are that our service was a bit slow when the restaurant was definitely nowhere near capacity, and also the cost.Due to the small plate nature of the restaurant, you have to order a fair amount to fill up. We overdid to be safe and ordered 7 items and had a couple carafes of wine. We were full, but wound up dropping over $200 for two people. I have no problem spending $200 for a meal, but I would like for it to memorable. I would not put Mercat on that level, except that I will remember that I can go elsewhere for good tapas and pay a fraction of the cost.However, if you are stuck on going...some of the better options we had were the rice with morels, the flatbreads, the sea bass and the short rib/scallop combo.
