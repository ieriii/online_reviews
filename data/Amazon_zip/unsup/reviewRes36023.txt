Great food! Watch out for looooong lines & up charges! They charged $2.25 to switch out the cheese on my omelette. U couldn't ask me first? They charge extra for another bit of jam or butter too! Now they give you 1 less piece of bread with the breakfast! So I'm giving them 1 less star. Come on people, are we in that much of a recession?
