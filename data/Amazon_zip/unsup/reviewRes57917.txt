Totally wrong place to go. We were there for a birthday party a year ago and my bad impression will never blend. The owner is just in wrong business. That guy is not friendly neither then he tries to justify his attitude. He asked the birthday girl to pay the bill prior he served the food !??? I had hard time getting coke or mineral water that supposed to be included in the price B-girl paid per person. He came to say, that I shouldn't make pressure onto waitress and I should be more patient. The food in quality was ok but not in quantity . Even though the restaurant was empty he did not let us seat in the main room, as he set the tables for 40 if us in kind of hallway. He interrupted the musician who was playing for us (voluntarily) .... he thinks it is cool to help ladies climb on the bar as he literally takes one of them and put them on his shoulders ...Very disgusting. Our friend spent a lot of money and time planning her birthday but obviously she picked the wrong place!!
