Nice decor, but looks so much better on the website. We were placed on the 16th floor directly RIGHT next to the elevator. The next morning we were woken up by drills, hammers, etc. They were doing maintenance on the elevator. I asked for a different room, therefore we were downgraded to the 15th floor. Should be the other way around right? We couldn't even move into that room until 9pm the second night. This place is a GREAT location, Nice views, but the rooms were just okay as well as the service. Also waited 45 minutes at Hoytt's for 2 beers, we even sat at the bar!. Of course making us late for our flight. We had to run though the airport to catch it... I wouldn't stay there on our next visit to Chicago..... wouldn't recommend it either
