Really, I don't see what all the hype is about! I ordered the California Omelette and personally felt it wasn't very flavorful. And I'm not usually one to complain about service, but our waitor was incompetent and rude! He forgot to bring half of our sides. When my omelette was served, I asked if he was bringing the english muffin I ordered. He said yes, but never brought it. I never saw him again until I was bites away from finishing my meal and again asked for the muffin. He scoffed that they were "still waiting for it to warm up" and 5 minutes later tossed the half burned muffin in front of me. Also, we had to get up from the table to find someone to ASK for water, as our waitor apparently never noticed our empty water glasses. That said, the portions of food served are HUGE and the fresh fruit is good. Aside from that, save yourself the time and hassle and go somewhere better...and with a shorter line!
