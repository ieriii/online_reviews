Nice hotel, esp the club level. We were there the week of penny parking, but no one at the hotel told us so we had to go and get a rental car everyday and return it everynight. A bit tough to get to the L. Great steakhouse, Shulas. CHeesy decor, but good food. Also, the hamburger place in the bottom of the hotel is excellent and great for kids.
