they should really rename clark st. to bayless st. rick bayless OWNS that street. when we called frontera a month before going to the CHI, they only had one opening .. a lunch spot at 2:00pm. we'll take it! our dining experience at frontera was great! we ordered the carne asada a la oxaquena and the pato en mole coloradito (duck mole and so much more). both were superb! the service was outstanding! overall an awesome experience!
