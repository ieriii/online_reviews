Nuevo Leon basically owns 18th Street. Whenever I came to Pilsen during my first two years in Chicago I got dragged to NL. The food is good, no doubt, and you gotta love BYOB Mexican places when you're not yet of drinking age. But there are MUCH better authentic Mexican places in the city, especially in Pilsen. Every time I come here I end up getting some gross gristly hunk of something in my chicken and feeling sick. That said, I don't object to eating here. It's an establishment and it's beyond me to knock it down.
