I've heard so many people talking about India House that my visit earlier this week was way overdue. The restaurant is conveniently located near the Grand red line. When I first arrived, I informed the host that I made a reservation via Open Table and she walked away, presumably to retrieve someone who knew what I was talking about. Another person came to the front, checked me in and I was led to my table. The menu is huge, although I already knew what I wanted, palak paneer. As I waited for my friend to arrive, I was served "baby naan" with a tomato sauce. Yummers! We ordered a garden salad to balance the rest of our dinner - palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, biryani rice and plain naan. We asked for the food to be very mildly spiced and it was prepared just right. At the end of the meal, I took the leftovers home and I had enough fro three more meals. Bill came to $50 before tip. It seems like other Yelpers have commented on the service so I wanted to throw in my two cents. I was here at 6 pm on a Tuesday night so it wasn't crowded. I did notice that the waiter would ask us a question or field a request from us and then a busboy would come by and ask the same thing. I guess you could either call that overattentive service or lack of internal communication. The next step is to try the lunch buffet that everyone raves about. I'd love to sample the butter chicken and the matar paneer. I can only do Indian every so often so I look forward to my next trip to India House!
