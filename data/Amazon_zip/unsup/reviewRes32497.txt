Went here to lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food is! I'm not a vegetarian so I was a little leery when my friend suggested Chicago Diner, but I can say with certainty that I'll return! I have the gyro which was really tasty and my friend ordered the black bean burger, which looked awesome. We were seated relatively quickly (told the wait would be 15 minutes and were seated in about half that) and the server was very friendly. I would recommend this if you're in the neighborhood!
