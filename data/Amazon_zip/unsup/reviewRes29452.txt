I've been going to Frontera Grill for years, and it's consistently impeccable service and food. Rick Bayless knows Mexican cuisine, and every dish on the menu is extremely well thought out. Frontera also has the BEST margaritas in town, and I would argue with anyone over that - the Topolo is their signature. In addition to the ceviche, which is light and flavorful, I have a difficult time not ordering steak (either the Bravo or the Oaxaquena, both are delicious), the Dorado en Pipian Verde is a wonderful mahi, with a great sauce that really complements the fish. All and all, while I've tried most of the Mexican restaurants in the city, Frontera has yet to be beat.
