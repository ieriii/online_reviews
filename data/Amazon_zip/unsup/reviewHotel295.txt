We stayed at The City Suites Hotel in Chicago this past weekend. The hotel is an older building but the hotel is actually quite nice. We had the suite with a king bed and in the other room a pull out sofa. We had 2 LCD TV's, a table with 4 chairs, small frig, microwave, and a fully stocked bar. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was very clean (and I mean CLEAN) and the bath had everything you needed. The staff were very nice from the person who took our reservation, the desk staff, and the housekeeping staff. All of the employees made sure we were treated well. There is even a continental breakfast that is free--not many offer this in today's economy. Across the street is a diner that is open all night long if you feel the urge to eat. the hotel is on the Brown Line which will take you to the Orange Line (in the loop) then to Midway. It takes 1 hr from the hotel to get to Midway. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. RM
