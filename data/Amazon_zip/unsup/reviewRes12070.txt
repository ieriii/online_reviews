So I just ate at Arturo's in Greenwich Village, NYC, the quintessential NY style pizza. (See article in April '08 Wired mag). Well, I got a tell ya' that I think Piece does it just as well, if not a bit better that Arturo's. The flavor and texture of the crust is spot-on at Piece. I wonder what type of oven they use (coal fired?) . Is it possible that they bought a well used oven when they built the place, since good pizza gains some of its flavor from the many pizzas cooked in the oven previously? At any rate, I now have another reason to miss Chicago -- NY style pizza at Piece!
