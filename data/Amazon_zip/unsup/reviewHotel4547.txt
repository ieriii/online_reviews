When visiting Chicago for my semi-quartely pilgrimage to CSO, I always end up staying here not because I like stayin' here but you can get a good deal through various travel websites. Also the fact that it's only a few blocks away from the hall is a big plus. Rooms are tiny but that's what you expect at hotels smack in the middle of downtown of any city. They don't give you a spankin' clean vibe but acceptable sans their rug. It's close to everything including the Art Institute and shopping. I haven't tried the restaurants at the premise but the bar downstairs is cozy and they have good sliders. Subway from O'Hare takes you practically here so that's another plus.
