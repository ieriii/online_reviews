i get excited - childlike excited - when i'm about to try a new restaurant or fueling a craving. so i skipped my way through this restaurant with my best foodie friend, eric. yelp told me to do the duck dinner, so we did. it feeds about 4, but we said what the hell, we're asian and we eat a lot...let's do it. i skipped my way through a spacious, warehouse-y type spot. huge groups of people (we were probably the only twosome), many many birthday groups. sat down and drank our hot tea - didn't open the menu, though it's double sided!! - and ordered our duck. we waited. sang happy birthday to about 3 different people. then, a cart of deliciousness wheeled up to us. a quiet little lady didn't say a word and just began slicing our little ducky. lots of mouth watering and asian-tourist style photography happening here. the little buns, sauce, and toppings came. and all was right in the world. duck was crispy, cooked perfectly. THEN came duck fried rice and duck soup? YES. my thoughts after: when can we go back? i'd probably bring one or two more people to share this delightful duck with. so maybe we can order some sides and try some of their other things too... again, we eat a lot of duck. :/
