Pretty damn good authentic Chinese food outside of Chinatown! I ordered the Beijing Duck and it came with a huge soup, fried rice, the typical pancakes and hoisin sauce etc...everything I had was very delicious...The Ma Po Dofu was hit or miss though...it was excellent my first time but my 2nd time there it wasn't nearly as good. Try to go when they're not slammed.
