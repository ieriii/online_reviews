We went to Glenn's for dinner last night for the first time. We've been there for breakfast (best traditional style pancakes anywhere) several times, but never for dinner. We dined al fresco on what, to my mind was the most beautiful evening of the year. We shared the Sturgeon with mushroom-bacon cream sauce (not low-cal, but Atkins friendly if you're going that way). It was like a dream...truly the best non-crustacean seafood dish I have ever eaten. It came with oven-browned red-skinned potatoes and fresh, slightly al dente asparagus--both perfect. It was a great meal in spite of my initial buyer's remorse as it was "all-you-can-eat" King Crab night (every Tuesday) for $42.95. We knew before we got there that we had a late lunch and as such, we wanted to share an entree (no sharing all-you-can-eat fare). When I saw the crab being served to the next table, I came "this close" to tackling the waiter to get him to switch my order. In retrospect, I am so glad I didn't. The Sturgeon was absolutely awesome! On a Tuesday sometime in the near future, I'll skip lunch and go for the crab!
