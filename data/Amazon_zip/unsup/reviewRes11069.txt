This place had a funky "locker room" smell that stayed with me hours after we left. But that didn't surprise me because it looked pretty dirty and grungy. I had the red pizza with one ingredient and was not a fan of the sauce. It was also kinda of pricey for what we ordered. In addition, one member of our party got sick from the white pizza with artichokes. She thought it was just that she ate too much but then she had some leftovers the next day and got sick again. I won't be back.
