I went here on a referral from a friend....it was amazing. My wife and I had such a good time here. The food and expeirience was tip top from bigginging to end. We highly recommend this place. It was our 1st time at a fondue place and we'd 100% return and recommend this place. enjoy. -Happy customers.
