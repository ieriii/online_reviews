I think this is a welcome addition to the Millennium Park scene. We went for an office lunch and every one enjoyed their food. For a cute touch, my fish and chips were served in a newspaper cone, just like the ones I got in Dublin, so at the very least it made me feel that I was authentically a tourist at a pub in Dublin. Oh, and they were good, too. The interior decor is very nice, all dark woods and subway tile. At lunch, there was a rumble of conversation but my table mates and I could talk and be heard comfortably. And our server was excellent. It's pricey for lunch, but in line with what you would pay for similarly nice spots in the area, like the Park Grill. Probably not an everyday place, but it made a nice treat.
