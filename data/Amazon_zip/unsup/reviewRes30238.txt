Vegetarian fare does not have to be tasteless. I was dragged to this place by my ex-roommate who is a vegetarian. She said it is a Chicago landmark and I should try it. Everything I ordered was bland and tasteless. I even tried eating some of my friend's food and it was the same. I give two stars for the service and the catchy names on their menu. Reading the menu was entertaining.
