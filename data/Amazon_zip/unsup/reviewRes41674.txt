the Pho tai is the only thing I order for dinner. I will get different appetizers and drinks but really this is what I am after. I dont know if its saying it's a "Thai" style pho but it is the closes thing to my mothers guay tiew (i have no idea how it's spelled, just how it sounds)soup. It so good and yummy. It has all the right flavors and really makes me happy. The prices are really reasonable and you get a lot which is great if you want to share and I recommend sharing everything but the soup. Might get a touch messy. I love this place, even if I have to share a small table with strangers. It's not like you have to chat with them...
