I think they snuck into my building the first time they delivered. Since naturally I am a nudist in my apartment, I was not delighted by their stealth. However, every delivery they have made has so far included complimentary fruit--usually oranges, but sometimes more exotic things (and once, complimentary smoothies!). I always order their Pho soup, which I think is delicate and aromatic, and their Saigonese crepe, which is equally in-crepe-able. The physical restaurant, itself, is just ok.
