This is definitely NOT your high end Steak and Potatoes place, this is a high end Entertain-Your-Palattes place. My husband is a picky eater and although we had reservations at Alinea, he decided last minute to switch to EG based on the good reviews of picky-eaters. Needless to say, we made a pretty darn good choice. We signed up for the 20 course meal and we wiped all our plates clean. Salmon was cooked to perfection, chicken was paired with a buttery kale or whatever green veggie that was (the important thing is that my husband actually ATE it!!!), foie gras danced on my tongue and all the desserts were a fairy tale delight. It would take forever for me to describe all 20 courses. So all I can say is that if you love trying new dishes then this is the place for you.  If you want steak and potatoes, or pasta and salad or are looking to stuff your mouth with pizza, do NOT come here. Cause you're not gonna find it.
