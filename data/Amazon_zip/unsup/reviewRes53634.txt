I went to Crisp the first day they opened way back when and went again a couple of weeks ago. It's not authentic Korean per se, it's really more American with Korean influence or very Americanized Korean food. On my recent visit, the fried chicken was good, but very greasy, memorably greasy as compared to the food on my first visit. It's a clean, small place with picnic tables and decent food, but nothing totally spectacular. I think they were more attentive to detail and customer service when they first opened, with personalized attention from the owner regarding food quality at that time.
