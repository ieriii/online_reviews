It's kind of sad to admit this, but I've been there three times already and they haven't even been open a week.... The rundown: Thursday night, dinner - started with the Cross of Gold, which was smooth and light. For an app we had the bacon fat popcorn, which at $4, is a great starting snack for two people. For my entree I chose the farm burger, which had beets beneath and was topped with spinach and an egg (I did not need the lettuce or tomato that came on the plate); it actually arrived without the top bun but it was only day two, so who cares? I for one found it hilarious. Finished with the almond cake topped with sour Michigan cherries soaked in bourbon and vanilla creme, delicious and reasonably priced at $6. Saturday afternoon I may or may not have popped in for a beer after brunch... what else do you follow a bloody mary with?? Be warned: the place is kid friendly. We were waiting at the bar for a beer and/or a seat to hear the peals of a child screaming... not pleasant. People looked up from the bar. Parents, when this happens, as a courtesy to the hundred other people in the establishment, TAKE THE KID OUTSIDE. /rant I was also here Monday night to meet up with a friend for drinks. Tried the Anti-Hero IPA, which I hear is about to run out (because it's fantastic, natch), and split the bacon fat popcorn and the duck confit pizza with said friend. Not what you'd normally expect on a pizza, but the duck confit does not disappoint. Ended the night there with the Eugene porter, a smooth porter that I didn't find too rich like I do others. Overall, completely lived up to my expectations, and I'm so glad to have it in the neighborhood. Maybe next time I'm there I'll remember to join the Mug Club. D'oh!
