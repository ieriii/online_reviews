I am a girl that loves her sausages... brats, polish, Italian, hot dogs, and pretty much any other kind of sausage that have graced my lips. So, why in the hell did it take me 3 years to get to Hot Dougs?! I decided to come here for the first time today with my friend that was visiting from Minneapolis. I thought that it would be a great place to go seeing there is pretty much nothing like it anywhere else and HDs definitely did not disappoint. We got to HDs around 10:45 or so and the line was down the street and took about a 1/2 hour before we were able to place our order. No worries there because what we had before us was totally worth the wait. My friend had the burgundy and citrus pork with sun-dried tomato mustard and peppercorn cheese and he just could not stop raving about his sausage! I had the mushroom and Swiss cheese pork sausage with chili-garlic mustard, shitake mushrooms, and baby Edam cheese... yummy! We both had the order of duck fries too because, after all, it was Friday! I was almost going to give them 4 stars because, eh, the wait honestly sucks but the extra star goes for the music! Anyplace that is playing Orgasm Addict by the Buzzcocks while I am eating a sausage earns those 5 stars!
