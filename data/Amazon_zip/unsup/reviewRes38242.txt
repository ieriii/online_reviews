If you wish to satisfy your annual cheese intake in one sitting, this is your place. The stuffed pizza is two inches of cheese, along with whatever other toppings you desire. It's very tasty. The place is packed, loud, and we waited a good 45 minutes for the pizza to arrive. I felt the need to try a Chicago-style pizza on my one day in town, and I'm glad I went. Not sure how often my health can take shots like this though...
