Why doesn't Yelp allow for half stars? The Gage deserves 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option so I decided to be generous and round up to four  The Gage's selling point is that it's one of the only decent dining options in this part of downtown. It has a diverse, upscale pub menu with a great beer selection. The fondue appetizer is spectacular - definitely five stars - but then again when isn't cheese 5 stars? Unfortunately, I've eaten here numerous times and all of the entrees, except for the 4-star buffalo chicken sandwich, are just so-so. The pork belly sandwich sounds enticing but in reality was too thick to eat eloquently over a business lunch - and was way too salty (and the refills too slow). The steak on the steak salad was excellent, but the rest of the salad was too bitter and quite bland. If you stick the fondue appetizer and chicken sandwich, you could walk away like I did on my first visit, raving about a 4.5 star experience in a 1 star part of town. Unfortunately, visits 2 and 3 have left me questioning whether the restaurant really lives up to its hype or just benefits from being surrounded by mediocrity.
