This is a wonderful neighborhood Italian restaurant. It has a great atmosphere offering everything from romantic "old school" private booths to a fantastic upstairs that is available for private parties up to 40 people (I think). The best part about the private parties is that they serve the same meals as the regular menu, so it is good food not the average banquet garbage that so many others pawn off as decent fare. The service is excellent, the prices reasonable, and the food delicious. Highly recommended.
