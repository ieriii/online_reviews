Korean or not, most every Chicagoan has probably been to San Soo Gab San on one early drunken morning or another. I, however waited to try it until I had sampled nearly every other Korean barbecue restaurant on the North Side. I'm glad I waited. Yes, the panchan selection is more plentiful than many competitors', but when it comes to food, I prefer quality over quantity. As for the main event, prices are higher than average for undistinguished cuts of meat, while portion sizes are smaller than average. In a genre of ethnic restaurants not known for its effusive service, San Soo Gab San set a new low. There are several better competitors within a stone's throw, and Hae Woon Dae features the same late night hours.
