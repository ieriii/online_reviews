Hands down THE best pizza in the city. Enough said.  However, the wait can be really long (2+ hours on weekend nights) and it gets really crowded and noisy, but the pizza is so worth the wait. You can also avoid the long lines and carry-out. Having said that, the taste outweighs the wait....5 Stars!
