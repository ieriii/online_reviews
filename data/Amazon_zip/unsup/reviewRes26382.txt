If I had never been to melting pot I would probably love this place, but since I have I would much rather go to melting pot. At melting pot when you arrive your table is always ready for you, here we were forced to sit at the bar for over 20 minutes. One good thing did come from this though, and that would be that they have absolutely delicious cheese spread in the bar. I would definitely recommend it. The wine list was good although there was a definite lack of South American whites. The salad was quite good, my hubby liked it better than MP's, I like the variety at MP's better. The cheese course is definitely better at MP's, there is obviously more selection there, but all of the cheese fondues I've had at Melting Pot have been better too. This cheese fondue is WAY too runny for my taste. The meal itself is far more expensive at Geja's and the portions are smaller so it is definitely not worth the money. The chocolate fondue wasn't bad but I like the options at Melting pot better as well as the cheesecake, brownies, and covered marshmallows. Additionally, this place is very dark, too dark in my opinion since you are cooking meat afterall. Lastly, the tables are very close together so you can hear the conversations of everyone around you. The service is significantly better at melting pot. I'm glad I tried it just so I can be sure I made the right choice the next time I go to MP. Probably will not be back
