I had just wrote this lengthy review of a meal I had here last night - and then saw pretty much the same review written just yesterday, so in the interest of providing a fresh review, I had to try again. Sad panda. I wanted to go on about the duck liverwurst pate, and how its richness awakened my palate, or how the wild boar sloppy joe is transcendent (if not a sloppy joe as you've ever experienced). I longed to revisit the a-hah! moment when the scallop & oxtail, gnocchi and fonduta hit my tongue all at once, or to take a tour of the delicate, fatty, crispy, tender veal as sat on its mountain of brussel sprouts. But It has been written. So too has been the facebook-photo-worthy poached apple desert, with its shocking dollop of bacon ice cream. So instead I'll try to make sense of the lone oddity in this whole meal - the beef cheek manicotti that came with the veal. While tender, delicious and interesting, it didn't actually pair up with the plate. Why was it there we wondered, as we went about dividing it. What was the reason the chef thought this accented that tender,crispy,delicate veal we thought as we swirled it in the reduction that remained on the plate. Beyond that there was nothing that missed the mark. From the extremely reasonable prices to the well balanced design Longman & Eagle has done it for me. Will it do it for you? Only one way to find out.
