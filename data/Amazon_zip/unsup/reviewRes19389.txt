Highlight of the evening was the Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll (CSTR) - OMG! It was so good. We also got the dragon roll and while it was good, it didn't even compare to the CSTR. The volcano sushi was good, not too impressed with the sunrise, but everything was really fresh. And don't get me wrong all the food was great, but when you have a standout dish like the the CSTR then it's hard not to depend on the theory of relativity.  We had the spicy miso to start with and then edamame - yum, yum, yum! We ended with the mango and lychee sorbet. The lychee was my favorite. By the end of the night we were comfortably satisfied without being sickly full.  Thank you Coast for another wonderful meal!
