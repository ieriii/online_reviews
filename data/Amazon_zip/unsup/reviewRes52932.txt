Soooo damn good! I probably eat there once every two weeks. Cheap, delicious, nice ambiance, and friendly servers. They really know what they're doing. The only thing I'm not that crazy about are their shakes. I've tried three different kinds now and I'm not the least impressed. Not much flavor and not very thick.
