Tried to get away for a night with the wife for a nice relaxing night away from things on a "stay-cation". Not so much. This place is like a club. Loud techno music, we could hear the bar patrons until 2 am. The lobby is packed with coked up clubers. The double door that leads into the room next to us had no sound proofing so we heard the guy in the room next to us screaming on the phone at 8 in the morning. Then, house keeping woke us up at 9:15 wanting to clean our room. When we complained to the front desk upon check out, the reply was "sorry, thats how we are." Not to mention...the heated pool was freezing. Very disappointed on our wasted night at this place.
