im giving this place 3 stars because both times ive been here, my friends and i have found amazing parking. which is great, but also sheer luck and something piece has no control over. that being said, i think the reason this place let me down was because on the menu, the toppings SOUND so amazing, and the pizza itself (your choice of red, white or plain) gives you more options than usual. but both times the pizza arrived, it a.) took over our ENTIRE table and i literally could not see where i was eating or what was going on b.) the crust was burnt, and not in the good way c.) was really hard and difficult to cut and serve. i mean, we're talking about funky pieces. either way, ive always eaten my fair share (possibly even more). it's good pizza, but just, eh.
