Only been here for wine on multiple occations; but the service has been exceptional. Busy, loud and needingly brave scene; it's easy to blend or be noticed here. Very nerdy cool. Wine list is ever changing and fun. The staff is educated and ready to make your night easy breasy. Be strong, be ready for a long wait during peak hours.
