go for the LUNCH BUFFET !! there is a great selection (i am a vegetarian and my friend is a meat-monger and we both loved it)... and you can end it all with mango ice cream... so woohoo! i have a lot of indian friends and have had the luxury to have many delicious home-cooked indian meals... and this was definitely up there too! i also went once with my cousin for dinner--- not as impressed, but i'm kind of biased because I believe the best way to do Indian food is to try a little bit of a lot of dishes... and not just eat a whole bowl of lentils or something. But, they gave us extra garlic-flavored naan when we got our dish to go, so that was nice.
