The BEST authentic Mexican food in Pilsen & Chicago. Their guacamole is yummy and I always get the Caldo de Res (beef stew) and Chiles Rellenos de picadillo (stuffed peppers). Both are out of this world (or Mexico)!! The sizes are large so I get all that and share it with tortillas. It will fill you both up for sure. You cannot go to Pilsen without coming here. The two downfalls are that it gets REALLY busy and while you're waiting there is no where to go but be in the middle of everything. The other is that it is cash only. Truly a cultural experience (although gentrification is slowly taking place...). P/S: If you want alcohol like margaritas, it is BYOB and they have no alcohol supply.
