LOVED this place. we got the chef's choice for $35, 3 courses with 3 plates per course. it was amazing!! we also got dessert: chocolate croquettes that were beautifully plated with banana marshmallow, rosemary infused caramel and olive oil. IT WAS SOOO GOOD! I think you have to try this place!! I would eat here AT LEAST on a monthly basis! Too bad I live in San Francisco, CA.... Also, if you are concerned about eating sustainable seafood - DON'T BE! They comply with Monterey Bay Aquarium's seafood guide and use seafood ingredients that are sustainable and support the ocean's ecosystem.
