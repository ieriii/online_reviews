Ordered delivery online for the first time on 3/31/12. After 1.5 hrs (the site said it'd be 1 hour) I called to check on order. Without asking for my name or address, I was told that it was on the way. After 2 hrs, I called back, and was told they'd never received the order. I did have a confirmation number, but they said that wouldn't help. Was told they'd comp "something" the next time I ordered. No thanks. Was excited to try the food, unfortunately never got it, and won't order again.
