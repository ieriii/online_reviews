I would go 3.5 stars If i had a gun to my head. the inside of this place is great. lots of room, quiet, nice lighting. Was a fan of that.  the person i was with had the fettucine alfredo and I had the pork chops. I can say that both were satisfying for sure. Although the alfredo looked like all sauce and no noodles but there were leftovers so what do i know. The wine list is nice with plenty to choose from. the waitress was a little slow and unattentive and it took her awhile to get our drinks, our food order and our bill.  nothing REALLY stands out as amazing about this place, but its a good date place as someone else said and everything seemed above average that I put into my mouth.
