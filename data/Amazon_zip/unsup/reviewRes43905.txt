I just celebrated my Tenth anniversary there this past weekend and was blown away by the quality of the food and the service. Not only were our steaks cooked perfectly to order but the staff also went out of their way to help us in planning the rest of our evening post Kinzie. I had mentioned the anniversary when making the reservation, and we received a complimentary glass of champagne. The garlic mashed potatoes that came with my filet special were to die for. Overall, an excellent meal and well worth the splurge. A quality value I feel for a special occasion.
