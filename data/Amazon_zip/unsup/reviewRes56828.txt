This is a restaurant with a fantastic staff and owner who make you feel like you are in their home. And the food is fantastic. In reading the other reviews - most rave about the Pizza - and I cannot disagree. It is top-tier - cooked in a gorgeous wood fired oven imported from Italy. But for me - it was about the cheeses. Starting with the buffalo mozerella - imported weekly from Italy - was so fresh and lovely you could taste the subtle sweetness of the milk and the Italian grasses on which the buffalo grazed. My comment was 'it gives me the sensation of Angel wings' - and it did. It is that good - best I've ever had. And the imported prosciutto that was served with it was amazing and added a perfect richness to the lightness of the cheese. Ultimately, though, I forgot about the prosciutto and kept going back for Angel wing after Angel wing of the Buffalo Mozzarella.The next cheese which blew me away was the buratta. Served with crusty bread out of the oven and roasted sweet peppers - unreal! Again, this was a very special cheese which was a bit heavier in style than the buffalo mozerella but every bit as special. A remarkable experience with the bread and roasted veggies.Overall, this is a wonderful, neighborhood restaurant with a caring owner who loves food almost as much as I do :) He takes pride in treating his customers well and showing his appreciation for their business.
