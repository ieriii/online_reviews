I've been to the Publican two times, and I'm not sure why I went back. The place looks nice, but once you're seated at those long, cafeteria-style wooden tables, you are packed in with other diners. Their conversation becomes your conversation, and, each time I've been, it has been a conversation so awful that it ruins my dining experience. After 8 p.m., you have to shout to be heard, even by the person directly across from you. The service is...interesting. There are a lot of visibile waitstaff, walking about in their uniforms, but service is slow. Both waiters I've had have had an attitude. Also, the beer list. I guess if beers from the U.K./Belgian beers are really your thing, and you like paying very, very high prices for them, then it might be the place for you. I've found many other restaurants and bars around the city that have much better beer lists; like Maria's Community Bar. The food is good, the oysters are wonderful (maybe this is why I came back?), so if you can put up with everything else, then make a reservation (seems necessary) and enjoy.
