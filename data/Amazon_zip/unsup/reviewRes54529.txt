Ok, so I'll preface this by saying that I am NOT a vegetarian. I was kidnapped and taken to this strange place where people only eat green leafy things and the menu contains items that are listed as chicken to tease us meat eaters. Needless to say I was really impressed. The ONLY downside about this place is that it's tiny. If you don't mind possibly rubbing elbows to the person next to you then you shall be ok. The wait staff was greatThe food was good And they have a tiny parking lot located behind the restaurant. Oh and the cheesecake in phenomenal.
