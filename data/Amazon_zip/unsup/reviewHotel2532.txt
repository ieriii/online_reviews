The Chicago Hilton is a fixture in Chicago, with a history almost as old as the city itself. As a resident of Chicago, we were looking for a fun place to celebrate the city for an evening. Although we got an excellent rate on this hotel vs. the rates on their website, they want to nickel and dime you like crazy once you get there. Touting themselves as "pet friendly", they charge a $75 NON REFUNDABLE pet fee. Internet access was $25 per day. Even the bottled water that was sitting out on the desk (not in the mini bar) was $6.00. Add on overnight parking for $43, and you're racking up quite a tab for a supposedly 4-star place. The bathroom was tiny, the faucet dripped, and there were fingerprints on the window, even water left in the ice bucket. I am sure this was a grand place in its day, but that day has passed. I was really disappointed when I bid on a hotel for next month and came up with the same place. I can only hope that our experience is better this time, since we can't really do anything about the choice that price line returned. I can say that this is a two and a half to three star place at the very best, and would not suggest it at anywhere close to full price.
