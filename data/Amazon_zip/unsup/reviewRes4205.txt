This was without a doubt the best restaurant experience I've had in Chicago. To start, the service was outstanding- they were welcoming and gracious (we were thanked for coming in by at least 3 different people through out the night), and took the time to explain each course in detail even when the place started to fill up. They kept our wine glasses full and let me take a copy of the menu home when I asked. The space itself is tiny as everyone always mentions, but it's sleek and clean and relaxing. Most importantly- the food! All 9 courses plus one extra were spectacular. Everyone raves about the quail yolk ravioli, which is excellent, but in my opinion nothing could trump the sweetbreads with cilantro and patron. We also couldn't stop talking about the apple pie soup with savory and cheesey pie crust, and the grilled tigerfish.... all of it was amazing. I would go back any time, TODAY if possible. Thanks to Michael Carlson and his fantastic team for giving us such a memorable experience. (I did see Carlson in Whole Foods yesterday-- I wanted to tell him what a great time I had at his restaurant, but he seemed busy and I lost my nerve.)
