Everything is priced 10 to 15% higher here than other comparable steakhouses. It is pretty dark here, the atmosphere is similar to an upscale club. We sat in the in the "bar" area for my birthday dinner. My seat was in the crack of a booth which was uncomfortable at times, I had to move the table. What I cannot understand is that these are the best seats that they can offer after having reservations for 5 weeks in advance? Also, they didn't even mention anything about my birthday which was reserved as "birthday dinner".  I prefer my steaks less charred then what was prepared here. Everything else is average. Although the service and valet is top notch! For a better steak at a more reasonable price try Capital Grille, Flemings, Chop House and even Wild Fire! These restaurants seem to remember special engagements such as birthdays and anniversaries!
