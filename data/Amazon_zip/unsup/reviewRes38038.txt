They have Alpha King on tap. And, and, Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA. And Crooked Tree. And so... many... more. These beers will knock you out. These beers are like drinking two beers or three beers, so be careful with yourself if you are unlucky enough to not have a residence within walking distance of this bar. (Heh heh... I'm lucky.) If you are splurging and want to eat as well, they actually do have a couple of awesome vegetarian options. The cashew butter, cheese, and fig sandwich is something of an enigma to me. An amazing enigma. Sure to please.  If you want intimate conversation with someone, then your only hope in hell is to eat and seat in the dining area. It will be hard to catch up anywhere else, especially on the weekends. Remember to project your voice. A lot. And you'll be fine. And probably drunk.
