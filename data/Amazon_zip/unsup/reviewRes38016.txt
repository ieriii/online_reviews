I think Giordano's pizza is pretty great - it's the definition of a Chicago deep dish pizza. These pizzas are HUGE - it's hard to eat 2 pieces! It is SUPER cheesy...so if you don't like cheese, this is not your place. But if you are a cheesaholic, you won't be able to get enough. This is just one of those places you HAVE to try if you come to Chicago.
