We ordered delivery last night. The food was delivered within 30 minutes. We ordered these rolls: main lobster, rainbow, kani chiung, emerald, and spicy tako. Everything tasted good, as usual, but a few hours later we were vomiting and didn't stop until every molecule of our dinner was back in the bucket. I'm off sushi for now, and off Wakamono forever. Kind of sad, and absolutely wrecked our Friday night.
