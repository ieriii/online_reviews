Don't plan on going out after you eat at Demera. I smelled and tasted my dinner on my skin and in my mouth for two days after I had dinner there. Garlic and curry flavors weren't overpowering while you're eating them, but watch out after. We went in to Demera with high expectations I guess since people seem to rave about the cuisine. We were disappointed in the wine, the appetizer was ok, and the entrees were nothing spectacular. The brown bread that came with our tomato app was good, but the white was dry and tasteless. Our 2 entrees were the vegetarian and lamb wat. Really nothing to write home about. Not completely offensive either.  The price was reasonable, and the ambiance was good. Overall though, I will not be going back.
