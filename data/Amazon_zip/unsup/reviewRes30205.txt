This place is terrific. Everything we had was delicious and creative. The short ribs were tender and full of flavor, the 7 spiced fried chicken and the Malay sea bass were also very good as was the oxtail pot stickers. The devils basket had fried squid with more chilis in one dish I have ever seen. Could have had less chilis and more squid but that's all I can say as a criticism. The squid was excellent but they could have put more of them in the dish. Then the desserts were served. All I can say is try the mango tiramisu. Amazing! It a bit loud but all in all the food will compel me to return.
