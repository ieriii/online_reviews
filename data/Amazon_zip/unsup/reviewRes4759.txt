very busy, long wait for seating, touristy cuz it's on Michigan ave, but a convenient place to have an afternoon meal after shopping on Magnificent mile but.... YUMMY FOOD! good and would order again: pig ears: thinly slice/fried(almost like onion rings, you won't even notice the cartilage), with pickled peppers, and overeasy egg, and some other stuff (my favorite dish) octopus: with green peans and potatoes and some sort of salsa verde, yum! panzanella salad with rabbit good, but probably wouldn't order again: roasted beets would not order again: pig jowl: marinated jowl seared/crispy with over easy egg, asparagus, served on a crostini that i think i had some sort of pate on it...if you like bacon but only the fat part of bacon, you'll like this dish...but wow, its so heavy! it put me in a food coma. The jowl+pate+eggyolk was just to heavy all together would go back, prices are decent they have outdoor & indoor seating
