When my wife asked me what we were doing for lunch, I knew that pizza and beer would be an easy sell. So that softball of a pitch led us out of our usual haunts and to our first visit to Piece. Part pizzeria and part brewery. Brilliant! Build your own pizzas that were going to take some planning. That means beer first. The Top Heavy Hefeweizen for Kris and the Full Frontal Pale Ale for this exhibitionist. Both were really good and we switched them up for round two. Now for the pizza. Half spinach, garlic and olive for the lady and half sausage, garlic and banana pepper over here. We decided to forgo the lunch special deal as those looked too small for us. But they do seem quite the deal for $5. After about 15 minutes our pie arrived at our table. It was a huge baking sheet with an oddly oblong yet tasty pizza. Be sure not to burn the roof of your mouth diving in right away, as Kris did(even though I warned her). The pizza was very good thin crust. I was curious about their oven but my inquiries about what they do were met by a curt "there's the oven" from our server. How pleasant. I'm sure this place gets packed at night and is probably a hopping scene. Lots of communal tables. A few gripes for my Piece -how about some house combos instead of just build your own? -some new toppings are needed, like pancetta or proscuitto -please upgrade those canned variety olives and peppers -I'm used to round pizzas -how does a place called Piece not sell slices? You know a "piece". -what was up with that surly little waitress? Don't be shy about interacting with clients, I'm sure they'll tip better. That said, one of the best thin crust pizzas I've had in town.
