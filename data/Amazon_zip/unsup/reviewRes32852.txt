love love love! DELICIOUS reuben, firstly. also, the mac n cheese. thirdly, great margaritas, and available by the pitcher (i love me some margs). they give you a tonnnn of food, just know this.  the seating is limited; try out the "bar" seating - you still feel like it's an intimate way to dine, and can avoid the waiting list (we avoided probably a 25 minute wait by doing this). the servers are fun, the food is healthy, and there's even a bakery! what more can you ask for?
