This place is not what you would think. It is not a bistro. It is slow to serve your meal but it is fast to charge your credit card to the point that they charge you while you still are waiting for your coffee. Our waitress was without skill badly needs an education.It is influenced by neither European nor American culture. A word of advice: stay away from the owner, his manners may embarrass you, his loud laughter may make you deaf.There is no modern twist to the cuisine particularly to Mediterranean. Tip: go there if you want to pay price of the modern French restaurant and eat as a Romanian peasant in the cave.Warning: their chairs may be very dangerous for your children. We witnessed how the fallen very heavy restaurant chair almost injured the child.
