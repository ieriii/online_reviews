I've heard such great things about this place but how the heck do you get in?? Twice now I've gone for pizza and as early as 7:30-8pm there was an hour and a half wait for 2 people?? I think after people eat they stay there and sit and watch the bar area or the t.vs. They should really move their people out when their done. And the funny part about this is that I emailed them and asked what's a better time to come in for pizza, and their reply was...LUNCH TIME! great! so I work for 8-5 every day and the only way I can try this pizza is at lunch time? Why does everyone else get to enjoy a dinner there but I cant?  I think the waiting time to eat is ridiculous but I will go back and try AGAIN just to see what the hype is all about. They do have a great beer selection.
