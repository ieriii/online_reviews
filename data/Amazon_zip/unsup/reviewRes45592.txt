The interior of this place is pretty short of amazing considering surrounding locales and it's laid back atmosphere. As others mentioned there is a mini library area which would be a nice place to grab a drink or some appetizers. The low tables and loungy chairs might not be convenient for dinner setting.  Actually the only seating I would recommend for dinner are either the booths or square tables. The tall round tables with bar stool chairs are very small and I found it a bit annoying trying to make sure I wouldn't knock anything over. My friend had the chicken ceasar salad which he thought was incredibly good. I had the turkey burger on wheat bread.. which was just ok. We are going back tonight to try other things off the menu...
