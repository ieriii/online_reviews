I went here last night for a celebratory dinner with my BF. I truly enjoyed the interior and would definitely come back... for a drink on the deck. To be honest, I wouldn't come back for dinner, unless I was looking for something in that area of town. Here's the pro/con list: pros: great drinks, good decor, harvest table very satisfying. cons:  overly friendly waiters. I think I'm of the school where more is more, and I don't really want "more." I like waitstaff best when they're just a smidge above normal. I felt everyone here was on their extra-special-hard-sell toes. Which some people like, I think. It's not my cup of tea, and the hard sell leaves me less sold than skeptical. It's still better than apathy so just 1 star off for this. overly salty food. Maybe I have a less salt-friendly palate, but I just felt everything protein-wise was seasoned within an inch of its life. The harvest bar was fine though.. I was afraid to try the dessert first because I was so full, but also because I was worried dessert would be overly sweet.  So, if I do eat dinner here again, I would just do the harvest bar. 1 star off for the salt. The drinks were super. That's what I would recommend.. on a weeknight anyway. I think the weekends must get crowded, since even on a tuesday at 8pm there was a line to go onto the deck.
