A really fantastic restaurant that blew me away. If you want a great cocktail - order an Aviator. The best aviator I've had in a while, the perfect gin drink. Appetizers - the bone marrow and red onion is good, but the tartar is fantastic! A must eat... The other must eat: the Pork Shoulder is melt in your mouth amazing!
