Decent, solid Mexican food. Fresh, I wouldn't say that, just the chips seem to be. But still all ok. There's a lot of food at very cheap prices. They've got a high bar to conquer with me, though - we lived in California near tons of authentic Mexican places (and great food trucks, LOL!).  But this passes muster here for the Midwest. Visited for lunch. My dish was good - I got the beef enchiladas in mole sauce, and my usual tamarindo Jarritos. I got an horchata to go, and that was pretty good. I love tamales, but I was glad I didn't get them here - my girlfriend got that, and they were dry and not particularly tasty. The rice and beans were just ok. Don't let them sit you in the back room like they did with us, it's right next to the bathrooms, and when the doors open, that's not a pleasant smell. The service is ok, but not particularly friendly or prompt. If we were in the area again, we may consider dropping in, but this place doesn't merit a special trip.
