They have the best sauce here - sweet and tomatoey. I usually get the pan pizza here since I just can't get used to the sauce on top of the cheese. Tasty buttery crust that's not dry at all. I love their super speedy delivery too. They have daily specials, and you get a whole lot of food including soup and salad and bread. Great value and good food.
