This is not "mindblasting" as most of my friends would say, but it's pretty damn good! As my first time eating Costa Rican food, I didn't really know what to expect. One of my good friends is Costa Rican and always talks about Gallo Pino which is rice with black beans served with an egg. I did not personally order this, but a friend of mine did and I was able to try it, not bad! I ordered the steak and onion with yellow rice and tostones. This is a huge portion and should be shared with another person unless you are a big eater. The steak was flavorful and rice was amazing. Since we came on a nice warm night, wait to sit outside was 30-40 minutes! No thanks, we enjoyed a nice table inside and had a hilarious server. Unlike your conventional style of service with a proper well mannered non potty mouth server, ours was the complete opposite, yet I didn't leave feeling offended. He was fun, loud and BIG! Literally. We ordered everything he suggested, even the bread pudding for dessert, Ugh can we say 2000 calories per bite? Well worth it. I will be back and next time with my Costa Rican friend!
