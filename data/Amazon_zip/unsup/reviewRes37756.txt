fox & odel......hummmmmmmmmmm looooooooooong wait for food. i ordered the panini and my wife ordered a single pancake. after about 35 minutes MY food arrived but my wife's food was french toast. we sent it back and about 10 minutes later the single pancake arrived. the penini was great and I loved it. the single pancake slathered in all kinds of syrups and sauces wsa overly sweet; not too enjoyable. the server was usually unable to be found. and when the check came, in a haste to get out of there, i just gave the card to be swiped so we could get out of there. on the way out i found out that he still charged me the french toast ($10.99) when we ordered the single pancake ($3.99). big difference no? well they fixed everything, but will think twice about going there again. oh did i forget to mention that two other couples got there complete meals about 10 minutes after they ordered....figures.
