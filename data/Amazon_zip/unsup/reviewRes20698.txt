Four stars because I didn't have to wait! The bread was perfectly crusty on the outside but still soft and airy on the inside. Pork filling was tasty and obviously slow cooked and tender but could have used a little bit more. I am a big fan of lime in my Mexican dishes and this place is not shy about using it which I love. Just peak into their kitchen and you will see milk crates stacked to the ceiling full of limes.  The one down side to the dish was the tomato broth it came in. Just way too much salt. Such a shame since the broth was good and complex otherwise.
