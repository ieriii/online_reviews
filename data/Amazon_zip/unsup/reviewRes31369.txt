I had passed by and seen nana from a distance many times on my way to the Gamestop nearby so I figured I would give it a shot for brunch. It looks very cute and comfy from the outside. We got there around 11am and were quoted a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. Lots of couples were leaving so I figured we would get a seat quickly. 15 minutes later we were seated and I ordered the spiced apple crepes (boyfriend ordered the benecio, poached eggs over potato fritters). When my food arrived, I was kinda shocked as to how...small the portion was. It was wonderful, don't get me wrong: the caramelized apples on top were delicious and the apple butter filling was just amazing. I guess I just expected more for $8...meanwhile I tried by boyfriend's benecio and it was also pretty tasty! Kind of wished I had gotten his because it looked like it was a little bigger portion wise. Service was good considering how busy it was, food arrived quickly, seating and atmosphere were pleasant. I'd definitely recommend visiting, probably during the week.
