it is very hard to find another pizza place in town that prepares its pie in the traditional manner while still embodying all of the rich flavours from my grandmother's home in italy. i previously had stated Pizza D.O.C. as a close tie and recently tried Coal Fire as well.. if i had to rank these it would look like this: 1. Spacca Napoli 2. Pizza D.O.C. 3. Coal Fire their margherita is pretty spot on. if you are looking for an appetizer that will make your tummy smile, i suggest an order of Prosciutto e Bufala. fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil and prosciutto! it really doesn't get any better than that.  quite lovely to sit outside during the summer as well.
