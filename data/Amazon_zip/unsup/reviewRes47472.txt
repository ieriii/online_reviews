The Lockdown is a really not just a metal bar, but a rock bar for all ages. They have a great selection of the harder stuff from the 1970s through the 21st century. Really, it is nice to know that I am going to enjoy the music because they play bands I know I love (Tuesday's are my favorite). That fact, coupled with great eats makes it a place I am going to return to. I loved that this place puts out free what seemed to be fresh warm chips with some good dipping sauce to enjoy with my beer before I ordered.
