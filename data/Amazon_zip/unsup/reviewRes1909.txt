Hot Doug's has become a Chicago legend for the most delicious and creative encased meat concoctions. Hahaha. Seriously, this place is the best!!! You will find everything from the most basic hot dogs, knockwursts, polish sausages, and even corn dogs on the menu to sausages made from chicken and pork, foie gras, elk, alligator, ribeye steak. Literally, you name it and it's probably somewhere on the menu covered in smoked cheeses and/or gourmet sauces. I do recommend going during the week if possible when the line is a little shorter and definitely go before noon if it's an option. By the official lunch hour, the line is likely to run out the door and half way down the length of the building. Don't let this discourage you though because your meal will be worth it. Oh, and get the fries cooked in duck fat and then smother them in melted cheese. They're only available on Fridays and Saturdays but oh god they're good.
