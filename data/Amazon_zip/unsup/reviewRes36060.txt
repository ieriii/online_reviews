I love Meli..really really love it. Everything about their food tastes so delicious!! I always order something with their organic eggs mostly because I can actually taste the fluffy creaminess of them. Yum Yum Yum! I love their corn beef hash, which I always find myself ordering. But their sweet breakfast items are more than lip smacking! My absolute fav is their nutella crepe with fresh bananas. They're amazing! I do admit that they use a bit too much nutella, but who cares!! They're worth it. My dad who isn't a breakfast nut by any means can not get enough of their granola, which I always have to order a bag of to go. :) They prepare and make it in-house and it's the perfect mixture of granola, flax seeds, and dried fruit. I think the best I've ever tried to be honest! Meli is definitely the place to go for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. In fact, if they were open for dinner, I'd go there too. :) This location is definitely the place to be at. I was not a fan of their downtown location.
