What's there to say about the best meal of one's life, except...I'd gladly endure 20-below winters and 90-years of baseball misery if it meant I could dine at Alinea on a regular basis. As a New Yorker, that's impossible unfortunately... 1 pillow, 5 hours, 7 servers, 10 MoMA-worthy presentations, 23 courses, 35 OMG moments, 48 new flavor combinations, and hundreds of dollars later, I was on a such a high that I tipped the maitre d $40 for remembering our coats. Sigh. Life is all downhill from this moment on.  What, the Yankees won another World Series? Who cares....
