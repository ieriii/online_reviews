I really enjoyed everything here... Location--right off the brown line(teehee) Service--awesome, great waiter, friendly, enthusiastic and honest Food--great choices, yummy, seafood and a general diner food list BYO--nuff said, they give you an ice bucket too! Meal: Shrimp in cheese appetizer with bread--orgasmic Some sort of whitefish with awesomely seasoned vegetables I left feeling satisfied, but not overly stuffed! Cozy atmosphere, be prepared to wait without a reservation :)
