How can you people be okay with charging 42.00 a night for valet parking when the room was only 149.00 - That's just straight up mean. Anyways. Besides the stupid parking fees, I was pleasantly pleased with this hotel. For the price it's actually pretty great. We upgraded (for 50 bucks) to a megasuite which is about 5 times bigger than my San Francisco apartment. It had three flat panel TV's, one of which was in the bathroom. Classy. Make sure you get one of the renovated rooms. They're pretty. I'd stay here again, just not in the middle of winter when the temperature is oh 10 degrees. It's not the hotel's fault, but what is that!
