Garcia's is where we usually end up after Huetenbar closes. This place has been recently remodeled and now is much bigger, however food is much worse in terms of taste and quality. We were there this Friday and I had 1/2 chicken burrito some chips and guacamole. Burrito was less than tasty, guacamole were ok. However at least three people that were there with us, including me had their ass glued to the toilet for hours as result of the dinner. Not sure exactly which ingredient was the culprit (we are suspecting guacamole or chips since we all ate those) but we are all scared to go back. Shame, since it was so convenient, that's the only Mexican place in the neighborhood that we know of that stays open that late. Lady that served us, however was very nice, star added for that.
