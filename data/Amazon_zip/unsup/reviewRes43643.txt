A very average steakhouse near the Merchandise Mart. There's nothing wrong with the food, but there's nothing spectacular about it either. The waitstaff sometimes has a bit of a chip on its shoulder that makes the experience unappealing. It's rarely difficult to get a table here, particularly for lunch, but there are better options nearby.
