Yessss! This place is wonderful. It has a very mellow, sophisticated vibe that the bf and I thoroughly enjoyed. The pork and duck liver was deelicious, as was the brussel sprouts (v. deeeelicious) and the paris mushroom/truffle pasta. The chandelier in the back is amazing, I want it for my bedroom. Actually, I love the entire interior space: candy drum pendant lights, dark woods, intimate seating areas. This place is a hit!!
