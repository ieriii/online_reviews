Here's the deal. Best beer I have had since moving from Oregon. These brewmasters know how to make a perfectly crafted pale ale. The food is plentyful and filling. This place is just near perfect. I am a big fan of the atmosphere- great seating, fantastic wrap around bar- old timey. Very cool. I can't wait to go back. You've just been yelped in.
