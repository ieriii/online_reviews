This is always on my To Eat places when I'm in Chicago. They have excellent service, the atmosphere is great, and the food is BOMB dot com! :) Since I'm not from Chicago, my friend and I ordered a bunch of things from their menu. This is what we ordered for dinner: -hand cut spicy tuna and jalapeo...this should be censored, it's so good! -lemongrass beef lollipops...melt-in-your-mouth goodness! -adobo braised pork belly...dee-lish!!! -malay style chilean seabass... sexy seafood goodness! -mango flavored iced tea... you control how much flavor you want -[taro] bread pudding... Mmmm! Everything was so good!!! The best meal I ever had in Chicago! Oh, and the best part was: we complimented the chef (in person) and he took a shot with me and my friend! So friendly and so cute! :)
