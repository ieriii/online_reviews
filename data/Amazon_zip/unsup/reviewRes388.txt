Okay, I'm editing my review because I've realized that my previous post didn't do Alinea justice. Let's start at the beginning: About three years ago, my husband (then boyfriend) treated his parents and I to Alinea. He kept talking about this restaurant that was difficult to get reservations for, and was excited that we had somehow gotten lucky enough to secure a spot on a Friday night. I didn't pay too much attention to him, just figured that we were going to what was probably going to be a nice dinner. Even the fact that I knew beforehand that we were in for a 24 course extravaganza, which I hadn't ever heard of before, couldn't have prepared me in the slightest for the experience we were about to have. God, I had no idea back then. Anyhow, we arrive at the restaurant and have a seat near the window. We decide on the 24 course dinner with the wine pairing. The waiter brought us some perfectly wonderful and delicious bread, and my first instinct is to devour it until our server friend wisely advises us against this, telling us that if we skip anything, it's going to have to be the bread. Long story short, 24 courses and (I kid you not) a few tears of joy later, my life is forever changed. I have married my boyfriend, and we have tried to live more humbly in order to save up for experiences like the one we had at Alinea. We travel around the country, and indeed the world in search of the most amazing culinary experiences, ones that make you close your eyes and bury your face in your hands in utter and sublime disbelief. Pregnancy has put a bit of a hold on our adventures, but after the baby is born we are planning on perhaps celebrating back at Alinea, though we admit to feeling a bit nervous, as we don't know how our next experience can possibly top the last.
