We went to this restaurant last october on my birthday. The ambience, music & people were lively & rocking. Though we are vegetarian, we had lotta options her.We started off with the 3 cheese platter, Mixto which was deliciously satiating & feast for the gastric senses & a visual treat for the eyes. we then had the patatas bravas which were spicy potato with spicy paprika Aioli. You can keep on eating them without a pause. we ordered one more plate towards the end. we then ordered the Arroz con morels, bomba rice with aspharagus, lemon & morel mushrooms. The restaurant is a bit expensive considering the small plates, but as they say, good things come in small packages !!! Lovely food, Lovely music, Lovely experience & a perfect place to celebrate the perfect day !!!!
