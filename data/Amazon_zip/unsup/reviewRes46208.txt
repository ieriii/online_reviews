wow what a surprise. I was there for a meeting with 45 other people. It was before the air and water show and the place was packed. We had a reserved room and waited in the bar for appetizers, which never came...opps was this a warning of what was to come for dinner? Dinner was wonderful, service outstanding...We had a great time, but in living in chicago all my life i have never seen so many people waiting for a table...At least 100 waiting,,,,,crazy. go there, just be real patient
