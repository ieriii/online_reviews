The service was FANTASTIC! My family and I just went there tonight. The restaurant has a kids/family and adult side, we sat on the adult side. Unlike other restaurants that seat their guests right next to each other when the rest of the restaurant is free, this restaurant seated guests at a perfect distance, so each of the parties weren't talking over one another. The food was filling and hit the spot. I ordered a crab cake dish the crab cakes were 90% crab and 10% filler with lemon butter sauce + 2 sides chosen (mashed yams and mac & cheese) for $12.50 + we got delicious cornbread. The jambalaya was a little spicy and was ~$8.75, the BBQ platter was $11.95. Everything was delicious. On top of that, the waitress was super nice. She gave us the right amount of attention without seeming overbearing. She knew what food to recommend, and seemed more genuine about her recommendations than other places I've been. I would come back because of the food and service, but maybe the more centrally located restaurant.
