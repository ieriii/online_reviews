I'm not designed to be able to resist a burger topped with pulled pork. So you can imagine my delight/dilemma when faced with this fantasty creation right there on the menu at Revolution Brewing Co. (yes, I said, "fantasty") Around the table we tried all sorts of stuff; bacon fat popcorn (I get the well from which this idea sprung, but the actualization doesn't quite deliver, especially for $4), duck comfite pizza (duck, schmuck, whatevs), sweet potato cakes (score!) The aforementioned Smokehouse burger didn't disappoint... hell, I think I even dreamed about it last night. Loved the blue cheese potato salad, although it was almost more like eating blue cheese sauce than any resemblance to actual potato salad. Obviously not that that's necessarily a BAD thing, but just sayin'... The decor is simple but strong, as a good revolution should be (although I must give props to the "revolution fist" columns supporting the upper part of the bar--an excellent touch), and the forward-thinking waiting area was a comfortable spot to hang out and sample a few of their brews until our booth was ready. Big thumbs up to the Black Power Oatmeal Stout and the Willie (a Scottish wee heavy ale, the likes of which I havnae had since I were in the Motherland hersel') I really want another Smokehouse now.
