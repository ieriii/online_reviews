A good neighborhood hotel. El stop not far. My small room was in the fun, kitschy motor inn. The bathroom is super-cramped. The walls are thin, which means I could hear the conversations of my next-door neighbor (which means they could hear mine). Yet somehow I didn't mind these negatives. Good access to other points of Chicagoland.  Don't come here looking for luxury. But it's clean, safe, and quirky. There is a decent amount of free parking, too.
