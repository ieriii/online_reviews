Xoco definitely did not disappoint! My friend and I split the Ahodaga, chips & salsa, churros, and mexican hot chocolate and each of us only ended up paying around $10. Sweet deal. When you arrive at the restaurant, there will most likely be a line. We only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Friday afternoon, and one of the employees at Xoco will tell you the wait time right when you get in line, as if you were waiting in line at Disneyworld or something. As for the food.... I would definitely recommend trying the ahodaga tortas. I'm a big fan of any sandwich that's meant to be dipped and it was excellent and big enough to share. My only complaint is that we were given our churros & hot chocolate right away, so by the time we wanted to eat them (after our meal, as a dessert) they were both cold. Not sure how they could improve on their system to accommodate those who want to eat their churros and hot chocolate AFTER the meal, but alas... The best part of the meal is that Rick Bayless was there that day helping out and was nice enough to let us take a picture with him (I know, we're nerds.) I'm definitely going back to Xoco to try the dinner menu and highly recommend it for lunch!
