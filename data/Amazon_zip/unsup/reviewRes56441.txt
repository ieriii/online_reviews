I created a Yelp account just so I could comment on this place. The food is pretty good, the decor is nothing to write home about and the location/parking for this place...meh. But the reason I love this place so much is because of the owner. He is perhaps the sweetest man I have ever met. He always welcomes you into his establishment with a smile and you can't help but be in a good mood when you leave. I support this restaurant because it is in my neighborhood and they have been going through some rough financial times (there is a great tear-jerking article about this place in Time Out Chicago). I believe supporting businesses that continually go above and beyond - these are the nicest people and the food is good, so I try and go once a week.Now for the food...the curry is flavorful - I recommend the Clay Pot Chicken and the Roasted Duck Curry. I usually get one of those two when I order, but I must admit I have only lived nearby for a few months. But try the watermelon smoothie when you go (no bubble tea). I can't eat there without getting one.Please try this place. You will not be let down. And say hey to the owner for me.
