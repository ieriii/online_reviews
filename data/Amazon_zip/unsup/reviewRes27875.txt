Walk into the bar - order a Topolo Margarita and steal a seat in the bar seating area. Get a few apps and have one or two more Topolo's and life is fantastic. Rick Bayless (Chef and Owner) is Mexican gourmet + real tradition flavor King. This isn't a restaurant or an idea - this is a way of life for this man - his passion and love for the culture burns straight into you and your hooked forever. After coming here for 15+ years, I have grown into not eating the entrees much and just diving in for the variety of the apps - feel cheated to be stuck with one entrees :)
