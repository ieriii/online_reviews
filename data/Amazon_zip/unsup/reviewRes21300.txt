Superdawg must be owned by the Miami Heat....it is SO OVERRATED!!! While I'll admit that the actual hot dog, or should I saw "dawg", is pretty good, I'm baffled at the amount of attention this place gets. It's crazy what a giant hot dog superhero on top of your place can do for business. Here is what I didn't like: --the hot dog is NOT a Chicago dog. A Chicago Dog has sliced RED tomatoes and celery salt, a Superdawg has pickled green tomatoes and NO celery salt--not even close to the same. It actually angered me that so many tourists are trying this place thinking they are getting a "real" Chicago Dog, when they are NOT.  --The fries were absolutely disgusting. I don't know what it was, but they had no flavor, they weren't crispy...just blah. On top of that, I ordered a side cup of cheese, for $1.25....yea a cup of cheese FOR FREAKIN' $1.25, and it was just pasty and tasteless glue. Which leads me to my next point... --The price of the food is ridiculous. A hot dog, maybe 10-15 fries, a cup of cheese and a 10 oz pop for OVER $8. There are literally HUNDREDS of places throughout the Chicagoland area where you can get 2 dogs, fries and a drink for just over $5. Oh yea, and it's cash only--and remember to tip your car hop... What can I say, I guess the super hero hot dog is pretty sweet, I just wish the food lived up...
