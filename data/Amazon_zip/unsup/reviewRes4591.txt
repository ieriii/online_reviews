SOLID FOOD!!!!! The Purple Pig has excellent Foie gras, pork sweet breads and pork shoulder. My boyfriend and I ordered these things before heading out to O'Hare and were impressed by the swift delivery of the food, the execution of how tasty everything was, and the reasonable price. Foie gras - as Califorinians, we needed to get our fix before heading back to the coast. The spread was so delicious, especially with the jam they put with it (Membrillo). Also, they offered extra bread when we quickly finished ours! What a plus! Pork Sweet breads - damn, this was delicious. They tasted like thinly fried pork nuggets. They weren't overfried like chicken nuggets are, but were instead panfried very lightly so we didn't feel disgusting afterwards. My only complaint is that I wish they served just a little more pork. I wanted more! Flavor was delish! Pork Shoudler - sooooooo tender. Melt in your mouth, dripping with sauce, and sitting happily on top of mashed potatoes. This dish was not my favorite but was still great nonetheless. The service kept checking in on us too. I appreciated that - especially since we mentioned we were in a rush to catch our flight. This place also seems like a great spot to go if you need lunch shopping at Magnificent Mile, or a great way to start off a Friday night.
