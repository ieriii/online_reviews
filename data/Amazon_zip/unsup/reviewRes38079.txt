When I told people that I was stopping in Chicago for the night while on my road trip, I was told to make sure I ate a deep dish pizza. I have never had a deep dish pizza, let alone see one in person, so I was intrigued. Giordano's was one of the places that was suggested so I thought I would check it out since I was in the neighborhood. The place was packed, people waiting outside and at the bar inside. I was told it would be a 45 minute wait but I could order my pizza while I waited so that I wouldn't have to wait so long once I got my table. I thought this idea was genius because I was already pretty hungry was wondering if I should go somewhere else where the wait wasn't so long. I'm glad I stayed. After a few drinks, we got our table where the waitress took our order for bread sticks and the Greek salad. The atmosphere was great. There was all sorts of photos of famous people from Chicago and the place was still pretty popping. Our Greek salad was tasty. Nice creamy feta and real anchovies on top too. Our pizza arrived not too long after. We ordered the special which had sausage, onions, green peppers and pepperoni. I thought it was amazing! The crust didn't taste like the regular pizza crust I was used to. It had a different texture too. I like how it was still cheese in the middle but wasn't soggy and actually held it's shape when it was on my plate, like a piece of pie. We ordered the 10-in and that seemed to be perfect size for three people, especially if you get bread sticks and salad before. I can't wait to visit Chicago again so I can try other types of deep dish pizza!
