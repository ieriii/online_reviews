Amazing Amazing Amazing! Wow. Highly Impressed. It's like all the top chef's in the world got together and created this excellent menu. As an appetizer, we had the "Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers and Pistachios." It was probably one of the best and most flavorful dishes I've ever had. As my entree, I had the "Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes" after reading tons of positive reviews and was far from disappointed. It was tender to perfection. Seems to be one of the most popular dishes. I wanted to try everything on the menu! I saw someone next to us having the "Eggplant Parmesean Balls" which looked delicious. So why give this place a 4 star and not a 5? We waited almost 45 minutes for our food and it came at different intervals. I was done with my meal and someone in our group hadn't even gotten their dish yet. Also, someone in our our group ordered the "Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki". I tried the chicken and it was drenched in grease and was flavorless. I don't blame them though, this place specializes in 'Swine and Wine' not chicken and personally I don't think people should order chicken at restaurants. That's just me though. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! MUST TRY!
