Rick Bayless?! He's here?! WHERE! Yep, that's right, I saw the back of Rick Bayless' head. Ha.. Simple menu, sophisticated food. The ahogada ($10, dine-in only) is my absolute favorite. A torta sitting in tomato broth? Doesn't get much better than that. For $6 I wish they would give you more than a spoonful of guac, but it's Bayless' guac, so you're allowed to price it like that... right? I WISH I could give this place 5 stars, but overfried churros? Really?! Xoco, you broke my heart. Maybe the cook was just as excited to see Bayless as I was and took his eyes off my churros for a split second. If that was the case, I forgive you.
