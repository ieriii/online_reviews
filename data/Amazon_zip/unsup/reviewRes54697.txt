Went for our 15th anniversary, had ressies for 8, showed up at 7, checked in and had a drink and apps at the bar, Bartender was AWESOME!!!!! Oysters were very fresh and shucked well, only MINOR quibble, were not told what the individual oysters were. Were seated promptly at 8, had a wonderful time, stone crab claws were sweet and delish, had a lovely Argyle Pinot, my hubby the red grouper, he devoured it, was tasty! I had the grilled halibut, was outstanding!! English peas, pearl onions, bacon and a YUMMY pea broth, that had a nice lemony flavor, also had an order of broccoli with a cheddar/Brie sauce! WOW! The best. We wanted dessert, but still had some nice wine to enjoy and we were both satisfied. Our server Jean(sp?) was a great server! She was attentive and not invasive and very friendly! Great service, great restaurant!!! Every employee we came across was friendly and nice, a server actually stopped my hubby when he came out of restroom and told him he had t.p. on his shoe and removed it for him! Really? :) Also as we bellied up to the bar at the 1 empty seat, about 5 minutes later the bartender came out from behind bar and gave my hubby an extra seat! All in all, really enjoyed the entire evening!!!!! Thank you Shaw's for a very enjoyable 15th anniversary!
