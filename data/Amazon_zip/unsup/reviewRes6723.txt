We live in the area and really liked this restaurant so we went back with a total of 6 people. We knew that it booked early and that they didn't take reservations so we had our friends meet us at 6:00 p.m. this past Saturday.  Long story short it was a 90 minute wait. No food is worth that so we got in at La Luce and had a fabulous dinner. We are not going back to Davanti Enoteca until they take reservations.....
