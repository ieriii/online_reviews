"Why does the crab in the California Roll look funny?" "Oh. That's because it's real crab and not crab stick..." Yep, Sushi X uses REAL crab in its California Rolls (and do not judge me because I enjoy a California Roll...they are a good simple roll that is hard to screw up.) Delish. In fact, Sushi X was our delivery diva through and through. Miso soup was piping hot. So piping hot, it turned into a miso dessert. Hey, I'm down with that. Who likes her soup cold? Not this girl. Two thumbs up. Nice big chunks of miso too. Edamame was well-portioned and hot. Spicy tuna was average, but not bad at all. And appropriately temped. You'd think with all the hot, hot, hot food we had going on the sushi might not be so cool. You'd think wrong. Sushi X does sushi delivery right, keeping the hot foods seriously hot and the cool food (like the raw stuff) cool and perfectly preserved in its darling little to go packaging. Sushi X is a Sushi do for delivery.
