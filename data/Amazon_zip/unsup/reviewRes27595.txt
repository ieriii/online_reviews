Had the 5 course tasting menu. They just started this summer menu this week.  - As usual, there's the deconstructed caesar salad and I loved the Spanish anchovy that comes with it. Beautiful presentation.  - Creamy corn bisque with lobster bits plus a vanilla marshmallow. Loved how they poured my soup using a beaker. That was the highlight of our meal.  - Halibut served with very fresh, finely chopped haricort vert with a leek brandade. The halibut is good but I would have preferred it to be more tender.  - Bison loin served with pea sauce, texas onion ring and a spicy sauce; it was my least favorite course as the bison was a bit tough. It just didn't feel special or I call it a typical Bobby Flay dish.   - Then we each had their foie gras mousse lollipop sprinkled with rock salt and strawberry (or watermelon??) pop rock. That was very delicious and well worth $5 each. - Flourless chocolate cake topped with root beer gelatin, cherries cooked in port,, rootbeer ice cream and some port sauce. I don't like root beer but that was amazing when combined together. Chef uses sassafras(?) which is the leaves that gives root beer taste to make this dish. Great service from our server and everyone who brought and explained our dishes. Nice touch on giving you a printed menu for you to take home.
