First spot we went to in Chi-town... Food wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. It was just...A-OK. The decor was really cool and our server was kinda awesome...hence the three stars. We told him we needed to catch a show and he delivered fast, friendly service. Next time...I'll have to try the Ropa Vieja. Everyone seems to be writing about it on yelp.
