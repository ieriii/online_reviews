Good stuff here. I would venture to say this place is a better deal than the little storefronts they have inside the Super H Mart. You get more food and it's cheaper. And you can add fries to your meal...i think someone is after my own heart! For my meal I had the bulgogi on a bed of rice and scallions (i think it's called the seoul steak bowl). Very flavorful and wonderfully greasy for only 7 bucks, add 2 more dollars for fries and a drink. I also sampled the large chicken wings and also found them quite tasty. I'll have to try the bulgogi burrito next time as some stranger next to me was eating it and i kinda creeped him out by leering at said burrito a little too much. Service was excellent as well. Nice, friendly people.
