not going to hurt this family restaurant by speaking the truth (most ratings in the area). ok so the good: beans, chips & salsa they serve you as you get there, tacos too ... were ok but this place seems to have outgrown it's roots due to crowd of people that passes through it now. they have to cook more & fast. & unfortunately it shows. one of the toughest stakes i had in chicago, if not life. still tasty but won't be calling my name anytime soon. guack ... seems to be straight from costco & ... i had to ask 3 staff members before i received a confirmation that this is indeed BYOB
