The location was great and the rooms were fine; the bathroom was great in fact. In terms of customer service, however, it failed miserably for me and my students. I was there with 6 students of mine for a field trip to visit art museums. So as a group, we checked out 5 rooms. First of all, the hotel had a $75 authorization charge per night per room which I never had to deal with before, and it was something the hotel didn't inform us about when booking the room. For some of the students, depending on the bank, the funds will not be released for 3-5 business days. Problems: 1. When checking out, the bill that was slipped under the door noted that I had stayed there for one night (which was wrong since I had stayed there for two nights) and that I owed them for that night. Again, not true since the room was paid in full in advance. 2. The day after we arrive back home, a student of mine notifies me that her bank account had a $368 dollar charge from the hotel. First of all, it was only supposed to have been a $150 authorization. So when I called the hotel, I was informed that it was a mistake and they have no idea why the person checking her in did that. !!!?? How do you not know how to type in 150 and instead type in 368? So that is 200 dollars that this student won't have access to immediately, not to say she already had 150 dollars that she wouldn't have had access to. Pretty bad.
