Outstanding! This is the only place I know of where I can get a true Chicago-style deep dish pizza that is vegan (their crust is vegan, so you just have to order it without cheese). My wife (who does not eat vegan) got her pizza with green peppers and sausage (and cheese of course) and said "this is the best Chicago-style pizza I've ever eaten!" It was *very* kid-friendly and the staff was great. We will *definitely* be eating here again!
