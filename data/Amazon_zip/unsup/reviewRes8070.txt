Oh man, if you like meat, and you're a meat-lover, then this is the place that will really let you indulge your two great passions. You know what's good here? THE MEAT, IDIOT. Also the cheese bread and fried polenta. I've been trying for years to figure out how to make fried polenta. Their: light and crispy. Mine: hard like plastic. Face it, as long as you're there, you really do owe yourself a Caipirinha or three. And the Papaya Dream dessert, papaya custard drizzled with raspberry liquor. I can't give it five stars because it's the only churrascuria I've been to round these parts, and because you can't get out of here without throwing down half a c-note minimum. I'm told the salad bar is good, by the idiots who have used it.
