One of the best meals I have had in a long time. We got two apps, guacamole-smooth and creamy and coconut shrimp-super flavorful and so tasty. I got the Bistec al la Cubana- my steak had so much flavor. The rice/black beans/plantains was phenomenal. My husband got the Ropa Vieja and loved it. Mojitos were great as well, overall a wonderful dinner with tons of flavor, would highly recommend this restaurant!
