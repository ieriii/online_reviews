I visited Wilde's on a Tuesday night and was seated at a small table in a crowded area surronded by a noisy family. I ordered Shephard's Pie with a lemonade. The waitress ignored my request for a few orange slices to be brought with the drink. The food was tasteless and didn't have much meat in the pie, mostly gravy and overcooked small vegetables.I was told that there would be a charge for a refill of the soft drink. I could understand if the lemonade was freshly squeezed, but really at $3.00 for an instant drink...unacceptable. When the waitress brought the check (which was over $15 for such a small meal), she asked if I wanted change from a $20, why was she deserving of a 25+% tip?I will NEVER return to this establishment!
