The presentation of food at TRU is absolutely spectacular -and the Sommelier is a MASTER at wine pairings!  I found the ambiance to be a 'bit' stuffy at times - like people are afraid to laugh.....I enjoy adult eating - but to truly enjoy everything on my plate, it helps to see a few smiles. :0) The one issue I had was....a few things were too salty. Especially the Veal Consume dish we had. However, the Vin Santo might be one of my top 10 wines of all time. It is obvious that most people going to Tru are going there for the name and the "I am so awesome I went to Tru" thing....but I didn't feel like most of the people were there to enjoy the food....just to be snobby about the food. I enjoyed most of it - loved all the wines - and had a great time. By the way - I did laugh out loud - HA! :0)
