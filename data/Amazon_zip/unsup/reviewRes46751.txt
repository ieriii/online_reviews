Pros: Cozy neighborhood burger tavern. Been there since the early 70s. Fair beer selection, decent burgers. Cons: Someone said in their review that the walls need a good pressure washing. Right on! The decor has been the same since the 70s and you leave smelling like stale, fried grease. Ugh.  The burgers, which they claim as a specialty, are decent but not great.  Just a fair place and a nice one to duck into in the neighborhood.
