I think everyone should eat more fish so that is why I gave it two stars. Aside from that I was very disappointed in the food. The crabcakes were mushy and not meaty at all. they actually stretched the truth saying they are like maryland cakes. I had pre made cakes at dirks and they were just as good. Swordfish was small portion and overcooked. Most of what I ate was overcooked. Really just go to bob chins if you cannot cook your own fish. Oh and lest I forget the soup was lukewarm and super thick cheap tasting.  Very sad 100 bucks worth of food. I am a seafood expert and junkie and this was just not seafood well executed. Dont do it.
