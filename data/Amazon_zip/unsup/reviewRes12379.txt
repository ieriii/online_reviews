After hearing nothing but amazing feedback about Piece, my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We walked in on a Wednesday night and the wait was about 45 minutes- which we were a little bit surprised about, but waited nonetheless. We don't go to Wicker Park too often, so it was nice to walk around and check the area out while we waited. After getting seated, we had a couple of beers and decided to be extravagant and order a crazy pizza. We ordered BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes, meatballs, and garlic. It was delicious! The best part was that we had tons of left overs (there were two of us and we ordered a medium). I'll definitely be back! I saw on their menu that they have a pretty good lunch deal where you can get a personal pizza for like 6 or 7 bucks, I plan to check that out too! Must try this place...
