This place is hands down my favorite restaurant ever. I'll be going here on Sunday for graduation again (Masters degree thank you very much) and I'm excited just thinking about it. First of all, the food. Everything is always fresh. The Saganaki never fails (I always eat it with extra lemon), the Taramosalata (Greek cavier) is always creamy and subtle, the Tzatziki sauce has the perfect flavor, the pita bread is always fresh and dry, never greasy/soggy. The gyros are seasoned and cooked perfectly (the reason I stopped being a 5-yr vegetarian I swear), the salmon dish is huge and cooked perfectly. The Avgolemono soup has a nice creamy flavor, very authentic. The wine list is amazing, ask server for recs. The Greek salad has tons of fresh Feta and Kalamata olives. The spinach side dish with tomato sauce is so good and inexpensive. I need to try the kabobs again. Second: the price. Considering the quality of food and overall experience of the place, the prices are super reasonable. Gyros are about $11.99, all the appetizers are about $5 or less. We always order family style so it's not as much. Third, the restaurant itself is very spacious, many different rooms, the decor is so festive/fun, yet classy, the service is always friendly, food always comes out quickly, lots of diversity, casual dress is cool, the line can be long sometimes but the free valet makes up for it. This place is a must-go in Chicago!
