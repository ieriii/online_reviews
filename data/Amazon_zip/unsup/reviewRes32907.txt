I had been to Sunda a few weeks ago for a late-night drink and really enjoyed the hip vibe. Went back for dinner with my wife and while we loved the atmosphere, the food did not live up to our expectations. Very average sushi. The pieces were small and while fresh, just very average. She started with the seaweed salad, very good and their soft-shell crab and tuna of two tails was good, just not worth all the hype and expense. I may be back to Sunda but probably just for a drink and/or appetizer in the bar.
