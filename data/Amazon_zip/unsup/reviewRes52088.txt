Went a couple of years ago. Was really impressed. This place was excellent. Best deep dish I had. Crust was a little weird, and inside is kind of eclectically dumpy. Service wasn't great, and a serious tourist trap, but I really enjoyed it. My main investor loves this place, and I had to agree. Except for crust, hands down the best pizza place.
