During my graduate study years, I ate at M & H at least once a week. My all time fav was Smoked Salmon on everything bagel and crabcake sandwich. I went back this morning and was extremely disappointed. The cucumbers were frozen; the capers and red onion had miniaturized. Plus, the portion of salmon got smaller and it didn't taste fresh. My friend had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a piece of cranberry orange cake. The scrambled eggs tasted too watery and the bacon strips were thin and small, as if they were a generic brand from Jewel. I can't believe I drove 20+ miles to eat there. This place doesn't deserve even one star.
