I had been hoping for a chance to dine at this restaurant since I first saw Rick Bayless on Top Chef. I felt a little nervous bringing my friend and her Mexican mother to a trendy Mexican restaurant, but we were all pleasantly surprised. My friend's mom thought that all the food was very authentic and I loved the food as well. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that we got there at 11:05AM and had a 20 minute wait before ordering. But the food was definitely worth the wait!
