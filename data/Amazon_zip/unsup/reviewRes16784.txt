Pleasant server - check Smooth, spicy, flavorful guac with crispy homemade chips - check. Tasty raspberry mojito - check Delicious chicken empanada - check Great steak thingy - check Delicous desserts - check Overall this place is consistently good. Been to a couple of lunches and work events here and its been really good all around. I'm always surprised that its not that busy for lunch, but I'm not complaining because we can always get in! Enjoy!
