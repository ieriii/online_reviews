Stopped in to meet my brother, SIL, and niece for a quick bite before the game. They were already seated and had ordered by the time I got there. (Not my fault, my bro called me when they were parking- I cannot transport myself 5 miles in the blink of an eye, especially on a cubs game day!) I opted not to order- I wanted to get to the game ASAP. Instead, I got to nibble off their plates. The ravioli was cheesy. It had a nice and mellow vodka type sauce- not too red (I appreciate that). My sister in law ordered a flat bread pizza with fontina cheese and mushrooms. It was great. The combination of flavors and textures really popped in my mouth! (my niece, being 4, did not like it, it was too crunchy for her, but she was holding out for game food). Service was handy but not hovering. They were great with my niece too! They were a bit slow on the refills, but hey, no complaints!  My experience yesterday is pretty much parallel to the ones I have had here in the past. Solid food, good service.
