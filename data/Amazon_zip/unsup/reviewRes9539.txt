I can't help but feel a little weird inside Le Colonial. Are we reminiscing about French-occupied Vietnam? It's a little weird. HOWEVA, the atmosphere was really nice, I have to admit. We dined on the lower level, which is more of a formal dining space. The upstairs is a bit more lounge-like, with louder music and a bit more buzz. Both floors serve the same menu. For starters, we ordered the tuna tartare, which was in a ginger soy sauce and came with pieces of fried wonton. This was so good, and easily the highlight of our meal. The fish absolutely melted in my mouth. For my main dish, I ordered the trout, which was first grilled, then steamed in a banana leaf with vermicelli noodles and mushrooms, and came with a side of coconut curry. My trout was over cooked and rather dry, so I needed the curry sauce doused over everything in order to add some moisture. The fish itself was a bit of a letdown, but the flavors were really good. I loved the mushrooms and the noodles, and the curry had just a bit of spice to it. They also brought out some rice for all of us to share, but I didn't really need it since I had noodles with mine. We were too stuffed for dessert, so I had an espresso instead. They serve Illy here (at least according to the little espresso cup they do), and it comes with a small piece of chocolate, which was a great way to end the meal. If it weren't for the dry trout, this would have been a nearly perfect experience. The service was top notch, as one would expect at a place like this. Our wine glasses were kept full until we finished our bottle, and the minute I took a little sip of my water, someone was over to refill it. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and was able to make suggestions to us. 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.
