Wilde is a great addition to Broadway. It's absolutely beautiful inside. Kathryn did a great job describing the place.  The library would be a great date spot. It's super cozy and romantic. I had the meatloaf for dinner, and it was yummy. My friend had the bangers and mash. She would have enjoyed it more if I would have stopped giggling over the name. Come on! Bangers and mash sounds dirty! Anyway, the place is really nice, and I don't think you'll be sorry if you check it out. I did take off one star for the amount of babies in the joint. I counted ten of them! It's a bar not Applebees! I'm sure they clear out later in the night, so don't let the babies keep you away.
