Good/ bad: pretty friendly staff. However, at one point in time the waiter came over to our table, and the table next to ours, apparently in search of something? She never gave us a proper explanation....she just kind of bent over and looked under our tables. Awkward? Yeah, just a tad. The sushi is pretty good, but I've had better. It's a bit crowded and loud. The chairs are unbelievably comfortable!
