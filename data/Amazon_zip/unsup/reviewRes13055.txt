My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on Sunday to redeem a Groupon I bought a few months ago. I really liked the atmosphere and the way they chose to decorate the space. The mojitos are yummy and pretty reasonably priced ($8.50). I LOVED the halibut but the Ropa Vieja reminded me of pot roast. I thought the beans and rice that came with it were too bland - ask for their house made hot sauce. I'm glad I tried Cafe 28 and will definitely be back. The service was very good and the experience was enjoyable!
