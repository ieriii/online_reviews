We did a three course, prix fixe lunch during restaurant week. Shrimp flautasappetizer, pork in red mole and tres leches cake were all amazing. Couldn't finish it all and it was $22 for everything! The mole here is what you're coming for. Order something with mole. Doesn't matter what. It will be good.
