Yummy food for someone who doesn't particularly like sushi. I went here for a friend's birthday. Our group of 15 was seated at a nice large table with plenty of room for all of the dishes we ordered. The wait staff was attentive but didn't really give many suggestions when we asked what was really good on the menu. As someone who was is not particularly fond of sushi, the menu had plenty of choices to pick from. The shaking beef was very tasty, and the roasted brussel sprout salad special was flavorful and big enough to share. Everyone in our group that ordered sushi was pleased with their choices. We ordered the mochi dessert, and there were plenty of pieces to share and dipping sauces. The prices were a little high, but definitely worth it for a special occasion
