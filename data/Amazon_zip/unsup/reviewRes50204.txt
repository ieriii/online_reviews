I really like this place - the menu is definitely a comfort food lovers fantasy. The burgers, sandwiches, and assortment of different types of fries are fantastic...but i'd have to say my favorite is the wings - they are just so big and juicy, soooo delicious. the drinks are alright - the last time i got some house special it came in a plastic sippy cup type deal which was interesting....but the taste reminded me of a cross between 5th grade and mcdonalds hi-c orange...which i may or may not like. all in all a great place to hang out. definitely worth a go.
