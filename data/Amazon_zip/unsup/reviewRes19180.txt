It was a cold and rainy day. After a long visit at the Art Institute, I was looking (a) for greater respite from the cold and wet, and (b) for a great place to eat. This place was great for both. Our server was really friendly and put up with my endless questions about his preferences, and even gave me one of the better recommendations I've ever gotten -- "I usually hate mushrooms, but [this dish] was really good!" He could have been full of it, but I ended up ordering the Roasted Woodland Mushroom Sandwich and a bowl of...I think Carrot Ginger soup, and my friend and I shared a side of cheesy potatoes ("Crisp Potatoes, Brie"). I don't remember the soup being all that great, but the sandwich was really good -- I basically inhaled it. And the cheesy potatoes were... mmmmmmm. How can you go wrong with that combo? I will warn you, though, the place is a little on the fancier side. I don't know that my wet umbrella and endless layers quite met up with their more white-tablecloth standards, but they were really nice about everything and mostly treated us well (I vaguely remember fairly long wait times...) I'd go back :)
