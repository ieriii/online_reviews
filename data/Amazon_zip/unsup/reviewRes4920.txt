Wow, what a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon! Our wine and beer was excellent and there was a unique selection of small plates on the menu. Everything we ordered was full of great flavors. We cleaned each plate. Our server was attentive and knew his wines and food. table favorites: Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios (they ran out of the fried deviled eggs- heard they were awesome) Now I know why it is so hard to get a table at this place.
