As much as i love Frontera Grill, the rating has nothing to do with the food, because the food is phenomenal. What dropped it down to 2 stars is the service we received. I went to meet my family at the bar since they were still waiting for a table, we decided just to order and eat there. They had already ordered their appetizers, Our server/bartender RICARDO was extremely annoyed by taking my and their orders for the food. It might have been me but he seemed extra jolly with everyone else but us. Also note i work in the restaurant field, I've been a waitress since i was 15 so this was just uncalled for. We were not being annoying or rude and even if a customer is its his job to have a smile! When we got ready to pay we gave him cash which almost covered the whole bill plus a credit card to charge 40 dollars. He charged the credit card the whole bill!!!!! Then i said very upset, you charged my card the whole bill its suppose to only be 40, very rude and snotty he responded OH i know, and no sorry , nothing he walked away and charge my card the correct amount. How disrespectful, the worst customer service i have ever experienced in a long time. A burger king has better service than him. If you ever go there avoid him. He needs some class to teach him customer service.
