Churros are just as good as at the county fair, rodeo, or circus but only just as good. The chocolate dipping sauce is spiced well and delicious... it's chocolate. Tip 1: Tell the hostess you're ordering to go, skip the long line and go straight to the register on the left, then take your food and eat it at the tables outside. Tip 2: Dip your churro in a small cup of Mexican-style vanilla soft serve.
