I love the Bayless array of restaurants, and have made Xoco a regular Saturday morning part of my life. My only complaint with Xoco is that I find Chef Bayless is a little heavy handed with the salt. But Xoco is the perfect place (especially at off peak times) to get a good meal or just a snack. I just make sure to hydrate before going!
