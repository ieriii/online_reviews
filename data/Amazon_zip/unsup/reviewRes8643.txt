Absolutely fantastic! And I now have a new love: the owner, Jonathan Goldsmith! He was so friendly and knowledgeable when I quizzed him about the kind of flour they use that makes their dough to perfectly chewy, and he actually sent me home with a pound of the stuff and some how-to tips for me, the amateur home pizza chef! Such a doll. Gifts aside, this could not have been a better experience. We strolled in early in the evening, plonked ourselves down in the perfect patio seats (Chicago, thank you for answering my prayers and delivering the most outstanding weather I've seen in ages). We ordered our drinks, and pizzas a few minutes later. Before I'd even had a few sips of my bubbly aranciata, the pizzas had arrived! Fresh gooey buffalo mozzarella, perfectly sweet tomato sauce, spicy arugula, fragrant porcini, and even some runny gorgonzola...everything was divine. We finished with some truly Italian espresso, grappa, and a sublimely good zabaglione. Aah, the good life.
