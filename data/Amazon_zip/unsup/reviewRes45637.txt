ornate light fixtures, lovely bathrooms, library with a fireplace, rich wood, comfy looking booths everywhere. cozy warm romantic place with run of the mill comfort food selections, though very flavorful.  great on a winter night to escape the chill. such a breath of fresh air in this neighborhood, truly different for the area. my only complaint, rustic decor coupled with contemporary neon paintings of oscar over the mantle. hideous!
