I started going to Noon-o-kabob for lunch in Elk Grove Village when I used to work out that way. They Closed.. I ventured to the Kedzie location. My friend and I make it a point to get there as much as possible! Baba Ganojh (sounds like ganoush...sorry can not spell it) and some other things I can not spell out. everthing I have gotten has been very good. I highly recommend it! Excuse me while I go eat my Noon-o-kabob Leftovers!
