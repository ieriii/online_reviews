This is our favorite place to get sushi in the city! I had a craving for their Maui Waui roll after a long day this weekend and called in my order for takeout. The rolls were ready to pickup in less than 30 min and hit the spot perfectly. Michael, the manager, knows his customers and is always friendly and professional. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fresh and inventive sushi dinner with consistently great service!
