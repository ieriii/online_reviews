We had about 3 1/2 hours before our flight home so we thought we had to stop by this place. The best hot dogs in Chicago, right?.... or so it seems. It took us about 45 minutes to get here from downtown. We had all our luggage because we timed the trip to get to the airport after eating Hot Doug's and making it onto our flights with minutes to spare. We had to wait in line for about 1 1/2 hours in the freezing temperature. We finally got inside the door and warmed up a bit but still had to wait another 20 minutes! Because we waited so long, we ordered a lot! We got THE DOG, THE KEIRA KNIGHTLEY, THE SALMA HAYEK, THE GAME OF THE WEEK, which was BOAR, THE MARTY ALLEN, and a CORNDOG. I thought I would be blown away by a chicago hot dog. It is just a regular hot dog with relish, pickles and tomatoes... nothing special. The corndog was good but is there anyway to ruin a corndog? We also couldn't try to duck fat fries because it was on a day that they don't serve it. Everyone was raving about them so we wanted to try it but of course, Hot Doug's wasn't meant to be for us. Till this day, I ask myself if this was worth almost missing a flight and freezing to death on a COLD February afternoon--definitely NOT! We ordered 5 different things on the menu and we were the least bit satisfied. We got sick of one and ended up throwing it away after getting off the train near the airport. To me, the H in Hot Doug's stands for HYPE!
