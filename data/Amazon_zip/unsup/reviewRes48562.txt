The atmosphere is amazing with high ceilings, globe pendant lights, communal tables surrounded by "pig pen" small tables on the perimeter. There's no text anywhere in the restaurant, just large paintings of pigs on the walls.  We started with pork rinds and apple salad. The apple radish salad was amazing and I enjoyed the spicy cheese seasoning on the pork rinds. From there we had the langostines with a decadent butter sauce, a taste of three hams and the fideus, which was a casserole of chorizo, rabbit, escargot and house ricotta. This was a great second course that was enough for everyone in our party to sample and enjoy the delicious meat delights. Our third course was the pork belly and the sweetbreads. Both were huge portions and cooked properly. The sweetbreads were even topped with shaved burgundy truffles.  We loved the focus on pairing craft beer with a decadent meal and also how the staff was very attentive. The staff was also extremely knowledgeable without coming off as pretentious. They made us feel welcomed and appreciated.
