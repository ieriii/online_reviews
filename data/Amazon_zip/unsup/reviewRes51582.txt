I've been coming here a Lil over 10yrs. The customer service is ok. A great Nside Mexican restaurant especially for dine-in. My faves are the tacos, chimichanga (the burritos r big), chicken soup, guacamole, chicken flautas, limonada, horchata, and chips with Pico de Gallo. The Pico de Gallo is chunky and tasty although sometimes it has been real bland or watery, but overall good food and reasonable prices.
