Burgers and fries: meh Fried Cheese Curds: Yes! Beer: Yes! Friendly Staff: Yes. A burger collab with Sage Francis: Awesome! After a morning of indulgence in pastry, cookie, ice cream, candy and etc. shopping at the Logan Square Pastry Market, real food was needed, preferably meat. After awhile of being indecisive on where to have lunch, Sheena R. and I settled on the Bad Apple. It was early and not crowded. We sat ourself and was handed a beer and food menu quickly. They have a great beer selection at reasonable prices, which was nice to see. We were hungry, so to the burger list it was. I ended up ordering the Hangover because fried egg, bacon and a pretzel roll sounded good. The burger looked awesome, but it was missing flavor and juiciness. The toppings were so/so as well, nothing stood out. Flavor was definitely lacking. The fried cheese curds were good though. I'd definitely go back for appetizers and beer, but no burgers. Oh yeah and they do get an extra point for the veggie Strange Famous burger because it was a collaboration with Sage Francis. sorry I'm a hip hop nerd.
