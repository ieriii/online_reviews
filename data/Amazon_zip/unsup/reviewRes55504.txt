Awesome patio/garden, where they even grow some of their own ingredients. I had a servers who was passionate and knowledgable, and another that wasn't very good and had no idea what he was talking about. Regardless, the food and wine is REALLY good! They even make their own whole wheat bread so I feel healthier about eating 5 pieces before dinner. The chef makes things a little too oily and creamy for my taste (health freak) and doesn't, according to our server, appreciate requests for oil-less or healthy substituions in the meals. Really good sea food and I love some of the unique dishes like the squid ink pasta. Also fun for people watching.
