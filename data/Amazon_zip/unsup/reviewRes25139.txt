It is a oh-so romantic restaurant. My boyfriend first took me after our date at Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and this restaurant has not failed us ever since.  Food is amazing and the ambiance is so bone-meltingly romantic. They have a guitar player there playing some acoustic music that adds another layer of romance to the restaurant. They have a huge selection of wines if you are interested.  Oh, the secret is that they send you a 25 dollar gift certificate if you fill out a form at the end of meal that comes with your bill. I think there are some restrictions but it's pretty amazing, and we have been taking advantage of it. I think it doubles to 50 dollars if you have 4 people dining there.
