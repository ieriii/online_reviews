I liked Big Jones, although I am fully aware that this is "Chicago-style" southern cuisine and not a 100% accurate representation. The interior is cute (although compared to the horror show that was old Augies, they basically could have given you concrete benches to sit on and paper plates to eat off of and it would have been an improvement), and our server (I think her name was Bridget) was an absolute doll. We got there early so we were the only ones in there for almost the whole meal, but it had almost filled to capacity by the time we left.  Started off with the Pulled Pork Grit Cakes, which were OK, a tad on the small side and I found the sauce the pork was in to be too tangy for my taste. But BF loved them and ate most of the dish. I ate almost all of the boiled peanuts by myself, which were really, really fantastic. Up until this point I have only had the canned version, which I buy whenever I am down south. As it is with most foods, fresh is far superior to canned anyday!  BF ordered the Tallgrass Beef Burger , which was a thick, juicy and lovely sandwich, placed atop a mix of fried onion, potatoes & okra. I snuck a piece of okra and it was perfect.  My dish of choice was the Gumbo Ya-Ya, which was a medley of Chicken, Andouille, Gator Sausage, okra and vegetables in dark roux with popcorn rice. I have to agree with the other reviewers that ordered this - perfectly executed, but nothing better or worse than gumbo I have had in the past. I tend to fall deeply in love with certain dishes at certain places, and this didnt do it for me. But hey, I look at it this way - now I can explore other options on the menu without the guilt. I also ordered the Ginger Dimple, which was Armagnac, fresh squeezed lime, and house ginger beer. What a great drink. If it was less pricey I would come here after work and just drink those. Lovely stuff.  I think this place is a great addition to the neighborhood and look forward to coming back.
