Best tapas in Chicago! I have a very high standard for tapas. This is the only place I'll eat at in Chicago. They have some traditional favorites but also some unique Catalonian dishes. Their seafood tapas are not my favorite, but the menu is huge and there really is something for everyone. it's not cheap. It's a special occasion place. Once you see the imaginative decor and try some of their delicious sangria you'll understand why. The sangrias change with the seasons and even if tapas aren't your thing you should go to the bar for a drink.
