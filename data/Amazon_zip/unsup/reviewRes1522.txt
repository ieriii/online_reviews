There's really only one way to put this... Hot Doug's rocks. And that's an understatement. So much so that they can close down for several consecutive weeks, probably without noticing a dent in income (yes, they do this occasionally, so make sure they're open before making a special trip). The place is super small, and weekend lines are known to stretch all the way down Roscoe (and then some). Get there early, and you still may have to wait. Check it out during the week - lines can still be long, but instead of waiting three hours, you may only have to wait one. And the duck fat fries - unique and good, but save all the room in your stomach for the sausage. The best idea is to get a couple sausages each and share, thus experiencing more of what Hot Doug's has to offer. Last time we were here, we tried the classic Chicago dog, the Rib Eye, Alligator with Shrimp Remoulade, and Sonoran dog (very spicy). They were all amazing and I will never forget the phenomenal taste from the Sonoran dog.
