Went to Sabatino's last night with my husband and a friend that we haven't seen in years, who had never been. Of course it was fantastic. We love this old school Italian place. This and Buona Terra in Logan Square are probably my favorite Italian restaurants in the city. We started with strong cocktails. Yum. Minestrone soup came next, then salad. The soup was perfectly seasoned, filled to the brim with chunky vegetables, and was exactly the right temperature. The salad was simple, with a garlic dressing, and was perfectly chilled. A big warm loaf of Italian bread was accompanied by their signature cheesy bread. There's Parmesan cheese, butter and olive oil on the table, so you can select your favorite bread accoutrements. For entrees, I had the chicken meuniere -- sauteed chicken in a garlic, butter and wine sauce, with oil and garlic mostaccioli on the side. Our friend had the special fish -- skatewing sauteed in garlic and oil, with red sauce pasta, and my husband happily remained in his chicken parm rut with a side of spaghetti. The service was gracious, and the portions are huge and very reasonably priced. The tab, including drinks and tip, for the three of us was $75. Every table in the room was filled -- on a Tuesday night, natch. We skipped the baked alaska (personal favorite) prepared tableside and the rest of the dessert menu, but we did indulge our ears: there was a violinist and a guitarist working the room, singing Italian songs, so to speak. If you don't try this place once, you are making a HUGE mistake! P.S. It's exactly 24 hours later, and we are having our leftovers for dinner. Yippee!
