First things first: Get the mac & cheese. Your arteries might hurt later, but your mouth will be thanking you. I seem to forget about Wilde... but when I remember it's there & head on over, I'm always happy I did. I've had a mixed-bag of servers... some really nice & competent, some not so much... but the food is always delicious. My two favorite things are definitely the mac & cheese, and the fact that Wilde has Magic Hat No.9 on tap. This makes their 1/2 price beer Wednesdays even tastier. The decor couldn't be better... once I walk inside I forget that I'm in the frozen tundra of our fine city... always hoping for a spot near the fireplace.
