Seems like the place to sit is at the bar. The last few times I have sat at a table I waited for servers who never came. At least I got a water last night from the clearer. I waited beer-less until a spot came open at the bar and I moved. Jillian instantly informed me that they were out of my favorite beer there, the Left Hand Milk Stout, before I could even ask for it. She got me a delicious Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale and then took my burger order remembering how I like it served and which salad dressing I wanted! The Conjugal Visit was pretty good and the salad plentiful and delicious. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that a burger order lighter than medium is going to come out bloody. The Conjugal Visit is a turkey burger so I avoided that last night but it has happened to me repeatedly in the past. If I said it had happened to me in the future, you'd know I was an idiot. Since Lockdown seems to be compared to Kuma's a lot, I'll join in and point out that I've never heard the same song twice at Kuma's while I have seen videos of Rammstein and Mastadon live at Lockdown so often that I've lost count. C'mon, PJ, invest in some new DVDs!
