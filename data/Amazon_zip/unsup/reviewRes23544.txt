first off don't get lost its at the very beginning of the mini-mall (or at the very end if you're one who sees the glass as half empty) Tradition long wait (unless you get there at 5:30 PM) bad service? I disagree, our servers were on point. all three of them! Highlite: we learned Tsingtao (aka Miller Lite) is pronounced Ching-taow! the spring rolls were just a'ight yeah we got dat modafukin 'crack' chicken everyone speaks of it was crunchy and delightful but i'm not sure i'd get it again Mongolian beef tenderloin tender as silk? duh Cashew shrimp, saucy! Egg Drop Soup not the most fab i've had but def enjoyable overall this was by far the best Chinese food i've exp'd in Chi. My friend from LA who joined me (terrible 2sum) said it was the best Chinese food she'd had in her existence and that she's bringing the 'rents to Sze Chuan next time they're in town. Ross H. said "For anyone who gave this place less than four stars -- how?" and I feel that. yet... Quality of Food: 9/10 (beef/shrimp/chicken/soup) Service: 9/10 (other than being yelled at by the general of the army who decides which little birdie gets to sit down, once seated we was constantly poured fresh tap water etc) How Long I Stayed Full For: 6/10 (starving lyke 3 hours later) Stomach/Digestion: 4/10 (was strugglin') Fortune Cookies: 2/10 (LAME 2 cuTesy)
