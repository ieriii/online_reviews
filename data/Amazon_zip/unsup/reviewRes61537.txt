Rubino's is not really setup as a retail operation but the prices are inexpensive and the quality is good. They sell out of a freezer, in a industrial/warehouse environment. If you've been to Peoria Packing or Isaacson &Stein, Rubino's "ambiance" is two notches below...however their product is good and inexpensive.
