I fell in love with Alliance as soon as I walked by and saw an edible display of "The Nightmare Before Christmas." I try to avoid bakeries as much as possible but I couldn't resist this one. By suggestion I ordered a red velvet cupcake. I'm not a big red velvet fan but this baby was the best red velvet cupcake EVAR. I also got a vegan cupcakes, and it was surprisingly good. I doubt I will ever be a vegan, but if I did it's good to know there's at least one place in the world where I can get a humane tasting baked good. The cafe is very quaint and quiet. A wonderful place to grab a sweet, an espresso and get some work done.
