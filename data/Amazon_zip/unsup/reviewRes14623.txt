I usually frequent Goose Island's brewery in Lincoln Park, but was looking to try something new. When visiting a brewery, I always like to try the beer flights so I can sample many different flavors, and Revloution's samples are reasonably priced at $2 for 5 ounces. Revolution has an expansive list of bottled and canned beers, although they are a little more limited on their draft selections. And, let's face it, there always comes a time when you begin to get hungry once you've drank enough. I tried Revolution's take on mussels, which had a cider sauce with bleu cheese and fuji apples. They were delicious! I'm craving them right now!
