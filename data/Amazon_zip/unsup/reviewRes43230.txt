Firstly, this place is very good, and I am hopelessly addicted to their granola. However, I could not have a single entree on their breakfast menu when I went in there today because I'm allergic to dairy products. The problem was, instead of being accommodating (all I asked was if the could fry me a couple of eggs on the grill real quick without milk mixed in them) their response was that they can't vary at all from the menu, blah, blah blah. So I ended up with 2 hard boiled eggs, chicken sausage and toast. I own a business myself, and this is not good customer service in my opinion. I'm not going to be back until they make more of an effort than that, because they are making it pretty clear that they obviously don't want my business that badly.
