except for the A in the name, this place has nothing to do with kumas. there's not even a K or an M or a U or even an S...just a t h e a b d p l and e! yes they serve some damn fine beers. yes some servers like Kelly are way hot and sport some ink. yes most of the servers are way cool and make you wish you had a bassment and a keg and a record player so you can invite them over for some listening fun. and yes...there are burgers. some even on pretzel buns, some with pulled pork or gooey cheese and sometimes even bacon. I still don't see it. It's totally different. It's also good that way. TBA is not perfect. its still a work in progress, but it has a good start. The poutine(pronounced Pooteen, tho I likes PoeTang;p) was good and so wrong, but could've used some BAM! Bacon or maybe a jack daniels sauce on the side.(though the gravy was a mighty nice I must say) The cheese curds were just too small a portion. Heck even the burgers as tasty as they can be...I have been brainwashed I must confess into thinking these portions are just not big enough. If I'm going to kill my insides with greasy goodness..It should be big time killin with big as my ass servings.( and a buttcheek is sometimes more than plenty) So to repeat...nothing like the kumas of folklore, way different and this difference is a good thing.
