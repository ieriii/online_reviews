I very much enjoy this restaurant. Every time I have attended a gathering here, the service was outstanding. The manager checks with every table to assure their dining experience. The salad bar could use some work as far as selection and the wine list was much better than other Brazilian style steakhouses. If you're in town and have time for lunch or dinner, I recommend stopping in. You won't be disappointed with the food, hospitality and dcor.
