The pineapple martini was amazing. I literally had to force myself not to drink it all in five minutes....you know, try to keep it classy. I was here with a party of eight for dinner on Saturday. Our table was ready right away and our waitress was great. Six of us ordered the full menu and two of us ordered just the harvest table. The GM came over and asked why we were just ordered the harvest table and my friend explained she was a veg-head. He had an awesome vegetable skewer just for her. She loved it. He declared that no patron should come to his restaurant and not be able to eat from a skewer! It was my birthday so indulged in the cookie skillet dessert. It was very good....although not all that different than the ones you can order at a bar. It was also a dinner for my friends engagement and she ordered the butterscotch bread pudding. It was awesome. Try them both. On of my guy friends mentioned that he felt the meat was not quite as warm as he would like it and from that point on I swear we were the first table to be served as the meat came from the kitchen. The only reason why I did not give this place five stars is because the is a very distinct group of patrons (the "look at me" crowd) who really look you up and down. They really did not effect you if you do not pay them any attention but they are definitely guilty of reckless eye-balling! If the opportunity presents itself...go! Oh and if you want the rooftop then you better get there early!
