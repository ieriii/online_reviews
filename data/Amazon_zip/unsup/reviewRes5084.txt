I am not particularly a fan of bone marrow, so although it was ordered, and properly executed -- well, I'm still not a fan. However, they did a good job.. The pork shoulder was perfect, and the brussel sprouts just right. The wine was reasonable and delicious. Great service and lovely ambiance. I would highly recommend.
