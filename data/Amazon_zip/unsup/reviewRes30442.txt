First and foremost- I was delighted by our waiter Aaron. This guy does his job perfectly. I really appreciate good service, and felt this was one of the better waiters I have had. Kudos to that guy. What a cool place. and everything has vegan egg/cheese options. We ordered the red pepper hummus and the "meat" nachos for appetizers. Meals ordered at our table included Avocado Tostadas, "Pork" Tacos, Enchiladas, and the Kids Quesadilla (non-intentional fiesta theme, minus the hummus :) ).  Vegan craft beers: Two Brothers Bitter End Pale Ale and Three Floyds Alpha King Pale Ale. Also, mixed drinks, and the kiddo ordered a Chocolate Vegan Shake. For dessert, we all split the Cookie and Cream vegan cake. Everything was impressive.  Most notable to me: *No high fructose corn syrup is used. ever. *Biodynamic (this means no pesticides on the grapes) and vegan sustainable wines (yes, vegan wines, and there is a reason for that, as Aaron kindly explained when I inquired) *bakery items are distributed through Whole Foods, prolly cuz they rock! *Seiten tastes pretty darn good! *They heart the environment as much as I do, and it shows Can't wait to go back again...my next endeavor will be the brunch menu :) Hearts and warm fuzzies.
