I must add an emphatic yes! This place is great, the service is wonderful, the food is fresh, light , incredible presentation. I wanted to eat the coconut and pineapple serving bowls for the entrees! YUM! Great flavor combinations and service of a super expensive restaurant. Definitely going back to give some other items a try.
