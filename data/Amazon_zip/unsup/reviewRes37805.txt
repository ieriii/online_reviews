With close to 800 positive reviews - I don't feel the need to blabber too much about Hopleaf. Here's my two cents: - Awesome selections of Belgian and other imported beers: Lambic ... YES!! - Belgian style mussels: don't forget to dip da bread!! - House-made potato chips with house-made garlic mayo: no brainer, really. Go early or be ready to wait about an hour or two. Yes, sometimes even on weeknights.
