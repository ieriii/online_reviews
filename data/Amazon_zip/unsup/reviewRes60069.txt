I heard about this place through a bartender at another restaurant in my neighborhood. He recommended the Tuesday night special of fried chicken, but I couldn't wait that long and chose to visit Big Jones on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. I made reservations because I figured the place would be busy, and I'm glad I did. We were seated immediately. At first I was a little skeptical since I had a reservation but was seated right next to the kitchen, however, this turned out to be a blessing indisguise. Since I was right next to the kitchen I was able to watch all of the delicious food come out and even discovered that they had fried okra, an item that wasn't listed on the menu! And since I LOVE fried okra I immediately placed an order for an appetizer! At $4 you can't go wrong. It was delicious! After polishing off the okra our waiter (who btw was excellent) brought us delicious complimentary beignets. They were STILL warm when they were set down on our table. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this place. We ordered the Eggs New Orleans and The Bacon and Cheese Omelet. And both were excellent. The omelet in particular looked so clean and fresh, not greasy or messy on the plate. In fact, all of the food looked clean, healthy, fresh, etc. Nothing came out greasy or over cooked and I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious. Our waiter was phenomenal and I wish I could remember his name, but alas I cannot. And even the table right next to the kitchen is a great place to sit, and you can't say that about many restaurants. I will definitely be going back for brunch and I am planning a trip back to try the fried chicken. If you decide to make a visit, I suggest making reservations before hand since I saw a few people waiting over 30 mintues for a table, but the food is definitely worth the wait. Big Jones is definitely one of my new favorites in the city!
