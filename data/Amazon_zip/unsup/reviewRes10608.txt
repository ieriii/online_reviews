One of the finest meals I have eaten in quite some time. My wife greatly enjoyed the sea bass. I ordered the veal chop, served with a very complimentary meadly of vegetables and it was outstanding. The waite staff was 5 star, valet parking and there's a cigar compay/ lounge (TESA Cigar Co.) next door!
