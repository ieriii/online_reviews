My friends took me here for my birthday. We love asian food of all kinds, but I especially love thai food and my bf loves sushi. This place is perfect for having both!! The drunken noodles were sweet & salty... we had sushi rolls for appetizers which were average, but a nice start to the evening. It was great for a bigger group and not too loud. Plus it was byob! While it was pretty far north for us to get to, I would definitely go there again.
