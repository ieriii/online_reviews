We found plenty of street parking as we rolled up to NOON O KABAB on a Friday night around 6pm. Inside, the only open two-top was right by the doors, so I requested a four-top in the adjacent, smaller room and the hostess obliged. The front dining room was a wide open room, very loud and chaotic. I was happy to get seated in the back room, which was quieter and more intimate. The meal started off with a complimentary starter of soft, delicious flatbread served with goat cheese, white onions and radishes. I ordered a Persian salad and my girlfriend ordered the soup, both good. For entree, my girlfriend ordered a chicken kebab - two skewers of grilled chicken breast and a pile of rice. It turned out to be enough food for three meals. She liked the dish but wasn't blown away. I was. Completely. I changed my order to the Shirin Polo after my waitress balked slightly at my first request (the Zucchini Plate). I must have made the right choice because she smiled widely and commended me. "Good choice."  It was a good choice. Grilled mushrooms, tomatoes and green peppers topped a rice dish mixed with golden raisins, shredded carrots, and a sweet (but not too sweet) orange peel jam. It probably could have been stretched into two meals, but it was so delicious that I only left behind a few spoonfuls (which I had boxed and ate the next day). When I go back, I fully intend to order the exact same thing. Service was a little spotty. Our waitress seemed to forget about us for a while, but the bus servers stepped up and cleared the table. When the waitress remembered us and came back to the table, she was surprised to find that our table had been bussed and that we were just sitting and waiting to order coffee and a small sampling of desserts. She got right back on the horse and did a fine job overall. I'm not an expert on Persian food but after a few dozen more visits to Noon O Kebab I hope to be.
