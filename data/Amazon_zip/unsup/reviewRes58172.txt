It does not get any better than this. Went to supper last night. The restaurant is beautiful, the lower bar is small and quaint. Great drinks. specialty drinks...especially the Caliente.The menu is diverse and the food is very good. Portions could have been a liitle larger. The service staff from hostess, to bartender to server to busman was 5 star.Mercat is going to be a hit in Chicago. Making reservations for next weekend.
