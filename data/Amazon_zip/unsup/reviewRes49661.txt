Oh my god i loved this place. We went here for my group's work lunch and it was so good.  First of all, BYOB - automatic 3 stars in my book.  The food was great. we got empanadas and some other stuff for appetizers. I got the lunch special which was $6.95 (!!) and included a soup, a HUGE portion of meat (I had the chicken), potatoes, rice, and a bit of salad. I had my first oxtail soup ever and i liked it a lot. The chicken was just as I like it, pounded thin and seasoned perfectly. their salsa is very good too, it's not like Mexican salsa, not as spicy, but it's good. four of my co-workers got the entree for two, which at $34 included a ton of multiple meats - chicken, beef, sausage, another beef, more meat i can't remember, plus sides. would get 5 stars but the decor and the dining area are only ok, esthetically. however i adore this place and can't wait to go back for dinner!!
