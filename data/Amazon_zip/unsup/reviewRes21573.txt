I had never heard of Superdawg Drive-in growing up in Humboldt Park. Once I moved to the burbs I passed by it for years but never stopped. My husband finally took me there for the first time 9 years ago. Now, I like this place but my heart belongs to Vienna, sorry Maurie and Flaurie.  I admit the place is very 50's (I was a greaser in a pass life) and the food very unique. I still find it odd that the dogs are not wieners, not frankfurters and not red hots, but described as pure beef Superdawgs. They're served on a poppy seed bun, (they got that going for them) trimmed with golden mustard, tangy piccalilli, kosher dill pickle, chopped Spanish onions, a couple of hot pepper, and accompanied with Superfries. The clincher for me though was the Superonionchips. I hate raw onions but love onion rings and these were awesome. My order is never complete without these and my husband complains every time because he never gets any. Hey, you snooze you loose! I've tried the Superfish (the lent thing again) and it was very filling. The hubbie has had every thing on the menu. He tends to lean toward the char-broiled Whoopskidawg with grilled onions. The kids share a Superdawg or the Superchickenmidgees since all of the main items come with fries.  They serve sods, iced tea, lemonade, milk coffee and during the cold season they even have hot chocolate. I however like to order a pineapple shake. It's so thick that I have a hard time drinking it through the straw. During a nice summer evening we sit outside at the umbrella covered tables to enjoy a Supersoda or a Blackcow. I'd like to get a Supersundae but I could gut imagine the mess the kid would make. They only con about this place are the prices. They are a bit high but for nice and easy meal this place is great.
