OH! Dagnabbit. Hang on a second. I have to get a napkin to clean the drool off my keyboard. Just the thought of the succulent duck I ate here on Christmas is enough to make my mouth water with need. Otay, all cleaned up. I had the great pleasure of spending Christmas at this fine establishment with some of the best meaties, er um, yelpers around. Fernando C. was kind enough to set up the event and invite all who love duck and good company to spend the holiday together. We drank wine, we chatted, we waited for duck, we drank and chatted some more. Appetizers were enjoyed, more wine and finally after a slow clap that ended in a loud call for duck, the beauteous thing finally arrived and well all hailed the glorious beast. There was duck on sticky buns, duck soup, duck friend rice, and duck with noodles and even after all that I wanted MORE duck. Why you ask? Because it was so damn good. I could go there now and have more. A whole duck just for me. Muwahahahaha. No sharing. MINE ALL MINE! Woah. Okay. Calm down. Wow. Mild duck obsession. Eeesh. I guess I'll just have to go and get some more. I don't think I'll be able to wait for next Christmas. Not if this drool is any indication anyway.
