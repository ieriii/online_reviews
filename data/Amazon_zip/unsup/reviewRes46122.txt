The decor is eye-catching, the service is very attentive and the portions are large. Of course the other important aspects are that their drinks are great & the dessert (strawberry shortcake) is even better! I have been here numerous times and came here last night w/the man before heading off to a movie. For some reason, this place consistently serves up a memorable, delicious meal to the other members of my party, but always leaves me somewhat unsatisfied. Last night my Pasta Fresca arrived w/a mix of overcooked (some burnt) and undercooked (semi-raw) vegetables. The time before when I was here I requested that my chicken NOT be prepared w/an egg wash...it was. When I sent it back, they simply scraped off the egg wash & returned it to the table. Ugh. All in all, I would say it is 3.5 stars.
