So these guys probably don't need another review, but so what? I always seem to show up at Piece the morning after a late night out. It's thankfully not too bright, the noise level is tolerable, and the pizza is GREAT! They have some great in-house brews too, except that I'm not really a beer person. It's like a mildly upscale cross between a pizzeria and sports bar, and that's just fine with me.
