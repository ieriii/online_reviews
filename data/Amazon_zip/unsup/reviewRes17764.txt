That's right. 5 stars! Carnivale was, in my opinion, everything a good restaurant experience should be. We started at the bar. Very rarely are $9 cocktails worth $9. These cocktails were very well made and worth every penny. The menu seemed to have something for everyone's taste. I got the Pollo and it was absolutely delicious. The portion was huge. It was a half chicken, served with lots of potatoes, green beans and olives. The chicken couldn't have been cooked more perfectly. And the flavor of everything was out of this world. Plus, the serivce was top notch and the atmosphere can't be beat. Finally, a place with high quality upscale food at a decent price. Nothing on this menu was overpriced in my opinion. My entree was under $20 and with such a large portion and excellent flavor, worth a lot more in my opinion. Carnivale is my new place to take out of town guests. The best!
