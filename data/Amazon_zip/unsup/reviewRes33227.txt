This restaurant is awesome. I had the skirt steak which was extra tender and a capirinha that was amazingly refreshing. The owner/manager is absolutely congenial and helpful when selecting items from the menu. It is definitely one of the hidden gems of Chicago. Also, as a side note they offer limo service for groups of 5 or more which is pretty awesome.
