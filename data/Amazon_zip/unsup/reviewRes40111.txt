Really what's there to be said about this place that hasn't already been mentioned? You'll either like the food or won't depending on your person. Me, I like the food. It's interesting, diverse, and makes me feel like an adventurer all without leaving my neighborhood.  I love the atmosphere in here. I do try to come when it's either early or late in the night because I don't appreciate dense crowds, but when there's a few people mingling and you can get a spot at the bar and chat with some friendly and knowledgeable bartender I can almost imagine a sharp shooter wrapped around my hips and a player piano in the corner. I feel like I'm in a modern day wild west and because of that I actually drink whiskey when I'm here. And let me tell you - they do have quite the whiskey selection and they're always friendly to the novices like me who taste whiskey mostly as varieties of liquid wood. Now if I can only remember where I parked my pony.
