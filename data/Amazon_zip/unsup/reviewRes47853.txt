This place is crap. After weeks of anticipation, I showed up on a Thursday night to enjoy the roof deck. There was a long line of trixies and middle-aged women who still thought they were 25, along with your standard guys in jeans, tight t-shirts and over-gelled hair. So we went to the hostess stand to see if we could get a table to eat and have a drink. She gave us the tour and told us all about the "experience" this and "experience" that. Could we get a table? I asked and she said probably not. I looked at her and then around at the five empty tables around us. She said she'd check the list. Then, "Luckily, I do have a table." It was getting late and we decided to skip the meail and just have a drink. We sat down on a sofa and waited 10 minutes for service. Finally, I got up and asked the hostess if we had a waitress. She supposedly disappeared to find one, but after another ten minutes without service, we split.  LUCKILY, we stumbled across Garrett Ripley's which had great food (try the spreads!) and even better service.
