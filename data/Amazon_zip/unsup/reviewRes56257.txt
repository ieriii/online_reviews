My husband & I just returned from Vietnam & we were looking for a restaurant that was just as good as when there. The food at Simply It was amazing. The waitress was very nice and the greeter was so friendly. Prices were totally reasonable $11 for a dinner meal. Yum food! Casual atmosphere. Highly recommended!!!
