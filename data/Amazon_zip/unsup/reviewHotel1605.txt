Reasonably priced hotel with great location right by the Chicago River and a block to Michigan Avenue's shopping haven. The rooms are spacious, we fit 5 girls to a room without anyone beating anyone up for space. Hotel 71 tries to display a modern and sleek look by choosing trendy and funky furniture and it works. Parking can be expensive, around $40 overnight parking. I would recommend parking across the street at the Prudential Plaza or Millennium Park Garage for $16-$20 24 hrs. parking.
