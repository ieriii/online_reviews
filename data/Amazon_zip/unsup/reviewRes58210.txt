First time having a Chicago style hot dog was at Hot Doug's & it didn't disappoint. Saw the restaurant featured on Anthony Bourdain's show, No Reservations, but can't say we were as eager to try the out of the box dogs. We stuck with the standard & concluded Chicago has better hot dogs than LA. We were greeted by Doug, but didn't find him as friendly as others seem to. Also didn't like the fact that you can't take a seat till you've placed your order; noticed it wasn't very conducive to a family in line. We will return when back in town.
