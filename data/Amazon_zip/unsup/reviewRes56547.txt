My daughters and I had brunch at Frontera Grill June 25, 2011. We had been so looking forward to this meal and were totally shocked and disappointed. The only saving grace was the margaritas. The guacamole and tostaditas de ceviche were tasteless. The cazuela de Tinga, enchiladas de Mole and duck tacos, salty and served room temperature as were the sides. We are foodies, watch Mr. Bayless on PBS and chef shows and know he too would be shocked at our meal and service. One of the worst dining experiences ever!
