I love this place and it is my one wish that they would magically appear in my neighborhood in San Francisco. I was so tempted to have the wings, since I've heard such great things, but I was just too tempted by the Korean burrito. That's exactly what I had and it was amazing. The bulgogi was flavorful and tasty and the veggies were fresh and crisp. I loved the Atomic Sauce, which gave it quite a bit of kick.  I will definitely return on my next Chicago visit, and in the meantime, I will pine away for this place.
