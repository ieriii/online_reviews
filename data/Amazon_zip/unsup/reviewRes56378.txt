New to Vietnamese cuisine - now a lover. Fresh ingredients and bountiful. I couldn't stop eating - it was so good - and the courses kept on coming!What a deal for lunch! For $6.95 I had a salad, soup, eggroll, big plate of beef pasta, a plate of fruit, and a large fresh squeezed lemonade. Yum!Definately will return~!
