Ping Pong's little sister restaurant across the street reflects the same design sensibilities in a different way. Instead of the stark white modern, it's a woodsy modern space with a gorgeous full-length mural on the back wall. Their "Japas" (Japanese Tapas) concept is novel - always something I look for in a menu - and their "salad roll" is definitely worth checking out for the interesting arrangement of flowers. Tip: The sea bass here is good, but it's MUCH better across the street at Ping Pong. My guess is that it's the same piece of fish prepared different ways.
