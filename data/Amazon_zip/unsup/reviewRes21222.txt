The one word review: meh. The fries were good, but they came with Cheez Whiz or something like it, which obviously has only one legitimate use and it's quite a few miles to the East of here. More importantly, the hot dogs. They were pretty good, I suppose, but in my limited experience, Wolfy's does it better, and my guess is that Portillo's does too although I have yet to get over there.
