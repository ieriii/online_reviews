Must say that I went again recently... service was MUCH better. Last time I apparently was oblivious to the fact that they have a rooftop... and AMAZING rooftop... Meat is so so... (Fogo still rocks.... I would say that even Texas is a few steps further) but the dessert! OHHHHH the dessert! Butterscotch bread (or something near that) HEAVEN! And the white Sangria is very good as well although not that strong. Overall definitelly worth a trip... just to the rooftop maybe for drinks and desserts!
