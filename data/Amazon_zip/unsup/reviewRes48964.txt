This place is all about Pork, and I'm OK with that, but yet their black bass was deliciously done with potbelly oil and asparagus, we also had pork with homemade sausages that were the best part of the dinner. It was also a good value, and more affordable than the other Restaurants from this chain, (Blackbird and Avec), but it was also more casual. They have a great variety of wines, and the service was good.
