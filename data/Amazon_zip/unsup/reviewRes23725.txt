I find myself craving Icosium Kafe on a weekly basis. Cannot recommend this place enough. I've tried the following crepes: --Marrakesh: I get this with chicken, and it's perfect. Every little ingredient that goes into this crepe stands out, yet compliments the rest of the dish. If you like paradoxes -- delicious paradoxes -- get this.  When you get to the bottom of this review and think, "this Jill person sucks, she goes here all the time and has only had 2 crepes? wtf?" Well, Mr/s trendy yelper pants, you can blame this crepe for my pathetic review, cause it tempts me with it's awesomenessicity and I am weak.  --Bananas Foster & Clark: If you like bananas foster, get it for breakfast. If you don't like bananas foster, you have shamed your family. The chef has spoken to us a couple of times, and was very humble & gracious. Only makes me love this place more. Why am I being stingy with the last star? While most of the staff is great, there's one waitress that we dread getting. We gave her a second chance, thinking it might have been a bad day the first time -- nope, it was her. She's way to slow in everything she does and requires you to repeat your order a few times (and repeats it back to you incorrectly. Yep, that's it, I'd like an ice cold glass of chicken to drink, thanks). So, if you go and the service sucks and everything else is great -- congrats, you know who I'm talking about. Go again, and maybe ask for a different waitress.  Side note: I left my credit card there one time (cause I'm smooth like that). I called the next day, and fortunately an employee found it and I was able to pick it up. No funny charges or anything were on it, so that should speak volumes about the wait staff.
