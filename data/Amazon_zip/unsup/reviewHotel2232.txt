NOTE: This review is for their meeting and event services only. I was responsible for meeting with approx. 60 attendees and was not impressed at all by the meeting services. Every request we made was either denied or finally fulfilled, after an eternity of discussions. When reviewing rooms for our upcoming session, we voiced our concern that they are not big enough. Finally, the event coordinator had facilities place tables in the room, so we could visualize whether or not we could fit our people. We determined that we couldn't which resulted in the manager stopping by and telling us that we could easily fit them and since he doesn't share our concerns with us, he will not make another room available for us. Now that's what I call customer service...NOT. Accommodating is not a word in this man's vocabulary. Apparently it didn't matter that we had already spent a pretty penny there and were going to do the same at the upcoming meeting. Needless to say, we pulled our upcoming meeting from the Intercontinental and instead had it at the Four Seasons (hallelujah!!!).
