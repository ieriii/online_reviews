It's fall again and that means I cook. The best place to find beautiful produce in Chicago if you miss the Green City Market is Fox and Obel. Sure, if you are on a budget this may not be the best place to find a deal, but you will find quality in spades. It is also a bit of a hike unless you live right next door, but it's worth a trip. The meat department has the most amazing cuts...especially if you are interested in a bone-in pork chop or a gorgeous filet and an aray of spices and specialty items that you can't find at Jewel. I love going there b/c it feels like a true city grocery store. Plus, when you have all of your ingredients for te perfect meal, hop next door to Un-Cork It for a great wine selection to complete your culinary experiment.
