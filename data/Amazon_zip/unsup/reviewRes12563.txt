Brazilians know how to cook my HAWC How I Found It: Chicago is not my place of refuge sadly, I am from California upon visiting this frigid ice barren where people call home I immediately yelped the best restaurants in town. This among a couple of others repeatedly popped up, and looked extremely promising. Decided to make reservations, and without any problems got in, and was greatly impressed. Ambiance: Wow! is all I can say, one of the nicest establishments I have been to. Texas de Brazil lives up to its name and does everything bigger in Texas. The bathrooms were immaculate and the overall ground floor was beautifully designed. They even had acrobats dancing/spinning/sautee'ing in a glass window/library/thing that was really fun to watch while waiting for the various meats. The customer service was great, and Katie our server really made our experience spectacular. What I Had: I dont think you can go to a Brazilian BBQ and not try everything under the sun. I probably had 10 different kinds of meats, and then had them all over again bacon wrapped. The salad bar/soup bar was really really good. They had everything ranging from artichoke hearts to exquisite cheeses and other goodies that really complimented the meats, and plantains. I really enjoyed the Lobster Bisque and would be something I would serve double of the next time I'm there. Conclusion: I had a wonderful experience at Texas de Brazil, the food was delicious and I didnt have one bad cut of meat, or one bad thing from the salad bar. The customer service was great, and each and every server was very friendly and accommodating. We actually splurged and if you can believe this got 6 different desserts after our meat rampage, and I need to say each and every one was very good in its own ways. Keylime pie was my personal favorite and if you have room . I would check it out!. I had a great experience here in Chi Town, and Texas de Brazil was definitely one of my highlights.
