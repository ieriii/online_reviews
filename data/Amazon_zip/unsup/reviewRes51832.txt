Strolled in on our first day in Chicago, craving some deep dish. Being from California, there it's hard to find something comparable to Chicago deep dish -Zachary's has way too much tomato flavor, BJ's is too bready, though Little Star in SF is pretty good... Anyway, we took a seat at the bar around 3pm and ordered a small supreme, which we were told would take about 45 minutes. We watched the Cubs-White Sox game and the bartenders and staff always made sure our cups were full and finally, the pizza came. You've got to love the sausage patty... basically a giant sausage patty that covered the entire pizza! The pizza was good, about the only thing I could complain about is the crust. It's kind of crumbly like cornbread, I wasn't too keen on the texture and it's doughy taste. I came here thinking I prefer Giordano's and left thinking the same thing. However, I say this knowing there are Chicago natives that rank this place #1 and I can't blame them- you can't go wrong between the two of them!
