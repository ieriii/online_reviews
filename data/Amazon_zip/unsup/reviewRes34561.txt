I've been craving Sultan's ever since I moved out of the neighborhood last summer. One of my favorite things to do on a Saturday in the summer is get a cheap pedicure/manicure at Asia Nails next door ($33!!!) then head to Sultan's for delicious egg and cheese fetia sandwich for a $3 lunch. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now! I've tried a couple other things, the chicken schwarma sandwich is also delicious. You can't find fresher, cheaper food in the neighborhood, hands down.
