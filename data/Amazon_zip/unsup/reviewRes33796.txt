This place is quite wonderful. The salad bar is great. The Falafel (while not the best I have had) was yummy and well worth the price tag. I had an espresso and a Italian orange soda. Super. They are always busy, but they work hard to clear tables and make sure everyone can have a good meal. I am not sure how long this place has been in Wicker Park but I think it is going on 10 years (I don't remember it back in say 1995) and although I did not want to admit it (insert anti-gentrification bias here) it was as good a middle-eastern meal I have had - although I give the best falafel prize to a place in NW Indiana (really!). Oh, and people were drinking BYOB beer here so I suppose it is ok to bring beer and wine. You might want to check. Cash only. There is no real "market" here. If you want to stock up on Middle-eastern food items go elsewhere.
