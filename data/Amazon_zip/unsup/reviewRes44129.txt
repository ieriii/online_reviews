When it comes to great Sushi in Lakeview, Wakamono is one of my favorites! Always great quality sushi -- very fresh ingredients. I personally recommend the Peter Parker or Fire Dragon maki rolls. I also love their Miso soup, it comes with the option of jalapeno, which gives it a refreshing little kick. Wakamono's atmosphere is contemporary and feels a little zen. Its a rather small establishment and the tables are close together. When it gets busy, it can be really loud. While it's dinning room is BYOB they do have a full bar next door (it's accessible from inside) which makes a great spot to chill and grab a drink while you wait for a table on a busy Saturday night. Over all, all my experiences at Wakamono have been great and I look forward to my next visit.
