A true hidden gem! I've been coming here for about 10 years now - at first, just for the shakes....but then food is super delicious too. I love this place b/c its somewhere vegetarians, meat eaters and vegans can all get something equally delicious and 100% authentic. the service is outstanding and the price can not be beat. its also BYOB. Its a great date spot! Its not too big inside, so it gets crowded, especailly on the weekends.  who would have thought a shake would taste delicious with a burrito? i recommend the oatmeal banana water shake. so good.
