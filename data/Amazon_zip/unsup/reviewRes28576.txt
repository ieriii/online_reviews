I have never disagreed with a restaurant's rating as much as I do with the Pasta Bowl's. I checked the location twice and from the bits and pieces of facts from the other reviews, this is the right place. Sure, the prices are very reasonable, if not cheap, but for the quality of food you're getting, it's still a waste of your money. The dish I ordered had farfalle pasta with marinara and other vegetables. Clearly, the farfalle hadn't been boiled enough ,and was not just chewy, but acutally hard to bite through. The sauce, which holds the flavor in a pasta dish; something that should be absolutely robust, was like paste and far from warm. Really, this is not an attempt to ruin a thriving buisness's reputation or to stand out in the Yelp crowd. It's just really shocking that considering the experience I had, this place still averages 4 stars.
