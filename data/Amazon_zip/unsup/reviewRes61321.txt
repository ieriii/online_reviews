Absolutly LOVE this place. I find it to have great food very similar to the food Igrew up with as a child with my Cuban grandmother. The Mamey shakes are FANTASTIC! The guajirito sandwich is great (even though its not really cuban) and the rabo encendido is a personal favorite. The staff is great, the service is good, and and the food always brings me home. We eat here at least once a week (ok maybe twice). Its that good.
