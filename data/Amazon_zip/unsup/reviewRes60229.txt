been there several times attempting to redeem my experiences...but unfortunately it is just getting worse. -ordered the lox and bagel..waited 15 mins for my food, then they tell me they are out of salmon-change my order to a 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup. since the second thing i ordered was cheaper than my first, they offered a side salad along with that to make up the difference...they forgot my salad and the rude hostess attempted to blame it on the kitchen when i saw the salad sitting at the pick up station for the staff to bring to their tables for at least 10 mins. -my friend got the brussel sprout salad...brussels were completely undercooked and you could barely chew them. again the rude waitress said "oh, i eat it all the time!" assuming that we are just telling her that to make her day harder or something. i am a waitress and know how to give good service and always know that the customer is right. i dont know how everyone there seemed so frazzeld when its one of the easiest things to do. everyone there is just rude..slow..and dumb. the food isnt great either. perhaps change up the menu sometimes? just a suggestion
