The caramelized crust is a layer of burnt cheese around the edges of the pie and provides an amazing, unforgettable flavor (think of burnt cheese on baked ziti) with a crunchy/chewy texture. The crust (dough part) itself is buttery, slightly chewy, but also a bit crunchy. Delicious. Additionally, this deep dish pie provides a better balance of cheese and toppings to crust - about 60/40 crust to topping, which is different from the normal 30/70 crust to topping ratio you see at other places. In short, tasty and filling, but not overwhelming. I like this place better than Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Gino's East. Definitely a must try if you are in the market for an amazing deep dish pie. Pictures / reviews here: http://www.thegluttonous
