Thanks Yelp. Another good call. My aunt lives in the Roscoe Village neighborhood and I had to hit this spot being probably the top-reviewed restaurant in the neighborhood. Waited from 1pm-1:45pm in a line going out the door and around the corner but I hear the friday lunch crowd is a little bigger. Time went slowly because of the anxiety, but I quickly forgot the wait after my meal.  I ordered the smoked shrimp and pork sausage with remoulade sauce and gouda cheese. It was easily the best sausage-on-a-bun experience I've ever had. My only regret is that I got the duck-fat fries. They're no huge thrill really, they seem like ordinary fries to me. Next time I'd probably order two sausages (I was also hoping to try the duck in truffle butter sausage) or share that second one with whoever I'm dining with. Man was that good. I'll overlook the fries issue because the menu is ala carte and they're optional anyway, and the sausage was just too good for this place to get under a full five stars.
