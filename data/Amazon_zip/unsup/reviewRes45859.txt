After spending the day shopping on the Magnificent Mile, my sister and I were craving something sweet. Luckily, even though the restaurant was pretty packed, we were able to be seated quickly. I have been suckered into ordering too many hot chocolates that tasted like nothing more than a cheap packet mix added to warm water, but this wasn't the case at Grand Lux Cafe. The drink alone, being as rich and creamy as it was, could satisfy many a sweet tooth, but we decided to order the Molten Chocolate Cake and New Orleans Beignets, apparently looking to laugh in the face of potential sugar shock. The beignets were good, although I wished the sauces had been more addictive (yes, death by chocolate is the way I'd like to go). On the other hand, the molten chocolate cake tasted as good as it looked. Once we cut into it, the cake exploded on the plate and the gooey chocolate gushed everywhere. Somehow, the vanilla ice cream it came with remained frozen the entire time we were noshing on the dessert. I'll definitely be returning for another one next time I'm in Chicago!
