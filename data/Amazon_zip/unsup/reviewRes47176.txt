My first instict is to compare this place to Kuma's, but I'm not sure that's really fair because well, it's not Kuma's. That said, my boyfriend and I did end up here because I was too hungry to wait the estimated 90 minutes for a table at Kuma's. I got the...I can't remember or find it on the menu online actually, but it was BBQ, bacon, onion rings, and gorgonzola cheese...with a side of mac n cheese. I really liked my burger although it was a little heavy on the gorgonzola for me. That was easy enought to fix though I just picked off some of the excess cheese. I loved the mac n cheese. It could have been served a bit warmer, but it was still my favorite restaurant mac n cheese to date.  The boyfriend got the Border Patrol also with mac and cheese. He liked the toppings but thought the actual burger was dry. (I didn't notice this, but I also like my burgers more well done than he does.)  The fact that we were seated immediately was a huge plus, but the service was a bit lacking given how empty the place was. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't outstanding either. I really like the slightly industrial decor, but the 14 TVs were a bit distracting/ overwhelming. Finally because I just can't not compare it to Kuma's... I thought the mac n cheese was better than Kuma's. I thought the burgers were slightly less creative/ inspired than Kuma's My boyfriend liked the actual burger at Kuma's better. I thought it was a toss up. Prices were on par with Kuma's I did feel like the place was a bit of a Kuma's rip-off. I do think they could make a couple changes to really stand out as not a Kuma's rip-off. Overall the food is good enough and the wait is short enough (or non-existant enough) that I would definitely choose this place over Kuma's on a regular basis.
