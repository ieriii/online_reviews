Went to Tank Noodle for the first time on Sunday. The place was busy but we were sat quickly. The menu was overwhelming but looked delicious. My fianc order Pho Tai and I ordered the Curry. His pho was alright... not as flavorful as we've had before and it needed a lot of "doctoring" with sauces, and in the end it still tasted a little bland. Cafe Hoang a block down Argyle has better Pho by far and I would choose them over Tank. However, the curry was excellent and is worth going for that. We also ordered bubble tea, the mango flavor was alright and had cute watermelon slices on top but the Thai Tea Shake was PHENOMENAL!!!! Actually, I can't stop thinking about that delicious Thai Tea Shake bubble tea... Anyway, Tank is good for the curry and the Thai Tea Shake, otherwise there are much better places down Argyle if you just walk a bit further.
