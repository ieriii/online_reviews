a few buddies and i came here for lunch on a hot thursday afternoon. the weather was beautiful so it was awesome that we got to eat on their outside patio! we started out with the empanadas - chorizo, beef and ropa vieja. YUM. i love empanadas so hard. i ordered the lechon sandwich: roasted pork, romaine lettuce, tomato & sweet plantains. not bad, a little dry and it needed some salt. when i go cuban, usually always order the ropa vieja, but i decided to be different. i might have to switch back to it. it came with plantain chips, which were yummy. one of my friends ordered the cubano and a Salida Del Sol, which looked tasty. my other friend was going to order the cubano, too, but he asked the server if he should order different. he recommended some sandwich (which i think was a chorizo burger or something???) with a bunch of toppings. but my friend didn't think it was that great. kinda disappointed. furthermore, he kinda got raped with the upcharge fee for all those toppings. WTF? we should have been told that first. i do like this place though. their other food is pretty deece, like i said, the ropa vieja. my friend actually went back a few days ago to get the cubano, so you know that's gotta be a weeener.  summertime in chi is the best. lots of eyecandy. this is a good place to go eat outside and relax. my friend had an eye on some latinas. the owner is really cute, too. :)
