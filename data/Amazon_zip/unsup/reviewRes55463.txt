What a great place! Both for the wonderful food, and the great setting. The outdoor patio is just charming and relaxing. The simplest of dishes like a Caprese salad, go beyond expectation from ingredients at their peak of flavor. The pasta was memorable, the Duck the best I have ever had, done to perfection, the meat moist and flavorful, the skin crisp. Truly a great place for great food.
