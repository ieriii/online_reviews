Quite nice option tucked just off Michigan Avenue. My king room was huge with a cute work table, a playful white pleather barcelona-esque chair with matching ottoman, and a small upholstered bench. Comfy bed, lots of light from the windows, free wireless, porthole pocket bathroom door, ipod jack and kiehl's bath goodies pretty much sums it up. The workout equipment is packed into a small space but very up-to-date and there are many machines. The staff is extremely pleasant. I, surprisingly, got a great internet rate and for the amount I paid, this was truly an awesome spot for my latest foray into Chi-town. Extra bonus is having David Burke's Primehouse right downstairs.
