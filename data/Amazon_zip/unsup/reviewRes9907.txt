Piece! This is a great place to spend your birthday, pick up growlers, down some pizza, and hang out with friends. Definitely recommend making a reservation in advance. It's huge but immensely popular so it fills up quickly. Get..... all the things. And all the beers too. I seriously wish we had a Piece in San Francisco since moving here. Maybe one day!
