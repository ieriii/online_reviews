The vegan reuben is amazing! In fact, it's so good that, after I ate the second half of it as a leftover at home a couple of hours later, I considered going back to get another one that same day (too bad that the restaurant is not closer to my house). Great selection of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Good selection of cocktails and beer. Exceptional service.
