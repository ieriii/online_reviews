This place rocks. Went here awhile back for dinner. We basically sampled the entire menu. We had the ham plate, oysters, pork rinds and some other dish I'm forgetting but it was ALL good. Amazing. Went back for brunch and it did not disappoint. I had the pumpkin bread and red-wine poached eggs and the husband had bacon and grilled hanger steak. We had to wait a bit for brunch but it was worth it! Also, the environment is fun and laid-back. We will be back!
