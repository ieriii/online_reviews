the environment: the place is cheesy. terrible art. but not as crowded as kuma's. the seating is comfortable. but the decor is all around tacky. the service: we arrived at 8 pm on a friday night, so a wait is expected, but they handled it terribly. tables would be empty for 5-10 minutes before they'd seat someone. we waited for about an hour, but with a beer or two and friends..no big deal. just annoying to see the situation handled so poorly. the food: started off with fried cheese curds. delicious. great batter. highly recommended. i ordered the big texan. burger with pulled pork, onion rings, and bbq sauce on texas toast. it was delicious. cooked to a perfect medium rare, and seasoned really well. my friend ordered the frenchie, and said it was great. it was my second choice. the fries were pretty good. fresh cut, but somewhat lacking in crispiness. for .75 you can add on. i opted for the truffle oil. good, but very sparse.  so, the bad apple is one of these places that has all house made everything. they brag about it on their menu. which means they also make their own ketchup. and, to be blunt, it sucks. and i would argue is not ketchup. it is basically tomato sauce. it just tastes like smashed tomatoes.  i understand wanting to make everything in house, and pride yourself on it, but if you're going to do it; don't suck at it. and if you are a burger and fries place, and insist on making your own ketchup wouldn't it make sense to make a homemade version of the standard, like heinz, but improve upon it slightly, like using sugar instead of corn syrup? or honestly, just use heinz! its the gold standard. if i go back, i will bring a bottle of heinz/ketchup packets to enjoy my fries. so, 3 stars because the burger was great, and cooked perfectly, but everything else kind of irked me. even though the burger was very good, i don't see myself going back, and i think that speaks volumes about the place.
