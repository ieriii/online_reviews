Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, hands down.  As a Chicagoan I'm well aware of the fact that everyone's favorite pizza place is the best and to say otherwise is fighting words, but Peqod's pizza is really spectacular.  I am a regular fixture at the restaurant, eating there on almost a weekly basis, and the food is consistently good. The best part is of course their trademark caramelized crust.  I've only ordered the pizza delivery a few times and can say that while its still good, your much better off going to the restaurant and eating it fresh from the oven. Like most deep dish it will fill you up quickly and a small is more then enough for two people.  After a kitchen fire a few years ago the interior of the restaurant got a revamp, so it no longer has the classic Chicago pizza parlor feel, but the atmosphere is still nice, and the restaurant is clean. The restaurant is deceptively large with a second story with a full service bar, though I personally prefer eating on the ground floor.  The wait staff has all been working there for years and is friendly and courteous. Service is also always prompt with multiple servers and staff members taking care of you during your meal.
