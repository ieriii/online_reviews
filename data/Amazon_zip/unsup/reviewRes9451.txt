We went for dinner here a few nights ago and had a wonderful time. I think overall it is a really nice restaurant with good food and a great atmosphere. It really is a pretty restaurant but I did have to knock off a few points for how close together the tables are... It it isn't uncomfortable but yet with the attention that was obviously spent on the decor they might have just spaced the tables out a wee bit more to allow for a romantic evening. I didn't find it to be as intimate as I was looking for but still a very nice atmosphere. The service was really good. They were polite, prompt, and managed to be present without being overbearing. However, the meal was served too quickly. I don't like it to be apparent that they are making sure the tables turnover quick enough. It was bordering on rushed. Our food was really yummy. We had the shrimp on sugar cane app which was wonderful. My husband had the filet and shrimp which was really just incredibly tasty. I had the sea bass which was not the best- it was good but not as good as my husband's entree or our app. I definitely would go back here as it is fun to dress up a little and the food is really tasty.
