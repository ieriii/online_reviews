This is me and my girlfriend's go-to Mexican place. The thing that puts it above the rest is the service. They know us, say hi, and ask how we are doing. I enjoy it even more with the new back area, along with the outdoor seating.  The food is top notch Mexican as well. I usually get steak fajitas which are fantastic. You really can't beat the 1/2 price margarita special as well. Over a great place that I will continue to enjoy for years to come.
