My wife and I had lunch here last Saturday (restaurant week in Chicago). This was our first visit to Le Colonial. We really enjoyed our lunch and look forward to returning for dinner very soon. The food, service and decor are all excellent and exceeded our expectations.  Le Colonial is truly a unique restaurant on Rush in the sea of Chicago steakhouses. Great job Le Colonial and thank you for a very special Saturday lunch.
