Great food, great service! I recommend: 1. Panino con nutella. Two words: Food. Orgasm. A warm panini filled with creamy nutella and bananas... drool drool drool. 2. Braised Pork Shoulder 3. Wagyu Sirloin Tip I don't recommend: 1. Bone marrow: I've been to other restaurants that served bone marrow and the serving size at the Purple Pig was considerably smaller. Also, the bone is usually cut lengthwise, making it easier to scoop out the marrow, but here, the bone was cut to look like cylinders. I had a hard time scooping out the marrow, and since i don't like it working for my food, I couldn't fully enjoy this dish. Overall, great wine selection and great food!
