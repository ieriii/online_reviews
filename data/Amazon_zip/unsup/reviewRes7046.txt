OK, we went to q expecting great BBQ. we weren't necessarily disappointed. we ordered every appetizer. that's kinda how we roll. the hush puppies were dry. yuk. the fried green tomato's. yum. the ranch they served with them was great. we got the BBQ shrimp. it was kinda hit or miss, some were too burnt. we got the flight. yum yum yum. except for the Kobe. i expected better. My hubby loved the wings. (they were pretty good.) I would recommend this place to any Southerner visiting the windy city.
