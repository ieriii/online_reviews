This has got to be the best place for encased meats in all of Chicago. Friday and Saturday fries are awesome.  Yes, it's a meat lover's paradise (hey, I'll gladly go to a vegetarian place any day of the week), and they know it - the variety here is incredible. I don't know if I'm brave enough to face a line in winter, but I've done the two hour wait during the summer on a Saturday (there's an ice cream truck that just parks there - know your customers!). So, if you go there on a weekend (in the summer) bring either a lot of friends for convo while waiting, or a good book. Oh, and remember to bring cash, no credit (a couple of guys ahead of me had to leave the line after 2 hours finding out only by the register that it's cash only).
