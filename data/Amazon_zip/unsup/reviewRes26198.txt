The waitress was very knowledgeable and very nice. However, my alarm bells went off because she suggested the Chef Selection for the group because that'd make it easy. I didn't want too...$58 was already $15 more than I wanted to spend on actual food....but, had to...EVERYONE at the table is required if anyone wants to do the chef selection. Ok, fine. I'll do it. Experience right? Splurge. A plus...they accommodated for the vegetarians at the table and brought out some fantastic veggie side dishes when the rest of us had meat. What do I remember that was good? The little chili pepper dipped in mayo sauce was tasty. The lamb was excellent. The veggie dishes that had Murielles (spelling?) were awesome...I adore those mushrooms tho...best fungus of all. The beef...I got stuck with a butt piece so I didn't get to taste the pieces that were cooked rare...I like my meat bloody. I guess it may have been good...I did stare longingly at the red red pieces, but the little piggy in me said to share. The chef brought out some "complimentary" tator tot things topped with spicy mayo...fine, but they showed up on our table again. Seriously? If it's complimentary, send a salad or something...something we won't see again! Bacon wrapped dates...bacon was seared and way blacker than I like...if that's possible. Oh the prawns...the size of my hand (literally...I have small hands) and the heads were still attached! My Chinese self squealed with delight...too bad I wasn't comfy enough around my party to ask for their prawn heads so I could eat the brains. I think I grossed out the vegetarians that surrounded me. Sorry! That's pretty much all I can remember....Chef Selection didn't include dessert. :(
