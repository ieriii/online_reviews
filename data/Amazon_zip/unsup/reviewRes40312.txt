Went here on my birthday with my husband. We had a great time. The amuse was something raw like tartare, so I gave it to my hubby, who enjoyed it. We ordered some starters, I had the warm bacon vinegarette salad with beets. It was decent but I guess I'm not a fan of warm thick dressings, I like them more noticeable and not so smoky. For entrees I had the sausages with kraut and the watercress salad (such a huge plate, I had to take some home!) My husband had the veal and loved it. Oh and we also split the oxtail with scallops-delish!! We will be back and love that this place is walking distance from our condo. Kudos to the owners and chef!!
