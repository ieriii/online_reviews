this is the first brazilian place that i've been to and i thought it was really good. it's a place where the servers come to you with different kinds and types of meats on skewers and serve to you. you get whatever you want to eat until you can no longer eat. think of it as a dimsum restaurant, but with meat and a one time charge. it was f'in great for me. since it was my first time experiencing something like this, i thought i was in heaven - meat heaven. there was also a salad bar as well with a couple different salad mixes, sushi, cheeses, and some other stuff i don't remember. i didn't know what i was getting myself into, so i got a full plate. dumb, i know. i couldnt' eat my meat. so i just put the salad to the side and ate it whenever i felt my arteries clogging inbetween bites of meat. i seriously went meat crazy. along with everything else, there was also fried bananas (it was nicely sweet), fried polentas (didn't enjoy it as much), mashed taters, and cheese bread balls (i loved em). this is all for just 40 bucks per person for dinner. not bad. a way better deal than dimsum. the service was entirely great. i loved our host that seated us and the servers that came by. they were really attentive and great to talk to. the place was really nice. it was a bit on the dim side, but that's alright. lastly, the bathrooms were clean! next time i come here or to any similar restaurant, i'm going to prepare myself by starving myself all day. i'll bet you that dinner will taste so f'in good. that, and along with not going crazy on the salad bar. i learned my lesson.
