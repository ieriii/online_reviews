When being told that we were going to try out a place called "Wakamono"- one idiotic thought immediately came to mind: "I hope no monkeys are actually harmed..." (My limited Spanish can tell you that the word for "monkey" is "mono") To my knowledge, neither monkey nor ape has been whacked here- and that is just another good thing to add to the list of delights. I really liked this place! We normally have a problem going out for sushi. That problem tends to differ depending on if we either a) don't have a lot of money to spend and therefore leave hungry, or b) spend a lot of money in order to be satisfied, but somehow don't feel that it was completely worth it. Here- both problems were solved for us. I DEEPLY appreciated Wakamono offering a maki sampler that allowed me to devour four chef selected maki rolls for around $20. Worried that I would be given something cheap and skimpy, the sushi chefs selected a nice variety for me to try and I left completely stuffed! Plus- the maki were delicious. Bonus points for giving me a roll with grilled fresh water eel. Very good! If you come here- try out the sweet potato roll. It is worth the hype.
