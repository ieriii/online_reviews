lovely space and ambiance. good service. we thought the food and drinks were good, but not amazing. the bacon fat popcorn was a little disappointing. the popcorn did not have any bacon flavor in it. it is simply regular popcorn tossed with bacon bits and cheese. we also had the fish and chips and smokehouse burger, which were both tasty. i would not say it is a destination place, but would be a great place to have dinner if i lived in the neighborhood.
