I don't see why everyone likes this place so much. There are so many other better places to get falafel in this city. Even though it sometimes requires you to travel a bit more, I would do that because falafel should not be soggy and tasteless like it is here. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 (although it should be 1 instead of 0) is the prices. Everything seemed pretty reasonable considering what you get for the money. Of course on the other hand, most garbage is free. Plus, no credit/debit cards?!?! If you want good falafel try getting them from a place that makes them fresh to order instead of having them fester under a heat lamp for hours, it makes a difference. Cous Cous on taylor street is a MUCH better alternative.
