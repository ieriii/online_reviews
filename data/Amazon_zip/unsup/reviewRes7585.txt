If you are trying to decide between Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, I absolutely recommend Fogo de Chao. Of course, you get the Brazilian churrascaria experience at both -- endless skewers of meat and all! -- but the service at Fogo is what really sets the two apart for me. I found the service at Fogo to be much more thoughtful and less obtrusive than at Texas de Brazil. Considering that part of the experience is watching the gauchos swirl around the dining room with mouth-watering cuts of meat, constantly bombarding your table and loading up your plate, this can be hard to achieve. But I felt that my partner and I were left alone just enough at Fogo to really enjoy our meal, while at the same time never having to worry about having someone there to attend to our table. Texas de Brazil was much more hit-or-miss in its service, from what I observed. True, you'll see no "wine angels" performing trapeze acts during dinner like at Texas de Brazil, but like I said, there is enough of a show at Fogo just watching the gauchos parade throughout the dining room. Food at both places is pretty comparable, honestly, so when it comes to deciding between the two, I'll take Fogo de Chao and its excellent service.
