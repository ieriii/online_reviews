Really? I've never completed a review of Piece? Well, now's the time, I guess. First off, its New Haven style pizza, which I had never had before going to Piece. And, its pretty good. There are a ton of different toppings to throw on your pie -- artichokes, basil -- lots of good stuff.  Beyond the pizza is there brewery. They make their own beer, so its already awesome in my book. I have a collection of pint glasses from any brewery, brewpub, etc that makes/serves its own beer and my roommate was kind enough to get me one for Christmas. Its not as cool as some of the others in my collection but I'm sure I'll look back fondly on it when I don't live 4 blocks away. One annoying thing is that there is always a terrible wait on the weekends. I'm talking hour or so. It is always packed. I have met friends here for dinner with the caveat of "Call me when you get a table." Definitively worth a look, and a good place to have a good dinner and some good beer with it.
