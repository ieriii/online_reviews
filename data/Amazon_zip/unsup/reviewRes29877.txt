Something in Chicago that hasn't changed in the last 15 years!!! When I was underage, I'd come to Third coast to feel like an adult- great cafe food, coffee drinks, etc. I remember somehow being impressed that I could sit in a cafe that served alcohol- wine, beer, etc, and play chess! This was the first place I ever ate a craison. For whatever reason, I hadn't been to Third Coast in easily over 10 YEARS, so Saturday when I found myself in the area, I had a dilemma- avoid it and continue to imagine it exactly as I remembered, or go and risk being let down by another place corrupted with city growth and "progress." Was it even still around? IT WAS! And it hasn't changed one bit! I ordered a glass of champagne to celebrate! The food is still great, the atmosphere is still the same, everything is just right! I realize now that it's a pretty European feeling cafe, with drinks and simple food/salads to enjoy in addition to coffee and the normal cafe fare. The place isn't super fancy or new inside, but it's comfortable, and kind of hidden, and just the greatest. Not perfect- but perfect even in its imperfection, you know?
