Dropped in on a Wednesday night where Stella Artois and Guiness are $4. A very inviting atmosphere beautifully decorated for Christmas. The library and the fireplace help you forget about the chaos that is Broadway and Belmont. Definitely a place to take a date or catch up with a friend. Can't wait to return to eat!
