Why am I just trying this place now? This is especially tragic because from the reviews I scanned, it used to be even better prior to it's Check Please fame. I still completely enjoyed my experience here. I'll sum up my experience here with just one thing: the lamb soup came with two mini unexpected pieces of za'atar. Who can find fault in a place that serves surprise za'atar? I want to eat this right now!
