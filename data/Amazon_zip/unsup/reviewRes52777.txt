People rave about Cuban food quite a bit, but I'd never been treated to anything beyond average. Cafe 28 and Cafe Laguardia had been pretty mediocre. Then 90 Miles came along and made everything better.  BYOB. Bring Your Own Booyah. This is the secret to success that all restaurants know but most are too ashamed to admit. People love bringing their own booze. You could serve nothing but baloney on Wonderbread and people would still rave about the fact that they could bring in a six pack. If you build it, they will come, but make it BYOB first.  I like the vast majority of BYOBs, but some of them hide their average fare behind that delicious little acronym. Not 90 Miles, though. We started with the choripan, a Cuban take on bruschetta with chorizo and peppers. Excellent beginning.  Dinner was a pork tenderloin stuffed with ham, cheese, and some other things I don't remember. I'd really like to recall this dish's actual name, but several beers that evening and Father Time have fogged my memory. If you can't find it on the menu, just ask about the pork stuffed with even more pork. I couldn't even finish it, and that was the first time I'd had such a problem with Cuban food.  At the end of the meal, I'd enjoyed the food and drink so thoroughly that I almost gave our very good waiter a total of $6 on a $60 bill. A friend caught the mistake, and we all remembered why I don't normally settle the bill. Good food can confuse the mind, I guess.
