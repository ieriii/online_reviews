Wildfire has been around for a long time and for good reason, the service is consistently good and so is the food. Spinach and artichoke dip is good, chopped salad is a classic and the filet trio is great for dinner. Top it off with a little key lime pie and youve just had a darn good dinner. I think this is the dressed down version of Joes Stone Crab which is one of my favorite restaurants. I recommend it.
