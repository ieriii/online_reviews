With the exception of the weekends, this palce is great (I'm not a sports fan, so I hate that crazy game crowd, but I still gave 5 stars, because if I DID like sports, this place would be great!!). I'm usually here during the week for lunch, always getting the lunch sized white or red pizza, and a pint. I only order the beer that they themselves brew (what's the point of going to a brewery?) and have always been very pleased (which is also great, because I'm not a big beer fan!). One bad experience, once I called to see if I needed a reservation for 8 on a particular night, and the lady on the phone said no...When we arrived, and of course, there was an hour wait. Kind of annoying, but oh well. Overall, I like this place. The ingredients are quality, and the service is fine (not amazing, but all you need where they serve pizza and beer). Sometimes I pretend it's my birthday, and decide I need pizza and beer, and we go here. :)
