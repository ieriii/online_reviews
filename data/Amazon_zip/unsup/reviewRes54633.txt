Good god is the food ever incredible!!! I recommend the chicken shwarma and the falafel sandwiches. The staff is not at all friendly, even when they're not busy, but they make some fantastic food. The expanded facility is really quite nice, and the similarly expanded salad bar (more of a buffet, really) is divine. Really tasty and not too expensive!It gets BUSY around dinner time, so be prepared for that. The wait is worth it, though, and the place isn't nearly as cramped now that they've expanded and updated.
