This is one of the best, hippest restaurants in Chicago. The wine list is deep, interesting, and, surprisingly well priced, by the glass 1/3 carafe half carafe and bottle for many vintages. I asked the waitress to choose a couple for me. I had two Riojas that I'd never tried before that were out of this world.  The food is tapas style. About five dishes make up a meal pretty well for two. The filet on the bone was exceptional, as was the Serrano ham and duck egg on the piece of toast. You can get a cheese and cured meats plate, and more than a dozen other exotic combinations of this and that that were all tasty. The deserts rock too. Try the sandwiches with the bananas and Nutella. They were a wow. The only let-down in our sampling were the sardines. They were fried (not indicated on the menu) and the frying did not do them well. I would have preferred a bit more of the salad underneath and the delicacy of the sardine that wasn't toughened up by the frying. The Purple Pig is small, with big elevated family style tables and a healthy number of tables for two. Two big purple umbrellas cover the front of their patio in the summer, which is where you should be. The other part of the deck is line to get in. There you should not be. Come early (before 6) if you don't like waits in the summer. I'm not a Chicagoan so I can't say what works in the winter. The individual dishes are not badly priced, but together with the wines or the bar the evening can get a bit spendy. If you visit one restaurant while in town, depart from the traditional and head down Michigan Avenue just a couple of blocks before you get to the Wrigley building.
