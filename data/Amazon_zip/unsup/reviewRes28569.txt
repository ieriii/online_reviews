i use to say that lou malnatti's was the only acceptable deep dish in chicago...but pequod's has trumped that. i'm not a deep dish fan. i think giordano's and gino's east is all bread and a choking hazard waiting to happen. but pequod's and lou's changed my mind on that front...helping me realize that there are some redeemable qualities for deep dish. pequod's is crispy as hell...almost burnt, but not. buttery and not too doughy. it's a lil dive, just the kind of chi spots i love and right across the street from the webster movie theater if you wanna do dinner and movie.
