We ordered a Pizza for pick-up last Sunday and were told that it would be ready at about 7:00pm. When we got there at 7:05pm we were told that it would be a couple more minutes but at 7:25pm when our pizza was still mysteriously MIA we asked how much longer it was going to be. The person who had previously told us it would be "a couple more minutes" went to check and upon their return, we asked if the pizza had even been put into the oven, we were met with a look of confusion and were told, "I think so." NEVER AGAIN! I understand that things can sometimes fall through the cracks and that people make mistakes but when I show up and rather than owning up to the oversight you lie to me and let me stand there waiting without saying anything once you realize that it is going to be longer than expected is ridiculous. If you knew there was an issue and it wasn't going to be ready at the time you had originally given me, you should have called me and let me know (you had my number). If you didn't realize there was an issue with the order until I arrived you should have TOLD ME THE TRUTH as soon as you knew whether that was right when I walked up and gave you my name or after I had been standing there waiting for nearly half an hour.
