This is one of those grossly overpriced restaurants that compensate for lackluster food with a trendy atmosphere. My boyfriend and I came for dinner and like most reviews state, it is VERY loud making it very hard to hold a conversation. We got the pork belly ban bao (buns), baked seafood dynamite roll (kani, scallop, ebi, roe, avocado, scallions, cucumber, dynamite sauce,tempura crumbs), crunchy pig hidden lobster roll (soy paper, lobster, avocado, jalapeno, sweet chili sauce, tempura crumbs, bacon) and the Sunda house specialty sushi spicy tuna with crispy rice and jalapeno.  The pork belly ban bao was smoothered with hoison sauce and pickled slaw. Unfortunately, it masked the taste of the pork belly. This is a common theme with some of the dishes we tried here. Same thing with the rolls, they add so many extra things to the rolls that you couldn't really decipher what you were eating (if that makes sense - see pics).  I must say the one saving grace of our meal were the Sunda specialty sushi. I never thought to have sushi with crispy rice before but whoever thought of this is a genius!
