Holy pancakes, Batman! We went on a Saturday at 1pm and finally got seated around 2pm...and it was SO worth the wait! I was indecisive between the pancakes, french toast and omelet. I asked the waitress and her recommendation was the ricotta lemon blueberry pancakes with whatever kind of yummy spread comes with it..and oh. my. god. Seriously, those are hands-down the best pancakes I've ever had in my life..and I don't even really like lemon that much! But the 3 flavors blend together so perfectly, it's insane. My husband, who is picky picky picky when it comes to food, was enamored by the pancakes as well. I would go stand in that line every weekend just to get me some of those crack-laced pancakes. No joke, you must go.
