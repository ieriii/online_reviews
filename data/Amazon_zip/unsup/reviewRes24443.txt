En garde! Prepare to spear the shrimp and do so quickly lest you miss it altogether. Let's just say that this is not your typical tapas shared food experience. The servings are smaller and not the family-style portions you may have come to expect if you frequent Cafe Iberico and Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. What Mercat is though, is a sophisticated dining experience in a lovely setting with huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the southern end of Grant Park. The portions may be small but they are exquisitely presented and complemented by the best white wine sangria I've had in years. The service was attentive without being intrusive. They won me over with the sublime Braised Goat Ravioli that they made especially for the Cubs Convention. Mercat's way of keeping it real, Chicago style.  ;) Must-haves: Setas al Horno (Wild Mushrooms), Tocino con Cidra (Pork Belly in Cider Glaze) and any tapas with goat meat, which they prepare to tender perfection.
