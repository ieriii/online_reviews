I just ate here today. If you are someone that eats Sushi a lot I would be surprised if you like this place. I am amazed at all these 5 star reviews. I had three different rolls and they were all terrible. Tasteless, mushy, just plain bad. It isn't cheap like some people are claiming. It's the same as any other sushi place in general but the rolls are much, much worse. The crab rangoon however was awesome so it isn't all bad. Just dont go there for sushi.
