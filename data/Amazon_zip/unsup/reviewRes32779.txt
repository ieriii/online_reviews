(4.5 stars) While I can't compare Demera to other Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago, it is probably the best I've encountered anywhere else in years. The injera was fantastic and the rest of the vegetarian Messob was outstanding. My friend was completely taken with the beets -- sweet and delectable -- and I couldn't get enough collard greens. The lentils and all of the other veggies on the tray were equally well prepared and unique. Had I been alone, and had the salad (fine, but mundane by comparison) not been anchoring the center of the tray, I might have finished every bit of injera *and* licked the tray. If only I didn't have to fly to get there!
