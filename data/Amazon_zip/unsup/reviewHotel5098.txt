For your buck you get a very nice hotel that has an amazing view if you can get lake side. Do yourself a favor and stay out of the mini fridge or you just might be drinking a $7 Evian water. Pretty ridiculous. The downstairs lounge is a nice place to relax and watch a game or the connecting Kitty O'shears Bar has a nice outdoor seating area. The room was very nice and comfortable. The bathroom was immaculate and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. I usually do not sleep that much, but i just couldn't get out of bed because of the comfort. I also had a late reservation and they accommodated me very well.
