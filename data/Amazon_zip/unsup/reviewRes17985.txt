I want to give this place 4 stars, I really do, but I didn't have anything that stood out. SO, I guess I found it a little boring. And good Lord! There's like 3 items on the menu that don't involve heavy cream or oil sauce. Please. Pretty please, vary the menu, chef. I know there are Italian dishes out there not intended to hasten my death due to clogged arteries. Otherwise, the atmosphere was great. It's very home-y feeling. A little on the pricey side for such a lack of variety (I kid you not the menu mostly read cheese, cheese with cream, cream, cream with tomato, cheese) though the portions are pretty large. I can't say I'll be back anytime soon without being dragged, but the experience here was overall, A-ok.
