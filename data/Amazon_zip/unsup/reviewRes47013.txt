This review is limited to the take out, observations, and the overall environment. First, the carryout; it was ready earlier than promised. The food was better than expected. Second, the outdoor dining. At night, it still looked appealing.  Third, the indoor bar; the selection was noteworthy with a variety of local American spirits (e.g. Death's Door, North Shore, etc.). There were a few single malts, one of which I would order and quite a few wine bottles. Parking was not a challenge, but I came late in the evening. The bar and indoor ambiance may have been inherited from the former Speakeasy Restaurant, but its noteworthy. Now, I have to find time to stay and sit down. I have heard raving reviews about the farmers market Friday's. The Friday market is a neat and unique touch that catapults UG-Devon above other similar restaurants. Some should check out the Friday Market before commenting. Maybe they picked the wrong day.
