The best Chinese food I have had in Chicago. Extremely authentic as close to China as you can get. The duck is amazing and the prices are too. They don't deliver but, just order over the phone and double park with a friend on argyle to pick it up. Deffinatly worth the trouble. A little hard to park in this area but worth a try if you wanna sit down and get some great grub. Beef Fried Rice (amazing) Duck Soup for 4 dollars is a steal. Maybe it is $3.50 Egg Rolls to die for. Chinese Vegetables fresh and cooked to perfection. Atmosphere inside isn't amazing but for the food alone its worth it . You cannot go wrong for Chinese food.
