Sushi X...I have such a love/hate relationship with you. You have the best sushi in town! I love your godzilla roll and crab rangoon roll. I love your mysterious vibe and peculiar location. I love your hip menus and awesome website (who designed these?). But I really hate your service. And I really hate having to wait for a table in your small restaurant on the weekend...you really are just too small!  But, in the end, the love definitely wins out! There are few places that I can put up with such bad service, but for you I will do it. And besides, I can always order delivery from you, so this relationship is defintely going to last a long time!
