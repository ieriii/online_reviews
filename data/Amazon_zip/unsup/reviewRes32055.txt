I have been visiting the diner religiously for many, many years. I was so disappointed the last time we went that I do not even care if I ever go back. The food portions have shrunk to ridiculously small portions. We could usually share and have enough left over to take home and I ate my entire meal and was still hungry...that never happens here! (Look at my original review...I even talked about how huge the portions are!) To make it even worse, the prices have gone up dramatically. I could justify $12 for a sandwich when I had half a sandwich to take home but this is getting ridiculous.
