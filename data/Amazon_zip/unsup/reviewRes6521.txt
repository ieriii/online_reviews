Davanti was an absolute delicious restaurant. 4 of my friends and I went to Davanti because we wanted to try somewhere new. The only downfall of this place is that there are no reservation and they make you wait until the entire party arrives (which means we missed out on being able to sit down right away). instead we ended up having to wait and hour and a half. The manager could tell we were getting restless, so he brought us over a comped appetizer to try. The Foccacia di Recco was phenomenal. When we sat finally sat down, we thought the atmosphere was soooo cute.  The rest of our meal was absolutely delicious.  We had the grilled asparagus, Bruschette, Riccio di Marie e Granchio, Pizza con Salsiccia e Rapini, Riccota & honeycomb, and the heirloom tomatos. Everything was delciious , and i would recommend all dishes.
