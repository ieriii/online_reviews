I went here for the second time last weekend. The food was great. Even though I live in the West Loop, I don't get down to Greek town as much as I should. Greek Islands may have me visiting more. We went there on a Saturday night at about 8 pm. For a table of four, they told us it would be a 20 minute wait...so not too bad. We were pleasantly surprised when they called our table in about 5 minutes. The decor was fine, but the place is loud. This was fine with me as we weren't coming here for a romantic dinner but coming here to eat! I was craving some Gyros but didn't want to come to this restaurant and only get that. So i got the combo dinner with the Gyro and the Chicken Riganati. The Gyro meat was one of the best that I've had and the Chicken Riganati was so good. It was juicy and flavorful. I would go back to get just that. My wife got the Dolmades. She liked it but I wasn't a huge fan of the grape leaves...maybe I just don't know how to eat like a Greek. Overall this is great place for affordable Greek food.
