Came here on a Saturday night for a first date. We had a bit of trouble finding the place (as most speakeasies are) since the door blended in to the wall because of the paint. Once we got in there was about 10 people in front of us so it looked like we may have had to wait a while but it was only about 20 min. The people in line were fun to talk to as well. Once we got in, I surprised at the size, most speaks I've ever been to (in NYC) are on the smaller side but this place was much larger than usual. Not a huge deal though since the chairs were so large they pretty much cut off the opposide side portion of the lounge. The drink list was good, nothing particularly spectacular but solid nonetheless. I would suggest this place as a cool spot to bring a date, probably won't make this a regular occurance though.
