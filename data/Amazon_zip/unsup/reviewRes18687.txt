Went there for my husbands birthday with our 3 girls that are 7-11 yrs old. Sat us quickly but then never came back! It was a Monday night and there seemed to be 2 parties or large gatherings going on so it was really loud! I mean these people were whooping it up loud. Any how... my husband went to the bar to ask for menus and they told him to sit down that they would bring them. Ok then... Ordered our food from the not so friendly waiter who seemed like he was a part owner pr part family. They wanted to charge us $12 to split a dish for 2 little girls...kind of crazy. The dishes were $16 each so it wasn't worth splitting it. Bill on a Monday night for a family of 5 with no drinks (only water an no apptz!) was $165. It tasted good and the portions were really large so we took home a meal for another night. For what its worth...
