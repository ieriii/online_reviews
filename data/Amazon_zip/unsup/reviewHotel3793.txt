*This review is for the downstairs bar at the Dana Hotel A friend suggested we head to the Dana Hotel for drinks after dinner. The bar area was small but we were able to snag a seat by window. This isn't a place I would hang out normally but I did like it because: 1) It had great people watching from some dude that looked like a professional wrestler with his ultra-blonde girlfriend to cute foreign guys (several were French), to some guy that got out of a Bentley convertible. Also, there were several drop dead gorgeous black women working here. 2) The drinks were STRONG. Like scrunch up your face and make a noise strong. If you're gonna pay $10+ for a drink in my book, it better be strong. Sangria was tasty. 3) I dug the dcor. We checked out the upstairs/hotel check-in area. It was cool-swanky. After this experience I wouldn't mind trying out their upstairs bar, Vertigo, for a special night out.
