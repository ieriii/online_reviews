My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, lovely place with great decor. Inviting and staff is extraordinary, this new restaurant knows how to please their customers. We were seated in the bar area, some people may be offended being sat here but it was a lively atmosphere with a live pianist. The food was delicious I started with the wedge salad which was great. My boyfriend had the French onion soup, some of the best Ive tasted. We both had steak for our main coarse great flavor and charred to perfection. The gnocchi side dish with crab was also delicious and wealth worth the price! Mastro's also gave me a delicious piece of chocolate cake with happy birthday and a candle and presented it elegantly without singing a nice surprise to end the night! One of the best steak houses Ive been to!
