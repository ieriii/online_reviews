Can I ask a question? Who the fuck does Piece think it is? Piece is slowly turning into the new Kuma's. And not in the good, gotta-have-that-food way. But in the two-hour-VIP-waiting list-bullshit kinda way. Seriously, I remember the days you could just walk into piece during dinner time, get a table for four, inhale your peetz and move on. Now, you have to devote your entire evening because they have singles karaoke or some crap like that. The pizza is good, don't get me wrong. But I'm not going to wait 3 hours on a Tuesday afternoon for it. It's not cheap and the ambience is decent. I mean, the prices and the wait really aren't worth having to eat your pizza underneath the pan they serve it on that's as big as the table itself. And, my gays tell me that one time they went there and ordered a large pizza and an appetizer for the two of them and the waitress judged them saying it was "a lot of food" or something. If that were me, that's when my famous "no tip" line would be cued. Piece is a disappointment all-around. From the lack of parking, to the pretentious wait list to the mediocre service, I'd rather get a Hot-n-ready and call it a day.
