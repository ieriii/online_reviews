I like this place. They totally beared with me during a ridiclous credit card mix-up, and were accommodating and NICE about it. Nice lounge, sushi place there is eh, but it's fast if you need something quick. Meeting rooms are well-appointed, albeit too cold...but the hotel food was good. Close walk to everything-nice. I knock a star for the smell in the bathrooms. UGH. It wasn't just in my room. A friend of mine who happened to be attending the same conference had this issue too. Nothing really made it subside. So all in all, a positive experience. I'd stay here again as long as the bathroom smelled better.
