Took my Mom here for her birthday in September this year. I was a little hesitant as she is not a huge meat-eater. However she absolutely loved it and so did I. Each select cut of meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection! Not to mention you could get full from the immense salad bar alone! Everything was fresh, and the service was pretty good even though we went on a pretty busy evening.
