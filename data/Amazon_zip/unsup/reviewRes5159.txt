I had read nice things about this place, and since it's next door to where I work, I really wanted to go. Just prior to leaving, two co-workers said "don't go, that place is disgusting". The only thing disgusting is how terrible my co-workers' taste in food is. I would not say "OMG, you MUST go here" but seriously everything we had was really good. Cheese plate, pork shoulder, butternut squash, fried bread balls, pate....everything was really enjoyable. We hit it up at 1pm on a weekday, it was still pretty full, but winding down. You could tell that it must be tight at noon.  It is small plate dining, but everything was so rich that two people couldn't come close to finishing our five small plates. Add in a couple of drinks and the bill was onlly $55, so it's truly affordable to eat here. Our server was pretty knowledgable about the spices used and it was fun to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare meals on hot plates. I would definitely come back.
