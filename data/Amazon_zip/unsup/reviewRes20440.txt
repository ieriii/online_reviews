I feel like I must have missed the charm of this place, somehow. It's so well reviewed, but at least on the night I was there, the experience was lacking. The Gage was insanely packed on a random Monday night at 8 PM, and brutally noisy. The waitstaff was slammed and hardly had time to glance our way, let alone provide decent service. I also found the beer list to be ludicrously, almost insultingly overpriced. Seven bucks for a Negro Modelo? Really? Sure, the food was tasty, but the atmosphere and general experience were so wearing that I didn't really enjoy my meal. I doubt I'll be back.
