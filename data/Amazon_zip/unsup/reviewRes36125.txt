I've got pretty high standards for Chinese food because A.) I am in fact Chinese, B.) my mom cooked a lot when I was young and she's Chinese, and C.) something else about being from the Middle Kingdom. That being said, the roast duck here is "hella good" (cribbing my Bay Area brethren) and I liked the 3-course presentation with the standard Beijing roast duck (it's not called "peeking duck" you plebes) on fluffy gua bao, a light soup made with vegetables and silky duck broth, and a very serviceable plate of kinda-dry but fully dressed duck fried rice. What goes quack quack? We tried some of the other dishes and my buddy there at the table who is a certified Cantonese Frank Bruni informed me that the soy sauce chicken and roasted pork got a big fat goose egg - fail. How are you gonna do a Guangdong brother like that Sun Wah? Way to stick the 3-pointers and miss the free throws, guys... your comfort zone is showing. This place is BYOB and most people take advantage whether keepin it real with a sixer of Tsingtao, classing it up with a couple bottles of vino or gettin it in with my personal favorite - fruit punch 4loko. Just kidding, don't do that.
