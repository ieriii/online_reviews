What can I say? Wa-wa-we-wa. This place was delicious. First and foremost. The creativity is superb when it comes to this tapas joint. Jose Garces is genius, and has picked a very well trained staff to maintain Mercat A La Planxa. Came here for the first time in April for my birthday and still think about it. It also doesn't help that I work across the street and around six to seven o'clock the vents are pouring out savory smoke from the kitchen's that just smells like heaven. I was with 8 people when I went and we all had the chef's tasting menu which I recommend. We decided to just have excessive amounts of sangria and Absinthe for desert instead of the additional wine pairings. I do have to take ONE star off for service. When spending over a G on a meal you want start to finish steady service. I do think that an automatic gratuity over parties of six doesn't help that situation. So all throughout about 85 percent of the meal the service was impecable. But for the last fifteen percent it tailed off to let's say, non-existence. Couldn't get the check let alone see the server anywhere inside the restaurant. Could've been in the bathroom or havin a smoke, but either way unacceptable. So in conclusion, go here for dinner not lunch or brunch. Make reservations, have the tasting menu, and don't be suprised if the service has a tendancy to lack during your dining adventure.
