What a surprise! This place is a classy American diner, and it fits in so well with Michigan Ave. We started our meal with the Scotch Egg...it had incredible potential but it was fairly over-salted and un-flavorful for a sausage covered egg. The Beet Salad though was fantastic, with great colors and presentation along with the sweetness of beet and citrus. The hand roasted Brisket Sandwich is open faced and absolutely delicious! The Salmon Sandwich my girlfriend ordered was also equally great, both came with delicious fries. Overall if you focus on the sandwiches, you should really have a great meal.
