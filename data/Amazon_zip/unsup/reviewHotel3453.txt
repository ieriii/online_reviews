Pro's: Price. You cant find much of a better deal on Michigan Avenue then you will at The Allerton. With all applicable fees + taxes our room was $140/night.  Location: Right in the heart of Chicago. A short walk to downtown, the river, and all sorts of shopping and restaurants. Cheap cab ride to the musuems and the Sears Tower/Union Station area. Style: I love the old school feel of certain hotels so I'm biased, but the Allerton was outstanding in this regard. After a few drinks in the bar it wouldnt have been a far stetch to visualize it as being the 1920's...except for that whole Prohibition thing. Service: The front desk attendants were somewhat standoffish, but all other hotel personel were very friendly. Con's: Tempurature: It was fairly warm in our room and we couldnt lower the thermometer to offset the heat. It seemed to be an innacurate read. Overall not too bad, just something we noticed. This all being said I would recommend The Allerton to anyone. It's a great experience overall.
