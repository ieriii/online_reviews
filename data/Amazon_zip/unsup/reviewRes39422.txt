Basically you just go here and order some raw meat. Then they bring you out a little grill on which to cook your meat. They also bring out like a million bowls of little unidentifiable stuff. You're supposed to eat that with the meat I think. Anyway, it's really really really good. And it's open really really really late. So you can go there in the wee hours after you've finished dousing your brain cells. It's never too crowded late, either. I don't know why this has three dollar signs ($$$). I would argue that it's pretty cheap if you go there with a lot of people. Tip from me: be careful that you don't stuff yourself silly. It's easy to do here. Also look really carefully at what you eat before you put it in your mouth. There was this little bowl that looked like it was full of noodles. Except upon closer inspection, we found that they were not noodles, but they were some kind of fish. They had eyes. And gills and scales. Gross. Also, it's fun to throw stuff on the grill besides meat. Like the stuff in the bowls, ice from your cup, or your chopsticks. And it doesn't matter how you say the name, just say four syllables of some Korean sounding word and everyone will know what you're talking about. Plus it's cooler than saying the real name.
