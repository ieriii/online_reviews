The girlfriend and I stumbled into this place knowing nothing about it and we walked away in love. I've only dined in once and was blown away at how friendly everyone was. The waiter recommended an appetizer for us that we devoured and told us about their amazing BYOB policy. Living in the immediate area has afforded me the opportunity to try every sandwich on the menu, and though I love them all my favorite is the Lechon Sandwich. A friendly, happy staff and great food is a combination that keeps me stopping in for take-out a few times a month.
