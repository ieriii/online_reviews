Finally a restaurant that doesn't serve any meat whatsoever. Lots of options to chose from, a little wine/cocktail/beer list, awesome appetizers and sides, and even a kid's menu. Its a cute home-y atmosphere. Nice and friendly waiters. Right off the Halsted/Roscoe bus stop. Its a great place to even if you aren't vegetarian! My only complaint is that its always crowded and there's always been a wait. They need to open a second floor or something!
