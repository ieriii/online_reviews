Good quality Neapolitan pizza- just like it says at the door-they are a verified true Neopolitan pizza - pretty impressive since the standards in Italy are very high!!!! Having been to Naples, Italy many times ove, I find this crust to not be as thin as in Naples BUT its really good with sufficient topping and its ridiculously chewy and tasty! If you love crust, you'll love this pizza since like a 1/3 of the pizza is crust! It's good pizza, quality toppings. We just got back from Italy a week ago and it was great to feel like we were still eating in Italy with this pizza : ) Come here if you are looking for a good Neapolitan pizza or a good thinner pizza with an old school Italian list of toppings! Enjoy!
