As a graphic designer, seeing the Bad Apple logo/mascot/whatever it is literally HURTS MY SOUL. It's horrible. And the fact that they plaster it everywhere, and painted it all over the bathroom, makes me physically ill. Buuuuuut. With that said. It's a really good bar. The decor is super swanky. It's actually pretty clean too, which is a big plus for a bar. The beer selection is EXCELLENT. I don't even like beer, but I am completely obsessed with this Lindeman's Framboise that they have on tap. It's like raspberry soda and so addicting. Their mixed drinks are also excellent! Their burgers are pretty awesome, though I'm not a huge burger fan, so it doesn't mean much to me. Their truffle fries and old bay fries are soooooo gooooood. The best part of this bar, though, is the back game room. There are all these board games you can choose from and play with your friends! I know I'm a nerd, but I LOVE board games. I blame my mother, for not providing them to me when I was little, and now my adult self has to make up for lost time by trying to make all my friends play board games with me. Bad Apple certainly makes the little board-game-deprived girl in me very happy. :)
