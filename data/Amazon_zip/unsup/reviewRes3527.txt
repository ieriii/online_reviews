I've lived within a few blocks of Crisp since they opened, but for some moronic reason i STILL had not been there. That all changed last night when I decided that my time had finally come. It's probably best that I waited for so long, because now I'm going to be forced to eat here on a regular basis. I could not make up my mind, so I went with what some would see as boring, the BBQ Super Strips, but holy crap were they delicious. My friend had the Chi-town Chicken burrito, it was hella delicious, and HUGE. Crisp is so great... friendly staff, affordable, delicious food within walking distance, and I gotta say it... I love the logo. There are restaurants I refuse to go to because of poor design, so the Funke Chicken logo just makes Crisp even better.
