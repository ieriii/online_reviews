I do have a culinary background so I can be a little biased...but the best dining experience I have had - EVER!!! The food was exquisite, but I was MORE blown-away by the service. The service was perfectly executed!!! Each course was like a work of art-perfectly blended with aroma, texture, taste, and presentation. Of course, with this type of food expertise and service, it all comes with a price...and it wasn't cheap. But it was well worth it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!
