We went to Fox & Obel since I read it's a foodie gourmet grocery store. It's very nice for downtown Chicago.  They have a fancy looking cafe - didn't eat here. Also, a more casual take out counter for ready made food. Bakery, cheeses, fish market, meats, gourmet stuff. Oh, it's nice. We got some ready made sandwiches for the plane ride back to Calif. About $7 ea. Terry's Toffee Hazelicious - made in Chicago. It's only a small box 4oz and about $10, but tasty. I got 2 Vosges bar: Mo's Dark Bacon Bar $7.49 and Black Pearl Bar $7.49 Credit cards taken.
