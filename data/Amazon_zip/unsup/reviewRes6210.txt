This place had great food, a wide array of choices, and a lively atmosphere that would suit a range of desires. The noise and bustle of the dining area make it a ban candidate for a romantic date, but great for friends, family, or a chilled out night to get to know someone. Tried a range of dishes from pastas and pizzas to polenta and salads and everything was done well. I'd try to list them but we ordered way too many and it was all just so good. Make a rez if you can or be prepared for a short-medium length wait as Davanti is clearly on a lot of people's radars. Reasonably priced with friendly and decently knowledgeable/attentive wait staff.
