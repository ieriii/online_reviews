The Palmer House was an enormous disappointment. Sure the lobby is nice, but the room was shabby. Right in downtown Chicago, Hilton has managed to create the kind of room I'd expect to find in a Motel wedged between a whorehouse and an airport runway deep in a Florida swamp.The room we had was tiny and worn out; the carpet was faded, the wallpaper was peeling, the sink wouldn't drain and the cheap and cheesy "Empire" furniture was stained and scratched. The room was also very noisy. The constant rattle and hum of the building's mechanical systems was on par with a flight on a regional jet. This wheezing symphony of air conditioning and elevators was punctuated occasionally by the three-year-old-with-kettle-drum sound of the showers in the adjacent rooms. Finally, the room was humid. No matter how we set the AC, the room, the sheets, the towels, everything felt damp.If you drive, be prepared to pay their "specially arranged" exorbitant parking fee, in our case it was a third the cost of the room, at the garage across the street. No, there's no connecting bridge or walkway between the garage and the hotel.Those are all the ways I can remember that this hot mess of a hotel disappointed us. If I remember any more, I'll be sure to ammend this review.
