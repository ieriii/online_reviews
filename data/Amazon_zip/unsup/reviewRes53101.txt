Finally, REAL Cuban food in Chicago! It took me what....three years to find this place (thanks for the heads up Johnny T). This is as close as Chicago is going to get to authentic Cuban food like the diners back home in Miami. This is what I am use to...and I had my friend come along with me who is also from Miami living in Evanston. Let's see...croquetas are Caserita brand but who cares! Pastelito de guayaba- imported from Miami- Yum! Tostones-- I love these but next time I will order garlic on the side (they do that too in Miami) Frita, Pan con Bistec, and Picadillo hit the spot! OMG, I'm so happy. It's a BYOB place and its casual, with some great salsa music playing in the background. They cater and hold private parties there. The service was super friendly and we got to meet the owner. We Cubans have to stick together ya know! ESPECIALLY when it comes to food!! Oh, my son devoured his steak sandwich. It was a beautiful breezy day and we sat outside in the patio. You have to come try this place especially if you can't make it to Miami. This is as close as it is going to get.
