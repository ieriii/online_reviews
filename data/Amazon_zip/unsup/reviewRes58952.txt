We went to Sunda recently and were seated right away. The decor is beautiful with a modern asian touch. We arrived early, but by the time we left the restaurant was full and becoming very loud. The food was outstanding. Absolutely delicious and beautiful presented. We would absoultely recommend this restaurant. Try the beef lollipops!
