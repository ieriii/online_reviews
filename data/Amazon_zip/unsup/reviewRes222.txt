Ambiance: 4 stars - Nice. Modern. No music (that could be a plus or minus depending on your preference). My particular seat in the house faced a boring corner, but the glimpses I got of the restaurant were...zen. Service:  5 stars - Impeccable. Perfect. Not pretentious. Attentive but not smothering. Very informed. We were the rowdy table and the servers rolled with us; but still laid down the law when we were out of line (no flash photography!). Saw a couple of the servers at Violet Hour later and they were very gracious and sweet. Food: 3 stars - We did the 20+ course tour, half did the wine pairing as well. I really tried to keep my expectations down about the food because I didn't want to be disappointed. Out of 23 we saw, I licked my lips for maybe 6 of them. My stomach literally churned at the sight of one course - the Black Truffle. I've mentioned my dislike of the overuse of truffle before; this was an explosion of truffle - blech. I tired of the pudding texture presented as a cube. The courses that wowed really wowed. Tastes and flavors I didn't think would go well together but were wonderful - sweet onion and rhubarb? Who would have thought it! My friends who did the wine pairings were impressed and enjoyed the wine more than the food (I think). Presentation was exquisite. A great dining adventure that I only need to experience once. I'm giving it three stars because Alinea needs to be taken down a notch. I feel that the overabundance of 5 star reviews is deceiving and skews perception.
