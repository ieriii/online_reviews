Wow I've never been so disappointed by such a well-known restaurant. The flavors were just OFF. I went with my colleagues and none of us liked our dishes. I went with the scallops, my colleagues had the pheasant, pig and then we got a bunch of the oyster tasters. I had a read a review that the scallops were so good you left wanting more, but honestly i couldn't even eat half of my dish. It just didn't taste good! Then we ended with this chocolatey/marshmallow dessert. It tasted great but literally took 25 minutes to come out (apparently they "overtorched" the marshmallows) so it sort of ruined it. The service was also somewhat slow. I really wanted to love this restaurant after the great reviews, stellar reputation and beautiful pictures on the website.... but it was just bad. There are so many restaurants in Chi to try and not worth the risk going here!
