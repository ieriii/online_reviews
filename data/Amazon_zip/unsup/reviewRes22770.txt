So I while back I wrote a review on the Oatmeal shake. It was not what I expected at all...... It was chunky and full of ice. I wrote a non-stellar review of it. The owner than asked me to come back and try one for free, just bring in the email and he'll make it. I really don't want to get free things from hard working small shops unless I'm a regular. I also didn't want to have him know that by making it extra smooth he'll get a great review. So I chose not to use that email for a free shake. I went back and ordered a shake (with my own money), and it was great. I really enjoyed it. My guess was last time they were just busy and didn't have as much time to put into making such a tastey treat.
