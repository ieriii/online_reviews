My first visit, late in the evening on a frigid Tuesday, could be called many things, mostly synonyms of 'excellent' and 'satisfying.' After waiting in line for a healthy half hour, we started with flan and chocolato (get the Barca thick with dulce de leche) and the antsiness just melted away. I went with the carnitas caldo, my compatriots with the woodland mushroom and pepito tortas, all expertly constructed and very flavorful. The caldo in particular was just the thing for a freezing December night, perfectly spiced, fresh and green with a fantastic mixture of flavor and texture. Filling too; we had come in starving and finished stuffed. I only have one question: wtf is chayote? And is it really necessary? It's like some crazy botanist woke up one morning and said, 'I know! We'll cross an apple with a potato!' We finished with fresh churros and ice cream for desert. So much to love about the place; there's basis for the hype. The quality and selection are very well priced, and even though the place bears a more-than-passing resemblance to the ambience of a Chipotle, there are some nice touches amid the cramped bustle like big glass coolers of sparkling and still mineral water and quick, attentive service. But yeah. Come for the food. I will definitely be back again.
