Yum yum yum. This is a great little Italian place with friendly, knowledgeable waiters and incredible food.  I ordered the salmon and it was fantastic (and I normally don't even like salmon that much).  Additionally, I was forced to try some of this spinach appetizer thing, and it was insanely good.  Very much enjoyed my wine as well.  One problem: I don't like how tightly packed you are in there - this isn't New York - we have room! But I deal with it because the food is delish!
