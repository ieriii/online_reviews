Randomly went on a Saturday night and it wasn't at all what I was expecting. To sum it up I was pleasantly surprised. A quick yelp search of "fried chicken" and there was Big Jones. I really had a hinkering for fried chicken. On the drive to Andersonville I already had a down home meal picked out in my mind. It said casual under attire - I was in jeans, sneakers, and a tshirt. They serve breakfast. And with a name like big jones, I really didn't think I was bargaining for sophisticated southern, that's what I'm calling it. BJ's fried chicken is unlike any other fried chicken I have ever had, the crunch they obtained on that chicken breast was stellar. Other standouts: corn bread, pimento cheese, vinegar coleslaw, fried okra...AND the service. Looking forward to coming back, will save room for dessert and probably get the red velvet cake. p.s. Felt a little under dressed, I was dressed more for a night out at target than date night. I got over that quickly. Casual yes, but casual nice.
