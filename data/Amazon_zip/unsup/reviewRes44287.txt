I love this place!  I usualy head to Cost for Sushi - but this place is becoming a new favorite spot of mine! They are byob, but they also have a limited wine/beer menu in case you don't have time to grab booze. The service is great, and quick! The food is great - both the sushi and the non-sushi items....and not too pricey either. They don't take reservatioins, but because they are so quick with the food the wait isn't usually too long. Well worth the trip! The crab with cream cheese (rangoon type) appetizer is so good! And the teriyaki shrimp is fantastic too! The rolls are yummy....and very fresh! And don't forget the jalepeno Miso - if you are a fan of Miso this is a must try!!
