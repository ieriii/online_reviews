I hesitate to write this review, only because I'm sure it's all been said before. . . but Carnivale was an excellent experience. It felt more than a little touristy, and the decor made me feel like I was at Opera (same designer. . . must be), but our server, Michael, was impeccable. Really and truly. I often hesitate to say to a server, "it's our first time" only because I hate schpiels. Or maybe I just hate them at The Macaroni Grill (oh, for shame). Regardless, I was grateful for his suggestions, and my husband and I trusted him the entire way through, from first course to dessert. He was extremely attentive and effusive with kindness even on a busy Friday night. Personally, I appreciate the segmented dining. We were totally put in the couple's room, a nice quiet atmosphere with a mosaic of fun bottles of top shelf alcohol. Good marketing for what turned out to be my first experience with Caipirinha. I will have it again. Many times. Delicious. Though it was good, I'm not sure how soon we will be back for us but I would love to take out of towners there. It's an impressive atmosphere with food that delivers. The flan was outstanding and I could literally eat their chips and guacamole for weeks on end. When a place can get the basics right, it's one I'm willing to trust with the chef's best shot. Ay, ay, ay!
