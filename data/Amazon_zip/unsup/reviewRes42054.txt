I very much like Vietnamese food. I've been to Tank a few times, and I like it fine. And the menu is huge. I always get variations on the same theme--rice-noodle soups with various combinations of primarily seafood. I've had more flavorful, richer, more complex pho elsewhere on Argyle, but Tank's is still tasty enough. The selection of basil, sprouts and greens etc. served alongside seems to vary a bit in quantity and combination, probably depending on season and mood, but it's always fresh. There's a ton of seating, so even if there are a couple of people in front of you, it's usually quick going. I like the bustling vibe there, and we've always had friendly, attentive servers. Also, they use admirably large water glasses--probably good for them (less time spent filling) and definitely good for me.
