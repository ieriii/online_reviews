Never really knew Koreans were known for their chicken but the wings here were quite tasty. I'd vote yes! I suppose they're better than my usual KFC buckets, more flavor and tasty! They also have the Korean rice bowls. The small size is already a pretty good size if you're looking for a good portion. If you want more, they also have the bigger bows as well. I'd go back!
