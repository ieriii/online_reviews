I have wanted to give lunch a try since Xoco opened but my wife was hesitant since the breakfast was very disappointing. As she says, we tried it now shut up and we are no going back! We started off with the Pickled Pig Feet Tostada, two 3" round corn chips with a mound of vegetables and pig feet combined $4.50. Almost like a ceviche. Then an order of guacamole, salsa and chips. Very small portion of guacamole and chips for $6.50. I had the Short rib chile soup $12. Not bad had good flavor and plenty of beef and vegetables in a rich broth. My wife had the Ahogada Tortas which was a sandwich cut in half in a bowl of tomato broth. Not much flavor or meat. Mostly bread and very little broth in the bowl $10. We finished off with a soft-serve Mexican vanilla ice cream with chocolate and caramel topping $4.50. Pricey for a small cup and did not have much flavor. The place was not that crowded for lunch. We waited about 5 minutes for a table. The music is too loud in the ordering line, plus it is very confusing getting a table. You can't even hear the person taking your order. Seems like the bigger and more popular Rick's restaurants have become the quality and service has paid the price. We went to Frontera last winter and got snubbed by the hostess telling us we had to wait 2 hours for a table when there were at least three empty. Sent an email to the restaurant and never got a reply back. I have been going to Frontera for many years and I won't be back at either restaurants.
