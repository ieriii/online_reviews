Came here for Christmas Eve, so it was packed but we only had to wait 3 minutes to be seated (we had reservations) I ordered the bisque to start off with, which was really good-I had the seafood platter for my meal which consisted of a couple of scallops, 3 shrimp and a crab cake and some rice- Everything was ok except the shrimp-I hate it when places butterfly shrimp with the shell on it-It's impossible to get the shrimp away from the shell-And it turns my stomach to be messing with crispy little legs the whole time-It actually made me not want to eat shrimp for awhile- It has a older feeling environment, very traditional-Had good service but it's not one of my favorite places in Chicago and I would recommend other places over this one-It wasn't horrible but just plain-I'd suggest Hugo Frog's over Shaws-
