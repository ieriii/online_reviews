After waka-ing by Wakamono for about a year I decided to step in and give it a chance. I am a sushi lover that really enjoys creative sushi roll combinations when they are done right. First off, for calamari fans this place has a delicious twist on those love-able creatures. The daily sushi special I found to be original and imaginative, and the Peter Parker role was excellent. The atmosphere is relaxing and pretty intimate. Great place for a first date. For sushi, the cost is about average, not cheap, not expensive. Expect to pay $9-$16 a roll. For two people expect around $50.
