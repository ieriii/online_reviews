OK - FOLKS. Here is the OFFICIAL review. This is one of two solid Korean BBQ restaurants in the city. The other is Cho Sun Ok. Either way, SSGS is a good restaurant. It is authentic. So what that translates to, is tasteful korean cooking with fairly mediocre service. Don't take too much offense to the subpar service performance. Some of my fellow Korean Americans may disagree but it is partially a cultural thing. Recall the concept, "when in rome...", well this applies to "when at Korean BBQ on Western...adjust service expectations". I do hope you enjoy the restaurant. It has good Korean BBQ. Not necessarily the leanest meat, but the overall package is representative of Korean authentic eats. Cheers.
