Went on a Saturday night.....that was my first mistake. So crowded you couldn't even get near the bar and a "2-3 hr" wait for a table (they only take reservations for groups of 10 or more). But luckily the wait time was not nearly that long... The service (despite how busy it was) was not bad at all. Much better than my last visit, that's for sure. The pizza was tasty and the beer was good too. My biggest complaint are the prices....It's a bit expensive just for pizza & beer. I did however, try our friend's raspberry lambic float and it was to die for and worth going back. We stayed for live band karaoke, which was fun (did I mention we'd been drinking?) but the mix was off and you couldn't hear the people singing hardly at all (maybe that was intentional?). Overall I'll be back.....just probably not on the weekend.
