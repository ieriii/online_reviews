I don't really understand the draw to this place. The space is very nice, and the location on Clark has a nice patio, but when it comes down to it the food is mediocre, extremely overpriced and the service is SO SLOW. It's the same story with both locations. I have given this place multiple chances and have been dissapointed every time. I appreciate a leisurely lunch but it shouldn't take a half an hour to get drinks and order food and another twenty minutes after you have to ask for the bill and another 15 minutes to pick up the bill. The last and final time we ventured there my extra-hungry girlfriend kindly asked our waitress if she ordered banana bread if she could get it right away, and she said "of course!" Ten minutes later she brought back a side of jelly for her banana bread, then another ten minutes she finally brought it out. When my other girlfriend ordered yogurt and granola for breakfast they brought her yogurt with no granola. That's 50% of the ingredients forgotten about. Then we had to wait, another 10 minutes for granola. Waiting for this food is not worth it.  I will give them credit for having perfectly consistent slow service at both locations - way to go!
