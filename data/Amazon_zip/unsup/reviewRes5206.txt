Sit at the end of the bar in front of the sous chefs if you can. Not only is the food amazing but you get to see iot prepared and chat with the folks making it and all the waiters zooming in to retrieve the food. It can be pretty crazy busy but when you're sitting here, it doesn't matter. Just know you might decide to order even more food as you start to watch it being prepared and get to hear all about it from all the staff.
