3.5 stars It was good but it wasn't THAT memorable since I hardly remembered going here. The BYOB is cool, especially since while you're waiting for your table you can have a seat up front and start sipping your suds. The place is just a bit too crowded for my liking...but the sushi was slightly above average.
