Gastropub with a separte Vegetarian and Vegan Menu. Let me repeat that - a Gastropub with a seprate Vegetarian and Vegan Menu. VEGGIE SCORE!!!! Ask the server for it when you get seated. I would not have believed it myself had it I had not tasted it with my own tastebuds. Scrumptious food. They put the gastro in gastropub.  A tad loud, but the secret cash only bar in the basement is quiet and romantic. Check it out. Check it out right now. You must leave room for desert.
