Sun Wah was an amazing experience from start to finish. We had a group of four, and took the Yelp advice and made a reservation. Even though we showed up 10 minutes late, they were still holding our table. So get a reservation people:-) The place is super nice. Exposed brick, nice wood tables. Note: They are not BYOB but have a decent beer/wine selection. So we got the peking duck, and yes, we LOVED it. It is crispy and tender and delicious. Here are some of the other dishes: Egg roles- nice and crispy, awesome bok choy, beef cho fun was done just right. These dishes came out first and then we had to wait a little bit for the duck. The duck is served with duck broth soup and duck fried rice. Amazing. Our bill was 20 bucks a person including tax and tip. You can't beat that- and a TON of leftovers. The duck can feed up to 6 people. I know people previously complained about the service but we didn't have that experience. Our waitor was really nice and came to take our order soon after we sat.
