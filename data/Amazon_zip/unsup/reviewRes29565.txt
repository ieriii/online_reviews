I'm from Los Angeles and new to the Chicago scene, but I've heard rave reviews about this place and its superstar Top Chef Master, Rick Bayless. I thought I'd give it a shot with my co-worker and my BF on his birthday. For someone who has lived in Southern California, I am definitely familiar with Mexican food. I grew up with it. Though this place offered rare and authentic ingredients, it was not mind blowing. It was "eh." I've had better hand-made tortillas at Casablanca in Venice, Beach. Though the server seemed knowledgeable, the wait for food was incredible. Then, there was the noise level. The bar was quieter than sitting down at the tables. Try carrying on a conversation when you can barely hear your own voice. Plus, there was a hair in the salsa and a burnt taste to the corn fritters. Was this just not their night or were we just not their right guests? This place is over-rated!
