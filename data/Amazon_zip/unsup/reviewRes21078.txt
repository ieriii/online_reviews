We live in the neighborhood, and have been to Gage a handful of times. We won't be going back, because so-so meals outnumber good ones. The lunch is fine- they have good burgers and their salads are okay. I've gotten the ham and brie sandwich a couple of times, but the last time, the brie was all rind- literally big srips of white rind. I sent it back, and the manager comped the inedible sandwich. Once I ordered soup, and it was stone cold. We went in for dinner once, and my risotto was crunchy and overcooked, and very rich. You're safer ordering pub food at Gage.
