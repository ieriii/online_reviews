This is Mmmmurica, and we mmmurican's love us some down home cookin'. Big Jones offers some damn good Southern Comofort food while providing their own little spin on each dish. A group of us visited during Chicago's restaurant week. Wuddah ya' know? We skipped the pri fixe and ordered off menu. So much for saving that dolla. We started with their Tete de Cochon which was a nice rich way and slightly spicy way to start out the meal. Along with this we ordered their Chicken Liver Pate which was another nice schmear to get us going. The rest of the menu seemed to be for restaurant week. We all ordered some different stuff like the Chicken and Waffles (good, but not great), my girlfriend got a pulled pork dish that was phenomenal. Served in a nice shallow bowl with a nice vinegary sauce (just the way I like my pulled pork). Dessert was the Chocolate Bread Pudding, excellent! Big Jones is a nice little restaurant that has a changing menu and will always leave you satisfied. Go with your gut and order something that will likely make it bigger than when you walked in.
