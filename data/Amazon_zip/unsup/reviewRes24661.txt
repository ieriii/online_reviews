Chicken burrito, passion fruit shake with water. Oh, th sandwiches are fantastic too. Only problem with the place is the wait you'll have to encounter at times. I'd rather get my food to go anyway. Best burrito in the city... this place was my standby when I used to live in Bucktown and didn't feel like cooking. Nothing compares to it. When my stepbrother came in from the UK, this was the first place I took him.
