Excellent restaurant! We have been to Tru for dinner and for dessert. It is a great place to go for dinner, but I loved the dessert tasting. Who wouldn't want to enjoy course after course of dessert? Such innovative desserts as well as grown-up versions of childhood favorites. (Such as a miniature root beer float made from their own root beer). Lovely!
