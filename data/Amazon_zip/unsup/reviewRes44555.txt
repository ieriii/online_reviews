This is a really cool little joint. The cafe is separate from the bakery so it is a little weird yet cool to walk outside and next door with my plate but the atmosphere of both sides was pretty neat. I had a yummy cup of coffee and a little treat called the Michelle. It looked cute and sounded really yummy. Chocolate, peanuts and berry stuff....yummy...I was shocked, a little disappointed but yet mildly intrigued and satisfied by the fact this little pretty $5 thing tasted EXACTLY like peanut and butter jelly sandwich. Texture was pretty on point too. Their cakes looked awesome and they have a bunch of awards on the wall for them. The attitude of the place was pretty cool too so I will be back and will definitely keep them in mind for future cake orders.
