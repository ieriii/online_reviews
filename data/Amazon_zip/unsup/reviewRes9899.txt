It's nice they brew their own beer (which was quite good) and also nice you can do carry out pizza and get a growler of beer to go with. We went to dine in though. We had to wait for a table and waited by the host stand area and kept hearing them ask people "did you want to hear about our specials" Then when we sat, there was a large hanging chalk board in the dining room that appeared to have daily specials but I couldn't read b/c it was too far away. So when I asked our snotty waitress if they had specials, she questioned what I was talking about and snarkily said that was for take out only. Basically the service is atrocious - they clearly think they are far more awesome than they really are. Want to know the worst part?? The pizza SUCKS! The crust was like cardboard and soggy on the bottom and all the toppings just slid off the pizza when you picked it up. The red sauce has no flavor. I really couldn't believe how terrible the pizza was but my husband and I force fed ourselves since we didn't want to waste it and we were going to a show after and didn't want to take it to go. I can see how this might be adequate pizza at say 2am after a night of drinking but it is not good AT ALL. Aside from the beer, their caesar salad was nice and fresh. Will NEVER go back to this place. There are so many other pizza places that specialize in thin crust and are 110% better than this joke of a place.
