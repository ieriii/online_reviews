When we bought our condo on Pulaski we tried La Villa and we have been back 100 times since.  Places like this seldom exist in todays environment. The quality of the ingredients is very high and the quantity even more so. One visit to La Villa will cover your dinner, tomorrow's lunch and quite likely your dinner tomorrow. Where else do you get a side of pasta with your fettuccini. Or, breadsticks with your pizza bread with your Italian loaf. Pack up the left overs cause they are tasty and you will be full after the salad bar and homemade soup. Service is delightful, seasoned servers make you feel like your aunt Bea is making you a homemade meal. I would have thought my first visit was a set up for Punked. A dozen Shriners in fez (es) singing along with Tommy Moran the accordion player. Not even Disney could make this one up! Go for the food and the service! The kitch is free.
