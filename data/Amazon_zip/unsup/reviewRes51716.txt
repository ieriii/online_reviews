By far the BEST little Mexican restaurant. Garcia's sets the bar for how a true margarita should taste. If you aren't addicted to margaritas before you go to Garcia's, you definitely will be after going there! The food is cheap and reasonably priced. Margaritas are strong; you definitely get your money's worth. $20 for a pitcher. Split three ways with two friends? You can't go wrong. As long as you go earlier in the night (better on a weeknight), you will feel like it's your second home (except at Garcia's, they wait on you). :) My only complaint is the times they are busy, watch out for annoying little children bouncing around or screaming their heads off. Not fun.
