Ordered atleast six things off the menu to share between five girlfriends last night and everything was delicious. My favorite beyond any doubt was the Denver Sole -- a whole fish topped with unbelievably sweet, sweet potatoes. I order fish all the time, and wasn't expecting much from a white fish, but this exceeded all my expectations.
