Uh, those lychee martinis are going to do me in! Seriously? The bar kicks ass. I've actually never eaten a full dinner here- just stellar apps and expensive cocktails at the bar have been my sustenance at Le Colonial. But five stars is warranted. The only minor drawback might be the unfriendly cougar with the updo who tends bar there a little too often for my taste.
