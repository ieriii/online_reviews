So I am Vietnamese, not "Vietnamese" but legit Viet. And I LOVE THIS PLACE. It reminds me of home... Restaurants at home look exactly like this, the food is yummy, the staff wear what my homies would wear. I was here on Chinese new year, and while all the other restaurants were closed they were packed! It's also BYOB. I still don't understand why they are called Tank Noodle though, what does that even mean? As someone who has instant pho in my pantry... and whose who grew up eating fresh pho... theirs looked ok.... but for American pho, it's pretty good. If you are into "fancy" high end asian fusion cuisine with "sophisticated" atmosphere then please go somewhere else. I do not believe in high end Asian restaurants, even back home... because the yumminess just does not compare... plus portion sizes suck at fancy establishments. All in all, true Vietnamsese food should be consumed in questionable establishments!
