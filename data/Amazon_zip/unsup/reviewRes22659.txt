One of the best urban resteraunts-great food, service, prices. If you have to wait for a table, hope you can grab a seat at the bar and people watch. I'll eat anything with lamb, but the lamb shanks have got to be the best! The wine list is appropriate and the saganaki, always accompanied by the flare of flame and "OOPA!" shouldn't be missed.
