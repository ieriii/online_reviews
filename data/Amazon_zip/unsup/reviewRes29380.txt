This is, by far, my favorite Thai food restaurant :) My former lit. teacher introduced me to this place back when I was in high school and ever since then, I've been bringing my friends and my sisters to this place. Usually when we get here, we always order the Tom Yum soup and appetizers such as their spring rolls or chicken satay. My favorite dish, however, is the Garlic Chicken, and to tell you the truth, I'm not really a big fan of garlic. I also love their Lemon Grass Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai. My sister Jacqueline, loves their Curry Fried Rice. The ambiance is beautiful. The interior design is interesting and the only thing that sucks is you gotta park across the street.
