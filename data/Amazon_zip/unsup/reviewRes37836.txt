Hopleaf is one of my fave restaurants in the city. Some of the best mussels, belgium fries and a nueske ham sandwich that prob would feed a family of 7 but I always try and eat the whole thing myself because its so freaking good. I don't even drink beer (I am allergic to the brewers yeast) and I still love this place. The food is outstanding! But since Check Please, I haven't been able to go because there is always such a long wait. Damn you check please!
