My friend and I created the best pizza combination ever while we were here: plain pizza + sauteed mushrooms + anchovies + mashed potatoes. I know it sounds disgusting. But it was absolutely DELICIOUS. They also have amazing beers. We had the Mooseknuckle and Cap'n Kickass and they were both solid choices. The staff were also super friendly. They commented/complimented our amazing pizza combination so you know its good stuff. Tip: It was crowded when we went at 6 PM. But we were able to grab seats at the bar so we bypassed the wait.
