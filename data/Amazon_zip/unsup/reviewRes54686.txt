Shaw's has consistently been one of the finest seafood restaurants in Chicago. The food is excellent and I would always receommend the Oysters, softshell crab (when in season) and the clam chowder. The service has always been consistent. I would receommend this to anyone looking for a great seafood experience in the midwest.
