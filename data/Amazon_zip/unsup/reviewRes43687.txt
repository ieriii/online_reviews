I went for my usual Breakfast Burrito yesterday and it just was not good. Not much (if any) Chipotle Sour Cream, very crunchy bitter lettuce, nearly whole cherry tomatos. I'm not a big complainer at restaurants, but I was so upset and disappointed in what I was served, I walked over to the counter to talk with someone. One of the owners was on her way in and when I explained about how bad it was and how my breakfast was basically ruined by this event - I was told that I need to specify that I don't want large cherry tomatos in a Breakfast Burrito (I mean, seriously, how is that even a menu option to begin with? Just because they are fresher does not mean that they belong in a Burrito; too big, ruins the flavor balance, texture, etc.). As I had met a business associate there (who was still with me) and was heading downtown directly after, I rushed out pretty dazed that customer service was handled like that. The more I thought about it, the more disappointed I became in Milk and Honey. For a place I live across the street from and frequent at least half of the week to have served me something I was UNHAPPY with and not at least have offered my money back or another burrito, made per their usual standards, the next time I came back - is ridiculous. I am truly disappointed (I can't stress this enough) in them. Wicker Park isn't lacking in restaurants specializing in seriously delicious breakfasts, but I loved Milk and Honey. Unfortunately, after that treatment I'm not going to be able to bring myself to eat there for breakfast ever again. No customer deserves to be served food that is not up to par and then be given the brush off. Shameful.
