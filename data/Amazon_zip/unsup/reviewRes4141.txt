This is the best restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life!!!!! I loved everything about it, except maybe getting in! Please know it's VERY difficult to get in, you call a number, leave a message and you get a call back whenever they get around to it. So as long as you know that you'll be OK. We went to celebrate my brother's graduation from medical school, it's BYO so we brought a lot of wine that they paired for us. although it's fine dining it's very casual! They play their own music (it was atmosphere a local MN band so I was in heaven). The chef's serve you as well. The food was beyond explanation and out of this world! If you are looking for a truly unique experience Schwa is the place!
