I ordered the foie gras duck sausage per fellow yelper's recommendations and it was delicious, of course. But my foie gras came out all crumbly instead of being in the nice thick slices I see from other Yelper's pictures. I felt kind of cheated for what I had to pay for that duck sausage hence the loss of stars. However, I don't think that instance alone will hinder me from trying Hot Doug's again. I am sure it has a 4.5 star average with 1200+ reviews for good reason. Hopefully I will leave a happier camper the next time around.
