The food remains inconsistent. There was a manager type person who leered at us and yelled at the staff but never came by to check on us or any other customer. The bartender was working like crazy but she had no support and drinks were slow to come out. However, our server Sophie was great. She was fun and sassy and made the trip worth it. We keep coming back for the specials hoping management and the kitchen get it together.
