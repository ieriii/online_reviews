Was there earlier today, and had a fantastic treat...Meli Cafe is changing their juice bar and featured a pomagranate smoothie which i loved and a ginger drink which was amazing.We aslo enjoyed a cactus omelet, which i have to say for a first time cactus eater was great..., had eggwhites at no charge...(what a deal)New pancakes are to die for....Can't wait for their new location to open up in a few weeks...
