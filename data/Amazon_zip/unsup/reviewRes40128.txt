Went to Longman & Eagle a during the holiday season, which may have slightly added to our expected wait time of 1 1/2 hours, but the host's estimation was fairly accurate. While we waited, we grabbed some seats that opened up at the bar. The bartenders were super busy, even moreso than usual! I sipped the RnB, (their cocktail of the week) which was very much similar to eggnog... minus the sugar and brimming with whiskey. I'm sure just ONE of these would be enough for me all night, the drinks are strong. We ordered some appetizers at the bar as well: Slagel Family meatballs and Maine Scallops. The meatballs were well seasoned and moist, but the scallops were amazing!!  The 2 large scallops came with black truffle gnocchi... Perfectly seared, with a nice golden crust on the outside, together with the potato pillow-like gnocchi....the combination of the two textures was one of the best things I have ever eaten! So good, don't miss out! The other amazing dish was the lobster parfait with mushrooms, I don't remember what was in this warm small plate (errrr. martini glass?) but I was secretly wishing I didn't have to share it.... lol I ordered the Slagel family Farm burger, which was just ok, I found it a bit on the salty side... but this may have because of the aged cheddar cheese. (Next time I will order the scallops and lobster as my dinner... Can't wait!) Our server was friendly, energetic, and knowledgeable.
