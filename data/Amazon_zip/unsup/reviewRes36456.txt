My mom and I went to Meli Cafe this past weekend and had a very leisurely and pleasant brunch. The wait was not awful but still considerable given a Saturday at 11:00 a.m. We waited about 45 minutes, but didn't mind since it was unseasonably warm out.  We had the cutest waitress ever, who so professionally explained the brunch specials along with their well-known homemade jams. These were truly spectacular-strawberry and jalapeno orange marmalade, and went very well with the freshly churned whipped butter. The only con that I would give is the overselling of the marmalade-it took us about 5 no's and a promise to come back when asked to purchase take-home jars, for her to finally accept defeat. I had the Veggie Frittatta and my mom had the Fresh Omelette which had Bacon, Artichokes, spinach, dill havarti, mushrooms etc...I had a bite of hers which was very good with the rosemary potatoes. I am by no means a vegetarian (I have a well-known meat tooth) and was thoroughly impressed with this dish. I felt satisfied but not overly stuffed--SIDE NOTE: I chose this dish since I had a meat overload the night before feeling as bloated as a Biggest Loser Contestant.) We did order a side of hollandaise which accompanied both our omelette/fritta meals very well-just slightly tangy and enough cream to make the vegetarian dishes not so healthy.  The cappuccino and iced coffee we ordered was strong and very refreshing-perfect for a sunny fall day. I definitely would come back to try the fresh squeezed fruit juices. It is, however, a bit pricey for breakfast omelettes-I left there with $50 with tax and tip included.
