Fantastic oysters. 4pm to 6pm oysters are 1/2 price, using this logic I ordered 4 times the oysters I normally would. Great selection, impeccably fresh. Served with a grated ice mignonette and cocktail sauce. If you dump any of these things on my oyster I will kill you. If you see me putting these things on oysters it means they suck and I am to stupid not to eat them. Accidentally stiffed the waiter, I had an oyster buzz and lost all ability to do simple math, I don't know what the other two at the table were thinking but that's my excuse. There are undoubtedly some five star items here besides the oysters, but when I find a good oyster I don't want much else. The sushi looked quite good, the lady next to me had a fine looking crab cake and sockeye salmon.
