Really enjoyed the interior - on a cold, wet October night, we were warm and cozy inside Opart, and things got even better after we ordered some hot jasmine tea. mmmm.... (how many times did I refill that tiny tea cup!?) The food was good. But I wasn't blown away.... My party of four split the appetizer sampler plate (crab rangoon, shrimp tempura, spring roll?, something that looked like a tater tot but tasted like a crab cake). LOVED the crab rangoon - it's topped my list as my favorite in the city. Could have eaten a whole order myself. I went to my safety zone for my entree - the chx pad se eew. I wish I'd opted for a curry instead, which was my initial inkling. The PSE was good, but a little more saucy/slippery than I like, and there wasn't as much broccoli as I was expecting. I liked it okay, but it left me a little disappointed. Prices are fair, and if I find myself in the area again, I'd give it another shot but would definitely try something else...  And order more crab rangoon. Just for myself.
