Yummy yummy...I can't really eat spicy food so I only tried a few dishes but I loved them all! I recommend the Tony's Chicken and tofu dishes!! I haven't tried the hot pot yet, but i looked good and seemed very popular considering more than half the ppl there were having it. I have tried szechwan dishes at a couple of restaurants before and this was by far the best I have had yet....It is worth a visit! As for service - with the restuarant located in Chinatown, I did not expect good service, so I wasn't disappointed... Tip - After you get your number to wait, stay in the close proximity (in between the doors) because they do not seem to make much of an effort to go out and call the numbers to those standing outside.
