Ok there's no point in me restating that this place is pretentious, overpriced drinks that WILL get you shitfaced....bla blah blah.  I do have 2 good things to say about it: I developed very intimate relationships with the Spanish Margarita and Moscow Mule.  There is also a special place in my heart for the fried, honey-dipped PB&J on brioche. Speaking of brioche, have the brioche french toast at Gioco for Sunday brunch mmmmmm... Anyway the other good thing I have to say (the food and drink part counted as 1) is that even with the long ass line outside, the waitress never hinted that she wanted us to get the hell out. And I would say we clearly sat there and shot the shit for long periods between rounds. Nevertheless, she didn't' bring the tab (which was damn high. 5 people + at least 3 rounds each + random "sustenance"= not a cheap date) until we asked for it.  Oh just to echo one thing most down to earth people are yelping: that sign in the bathroom about no Miller or Bud or Grey Goose is soooo unnecessary. It's akin to the snooty BS that Juicy Wine Bar has in their menu about why their prices are so high and why you she pay up or stay the f away. I yelped about that a while back. Would I go back? ...only if you're paying
