This is one "corporate" restaurant that bets the rap-- Large room, but broken up well with booth and table set up. Energetic place and a bit hectic feel to it, but welcoming and friendly from the minute I walked in--- from the Host, the wait staff and the kind visit by the manager to see how my meal was going for me. It is Chicago, and the LARGE Ribeye was amazing--tender, very flavorful and served at temperature EXACTLY as ordered-, and the dessert menu will make anyone happy, the apple pie is great and huge--just bring a few friends along or you wont be able to finish it A lovely meal, with welcoming, attentive and friendly service--what more could one ask
