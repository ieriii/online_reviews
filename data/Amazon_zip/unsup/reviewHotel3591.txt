The Drake is a "great old hotel" but they rely a little too heavily on their name and not enough on modern swank. The thing I love most about it is seeing it come more clearly into view when heading south on outer Lake Shore Drive. It's part of the skyline, symbolic. I've been to a few teas and brunches. Tea is nothing special - I can do pumpernickel bread with egg salad and sliced, cascaded strawberrys in my own house, and I am no Martha Stewart. Brunch is pretty grand though - waaay better than the Drake in Oak Brook. I've visited friends' rooms, nothing extraordinary - I prefer the Allegro or Monaco. But what a symbol.
