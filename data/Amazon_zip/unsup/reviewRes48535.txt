With 692 reviews on the record, I don't think The Publican needs my confirmation, but, what the hell! We were thrilled to give this place a go after a New Year's Eve dinner at Girl and the Goat, and we were all stumped on which meal was better. While the majority of my dinner party decided to give props to The Publican between the two, I was still torn because they were completely different experiences. Frankly, they both win the 5 stars in my book. Every bite of food I put in my mouth was divine, but I especially savored the catalan fish stew - my favorite of the evening. The dover sole, which was topped with capers and sweet potato dumplings, was fantastic. I'm not a crazy carnivore, but with several meat dishes in front of me, I admittedly devoured every bite of the country ribs, beef sirloin, and suckling pig in my plate. The dessert was also fabulous! We shared all 3 of the options on the menu, leaving no crumbs behind. And while I didn't order any drinks, I tried some of my boyfriend's beer, and whoa! It didn't even taste like beer...YUM. Definitely should have ordered one. Overall, a fantastic variety to start off my new year and put off that resolution! TWO THUMBS UP for the Publican.
