Epic fail. Had a reservation for 8:30, arrived early, lots of empty tables, asked to be seated and the attitude from the hostess started. Almost as if I insulted her. She reluctantly seated us. Waited forever for water and drinks. The waiter had zero personality and could have cared less if we enjoyed it or not. Prices here are insane for the quantity. I ordered a special salad from the specials, it was $10 for less than 1 tomatoes chopped with a slice of cucumber. The bread was good. Sorry we will not be back, way to many other choices with great food and service in the area.
