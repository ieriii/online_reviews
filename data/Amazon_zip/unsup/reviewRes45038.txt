Dear Anteprima, You sneaky devil, you took me by surprise. You moved into my neighborhood, waited around, and finally, one day while my +1 and I were out in search of a birthday dinner venue, you lured me in with your screams of a $29 prixe fixe. Temptress. Damn. Even though I wanted to check you out a long time ago, your pricier menu and bustling tables kept me away. I'm glad that you change your menu often, especially the specials. I may not remember exactly what we ordered, so we'll go with "you may not get it again anyway". I'll be back to check out your patio someday. Love, Kellie K.
