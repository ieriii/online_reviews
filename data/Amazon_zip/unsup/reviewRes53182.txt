Been here 2 times.. love the Maduros! They are delicious. I got a steak sandwich n my hunny got the Cubano. Mine was awesome and my guy enjoyed his as well. We also go the arroz con gris. It was good as well. I dont have much Cuban food experience to compare but I thought it was good.. A bit more then $20 for the 2 of us for some sandwiches to me I think is a little expensive but I guess nothing is cheap anymore. Nice people and the owner was very friendly and explained things great as I had a question about the rice.. gave us the low down on the restaurant as soon as we came in. Patio would be nice but its too hot for that right now...
