went to publican visiting from nyc for st pattys day. one of the better brunches i have had, even fighting sunday pre-flight anxiety was able to enjoy top 5 bloody mary of life that was accompanied with a tasting glass full of a fine ipa. one thing that amazed me was the shear space of the publican. large, open and high celings made this place stand out to me as this same atmosphere would be extremely difficult to replicate in ny. get the bacon and the egg fries, unique food served at large wooden tables like a mead hall. however, i would say probably not the best dinner place.
