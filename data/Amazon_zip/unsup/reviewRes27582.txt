I'll start by saying this place was a little overrated. Still did not beat Rosa Mexicana in NYC in my opinion. However it was really good and a lot of fun. Went here today, right before my flight out of Chicago to New York. When I read about this place, I immediately called to make a reservation. This place is closed Sunday and Monday, but I was able to get an early lunch reservation on Tuesday, which worked out well.  Reservations are pretty key here if you can get them. To our surprise there was a line waiting to get in at 11:30am on a Tuesday.  The place quickly fills up for lunch and I heard some people were waiting an hour to get a table. On to the food. Here is what we ordered: Queso Classico- Eh not what we expected but it wasn't frontera's fault.  Guacamole- Good for not being made table side but also not the best I've ever had.  Chips- Really great chips some of the best. Enchilladas Mole- So good. Really authentic mole sauce. Great flavor. You could taste the chocolate but it was not overpowering and had a wonderful kick to it.  Quesadillas- Should have skipped these. Not enough cheese, and for me I did not enjoy the flavor.  The food was 3 stars for me. I ended up giving this place 4 stars because the drinks were really great. Go for a mixed drink for sure if you go there because they are worth the 12 bucks. Had two margaritas and left pretty buzzed and also incredibly full almost sick. Really happy I got to go to this place. Great interior and atmosphere.
