For an omelette in Chicago, TEMPO is a must, but for pancakes and french toast one must try the BONGO ROOM! Forget the calories, and try to overlook the hostess and the "waitress black" haired waitress....they are a matched set of poor and condescending behavior........and remember that you are there to enjoy the sinfully rich delights, which are unmatched in the city.
