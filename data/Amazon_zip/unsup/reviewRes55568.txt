BUYER BEWARE - I have been giving Bongo Room my Sunday brunches since they opened. Food is good, but with every passing year they make it more and more difficult to continue considering them. The customer experience is the absolute last thing on their agenda in there, if its on there at all (sometimes I think not). They have a good product and rest their laurels on it. Took the week off from work in tough, stressful economy to spend time with wife and two infant children. Began our much anticipated week together on Monday AM @ Bongo Room. The glass front door had a crack in it and had to be replaced (there is another glass door after that door, so this crack was NOT contributing to coldness in the restaurant). While the owner of Bongo Room looked on, they hired a repairman to come and fix the door during Breakfast service. Bongo Room is Breakfast only and closes its doors around 230ish everyday. Despite this, the owner chose to bring in LOUD hammering carpenters into his tiny establishment in the heart of 10AM breakfast. My 2 year old Daughter started SCREAMING in fear at the loud noise and they didnt stop. My kids screaming and our cold food sitting there after being plated 20 minutes earlier, the owner does nothing and then hands us a check for the full amount!! Which, BTW, is very expensive. I walked out, NEVER to return.
