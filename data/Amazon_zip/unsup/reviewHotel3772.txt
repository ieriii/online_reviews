I am just coming off my HIGH from my girls weekend at the Dana Hotel. My best friend and I met at the Dana for a fun filled weekend to celebrate life. Instead of exchanging Christmas/Valentines gifts, we decided to take a girls trip and get a little rowdy. The Dana was perfect! We both got in on Friday but her train was delayed so I enjoyed the AMAZING view, AMAZING room, and OMG the shower! This hotel is quite possibly the sexiest place I have ever stayed. While we opted to keep it clean and not stare at each other in the nude, this would be the BEST place to go for a sexy love retreat with your favorite favorite. The 2 nights we were there were amazing. We had our first cocktail and amazing meal down at Aja and ended our vacay with a delicious breakfast at the hotel. The mini-bar was tempting late-night and even a great value but we didn't indulge. We loved our experience at the Dana so much that we have promised to return sometime in the summer to take advantage of the SPA and VERTIGO! *I'm knocking one star for a sometimes dirty/smelly elevator and a remote that didn't work but really...who is watching TV?*
