Pretty fast delivery. They have good selection of pizzas from pan to thick and different types of toppings and meats. There is nothing particularly special about it however. Just okay pizza that is sure to fill you up. Prices are very reasonable. If you prefer to dine in, they also have that option. There's plenty of seats available and quick service at the counter. They also offer pizza by the slice (for real cheap) if you're not up to an entire pizza.
