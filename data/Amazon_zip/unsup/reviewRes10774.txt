This restaurant was the longest wait we experienced in Chicago. They told us it would be 20 minutes but we didn't get seated for over an hour. I don't care because I had the most amazing god damn pancake in my life! I ordered the BANANA HEATH BAR PANCAKES (banana pancakes with heath bar chips, topped with warm toffee-butter cream & fresh bananas). I almost cried after the first bite because it tasted so good. Seriously. If you are ever in Chicago and anywhere near The Bongo Room, you are doing your taste buds a disservice if you do not pony up and wait for a table.  Also, the service once seated was amazing. The waitress had an ease about her that made me feel like I was welcome in the restaurant, not that I was a burden. They also serve Intelligentcia Coffee, worth every penny!
