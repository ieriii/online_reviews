I am one of the few people in Chicago who does not like deep dish, so I'm always searching for the best thin crust and I'm very picky. The topping choices are crazy vast and all very good quality. I had sausage, tomato and spinach and would highly recommend it. If you feel like getting into an eating contest with your boyfriend at a restaurant...not that I've done that or anything....this is the place.
