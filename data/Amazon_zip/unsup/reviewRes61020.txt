I was a big fan of Wishbone several years ago, but something just doesn't seem quite the same these days. My main complaint is that I ordered the shrimp Po' boy and was gravely disappointed. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the foodie TV shows that show Po' Boys as these sandwiches w/ hearty rolls of bread piled high with fillings, whether shrimp, fish or what have you. I got the hearty roll, - 7" long, nearly 2" thick. But the six or seven shrimp the size of my pinkie finger were almost a joke. I literally took all the shrimp and piled them on one side of the bread and folded THAT bread over and still had extra room for more. You get the picture.  Good thing I ordered the cajun fries, to give me some sense of Louisiana favor and filling that I was anticipating. Just letting you know. :-/
