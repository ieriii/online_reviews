Meli is for [breakfast] lovers. I've never had lunch food here, and I never will. It's hard enough to decide between a skillet or an omelette or a benedict--all of which are delicious. It's always busy--the tables filled with cute, urban pairs enjoying their coffee, but I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table.
