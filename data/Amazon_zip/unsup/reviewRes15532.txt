Another great addition to Logan. I like the vibe of the place, its very open yet comfortable. The bar is huge, they have a good beer selection and their food is pretty damn tasty, especially the blue cheese mussels which I was sceptical of. Their whiskey selection is also pretty good, but beware their cherry infused bourbon tastes kind of like cherry pie, which is a bit too sweet for me. I say grab some friends and try as much as you can!
