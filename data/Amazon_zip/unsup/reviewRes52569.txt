This really is a meatlover's paradise but also has a fantastic salad bar. I am a total carnivore, but I loved the corn salad, steamed asparagus and the shrimp salad, especially the shrimp salad!! Definitely try it if you like shrimp. The meats were good, but not great. My favorites were the grilled shrimp, grilled pineapple (delicious with the shrimp), filet mignon wrapped in bacon and and garlic steak. The lamb chops, leg of lamb and the pork sausage came in a pretty close second. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse and the flan, both simply out of this world. Do not skip dessert...they have a great selection.  We went for dinner, but my guess is that the lunch special is the way to go. That is what I would do the next time because $48.00 is just a little too pricey for us because we also got dessert and wine which then upped the total bill. I would go back though...for lunch.
