I still haven't braved Bongo Room for breakfast or brunch, but after hearing rave reviews from so many people I jumped at the chance to stop in for lunch when I found myself in Bucktown one recent afternoon. It was surprisingly crowded-- even for a Monday at 1 PM, but the food was worth it. Although they serve breakfast all day and those dessert-like pancakes sounded amazing I decided that if I wanted to make it through the rest of my day and not end up in a sugary food coma, the lunch menu was a safer bet. I had a great club sandwich with grilled chicken, brie, and cranberry mayo. It was a huge sandwich and really well balanced. A guy at the table next to me had ordered potato salad as his side and it looked amazing, so I decided to give it a try-- I wasn't the biggest fan, but I also don't love when they sneak hard boiled eggs into my potato salad. Just a personal preference. My friend got the lunch burrito, which was HUGE and looked delicious. All in all, a huge very satisfying lunch and the prices were pretty reasonable as well. I'm still working up the nerve to wait in line for pancakes... we'll have to wait and see if that happens!
