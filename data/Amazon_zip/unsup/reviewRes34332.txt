This place was a bit disappointing. It's amazing how bad service can ruin your whole experience. Well, the food wasn't awesome though maybe just ordered the wrong thing? We sat right at the buffet in front of the kitchen so we thought we should get quick service as they're right there but we were wrong. We had to ask for stuff that our waiter should have brought to us immediately like a spoon and bread with my friend's soup. Maybe they were busy but he just seemed to be standing there. My friend ordered a cinnamon roll and a chicken tortilla soup. She said the soup was too salty but the cinnamon roll was pretty good. I got the Hey Ricky! omelette. It had way too much avocado and the eggs were way too mushy almost as if they were undecooked. I like avocado and all but I do not like huge chunks of it that doesn't balance well with the omelette as a whole. I decided not to return it as it was still edible. I usually don't unless I really don't want to eat it. I just didn't eat all the avocado. The potatoes were pretty good though. And you can't really screw up english muffins. We went there on a Sunday afternoon around 1:30pm. It looked really busy. We only waited about 5 minutes though because we didn't mind seating at the bar. Parked at a meter on Wabash by Roosevelt. It was Sunday so no need to pay the meter. We walked from there to Yolk. It took maybe 5-10 mins, not bad. It was raining outside too. Inside it's pretty rowdy so you have to speak up quite a bit to talk to a person sitting right next to you. There seemed to be plenty of seating though just not available. Oh and after we asked and got our check, he did not tell us we were supposed to bring it up to the front register. Allbeit MAYBE he was too busy with other things or thought we've gone here before. But we waited a while before he came back and saw we were trying to pay our check and he said you have to take it up to the front.
