We are Kimpton In Touch members and have stayed in a number of their hotels on both coasts. Hotel Burnham in particular is so well located when it comes to attending Chicago's Jazz Festival. Just two short blocks west of Millennium and Grant Parks. We were fortunate to have a corner room with views of State and Washington Streets. Views of the parks of course, Macy's (world's second largest department store), and the Chicago Theater. Everything is at your foot steps... The Jewelery District, Water Taxi, Magnificent Mile, parks, and museums. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the visit besides the great jazz was the Chicago skyline of monuments. Our room was extremely comfortable with properly scaled furniture. Velour head board with overhead sheer canopy, matching curtains scripted with Mozart tunes covering the bay windows that were screened with sheer french drop curtains for daytime privacy. Coffee & tea was available each and every morning and on Labor Day, there was an arrangement of donuts, sweets and bagels. That was to make up for the inconvenience of not having the lobby restaurant available. Hotel Burnham is also a designated historical building and once had the pleasure of a visit from Al Capone. Would not ever hesitate to recommend or stay in this hotel again in the future.
