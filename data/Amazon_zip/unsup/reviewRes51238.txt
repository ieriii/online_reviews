First visit to Wishbone and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised - it was very kid friendly which was good for my friends who had their 4 year old in our group of 8. We didnt have to wait long to be seated. Our waiter was very nice, very sweet and friendly and worked hard at addressing all our needs. The food was really good...even though the place was filled with roosters of all shapes and paintings of weird hens, the seafood was outstanding. Our table ordered different kinds of blackened fish (catfish, salmon, bluefish) and they were all good. the crawfish cakes were great too as were the sides of homefries. The drinks that my friends ordered seemded to be good - Ragin' Cajun, sangria (though a tad sweet) but mine (pomegranate margarita) wasnt very good and had lot of ice and less alcohol. But given the sea food and service, I would definitely go back again
