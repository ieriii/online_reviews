I live in New York, but I have always liked Chicago style pizza better. It's been 11 years since I've visited Chicago, so of course I was going to hit up one of big named places. You just feel like much more of champ when you eat Chicago style pizza. Back in 1999 I had Pizzeria Uno, before it got really chained out....and came away a fan. Before NY, I lived in San Francisco and for some reason, there are a decent amount of really good Chi-Deep Dished places like Zachary's in Berkeley, Little Star and Patxi's in San Francisco. There's an Uno in NY, but it is really terrible. So needless to say, I was ready to tear some Giordano's up! Yes it was still pretty good, but I did feel somewhat disappointed. I was hoping being in Chicago, eating Chicago style pizza would be end all be all. It didn't live up to the hype I had built in my little peon head. Anyways...it was a late night of work in Chicago, so I was eating alone, and ordered a 10 inch small. The crust was decent, but not the best. The pizza itself was LOOOADDDED with cheese. Poor cow, must've been milked a gallon's worth just to laod up one pizza. Obviously this was a plus. Seriously there was so much damn cheese, it took forever to cut. It reminded of a kid, sneezing on himself and getting snot all over his fingers, and he just moves his hands all over the place and there is just that one lingering string of snot. The one thing that really bothered me about the pizza though was the lack of tomato sauce. I love deep dish, because it usually comes with more tomato sauce. Sadly, this was where it was lacking. Overall still a decent pizza...I just wouldn't pick it as the end all Chicago style pizza in Chicago. Will need to try some of the other more famous ones next time i'm in Chicago.
