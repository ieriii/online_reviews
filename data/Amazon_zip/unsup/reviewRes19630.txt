*********Update 11-27-07*********** $6 for a Harp. And during happy hour. On a Monday. Maybe they offer specials on weeknights, but I didn't see any. And I may be willing to pay more for Guiness, but not Harp. Stick to the wine or martini list for after work drinks--beer is not worth the price. Even Miller Lite is expensive at $5. Still like this place, but would take off a 1/2 star if I could. ************************************** Mmm, chips with curry dipping sauce! I can still taste it..... The green tile and dark wood are comfy feeling--like a cross between a bath house and an old-school D.C. bar. Plenty of seating--and even a separate room downstairs for private parties or busy nights. Drinks and food are pricey but the service matches them both--attentive hosts, waiters and bussers all around. Plus, they have Bisol Jeio prosecco--my 2007 summertime fave!
