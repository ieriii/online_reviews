I am in love with this place! Small intimate seating, BYOB, beautiful dishes, very reasonable pricing, attentive waitstaff...and the list goes on. Make sure you bring an extra bottle of wine if you're doing the tasting. They take their time to make your experience extra special! I can't wait until the next season's menu changes!!!
