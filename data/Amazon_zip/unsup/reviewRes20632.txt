My bestest and I went around lunch hour on a Saturday. Regardless, I truly don't understand why there is such a long line to get into this restaurant. The waiter tried her best to appease those waiting by handing out menus, or else suggesting that snack foods like guacamole could be ordered and served in line, but the entire process seemed incredibly inefficient. We were left standing there for more than half an hour, while there were seats available in the restaurant. To me, their system doesn't make any sense. As for the food itself: we shared the Ahogada Torta and the Milanesa Torta. Some restaurants tell you food is spicy, when it truly isn't. Do not expect that here - the heat will stay with you. Guzzled much of the water (great options for self-service, still/sparkling/limes available). Both tortas were fairly enjoyable, but I especially liked the Milanesa one. Perhaps I wasn't so into the Ahogada's tomato broth, and the carnitas felt to me, a little dry. Maybe I didn't soak it into the broth enough, or else I felt that there should be additional ingredients to make the carnitas more tender. Something creamy (avocados?) might have livened up the proceedings... And for dessert, we shared the churros. I think it's a tad cheaper to get three of them, instead of just one. MMMMM! They were very nice and crispy, with a good sweetness in the dough, although I had to knock off a lot of the sugar that was on the churro itself. Still, bliss! Oh, and another tip: make sure you load up on napkins. You WILL get messy.
