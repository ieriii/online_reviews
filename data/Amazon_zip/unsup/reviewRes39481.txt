You can read other reviews on why this place is so awesome, but to me, their cocktails are the best. Where else can you get a matcha based whisky drink before noon in the world!? Food was great, just look at the pictures I took and drool. As for the slow seating issues that many has mentioned, well, we were here on a Saturday around 10AM. Got seated fairly quickly. Had no problem with the service.
