Heard a lot about this place from people around the City and waited for about 40min to get in there. I thought it was a cool atmosphere, great service, and great pizza. You have to experience good Chicago style pizza where you are in the city. This might be a little too touristy though - making it a little too crowded. But it was worth the experience.
