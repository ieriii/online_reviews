I love it here, I can't say enough good things about Frontera, and can't wait to one day eat at Topolobampo. The atmosphere is filled with Mexican Art, bright colors, fantastic service and a very lively music. It's a great experience, with great service and everything in between. Pros: This food is great, it's second to none in this city and probably the United States... Well considering it won Best Restaurant, definitely the United States. The Food is great, and the tortilla soup is a must!!! As is the Margarita's!!! You can get just about anything and leave happy here. Cons: Not too many, some of the food might be higher priced, but you will leave here happy and full. It's a great dining experience. I highly recommend this place for all those in and out of Chicago, it's a definite must!
