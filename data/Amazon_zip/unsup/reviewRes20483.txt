It's like an upscale Chipotle, except: 1) Your in-line wait can be up to two hours - It was about 45 minutes for us on a Friday night at 8pm - group of 4, and it appeared to die down after we got our table and sat down; 2) You can order appetizers and drinks while you wait in line - LOVE this, as I surely don't mind waiting if I can enjoy a glass of shiraz and some chips, red and green salsa, and a great guac!; 3) The menu is anything but ordinary and does not dissapoint - we all ordered various versions of Tortas, which I guess I would liken to a Mexican version of a Panini - thick and crusty, filled with meet, cheese, peppers, onions - all the good stuff! One of our group members is actually Mexican, having moved here from Cabo only about a year ago, and she loved the food as well, so that has to say something! This place was not what I expected, but for a fun and unique dining experience, I would highly recommend it. Fave tortas we tried? The skirt steak and the suckling pig.
