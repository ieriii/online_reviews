Why don't I walk here more often? It's such a great neighborhood restaurant and the breakfast is stellar. I ordered an omelette with bacon, tomatoes, spinach, and swiss. The eggs were light, fluffy, and perfectly cooked. I could tell that they whipped the heck out of them before cooking them low and slow to perfection. Served with a side of a potatocake with chives. Divine. even the multigrain toast was great!! The coffee is nothing to write home about (hence the 4 stars)...but it's perfect for breakfast. The other reason for the one star deduction which was a little odd, was that they have a "weekend only breakfast only" section of the menu. There were two omelettes that I would've liked to have ordered but was unable, I would've understood had the ingredients been odd or special. Our total for 2 was $23.  That's what we pay at Overeasy...but not anymore.
