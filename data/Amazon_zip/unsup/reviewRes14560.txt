Good stuff! We went here last night after finding that the kitchen at our first choice restaurant was closed for two weeks while the owner is on vacation. No trashing on them yet though, because I still have high hopes. Back to Revolution! The atmosphere is fun and the dining space is very open. I'm not a beer drinker, so I opted for a Belvidere & 7, although my dining partner had one of their beers and seemed to like it. The food was fantastic! I had some burger with sauteed crimini mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese and fried onions. Best burger I've had in a while! I had the blue cheese potato salad as my side which was fantastic!! My dining partner had the fish & chips. The fries were super tasty, and they hand cut them! Also, our food came out super fast, and service was quite attentive. I'm only giving it four stars, just because I'm not "in love" with it, but it was a great place to go. For sure you should check it out!
