Great place... make a reservation, because its a busy place. Had dinner on wed night and it was busy, but we were seated right away. The food was great, the dragon roll and my favorite and unique item was the sweet potato roll, YUMM.... but the best part was BYOB, which is a great way to have a great meal and cut down on the cost.... The resturant was cozy, great for a date or night out with friends...enjoy!!! Great find in bucktown....
