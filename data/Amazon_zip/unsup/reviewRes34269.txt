This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. Though the dining room is a bit over crowded, the energetic atmosphere is contagious and adds to the charm. Reservations are a must, though there is a nice bar where you can have a drink prior to being seated. The wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing. The food is excellent from the bruchetta and tomato and mozzarella salad to the pastas and chicken marsala. Don't leave without trying the chocolate souffle. It's unforgettable.
