This place is simply great! Nestled in Greektown, Meli delivers excellent breakfast fare at good prices. The service is great and even during their rush hours they seem to be on top of their game by treating each customer as if they are their only table. The eggs are delicious. I've never had eggs so fluffy and cooked to perfection. The potatoes are wonderfully cooked and seasoned. Parking can be a bit difficult, but definitely worth driving around to find a spot!
