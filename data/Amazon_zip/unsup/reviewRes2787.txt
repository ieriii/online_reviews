Okay, instead of going forward, I'm going to take a step back and say this : AMAZING !! First, expect to spend a pretty penny if you're going here. I took my wife there for our 2nd anniversary through a reservation I made through http://opentable.com. As soon as we walked in, the host told us "Happy Anniversary." Of course, we felt like we were special. After he seated us, one of the waitresses brought the menu. On top of the menu, guess what? Yes, it said "Happy Anniversary." Not going nuts here, but a nice touch again, I thought.  The food was amazing. We ordered from the "Prixe Fixe menu" and both had the Thai butternut soup to start. It was amazing. The bowl that is was served in had points of sauce that we could use to make the soup as spicy as we wanted. Then, I had the "Colorado Lamb loin roulade" and my wife had the "Nova Scotia Halibut." Both excellent. The best part of the meal was the desserts, which kept coming and coming, with an accompanying set of instructions from the waiters as to how to eat it. Few things to note: There were four waiters and we were served by all of them. They somehow communicate to each other as the second to fourth ones knew already that my wife was allergic to peanuts. My wife refused wine, due to her pregnancy. We told the second waitress. However, all the others said congratulations as they came up.  Overall, amazing experience. Ladies, if a guy takes you there, he likes you a whole lot. Guys, take a girl there only if she's completely worth it. If not, save it for the anniversaries.
