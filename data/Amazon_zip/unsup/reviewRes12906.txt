My first time at Texas De Brazil and it was quite a memorable experience. My friends and I decided to go on Easter. Luckily we received a discounted rate for the holiday and free desert! FOOD: The sals bar wa AMAZING and delicious. The meet buffet was great. Im not usually a fan of meat but the flavors were spectacular and also very suculent. I had the banana foster pie and it was to die for. Presentation was great as well. I loved the fried bananas!!! SERVICE: From the moment we entered the restaurant we were greeted warmly. We were probably the youngest bunch dinning but it did not matter. The service was superb. Truly catering to their clients. My water class was never empty and they are always ready to get you a new plate. We ended up being the last customers in the restaurant. They began cleaning up but always assured us not to rush and to enjoy our meal. Honestly one of the best dinning experiences I have had! PRICE: Roughly $135 for 3 people not including gratutity
