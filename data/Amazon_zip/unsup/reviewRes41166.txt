Every time I've been to Tank, it's been crowded...but in a good way...clearly locals come back and first timers have no reason to leave. If it's really crowded you may have to share a table with strangers but, somehow, this fits the atmosphere of the place. I've only had pho here and the sheer quantity of it is astounding. The beef broth is buttery rich and the side of bean sprouts, basil, jalapeno and lime wedges is more than adequate (though I do wish they gave a bit more lime). Watch out for when they clear your table...there is something very unsightly and unsettling about watching/hearing your left over pho get slopped right into a bucket on wheels. Their spring rolls are classic, I think, but I'd actually prefer them if they had a bit more cilantro or basil or lime juice in them. The crispy egg rolls ( I think that's what they are called) were nice and hot. Fast and tasty.
