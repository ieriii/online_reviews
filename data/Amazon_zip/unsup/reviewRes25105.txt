The most romantic restaurant in Chicago? I'll take one of those, a side of adorable mandolin player, a dash of dark sultry curtains, heaping portions of meat and seafood to dip in vats of cheese... and I'm pretty sure that's the way straight to my heart. The portions here are really big, so you'll have to exercise your stomach before you make it in. The best bet is to go with one of the combination meals, which comes with an appetizer, entree, and dessert fondue. One portion is enough for two people, but when I make the trek to Chicago to see a particularly gluttonous friend of mine, we order two of those bad boys. That's just how we roll. I digress. The highlight of my meal at Geja's is always the coffee, which is paired with endless cups of fresh whipped cream. It comes with the meal, and actually may help in preventing many a food-coma induced accident. Genius! Also, service is incredible, and, in my case, the afterservice as well. At the tail end of my last Chicago trip, I dropped my wallet in one of the booths. Not only was geja's open at 9 am (unheard of!) but they had the wallet safe and sound, and completely untouched. they spared me a huge headache, and for that I will be forever grateful.
