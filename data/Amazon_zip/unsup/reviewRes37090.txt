One visit was all I needed. Yes, this place is for beer snobs galore and they have some great, hard-to-find beers but if you look hard enough you can find them sprinkled around the city just the same. Outside of the pleasant hostess who told us about the dreadful two hour wait for the back room, the service was rude. We lucked out getting a table in the bar area but were never informed that food and drink were to be ordered from the bar so 15 minutes later we bellied up and ordered our beers. When it came time to order food, the bartender seemed clueless and clearly uninterested in taking food orders. Here's a tip for you Hopleaf... if your bartenders are going to serve food, they should know the menu. This place is not for vegetarians or those who like to eat healthy. I ordered the fish sandwich because I didn't want the fried veggie option but when the sandwich arrived it was fried. The bartender claimed he had no idea it was a fried meal. awesome. Ambiance is great. Noise level was your typical Saturday night in a bar. The beer list is hands down awesome but if you are a person who desires having a personable, knowledgeable bartender then your beer will probably taste just the same if not better somewhere else.
