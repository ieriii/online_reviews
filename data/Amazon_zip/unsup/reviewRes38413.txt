See, the thing about a one-hour wait for a table is that you get to hang out at the bar and try some of the many delicious beers on tap for the low, low price of just five dollars. Sure, there are a few that are more, and there's also an extensive list of bottles, but don't get ahead of yourself! Save that list of bottles for reading at the table! Okay, two delicious beers in my belly, time to slosh on back and check out the menu... Holy CB and J! Yes, that's cashew butter, fig jam, and morbier cheese grilled into sandwich heaven. Or if you prefer your meals meatier, there's a duck reuben...I haven't eaten meat in twenty years and that sounded interesting even to me. The reuben also comes with the pommes frites, and while the housemade chips that are served with the cb&j are not to be scoffed at...make sure you're at a table with fries. Oh, and if veggies are your thing too - goat cheese polenta cake is the way to go. Now after a few beers at the bar, and a bottle at the table I was tempted to call it a night and begin the long, slow, stagger-y walk home, but then someone said something about lemon curd tarts with strawberry rhubarb compote and I couldn't resist.
