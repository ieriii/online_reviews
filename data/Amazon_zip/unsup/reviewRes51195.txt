West Loop location. Went to Wishbone several years ago and the entree I had was so memorable that have been making it at home ever since.  Have not visited as often as i would like but nonetheless the decor, the atmosphere was so ecclectic and fun that I still remember it to this day...just wish i had the time to visit them more often or maybe I should just move back to the West Loop.
