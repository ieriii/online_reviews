One of my favorite Korean places in the city. A fun atmosphere to have parties, go with a group, or even on a romantic date. However, word-to-the-wise, wear something that you can wash...you will smell like BBQ afterwards. This is a family style Korean BBQ, where the waitstaff bring you raw meat and KimChe and you go from there. The meat is amazing, and everything is very fresh. The service is better if you go with someone who is Korean, as this is true at many Korean eateries, but still worth the trip. It is also open all night, even though I have never taken advantage of that luxury.
