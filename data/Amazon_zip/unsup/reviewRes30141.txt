It's not everyday I eat shrimp... actually I NEVER eat any kind of seafood and shrimp is at the top of my list of 'no gracias'. I've gone to sushi restaurants and asked for the vegetarian menu... yes, I know, how dare I! But there's a first for everything and the first time I had shrimp was here... at Sunda! And holy crap, it blew my mind, the shrimp tempura definitely set the bar for how shrimp should taste for the rest of my life.  Came here for an early business dinner and ordered the shrimp, short ribs, pad thai and 7 spice fried chicken. It was the best meal ever, we all shared rather politely until the final bites came and then it was like a Hungry Hippo game... which I won. Thanks! Dessert was great, we had the mochi ice cream and a thing called the 'ridiculous' which was ridiculously f**king awesome! This place has made me miss hanging out downtown, but I'd be sure to come here more often... when invited. *hint hint*
