Positively delicious! I'm a relative newcomer to Indian cuisine and loved it. We had Chicken tiki masala, lamb, some soy like dish and a garbanzo bean masala. The naan (garlic and plain) is amazing. The place is pretty elegant and the drinks are yummy. I had their signature martini and it was delish. Completely agree with the yelper that advised not to stuff yourself on the cut up naan and butter chicken sauce that is on the table when you arrive. PS. They have valet parking for $12!!!
