5 stars for the BEER and 0 stars for the SERVICE. We live in California and visit Chicago to see family. My husband always tried to make it here because of the belgium beer selection and other great beers as well. I was with him this last time and found the service SUCKS! It was busy but aren't they always?? We grabbed a beer at the bar and say a booth open up in the corner so we grabbed it. NO ONE CAME TO OUR TABLE EVER IN AN HOUR except to try and deliver food we didn't order (twice). They calmed down and still no service. My husband had to order beer from the bartender and food when we wanted it. Saw the doorman reading a book at one point and eating so you would have thought he could have lifted his finger to see what was going on. Bummer cos the beer list is a great one but wouldn't recommend unless you like crappy service! Seriously not necessary.
