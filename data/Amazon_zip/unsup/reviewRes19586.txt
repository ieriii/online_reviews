The sushi was good. Service was horrible. No such thing as personal space. The tables are literally like 5 inches away each other. Had to yell across the table to my date. Way too loud. NO SOY PAPER!!! That majorly sucked because I'm not a big fan of seaweed. Won't be returning which sucks because I truly enjoyed the sushi but the ambience was severly lacking and I'd actually like to hear what the person I am with is saying...
