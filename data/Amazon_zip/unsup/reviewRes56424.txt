Simply It is an apt name for this restaurant. My girlfriend and I go there almost two to three times a week. The bubble smoothies are great. They use real fruit in each smoothie. I would recommend the avocado smoothie. The food is just as good too. The Salmon Noodles are excellent. I would also suggest that more people try the Beef Noodles. It has a nice spice to it. The staff is also very friendly. Tuan is the best host. This a place everyone should try at least once: I guarantee it will not be your last visit.
