I loved Garcias... the atmosphere was great, the servers seemed to be working pretty quickly. We were in a large group and didn't have to wait long to get seated or get our food, and even though it was super busy the servers were very attentive. I never had to hunt anyone down for more water. The food was inexpensive and good, it was pretty authentic. The only thing I didn't care for was the service at the door. We apparently came in a wrong entrance and employees could see that we were lost and just kind of looked at us and kept it moving. Other than that the food was great and so was the wait service.
