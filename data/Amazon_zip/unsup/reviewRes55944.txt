I see that the reviews for Caro Mio are predominantly positive, and the reputation of this little Lincoln Square pasta joint is in fact the reason I decided to go there last night. Pasta is usually something I pass on when putting my money down for a dinner out because I've unfortunately not had to many pasta restaurant pasta dishes I couldn't have done better at home. My overall experience here was not bad, but not good either. Kind of blah. So so. The dishes here were definitely slapped together to entice the weekend crowd, loaded down with not-quite-right and much-to-much combinations of keyword ingredients like sun dried tomatos, pesto cream sauce, and what seemed like just the ends of things the chef was trying to get rid of. Portions here were out of control too. My partner and I left with enough detritus to feed a family of 4. Sorry to say it Caro Mio, but quantity just DOESN'T make up for so so quality. My experience just wasn't worth the money.
