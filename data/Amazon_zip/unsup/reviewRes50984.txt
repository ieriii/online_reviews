Went here for brunch for the first time last week, and I was really surprised at how terrific the food was. It's a relatively new restaurant, and one expects a couple of glitches in service or food, but not here! I had the tallgrass beef burger, and it's one of the juiciest, tastiest burgers I've ever had. My friend Marisa had the eggs rochambeau (poached eggs, sirloin, potato cake, and bearnaise), and it too was delicious. We plan to come back and eat through the brunch memo, one lovely weekend after another.
