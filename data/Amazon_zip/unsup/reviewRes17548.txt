This is the biggest Indian restaurant I have been to. And I had their buffet today which I highly recommend! Lots of variety, food full of flavor, and reasonably priced. The buffet is $15.99 not incl tax and tip. (be prepared to pay 15% gratuity for a party over 2 people) I dont remember any of the names of the dishes but I can tell you they tasted great! In addition to the dishes they have laid out, they serve to your table a basket of naan and a hot dish of chicken. The variety they had is good for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. My favorite was the mango shorbet (soooooooo yummie and creamy), and their fried milk pastries (they look like donut holes drenched in syrup). I've never had either before at any Indian restaurant so I was happy to have tried something new. Its been over four hours since I ate and I'm still full from lunch! I hope to return soon!!
