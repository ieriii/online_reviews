I popped in here while running errands because I desperately needed a snack. . I ordered a piece of focaccia expecting it would simply be something good enough to feed my face, but not make me crash. It was an inspired slice of baking. The bread was moist, spongy, and airy. It was lightly covered in a really flavorful, well-seasoned tomato spread that made the top really creamy. There might have been a little bit of cheese on top that contributed to the creaminess. Regardless, the foccacia is not to be missed.
