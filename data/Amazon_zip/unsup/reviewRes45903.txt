Grand Lux Cafe is a VERY thinly veiled Cheesecake Factory. They pretty much made no effort at all to differentiate this place which I don't really appreciate. The overwhelming menu in particular is not my favorite. The location is obviously great if you are on Michigan and want a bite to eat and a drinkie. Even though we thought there would be a big wait (brunch on a Sunday!), they were able to seat our table of 10 within 15 minutes or so. The restaurant is huge and airy with lots of windows so that was really nice. Our server was extremely accomodating and made us feel like we were his only table. He also did a great job of topping off our coffee mugs which was much needed after a night out! Overall, the food was very tasty. Like Cheesecake, I am sure it was because it was laden in butter, salt, grease, chocolate, and all other matter of unhealthy yumminess. My favorite dish at our table with the chicken and waffles.  Overall, I enjoyed my brunch and coffee....while I was there. I pretty much felt full and guilty the rest of the day. Based on the portion sizes I saw around the place, I would bet alot of people leave feeling the same.
