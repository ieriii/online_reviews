I came here on a Sunday for brunch. I loved the ambiance and the nice decor. We Sunda does this east/west brunch that I thought was quite unique. I ordered the oxtail and potato "smash". Although I'm usually not a fan of fried eggs and would never order them otherwise, they were on the dish so I ended up eating them. The smash was very unique and I applaud that. Overall, the meal was good but I'll likely try something different next time.
