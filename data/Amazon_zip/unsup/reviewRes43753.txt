Milk and Honey, you will always have a special place in my heart. How many mid-day meals I've enjoyed at your table by the window, looking out at the milling Wicker Park crowds, up at the funky white light fixture, and around at the other happy, satified customers wolfing down your scrumptious offerings! And all those tempting baked goods in the glass cases up front, each making me go back for "just one more thing" even when I knew I shouldn't. You started what has now become an official addiction I have with brunching my way through Chicago. And even if I don't visit as often anymore, know that every time I pass your store front, I can't help but smile.
