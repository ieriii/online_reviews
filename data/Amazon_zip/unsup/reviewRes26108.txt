Not a fan of the the burnt crust. Oh, I forgot... it's "caramelized". When I accidently burn food, I just say it's "Cajun-style"! We ordered a sausage pizza with extra tomatoes. My guy swore that this was one of his favorite pizzas, but I am not impressed. The pizza was soggy underneath the toppings, and that burnt crust is gross. Never again.
