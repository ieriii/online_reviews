Don't be afraid of the giant hot dogs with glowing red eyes that will greet you from blocks away. This place has been rated one of the best Chicago-style hot dogs for years. You can even see them in an episode of the Girls Next Door (yes, I watch that show).  Get the hot dog with everything + hot peppers and though I am a ketchup feind (I later claim it is for the fries) I don't dare ask for it on my dog. The food comes in a little red box and though it does not look like too much they pack it in there. As a french fry lover, I wish they would give more fries but I make do.    Be prepared to spend $, it may suprise some how much they charge for a dog. In the summer there are tables outside, but otherwise I just take this to go - can't stand eating in my car. If you can try to bring at least one other person with you here. One to stay in the car since there is typically no parking and you usually have to dance around the narrow spaces when waiting, and another to run in and order the food.
