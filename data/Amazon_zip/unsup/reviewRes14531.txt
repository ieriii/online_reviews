Eaten here once, the food is pretty good. We went during off hours, so there was no wait, but I'd say the food is worth the wait. The beers are what make this place special -- strong flavors, and frankly, their grawlers hold up longer than they even suggest. Their molasses porter held up for four days without any sign of losing its freshness or flavor. If you take care of the seal and keep it cold, their beer should last you close to a week. I highly recommend the beer here, especially if you're a fan of Left Hand, Dogfish Head, Bell's, etc.
