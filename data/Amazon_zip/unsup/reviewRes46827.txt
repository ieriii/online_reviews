I love this place. I've been here twice already to see The Bergamot play, and I just love the space, the food, and the drinks. Yes, a little on the pricey side, but man I think it's worth it. You should def order the ginger martini, it's bueno! Eat, drink, and listen to music. Also the waitress we had was hilarious and so nice.
