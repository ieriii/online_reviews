Being a Californian, it's rare that I get a decent deep dish pizza around here. After Pequod's, I ALMOST got converted to this seriously intense pie, and I'm a thin crust pizza kind of girl. We noticed that they offered the thin crust variety but (of course) we opted for the small pan pizza, extra toppings: sausage, pepperoni, fresh garlic, and extra cheese. My was it lip-smacking, melt-in-your-mouth, porky, cheesy, garlicky goodness. And the crust, perfectly crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Definitely a game changer. This is not the slice of pie you eat with your hands, you've really got to get in there with a fork and knife. It's heavy and hearty and with only four slices we still had leftovers. Be patient, it's a thick, burly pizza so it will take about 30 minutes to cook. Completely worth the wait. I love the casual, sports bar atmosphere in here. Perfect place to come hang out, drink some brews, and share a pie.
