Longman & Eagle is very classy, "old Chicago," and delicious! You need to plan to "make an evening of it" here, the wait can be long, but if you're up for it, it's a great evening! There is a huge selection of cocktails, beers, whiskeys, and bourbons. So relax and enjoy a few drinks before you are called to your table.  The menu changes periodically, but old favorites remain. The meatballs over polenta are AMAZING! I have yet to try the roasted marrow bones, I'm curious. They have snacks, small plates, and entrees. You can definitely make a very good meal out of snacks and small plates. Everything is fresh and creative. For dessert, there was a side of goat cheese ice cream.
