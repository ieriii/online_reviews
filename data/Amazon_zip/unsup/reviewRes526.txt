My wife and I and two friends flew in to Chicago this weekend specifically to eat here. After reading the reviews and hearing about Grant Alchatz's tongue cancer, we figured that we should make sure that we ate there soon. It didn't disappoint. We did the 12 course tasting menu with wine pairings and over the course of 4 hours had a fantastic meal. My favorites included the wagyu beef covered in pine leaves and the "pumpkin pie" served skewed on a burnt oak branch, but it was all just a delight. Service was pleasant, informative, always there when needed but in the background the rest of the time.
