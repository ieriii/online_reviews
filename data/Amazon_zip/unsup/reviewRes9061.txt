Restaurant week was the perfect opportunity to go to Le Colonial. It's a pricey restaurant, but basically, the restaurant week menu gives you a free appetizer and dessert! Very nice. There were four of us, and we took advantage of the Restaurant week pricing, to order four separate appetizers... it almost doesn't matter what we ordered... everything was good, and the portions were better than average! Cha Gio (little vietnamese spring rolls) were a stand out... Tom Cuon Ram (Beignet wrapped shrimp) were just okay, but the pickled radish/carrots served with them were fabulous! Ca bam xuc banh trang (Wok-seared Monkfish) didn't sound quite as sexy, and didn't look quite as beautiful as some of the others... but it was the winner in the appetizer category...! Main Courses: Ca Nuong La Chuoi (Banana wrapped trout)... was my personal favourite... moist, delicious, served with glass noodles. Ga xao XA ot (Wok-seared lemongrass chicken)... good, but nothing to write home about... eclipsed by the trout, in my opinion. Desserts were equally impressive... mango ice-cream, with fruit was so much better than it sounds, and a beautiful follow up to the complex flavours of dinner. The banana chocolate dessert was good, but again, eclipsed by the mango dessert. The restaurant is lovely... linen table clothes, mood lighting, rich woods, and some of the most attentive wait staff I've seen. Our waiter was excellent... not pushy, just attentive enough... helpful when we asked for advice, but not at all snobby. Water glasses were never allowed to get too low, and the recommended wines and cocktails turned out to be excellent choices. Even the valet service was attentive and pleasant, and it was cold as the dickens outside. This is a pricey evening, but highly recommended... by me.
