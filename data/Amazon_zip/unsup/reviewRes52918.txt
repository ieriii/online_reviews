Big fan. Went here last night with a bottle of rum and an empty stomach. Left completely satisfied.  The tostones were perfect and the garlic sauce they poured on top - well, they didn't pour enough! The avocado salad was so fresh and the texture was great. I had the bistec sandwich and my boyfriend had the tofu sandwich. Both were on wheat french bread (nice touch!) and both were crispy and soft in all the right places. The flavors were so distinct and fit perfectly together. The only thing I'd change, is next time I'd add avocado to my sandwich. I read some reviews where they explained that if you bring a bottle of rum, they'll make you fresh mojitos. It's true and they went down easily. The patio was awesome. The tables weren't too close together even though there was plenty of seating. Our waitress was a sweeheart. I really got the feeling that this place really takes pride in who they are and what they serve.  We should have started eating here earlier in the summer.
