Good decor and lighting, friendly servers, yummy sushi! My friend and I joke about the "Oast" tour of Toast Too for breakfast and Coast Sushi for dinner, right across the street but that's not to say we're ever disappointed if that is indeed the plan! All my friends in LA mock me for eating sushi "in the middle of the country" but I have to say that the rolls at Coast are pretty damn good! I do remember really enjoying the white dragon and coast crab maki both quite a bit. I can't speak to their sashimi, but the quality of the fish also seemed to be quite good. Dark and kind of trendy so probably a good date place too!
