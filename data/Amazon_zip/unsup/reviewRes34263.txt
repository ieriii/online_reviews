Eureka!!! I have found it. The perfect breakfast place close to home. I dream about the french toast & turkey sausage from Yolk. If you can withstand the weekend crowds (which can be daunting...45 mins to an hour at peak times), it's surely worth the wait. The folks here are friendly, the patrons are a good cross-section of Chicago & the freshly squeezed strawberry orange juice will keep me coming back again...and again.
