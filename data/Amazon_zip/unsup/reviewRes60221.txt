My 2nd review on Yelp goes to my favorite pizzeria Fogo 2 Go. They opened up last year, are Brazilian(hence the name Fogo..means Fire i found out), and are just very unique. I normally order pizzas split 1/2 and 1/2, and have tried about 14 of their 60 types of pizza. I often repeat my favorites as well, but normally try a new type on at least half my pizza.  Delivery here is longer than places like Dominos(haven't ordered from them in ages..Yuk), but worth the wait for me. They have other stuff like garlic knots, which are yummy fresh garlic bread twists they bake in their pizza oven. The Coxinha(??) is this delicious chicken/mash potato empanada thing that you just have to try too. I've bought my office pizzas and chicken for lunch from them in the Loop, and it was a big hit each time..Great food, great service, fresh, and unique..Try them too
