I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I ate at Alinea. Everything about this restaurant is PERFECT!! I just wish I had another $450 bucks to spend on a meal!! The meal was magical! It was like being in a dream! If you can make it to Alinea and you have an open mind...GO FOR IT!! You will not be disappointing!!
