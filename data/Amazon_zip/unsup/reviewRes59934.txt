Wedding guests generally don't comment on the cake, right? It's usually fine, but it's rarely something special. Well, we got our wedding cake from Alliance Bakery, and according to many of our guests, it was delicious! We selected a chocolate cake with an apricot preserve filling, and the cake was a huge hit.Plus, Alliance's wedding cake prices were reasonable, and their staff was easy to work with. Done and done.
