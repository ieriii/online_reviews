Oh beacon of light in a night where there was no hope. Halloween night in Chicago - stopped by a few restaurants, people were very rude and we took a cab to your glowing door. Got a great table and with beer in hand we relaxed and ate. It was just great. We had the cheese plate, brisket sandwich, and the CB&J - cashew butter, fig jam and j for some kind of cheese, toasted. tasty. the brisket was good - a bit dry for my taste but my other half very much enjoyed it. Thanks for a great meal!
