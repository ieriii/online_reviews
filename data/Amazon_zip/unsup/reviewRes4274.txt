As far as the club/bar scene in Chicago - the Green Mill is an institution. I get that. BUT BE FOREWARNED - the bottle service here is deplorable! I have been told that to come to this place expecting wine may be out of the question. However, I do not care if they are the grandfathers of the jazzy cocktail lounge - I just want to get what I order! A friend and I ordered an inexpensive bottle of red. It came to the table without a cork and to add insult - there was about a glass worth of liquid missing! When we tried to discuss the problem with the bartender - they (because it takes more than one lug to handle two girls with an issue by himself) threw a fit! I will think twice before I come back to this place - if not because of the terrible wine service - then certainly because of the uncouth dimwits that work the bar...
