Hmmmm....Chicago Diner is a tough one. Hands down they get creative on ways to find alternatives for meat. Which sometimes I just like a veg dish w/ no alternative. The Reuben is good, I cant deny it. Other dishes (gyro and tamales) as well are very good too, but I truly feel that alot of their foods are greasy at the sametime. I do like this place but there are other veg places that I would choose over. I can do veg but no way to vegan. No offense, just not my style so I cant speak on that portion. The outside is nice so you dont leave smelling like diner food. Yuck!
