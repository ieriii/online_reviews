The only star they lose is for the waiting I always seem to have to do when I come here, whether it be for lunch or for dinner. I've come to realize that I have never had a bad meal at KCH. Their salads are works of art. The steak risotto is my favorite and most often-ordered, but I have had some great burgers and sandwiches too (the prime rib sammich is especially tasty). The portabello ravioli is very, very good, as is the filet mignon. Sadly, I have not been able to afford the filet often enough here.
