Bottom line: incredible food, horrible service. Actually, the wait staff is knowledgable, courteous, and enthusiastic, but it's the folks at the front of the restaurant that are the problem. News flash: when you make someone wait an hour from their reservation time for a bad table, maybe you should comp something. Or at least refrain from being rude.
