Burgers are really good, fries are very sub par no matter how they spice them up. I think the reason they have so many flavors for fries is because they are so bland. The atmosphere is a lot of fun with a large assortment of board games as well as an infinite # of beers! I recommend the Double Crooked Tree to IPA lovers.
