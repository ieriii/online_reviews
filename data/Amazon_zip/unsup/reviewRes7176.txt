Wow. Where to start? How about the "elegant" or "heightened" dining experience. Not even close. The table was dirty with dried BBQ sauce on it. My yet to be used small "bread" plate was dirty as well. When I asked for a new one, the server simply took it away without a word and never returned with a new one. When I payed the bill in cash, it took an inordinate amount of time to get my change. I thought that excellent BBQ would overcome the disappointment of the service. The ribs and brisket were almost tasteless- no smoke flavor whatsoever. And the side sauces were no help, in fact they were simply not good. I was so hopeful about this place, but now believe it is a hopeless cause.
