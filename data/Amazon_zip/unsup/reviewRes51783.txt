Love the carne asada dinner. Tacos are good too - especially the pork. Salsa rocks. Inexpensive and generous portions (the avocado salad is as big as your head). Chicken soup is really filling (huge chunks of veggies and big, whole pieces of chicken) and great comfort food. Good, dependable, cheap Mexican. Friendly service. Worth a weeknight meal for sure.
