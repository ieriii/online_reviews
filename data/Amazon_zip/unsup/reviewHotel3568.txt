I was so excited to have booked a room here in anticipation of our visit to Chicago after the Flying Pig marathon in Cincinnati. But we started bad and it went downhill from there. The building was having some renovations so there was some scaffolding in the entrance which sort of took away from the experience of "arriving at the Drake." We were greeted with half smiles by the reception. Room on the first floor, city view. I had not done enough research to know to request a lake view, so I kept my mouth shut. We entered our room which was spacious, with a king bed and couch. Bathroom with tub, but on the smaller side. About 10pm, some construction or maintenance along Michigan Avenue started. It was a loud drone of machinery, the kind where you feel incredible relief upon its cessation. But it didn't cease. Not past midnight. Not past 1am. We finally called the front to see what could be done, the best they offered were these cheap earplugs. And the bed was too soft for my comfort, I woke up every couple hours to pain in my back. I know it wasn't the hotel's fault, but having paid $360 for ONE night, i really expected more than first floor, street noise, spongy earplugs, and back pain. It's a beautiful hotel, but I will never again stay here.
