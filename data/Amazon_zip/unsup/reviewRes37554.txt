F&O acted like a Whole Foods to me. A place where really rich people dispose of their cash on the same items that can be found at a Jewel but at F&O is it marked up because it resides among the $1MM plus condos. Good for you if you got it. Also since it is pretty desolate in terms of places with food they sort of have a monopoly on the market. Kudos to them for that strategic move as well. We stopped in here to find a cafe (since all frou frou stores have one) to get a bit to eat before Cirque Shanghai. Selection was better that your average panini type sammy shop. They had ahi tuna, burgers, personal pizzas, salads etc... I will say that it was a legitimate cafe and the menu was broad. We ordered the pizza and angus burger. Burger was juicy but nothing i'll remember. The pizza was better, but the cheese was a bit overwhelming. The meal was filling and the place was filled with face people so it made for good aesthetics. All in all would go back if I were looking to get a bite before a show at Navy Pier, would not go seeking it out. Recommend for lunch if you are already grocery shopping int he store, but I would rather walk a few blocks west and go to other restaurants.
