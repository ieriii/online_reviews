I've dined at Tru at least four times, but possibly more like eight (I can't quite remember) - so I feel pretty confident about my feeling that it is the best restaurant I've ever been to (and that list includes French Laundry, and multiple trips to Charlie Trotters). Every little touch is brilliant. Every taste is superb. The four most memorable items from my Tru experiences are: -The Pain Perdu with Fois Gras and chocolate sauce that my wife had. -Rose lollipop. Delicious, and so fun to eat as I strolled up Michigan Avenue on my way back to work. -A creme brulee with slices of banana below the crust, which was embedded with macadamia nuts, and then the whole thing topped with macerated stone fruits. Awesome. -The mushroom risotto. Typically risotto is something I can only eat so much of - it's usually better as side for me - especially mushroom risotto. There's just something kind of one dimensional about risotto that makes me crave some variety. I could have eaten a gallon of Tru's mushroom risotto.
