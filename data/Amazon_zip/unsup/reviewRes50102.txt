we really REALLY wanted to write a positive review for this place. regardless of recent postings, this doesn't have anything to do with their liquor license. we have loved this place in the past, but after three tries, it continues to disappoint. service: our order was screwed up as one of us ordered a half size; it came to the table as full. when we told the waiter, he told us to keep it anyway since they'd have to throw away the other half anyway. the person who ordered it only ate half, but then they charged us for the full order! also, one of us had to send the shrimp back because it was not edible (only one bite was taken), and yes, THEY CHARGED US ANYWAYS! food: (in addition to the inedible shrimp) the salsa was tasteless (compared to other columbian restaurants, like llano's, which is awesome) and the other food was just barely mediocre. we are very sad to say that we won't ever go back. we had 10 that night, and the opinion was unanimous.
