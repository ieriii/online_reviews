review of a latin restaurant from the POV of a vegi... take it or leave it :)... it's nice to have a healthy alternative especially at a latin restaurant. it's even nicer to have a vegi option that isn't 90% cheese. the 2 options: pasta (blah) or the quinoa with grilled vegetables, which was prepared very well - the quinoa not too grainy and the vegetables still crisp. the dish could have included MORE vegetables and a side of plantains (since the meat dishes get sides... where's the love?). i did go ahead and treat myself to the plantains as a separate side order. it was more than enough to share - my party of 8 didn't even finish it. the plaintains which were some of the best around - not too mushy and not too sugary where you are picking sugar crystals out of your teeth. the mac and cheese was amazing - made with larger rigatoni noodles, white cheeses and sprinkled with herbed bread crumbs. SO GOOD. pass on the desserts - they are all overpriced: the chocolate cake was way too dry, the lime tart was way too sweet, the bread pudding was just... well... forgettable.
