Went back to Publican over the weekend and had a very enjoyable Brunch. Service was very good from our server to our attentive busser who made sure that we were always looked after. Had the French pressed coffee and it was worth the extra few bucks from the regular coffee. I had the Hanger steak which was very tough (I know hanger steak isn't a tender cut but thought it would be marinated at Publican to make it more tender). The potaoes and eggs were great with the steak but still the main part of the dish was only average and I didn't finish the steak. Mrs had the red wine poached eggs which she realy enjoyed and we shared the Publican bacon (amazing, if you go you have to get it) and the hash browns which are the best I have ever had. Had a waffle for dessert and it again was very good but I've had better. Again feel that Publican isn't far off a five star review but a tough steak was the difference between 4 and 5 stars.
