Upscale BBQ. I adore the atmosphere and decor. A Yelp quick tip accurately described it as the South meeting Room & Board. Well said. I struck up a conversation with an stranger/employee from the restaurant randomly last week at a fast food restaurant on Michigan Ave, who told me about the place and that I would not be disappointed. I'm a former vegetarian and don't eat much meat, but her confidence told me I couldn't pass this place up. After reading a couple of reviews, I knew I had to try this new spot. They even have a gluten free menu.  Absolutely divine. My BF and I sat in the bar and ordered the pulled chicken and pulled pork sandwiches. The waiter warned us the food would be out before we knew it and wow....we barely waited 2 minutes. Just enough time to order a couple of Mint Juleps and nosh on the yummy homemade chips they served us. We were instantly blown away. Make sure to sample each of the sauces and add what appears to be heirloom onions to your plate. The Mint Juleps are pretty stiff. They had to doctor mine up a bit. The service was amazing. And the food was even better. See my photos. The trophies sitting next to us were a testament. Our waiter informed me that the girl I met on Michigan Ave. was in fact the award winning trophy winner....! Thank you kind stranger. Consider me a new regular. I hope to see this new find around for years to come. I'm so glad to see this new business in my hood. Consider the word officially spread :) A+.
