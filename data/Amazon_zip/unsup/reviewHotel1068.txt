I would definitely stay at the Fairmont again, if only for their giant sparkly mural in the lobby! Alright so maybe not just because of that, but that thing is amazing. I wish I could have it in my apartment. The staff here is so nice, and wasn't overwhelmed when our group of over 40 people checked in all at the same time. Our rooms weren't ready yet, but they let a few of us change downstairs in the spa, and wow is that place beautiful! If you can fork up the extra cash, definitely spend some time down there. Or hey, if you're me, just go down there to change clothes and scope it out. Our corner room was really nice and a great size, and the same goes for the bathroom. The views can't be beat, either. We ordered room service a few times and everything was great! Expensive, but that comes with the territory. The only thing I didn't like was about an hour after your room service arrived, someone would knock on the door to take everything back. While that may seem convenient, it actually was a little annoying because the first time I was in the shower and the second time I was sleeping. The guy actually came in after knocking and picked everything up -- as I was sleeping. I thought I was dreaming but when I woke up the food was gone. Kind of creepy! This is a great, centrally-located Chicago hotel. The bar doesn't suck, either! Consider it while staying in the Chi.
