I can't chime in and say much that hasn't been said before. . . worth the wait, sporty and 50's-y, awesome service and best food ever.  But after today I had to write a review to pimp the Game of the Week - Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Rosemary-Garlic Mustard and Applewood-Smoked Cheddar Cheese. It just was unreal. The chunks of cheese and the mustard were the only things on it and there were completely perfect amounts of both. I don't know how he comes up with this perfect combinations.  My group was debating about how funky the specials can get, but this game of the week was pretty simple, especially compared to my sort-of regular dog, the Marty Allen, a thurdinger chicago-style. Believe the hype, get over not wanting to wait, plus, this is perfect waiting weather.  oh, see that picture of the cartoon hot dog with a with squiggly S of mustard? i was with a girl that has it tattoo'd on her leg. now that's hard core.
