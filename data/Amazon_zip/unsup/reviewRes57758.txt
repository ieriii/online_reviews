I have been to this restaurant a couple times now and have always been overly impressed with the menu, staff and ambiance. The menu seems to change daily and the prices are more than reasonable especially for the location. I had a bad experience dining in one night when I was caught in the middle of what I thought was an altercation between two customers. It was very uncomfortable and it seemed that no one wanted to intervene as a belligerent drunken women screamed at a man until they finally left the restaurant in disgust. Deciding to return to the restaurant this week I was met again with the face of who I thought was an unruly drunken customer only to later find out this was actually the owner of the restaurant. As I watched her stumble throughout the dining room, wine glass in hand, I first thought maybe I should help escort her home. I asked my waiter what was going on and he quietly informed me that she was the owner. After watching her for some time I lost my appetite and interest in what I thought was a tasteful restaurant in the heart of the Gold Coast. As I impatiently waited for my check I witnessed yet another outburst from my favorite character when she confronted one of the wait staff in the middle of the restaurant. I lost my taste for this restaurant once and for all at this moment.
