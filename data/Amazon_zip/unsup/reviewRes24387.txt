Sep 3 was second visit. I was regrettably talked into the 3 course $65 per person dinners. My wait person was an appetite depleting obese male w/ greasy blond hair, and an Israeli accent to boot. White wine was great, food was above average. My advice, ask for a pleasent wait person, if you encounter the above. refuse the 3 course $65 per person dinner. insist on tasting at least 3 wines before selecting one. Avoid the beef ( expensive and tough ). make do with vegetarian tapas, cheeses, and cold cuts.
