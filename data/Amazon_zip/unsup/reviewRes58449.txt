My wife and I have been regulars for weekend dinners at the India House restaurant in Downtown Chicago over the last several months, but Saturday night (1/23) we had the best experience so far in terms of Ambience and Service. We have had the opportunity to visit India a couple of times and learn the Indian Culture, and last night at India House, it brought back memories as we felt we were being welcomed back to India by a very Elegant Young Lady in Traditional Indian clothes, who was very professional and seated us at the best table available, as the place was super busy like every night. My wife and I were very impressed by her hospitality, and her warm personality. The Food has always been excellent at India House, with the wide variety of choices they have - Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Gosht, Palak Paneer and many more. The Naans (Garlic Naan, Regular Naan) and the Tandoori Chicken are to die for. Like the New Budlight Commercial goes - Not too Light, Not too Heavy, I would summarize the India House Food as - Not too Spicy, Not too Greasy, - Just Perfect I never miss an opportunity to go here for the Lunch Buffet too, as this is the best Indian Buffet I have ever had. I highly recommend this place to everyone.
