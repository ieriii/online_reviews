Super delicioso food, at very reasonable prices. Nothing fancy, but it is hard to go away hungry here. Great place to grab some grub if you just went to the Mexican cultural museum. It is walking distance from there.  It's authentic tasty comidas Mexicanas. (Mexican food)  CASH only.  Probably not a good place to go if you are a whiny "special needs" Biff/Trixie from Lincoln Park.
