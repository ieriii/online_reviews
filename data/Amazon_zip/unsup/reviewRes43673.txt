Love Milk & Honey!!! Prepare to wait in line if you go during peak hours, such as weekend brunch. My favorites are the tuna melt, the hummus/ mushroom/ spinach/ feta wrap, breakfast panini, and the breakfast burrito special. All of their bakery items always look delicious. They also have really great coffee and friendly service. They also offer cocktails such as Bloody Marys and Mimosas and different types of beer and wine. I highly suggest it. It's a weekend brunch favorite for my room mates and I!
