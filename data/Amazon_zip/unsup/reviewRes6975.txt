Bellisima. Sapori Trattoria has the perfect atmosphere and food creations for a great evening out in Lincoln Park. When I went, it was with friends, but frankly, this is a great place to just KILL IT on a date. Eschewing the rubbery pasta and overload of marinara that has sadly become the state of Italian these days, Sapori instead chases new flavors that I'd never seen in an italian restaurant, for instance, Pumpkin ravioli (Cappellacci di Zucca). Absolutely delicious, and a taste completely out of left field. Their grilled calamari with roasted red pepper and balsamic looks almost like grilled BBQ chicken! So good! Crusted bread with tomatoes, avocado, and provolone cheese rounds out a crisp, delicious appetizer. Spaghetti Barese features delicious noodles, a rich red sauce, and veal sausages. Fantastic. Their desserts are rich without being heavy, I sampled their Bread pudding, Panna Cotta, and Tiramasu, and loved them all. The service was prompt, but relaxed, ensuring an enjoyable meal for all. I will definitely be back.
