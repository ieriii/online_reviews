Ditto on not repeating a review. But I was not impressed. I do think the food is above average for a bar/pub .. it is not a restaurant. The music is too loud and you cannot escape it to have a conversation. Minus one star ... The beers are noteworthy but it took another patron is a brewmaster friend to explain them - the waiter wasn't able to do so - that's down to 3 stars. BTDT .. the end.
