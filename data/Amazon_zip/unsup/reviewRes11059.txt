Hmmmm.... bongo used to be my favorite brunch locale in the city. My friend and I used to go there almost every weekend to recuperate from a night out.  I'm not sure if I've outgrown the bongo room, or if I've found too many other places with good food and less wait. I just don't go there very often anymore, but I think it is still worth trying out especially if you live nearby. Bongo's strong points are the eggs benedict, the egg croissant sandwich and the apple cinnamon pancakes. Some of the other pancake items are a bit too sugary for my taste. Bongo's big weak point is the wait. Be prepared to wait at least an hour on the weekend.
