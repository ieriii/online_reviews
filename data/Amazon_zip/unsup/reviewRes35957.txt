July 25, 2009 My wife and I dined at Shaw's Crab House last night, and it was fantastic. We have eaten out at a lot of restaurants, and we can honestly say that Shaw's (either Chicago or Schaumburg) still has it going on, and is top of our list for consistent, quality seafood and shellfish. The food is always prepared right, with great service, and the dining room is comfortable, where you can relax and enjoy your meal. Here was our dinner/all worthy selections: Start with their hand-shucked dozen assortment of oysters (Chicago Magazine just voted "the best" oysters), then their famous jumbo lump crabmeat crabcake (North Shore magazine voted "best crabcake"), then their wonderful Lobster Bisque soup, then split an order of their steamed Alaskan King Crab legs with side of melted butter, then try the in-season special, three delicious soft shell crabs sauted in lemon, garlic butter, all with great veggie sides, and end it all with Key Lime Pie and Homers Peppermint Ice Cream with Hot Fudge sauce. Hot Intelligentsia coffee drinks and specialty tea capped it all off, and we were very happy. Shaw's has the seafood dining experience down to a perfect science. Highly recommend!
