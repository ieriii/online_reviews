Just went there for lunch. WTF...where do they get these wings from??? These wings are on steroids (in a very good way). The guy at the counter was more than helpful. He suggested the 5 wings with two different sauces. The only negative thing about this place is the price, it's around $2 per wing. For that price it should be awesome. I will definitely go back and try the other stuff.
