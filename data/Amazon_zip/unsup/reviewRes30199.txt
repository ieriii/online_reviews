There are ALOT of dining options in Chicago and I am all about experiencing new places. I have had mainly great experiences where I have gone, this is the first that was not so great. 1. Anything sushi that I had was masked in spiciness so all I know is their water isn't too bad. Telling me the sushi is terrible and they are hiding it by burning my mouth. 2. The pork belly and the duck are inedible, not tender - no flavor, just bad 3. The bartender noticed that I liked sushi/sashimi and confirmed by asking me. He then took a piece of paper and wrote down a place that I should go to for really good sushi....Arami, that pretty much sums up how good this place is. Their own people won't even eat it. Think I will pass this one by next time.
