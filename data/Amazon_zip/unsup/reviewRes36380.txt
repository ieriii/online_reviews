Word to the wise, if you want to get a table, come early! I met up with a couple of friends at 11am and there was already quite a line. Luckily we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes before we were seated. Meli offers a ton of options, so many options that I was completely overwhelmed, everything looked delicious! I only wish that they had a sampler patter. I finally decided on the zuchinni french toast - they pretty much take zuchinni bread, lightly batter it and serve it to you nice and warm with fresh whipped cream and berries. Wow I am salivating just thinking about it again. It was delicious, plus did i mention it was real whipped cream?  The coffee is strong and they make sure to keep your cup filled here!  Did I mention that our food came out super fast? That is always a plus for me! I would take another trip to Greek town for Meli anytime!
