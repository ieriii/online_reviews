Great pizza and beer! I'll admit, I wasn't Piece's biggest fan the first few times I went. I'm not sure if the pizza is any different but I think my palate adjusted to the "New Haven" style pizza. In fact, I now think that this pizza is some of the best in the city if you're looking for a thin crust that is perfectly baked. Unlike most standard pizza spots in the city, Piece has 3 main types of pizza: plain, red, and white. Their sauce there is delicious and they use high quality ingredients. My fave is the White Pizza with extra clams, garlic and bacon. mmmm mmmmm mmmm Their beer here is also excellent. There is nothing better than craft beer and know that it's made here in the great city of Chicago. I couldn't tell you which brew is my fave because honestly I don't remember the name since it gets me hammered every time.
