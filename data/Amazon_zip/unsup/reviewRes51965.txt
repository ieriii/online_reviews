I'm a native Chicagoan, I take my pizza very seriously. I've lived here for over 29 of my 33 years. The old saying is that American pizza was popularized in New York and perfected in Chicago. I really can't put it any better myself. This brings us to the shining example of simple, fresh, deliscious, deep dish Chicago style pizza. The best of the best is Gino's East. The key is is the different crust that Gino's uses versus the competition. Now, you'll hear people go on about Connie's, Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and those are all fine pizzas, but they are NOT (in my humble opinion) the best of the best. There is something special about Gino's East. It screams Chicago! It's bold, it's unpretentious, it's simple, it's fresh, takes a back seat to no one and makes sense! (Basically the complete opposite of New York) Stopping in the location is a very fun way to have a relaxed date night but you simply cannot beat this pizza. It is by far my favorite of all time and I highly recommended!
