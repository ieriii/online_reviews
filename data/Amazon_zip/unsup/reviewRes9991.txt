This place will always have a special place in my heart. After having Schwa cancel my dinner reservations with 4 hours notice on my husbands 50th birthday I needed to find a place and fast. My husband is a vegetarian so Italian is perfect.  I ask a few natives where the best Italian restaurant is and 2 out of 3 pointed me here. I called and they were booked, I told the hostess my sad story (husbands 50th, Schwa cancelling last minute - boo hoo) and she gets me in.  We were greeted warmly, sat in in lively back room and enjoyed a fantastic meal. Ravioli with shaved black truffles, white pizza and arugula (we asked them to shave black truffles on the pizza and it was no problem), the anti-pasta and beet salad were fantastic.  Our waiter was fantastic, he didn't miss a beat. This is great Italian food with a lively atmosphere. My husband had a fantastic birthday!  I can't wait to come back.
