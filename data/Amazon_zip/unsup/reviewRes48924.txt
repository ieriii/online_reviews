This is quickly becoming one of my favorite brunch places.  The brunch entrees seem traditional enough but the restaurant puts its own spin on it and makes it different so even though you may be ordering the same "every day" breakfast entree...it sure doesn't taste the same. I guess an easy way to say it is that The Publican takes the boring out of brunch entrees.  I don't think I've gotten grits at another place in Chicago. This place serves them and they are delicious. (Believe me...I'm from the South--and the South doesn't even make 'em like this!)  I mean, who gets excited about grits?  I know, right? This place takes the boring out of your run-of-the-mill everyday food items.  The pork rinds appetizer was unusual but delicious.  The entrees all very good. The coffee, hot and fresh.   Seating is a bit odd. It's either a long family style table or booths with a door that encloses you in. It's a bit claustrophobic in those booths. However, I can tolerate it because I really appreciate that this place is different. It's not your everyday restaurant seating arrangement. The bathrooms are also cool.  The service can be a bit slow, but that's because this place is always packed for brunch! It's a bit of a drive if you life north of the city, but well worth a trip to the meat-packing district to get your grub on for a not-so-boring brunch.
