Absolutely adore this place. Great food. Whenever we have guests I make sure to show them xoco. Staples are the woodland mushroom torts, the Pepito and agua del dia. Price- little pricey but well worth it. Quantity- good sized portion. Enough to make you feel like you didn't pay too much for too little food. Quality- most excellent. Some of the best food I've ever had. Atmosphere- very modern and uncomplicated. The only gripe I have is when xoco is busy I don't think the seating and ordering process is as efficient as it could be, which adds to the wait. Staff- very nice. Only one time have I been dissatisfied with the staff and I think it was because the person was new and didn't understand what gluten allergies were. Love it. Bring friends. Take it to go so you don't wait as long and go eat at merchandise mart down the street. Thanks Rick!
