It was a sad day when Con Sabor Cubano closed, since it was so close to home. I felt a cuban sammich void. Until we found 90 Miles. K and I have made numerous lunch visits to 90 Miles, and have tried several of the sammiches on the menu - lechon, ropa vieja, croqueta, and the traditional cuban. All are solid. Oh, and please do yourself a favor and ask them to put the fried shoestring potatoes on your lechon sammich. You'll thank me later. The maduros and tostones are also a favorite. And don't pass up the mango shake! I can't walk out the door without ordering one, even though in no way do I need one. I just can't say no. The owners and the staff behind the counter are very willing to offer suggestions on what to try, so don't be afraid to ask!
