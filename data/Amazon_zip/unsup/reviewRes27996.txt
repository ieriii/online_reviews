Not a 'Chicago Experience' by any means when it comes to pizza, but one thing is for sure: the food is DAMN good. This place was hopping when we stopped in after a quick change of plans on our way to Potbelly. The prices are reasonable, but they absolutely nickel and dime you. Two of us got a medium pizza with two ingredients, garlic bread, and each drank water and got out for a little over $30.00 including a reasonable tip. The service is so-so, not bad by any means. The food is great. The prices are fair but annoyingly nitpicky. It'd eat there again if the crave hit me.
