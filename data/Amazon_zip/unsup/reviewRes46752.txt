This is a great restaurant. I love the cozy environment and fun atmosphere. They serve great drinks and offer a salad bar.   The food, service, and drinks has always been great.  Grunts burgers are absolutely my favorite!  They're consistently good and, in my opinion, #1 in the city.  Delicious! Oh, and if you've wondered--all the pictures on the walls are of waitresses that have in the past or currently work at Grunts...at least that's what one of the staff members told me.
