Ok, I originally boycotted this place because white people were so hype on it, but hey whatever I gave in and it was alright. They pho wasn't the best, definitely wasn't the worst. Ain't no Cali pho and mine's still better. The service was good because I went on a Sunday morning before I got my hair cut and it was like 10:30 AM so it was pretty empty except for maybe 2 other tables having the breakfast of champions, which is of course pho. I also got a cafe sua da (iced coffee with condensed milk) it was pretty good as well. I'll actually probably give this place another go this weekend because I wanna give it another chance to live up to the hype.
