I will just say I have absolutely no idea what New Haven pizza is, but if this is it, you can count me in. I now know why almost 700 people have reviewed Piece on Yelp and it still maintains 4 strong stars (the service would be the reason I would give it one less star). You will wait, but it goes by pretty quickly. This is when you can have a beer! They brew their own beer too but yet to try it, but how awesome is that? You can also take the time to get prepared on what pizza you want because they are no nonsense when it is time to order. In an attempt to adventurous, the friends and I went a red pizza and a white pizza. Even 24 hour later, I am not sure which I enjoyed more. We got the red pizza with onions, mushrooms and peppers. The pizza sort of falls apart so you might need to bust out the fork and knife, which is typically a sin. The marinara was seriously delish and it had a good pizza taste. Hearty as well with a lot of veggies! That made me happy since they charge $1.75/topping. The white pizza had meatballs and spinach. Fantastic! It was very garlic-y so be sure youre not the only one eating it. The make the meatballs themself so they are moist and flavorful. You can really taste each ingredient as it adds body fat. You can watch a video of the place on Check, Please (http://tinyurl.com/682uuv). They throw out some tasty recommendations too! Great atmosphere and a fun place to bring locals and out-of-towners. Definitely will not be my last trip to Piece.
