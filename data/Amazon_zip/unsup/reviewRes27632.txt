Hard crunchy rice, tamales so dry that I had to use a knife and fork, beans tasted like they came from a can. I just don't get the allure of this restaurant. Due to the rating, I was expecting much more. So very disappointed. Went on a Sunday night. It was busy, but may this is not a good day to go. Won't ever be back. The service was friendly but extremely slow and not organized at all. The place was packed, though. I have been to taquerias around town that are FAR better than this place.
