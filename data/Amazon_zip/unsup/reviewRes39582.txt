This is the utility infielder of Korean restaurants, great for any occasion. Whether it's late night dining, lunch, or a large group gathering, San Soo can fit the bill. I recommend the haemul pajun (seafood pancake) and of course the kalbi or bulgogi. The dubus and jigaes are good, but not great. Pork tends to get overcooked on the table-top grill and I tend to stay away from the squid. Large parties are seated at booths where it is customary to take off your shoes. As a courtesy, be sure to where socks that match and/or do not have holes.
