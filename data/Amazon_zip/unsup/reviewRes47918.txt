I am a huge brunch fan and I have tried brunches from the Loop, to the Mag Mile (in the fanciest restaurants), to Wicker Park and Lincoln Square and let me tell you ZED451 offers the best service and the finest quality of food in a beautiful space. You will NOT be disappointed. They open Saturdays and Sundays for brunch.
