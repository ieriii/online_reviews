Small dishes at a reasonable price considering the high quality & great flavors. Haven't ordered anything bad here yet. Great for brunch, lunch, and late night eats. Nice feel with all the wood and communal bar tables (there are small separate tables, too). It's a socializing kinda place, so don't go if you expect quiet and privacy. Favorites: Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs Smear (the bread is SO good!); Coppa; Affogato.
