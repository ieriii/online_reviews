I had been to Glenn's several years ago for breakfast. We were in the area last night looking for a place to eat and I remembered that Glenn's did dinner too. They've come a long way over the years and they have an extensive menu now with a huge seafood specials menu. We had shrimp cocktail and 'shrimpcargo' to start. Both excellent. The scallops were the hugest scallops I've ever seen and cooked perfectly. The spinach salad was unbelievable and the unique pasta special, while very unique, was excellent as well. Everything they brought out was obviously prepared with care.
