Great location right off of the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave! Friendly staff, clean rooms, affordable (for downtown Chicago), overall great value...My favorite part was the big comfy King beds. Probably the best night of sleep I ever had outside of my own home! Marriott always does a great job, and this location follows suit wonderfully.
