I have very fond memories of this place and try to make it back there as often as I can. Over 10 years ago,during a wedding anniversary, me and my wife were introduced to FONDUE- it has been a wonderful ride since then. Being great fans of fondue, Gejas definitely sets a high bar - you cannot go to the Windy City and not make a stop here. Just about anything you order will be AWESOME- Try it out, be adventurous order anything you may think of- it is all good !! guaranteed.
