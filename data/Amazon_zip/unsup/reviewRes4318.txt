After having passed this club of "the sparkling green sign" hundreds of times as I rode the Red Line, a friend of mine suggested we get a drink and watch some "Gypsy Jazz" at the Green Mill. And so I went. And was not just pleasantly surprised but, frankly, delighted by my experience. The cover for that night was $6; normally I don't do covers, but I paid and walked in, hoping that it wouldn't be money wasted. It wasn't. First, the place is a throw back to another time. Offering both tables and booths lit by warm candlelight or seating at the beautiful bar, TGM knows how to pour a drink. My gin and tonic was perfect and, a couple more down the line kept us sitting there for several hours. But there was so much more that was good. I particularly liked that the band was obviously the center of the evening; every so often we were reminded that conversations should be kept at a minimum while they were playing--while the reminder didn't hinder our conversation, I liked the fact that they treated the band as the primary reason for being there and not a clacking sideshow. I was also surprised and pleased with the ability to make the space whatever you want. I felt under-dressed but didn't have to: dress ranged from very dressy to me (jeans and t-shirt) and no one seemed to care. No air of pretension or trying to hard...just a place to have good live music playing while you catch up with friends. I can't wait to go back. The gangsters might be gone (although that's ALWAYS a conversation piece) but it still feels like the perfect hole in the wall that just upscale enough that you don't have to worry about what that black thing is stuck to your glass or why your feet stick to the floor. And the round rock glasses are fun and quirky. Love it. Love...it...
