Visited Fox & Obel for the first time last week. Why oh why are the pastries and baked goods so humungous? So much for portion control. I'd prefer to eat, say, a smaller pastry and pay less than $2.99 for that same pastry. Bah well. Four foods I tried at Fox & Obel: --Cinnamon Swirl http://bit.ly/deuY19 --Double-Baked Almond Croissant --Raisin Bran Muffin --Olive Ciabatta Bun F&O's cinnamon swirl was simply delightful. It had an airy, light texture to it and the cinnamon flave was very subtle. The entire pastry wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be, which was a good thing. And the shape! This pastry is truly shaped as a big, bold, soft, swirly-swirl! F&O's almond croissant was unlike any almond croissant I have ever eaten! Texture-wise, it was madd crispy on the outside, hence, the double-bakedness of it. Crunch crunch in mah mouf.
