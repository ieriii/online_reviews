i really like piece and i can't put my finger on why because the pizza isn't anything special. it's fine, but i think it's the fact that it reminds me of a place i used to go to in college. perhaps there's something about drinking beer and eating pizza that is comforting to me. as with so many places in chicago, they have a great beer selection. there are always a lot of people around and the atmosphere fun. just a good, casual place to get decent pizza and beer.
