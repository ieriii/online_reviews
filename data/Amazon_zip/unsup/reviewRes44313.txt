Absolutely my favorite place for sushi in the city! In response to those whining about the corkage fee, they have a liquor license. Most places that offer alcohol will charge you up to twenty dollars. If a restaurant offers liquor, beer, and wine, they don't have to let you bring in your own for free. Anyway, back to the food. I crave their sushi like no other. The Oedipus roll is to die for. Nigiri and sashimi come two per order. I've always found the service quite pleasant, and I've eaten there many many times. Maybe this place is love it or hate it. I'm definitely on the love side.
