Dear Xoco, Oh, how I wanted so much to love your food. Tragically I can't say I do. I even waited patiently for you and only to find that it was all in vain. Are my standard too high you ask? Did my taste buds have an off night you inquire? I wish you were right, but with the grease still sitting in my stomach you are sadly wrong. The Pepito was so saturated with grease that it had soaked right through the bread and left a puddle at the bottom of the parchment paper!!! The Choriqueso was just plain uninspiring. The most disappointing part was the Churros... I was so looking forward to redemption from you, but your failed miserable! Instead of a crisp and a soft, chewy center, I was left with a hard and old grease laden Churros. Was bacon inufsed Churros the style and flavor profile you were going for? If so, then I apologize. However, was it necessary to burn them to a crisp where it could cause a tooth chip? Xoco, where does our relationship go from here? Do we give it another shot or do we part our separate ways? Considering the reputation you've had, I will give you another chance. Perhaps a soup next time around and some of your famous hot chocolate? Sincerely, A truly disappointed fan
