I don't recommend this restaurant as a sit down place. I find the atmosphere loud and the service mediocre at best. 5 minutes to be greeted and once the food arrives, our waitress disappears.  Food quality, I would say average at best, but they do give you a lot for the buck. The burritos here are HUGE and not too bad. I recommend this place as a good take out option but not as a sit down one.
