Let's start with the most important thing: FREE valet parking!!! You don't get many things for free when you live downtown, especially parking, so when you do, it's a big deal. Greek Islands offers all the classic Greek dishes and then some. My girlfriends and I took quite some time to peruse the lengthy menu in order to decide what to order. For starters, I had the grilled octopus appetizer, which was good, and also had a taste of the roasted eggplant and egg lemon soup, both of which were fantastic. When you can't decide what to order, no matter what restaurant you may be in--if they offer it--I say go with the combination plate! And so I did. The roast leg of lamb was tender and tasty, the meatball was so-so, the dolmades were fabulous, but my favorite was the absolutely delicious mousaka. Trust me, I know my mousaka and that ranked right up there for me compared to other Greek restaurants. My friends had the shrimp Tourkolimano and the broiled salmon, both of which were good. I had a taste of each and really liked the salmon which was cooked and seasoned well. Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, but I'll definitely be coming back to sample some of the other items on the menu. Our server was wonderful. The atmosphere was warm, cozy, and friendly. This is a great place for a family dinner, a date, or dinner with a group of friends.
