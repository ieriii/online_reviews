My tiny food-concocted world has been officially shattered. I never thought the day would ever come that I'd say this, but the skirt steak (medium rare) rivals the bone-in filet at Joe's Stone Crab. The steak is simply mind blowing. Why? Well, put it this way, I usually hate steak (yes, HATE), and I was practically mauling for it on my fiance's plate. Moving on, the strawberry mojito was decent (not as good as Carnivale, but still good) and the Empanada Combination Plate was very good with the accompanying chimichurri sauce. The Patacon Pisao was the biggest disappointment. It was so bland that even drowning it in chimichurri sauce couldn't save it. We wished they filled our waters more, and that's our only complaint. The prices (especially for that quality of steak) are extremely reasonable. If you're a steak lover, this place is definately worth trying out!
