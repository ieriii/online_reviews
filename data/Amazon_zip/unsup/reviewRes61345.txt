Me and my friends we had our first experience in a Brazilian Steak House on Tuesday the 31st and this place was amazing. From the hostess to the server Quite possibly one of the best meals of my life. The environment is really amazingwe had our chance to order wines and go to the salad bar which is amazing. There are so many items available it's hard not to get full before the meat comes. Our waiter  name  Juri I believe did phenomenal job paring our meal with different wines ,recommendations of nice cocktails to start with love the watermelon martinis (by the way the best martini ever)had a nice bottle of Riesling  with our salad bar , and for our meats we had a nice cab from California The service was immaculate. The server or other employees were always there to assist and switch out plates.  When it came to the meat, I have never had anything more amazing in my life.  They offer excellent steaks, pork's, chicken, and sausage. Shrimp, pineapple. The house special is the best meat I have tasted in my life. It is totally worth paying $50 a plate to eat there. we ask our waiter for a taxi in the way out he escorted us to the door and get a taxi cab for us great service love to bring friends and familyI would recommend it "BRAZZAZ" one of the best steak houses in the city
