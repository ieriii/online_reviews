let me take a page from Lisa B's review and say, I too hate people. but, I don't hate all people, just Bongo Room people. Douche bag hipster clones with their slip-on Converse, JLo sunglasses (worn in-fucking-doors in the fucking shade), tight vintage-esque polo shirts, "Look at me, I just rolled out of bed" fauxhawk hair. You kids and your Justin Timberlake remixes. WHY THE FUCK AM I EATING BREAKFAST IN A CLUB?! If we're all drinking coffee, then turn down the fucking dance music. But, I digress. BR is overrun with these people. Pretentious assholes that actually think it's still okay to wear trucker hats. The food is unfucking real. The pear french toast was nothing to Yelp about. But the beef tenderloin eggs benedict was unreal. if you've got a high tolerance for chain wallets, then The Bongo Room is for you. I'll go back, but I'll have to be blind-folded.
