maybe i didn't scour reviews carefully enough, but i was startled and a lil disappointed to walk into this place for a solo lunch while on business in chicago, only to find that it was the spawn of the cheesecake factory. not that i hate the cheesecake factory or whatever, it's just not really my thing. i believe in smaller portions and fewer choices that are amazing instead of the galaxy of food options available there. i digress.  i sat at the bar. had some goat cheese salad starter that was good - the vinaigrette was overdone, but other than that it was pretty tasty. the warm bread was a nice touch, especially since i was ravenous. i had a chicken sandwich on some kind of flat bread that was also pretty good. nothing to write home about. it's nice to sit in there and overlook the humans milling about the magnificent mile. there's nothing to really love about this place, but nothing to despise, either. my server was great, though i could see where it would be hella obnoxious if they were busy or whatever.  all in all - probably wouldn't go back unless i was coerced by a larger group.
