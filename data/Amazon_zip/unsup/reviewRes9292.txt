Perfect for drinks and some appetizers. The tuna tartare is flavorful and I always like the shrimp on sugar-cane served with lettuce, noodles, cilantro, and delish peanut sauce for do-it-yourself shrimp rolls. Note: take the shrimp off the sugar cane before eating. I had the boulliobaisse(sp?) that had big chunks of lobster and fresh seafood in a coconut saffron broth. I'm not sure that I understand the saffron part, but cilantro and other fixings served on the side to customize. My husband had the steak and shrimp which he loved. And we finished off with the banana crisp with ice cream and everything was very flavorful and true to the Vietnamese theme. The space feels more French Colonial than Vietnamese, but big tropical plants help give it some SE Asian flair. While I am happy to come here for dinner, the upstairs is ideal for a small group if you want to grab drinks and food. Same great menu plus comprehensive bar, thoughtful wine list, an even fresh lime juice for cocktails. While there is a Le Colonial in San Francisco, it doesn't have the same charm as the one in Chicago, so if you're in SF for a trip, bypass Le Colonial and go to the Slanted Door instead. Trust me on this one.
