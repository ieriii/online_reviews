Okay, hands down: Violet Hour is one of the best lounges in the Windy City. First things first: you won't find a sign to this place. Let's just say that once you see a list of people lined up outside, braving the cold in Damen street, standing under a light next to a colorful mural, then you've found it - now you just have to wait. Now, the first caveat about this place is simple: you will wait in line for more than you expected it. Once they let you go inside, you'll have to wait again in a small room as soon as you step in. The second caveat is to not wear any frat-boy garb - this is a stylish and sophisticated lounge, not your average run-of-the-mill sports bar. Once you go in, you'll be swooned at the sight of seeing nothing but darkness. Everyone is sitting on tall, elegant chairs. Their faces are only recognizable by the dim light emanating from the candle in center table. I strongly recommend the Monkey's Heart brandy cocktail. It's one of the best drinks I've had in a while. My partner and I also tried the "Julia and Romeo" and "Poor Lizza" drinks. We were more satisfied. If you're looking for classiness in Chicago, don't hesitate. Put on your suit, your best watch, and go grab some drinks at the Violet Hour.
