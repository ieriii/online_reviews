I'm in love with Nuevo Leon. I'm silly, head-over-heels, helpless for this restaurant. I knew it was special on my first visit when we were given a big bowl of home-made chips and four--yes, four--different kinds of salsa, from the mild and bright red to the fiery green, and a bowl full of vegetables, a parade of food really. And what's this? A free appetizer--which I later discovered changes from day to day, yet is always delightful. I ordered the taco sabinas, which came to me in the form of three god-like soft-shelled tacos stuffed with skirt steak, beans and goat cheese. The restaurant owned me the moment I bit into one. I'm not even going to describe how it tasted. I still marvel that all that food only cost me $8. That was about a year ago. I eat there several times a week these days. Now, a few flaws. The service can be bad, particularly from one waitress who will not be named. It gets insanely busy during peak hours, like weekend and Friday nights. It's a cash-only place. Some times the green salsa is like a barely contained inferno, other times a pleasant bonfire--truly a mystery.
