I've been here a few times in the past month for both lunch and brunch and I'm a huge fan. It has a great location across from Millenium Park and their service is really on top of things. Mussels are some of the best mussels I've had. Really meaty and hearty curry sauce. Burgers are very solid. Duck Confit with Grits and Eggs - yes please. Ordered with a size of organic greens (I got watercress) with Duck and it was a great side Nice bar area for happy hour, too!
