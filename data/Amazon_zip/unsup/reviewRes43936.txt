3.5 stars for this one. I must not have the same taste buds as everyone else because I really wanted to be wowed after reading all the reviews. Ever since one of my co workers brought me some of homemade oatmeal with cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar I have been on a quest to find a place that makes oatmeal just like hers. At first glance the restaurant is really cute, you walk up to the counter and order then grab a seat. Serveral breakfast items to choose from in the glass case, scone, donuts, pound cakes etc all home made. Rotating specials written on the board behind the cashier. I ordered the oatmeal and cornmeal blueberry waffle. My sister had the scrambled egg panini with bacon. Oatmeal arrive with dried cherries on top, and a small pitcher or milk (very thoughtful) I personally like my oatmeal slow cooked so it thickens, M&HC oatmeal did not have the thick goey consistancy that I was searching for. Overall the taste was good esp with the dried cherries mixed in for sweetness. Cornmeal Blueberry waffle was made well (done on the outside and soft on the inside) but there was a large amount of compote in the center of the waffle covering the butter which completly melted the butter. Scrambled egg panini was nicely toasted on the outside and the eggs were very fluffy .  Will return for the bakery items and cup of tea but until then my quest for the best oatmeal continues.......
