Elegantly designed in a warm European style, this East Lakeview restaurant and bar is the real deal.  Great pub food, certainly too good to call pub food is served but by a friendly and effiecient and properly staffed team.  You will not be disappointed by Wilde, and in fact, you will likely be delighted.
