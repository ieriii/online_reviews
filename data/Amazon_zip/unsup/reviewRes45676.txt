Not only do I LOVE Oscar Wilde, but I seriously enjoy this place. I mean it isn't fine dining or anything, but it is definitely fun and their food is good for what it is. The sweet potato fries with goat cheese fondue are LEGIT, even if they need to serve more cheese. The wings were totally decent, and my friends really enjoyed the mac & cheese. Nothing is wrong with half-off wine night either. We have also been late and night and closed the place down and their drinks & their bar were really enjoyable. Super fun.
