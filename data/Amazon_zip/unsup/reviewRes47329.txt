I like this place...Burgers are better than another heavy metal burger joint you may have heard of, and witout the 2 hour wait on weekends...Beer runs from $2 PBR's to $8 fancy beers, so you can bring ANY of your beer guzzling friends, and they wont bitch about the selection..As long as you are prepared for extremely loud, 90's heavy metal, you'll have a good time. I'm going to go ahead and shell out 4 stars...this would be 5 stars if the service was quicker (like other yelpers, my food always takes at least 30 min here) but the good burgers and wide gammet of beer will keep me coming back...That other place on Belmont isnt even on my radar any more
