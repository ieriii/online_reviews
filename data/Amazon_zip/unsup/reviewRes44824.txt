On our first night in Chicago- we had to try Chicago's Deep Dish Pizza- Giordanos' was reccommended- The sauce and the crust were really good! The crust was crisp kind of like a biscuit- The cheese was a bit much and one slice was very filling! Trust the Yelpers that say a small is enough for two people! This was good enough that my daughter and I brought one home to our husbands.
