This is *the* place to go for deep dish Chicago pizza. Forget Uno (they're overpriced and overcrowded). Giordano's is where it's at. The sauce is fantastic, the crust is perfect and the fillings are generous. It tastes better fresh than cold leftovers in the fridge, but either way, it's still better than what we can get out here in California...
