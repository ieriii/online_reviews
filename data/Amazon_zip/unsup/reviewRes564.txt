We dined at Alinea back in August. I think it's nearly impossible for someone to love every single dish in a multi-course dinner.  Alinea is no exception, but I must say the overall dinning experience was phenomenal. Alinea really stood out with exceptional service, tremendous attention to details, great atmosphere, harmonious flavor and artistic presentation of each course.  Every foodie should visit Alinea at least once.
