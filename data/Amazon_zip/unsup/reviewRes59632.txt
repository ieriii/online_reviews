I can't believe people actually think this place is good. I've tried it twice as to give it the benefit of the doubt, but both times it has failed. The most recent time I ordred a veggie burrito & was served a steak burrito...no big deal - send it back for veggie, but was then eating it only to find meat in it still. When I asked to have the burrito removed from my bill I had 3 waitstaff at my table including the manager accusing me of changing my order & possibly putting meat in from my husband's burrito! They even asked me how allergic to meat I was & said it should be OK since I didn't actually eat any of the meat...hardly the point! I'm sure many of you have had great experiences, but I have not at all & wanted to pass it on.
