This is actually a 3 3/4 star rating. Greek Islands is a popular dining spot with many years of experience. I was with a large dinner party that wanted to eat here. For Greek cuisine I personally have other places that I would go to, however, the food was solid all the way around, just a tad bit under seasoned. Attentive and competent servers and bussers. Flawless execution of service on an ten top (actually eleven people). So if you're thinking about trying Greek Islands out, sure, why not.
