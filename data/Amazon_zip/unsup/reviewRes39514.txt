I went here around 10 p.m. on a Saturday night for a late dinner. We ordered the unmarinated Kalbi, kimchi stew and the seafood pancake. The food took a long time to get to our table. There were so many varieties of banchan, it took up half the table. Since we only got one order of grilled meat, they cooked it in the back, rather than letting us grill it ourselves. The Kalbi was most disappointing, since it seemed to lack a beefy flavor. It was chewier than I had expected, too. After all the hype over this place, I was really disappointed in the quality of the meat. The kimchi stew was similarly disappointing, tasting like kimchi boiled in broth. (I liked the kimchi soup in the H-Mart food court in Niles better.) However, the seafood pancake here was probably the best I have tried. It was thin, crispy, and full of calamari and green onions. The dipping sauce was way too salty, but it wasn't really necessary anyway. I loved the texture, which was a little chewy, with crispy edges, unlike at other places where it comes out soft or soggy. If you come here, you should definitely get the seafood pancake.
