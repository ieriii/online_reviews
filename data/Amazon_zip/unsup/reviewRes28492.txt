Great pizza! Been here twice. Had the thin crust the first time and the deep dish the second time. I was very happy both times! The restaurant is very narrow and there are not a ton of tables. Would not recommend this place for a romantic date but a great place to go for good pizza and a a couple of beers. The service was friendly and fast.
