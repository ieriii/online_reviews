The wait was absurd even to get takeout churros, and when I was standing around waiting for my order I was cursing Rick Bayless and drafting in my head the 1-star Yelp review I was going to write when I got back to my desk. Then my churros came, and they were RIDICULOUS. XOCO makes the best churros I've ever had, and honey, I've had a lot of churros. Here are the details for how things go down: -you cannot get takeout from 10:30 AM to 3 PM unless you're getting pastries and drinks -breakfast is served until 10:30 AM -from 10:30 AM -11 AM you can only get pastries and drinks -sandwiches are served after 11 AM -soups are served after 3 PM -churros are served all day
