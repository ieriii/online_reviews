Sunday at Sunda. I'd like to start my week off like this all the time if I could. Lounging in the chic restaurant digs without the crowds. Trying all the different teas on their tea bar. Dining on bao and brunch centered rice dishes. Inspired. Elegant. Surprisingly laid back. If you're not into crowds, or if you want to enjoy some creative Asian-inspired brunch fare head to Sunda. This Sunday if you can.
