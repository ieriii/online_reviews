I don't remember the food much... but I DO remember the waitress who was completely rude and lazy. All I remember was that she was blonde and not only forgot our drink orders, but also forgot the additional sausage we wanted on our pizza. When we told her about it, not only did she not apologize, she literally dug around in our pizza (not ONE slice, but TWO slices) to make sure we weren't lying. Are you kidding me? Comon now.... When she walked away, she STILL didn't apologize for her mistake. Giordano's, get yourself better waitresses so I can actually write a review about the quality of your food and not of the waitresses
