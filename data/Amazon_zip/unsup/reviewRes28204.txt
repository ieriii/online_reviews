Great, hip, fun Chicago restaurant. Stylist interior with good atmosphere. Food was well liked by almost the entire family. Only dish that seemed to disappoint everyone was the scallops, which didn't look good (I didn't try them). My bisque and chicken were excellent. Desserts were only OK all around. I would like to come back and try one of their tasting menus. They even offer a tasting of every dish on the menu. Seems like a good restaurant for a fun date, but their lack of consistency prevents a rating higher than 3 stars for now.
