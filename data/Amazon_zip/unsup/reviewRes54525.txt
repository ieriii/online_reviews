I am a confirmed carnivore, but i actually enjoy going to chicago diner. my friend is a healthy eater and at times she goes for periods where she cleanses her system of meat and dairy, so i go along just because we are hanging out. i usally find vegetarian food to be tasteless and uninteresting. but no so at chicago diner. Ilove the black bean burgers and sweet potato fries and will gladly go back to try other items. the servers are really helpful and attentive and i really like that they appease people like me with some real cheese, I got a delicious slice of monterrey jack on my burger.Even if you are not a vegetarian, you should try it. --miss positive energy
