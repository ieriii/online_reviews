It wasn't as great as everyone claims. I mean, it was good, but not as good as they charge you. My dish was not worth the $35 it cost me. I could have made this dish at home. I was not impressed.  The drink I ordered was tasty. The key lime pie was absolutely delicious...but we got that for free. Wow. My husband's meal was cooked to perfection but the portion size looked like tidbits, especially for $56 for one plate.  It was good but not great. Our bill came out to $132.00 plus a $32 tip for just the two of us. We tipped extra because our service was great and we enjoyed our host. Just be prepared to dish out for a good not great meal.
