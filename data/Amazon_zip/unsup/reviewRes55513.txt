Thank goodness for yelp! The hubby and I were looking for a bomb brunch spot in CHI and found it! Worth the hour wait! And while the outside could use a little more work (we walked right by it at first), the atmosphere inside is warm and the staff uuber friendly...We had the BLT Benedict, blueberry hotcakes and a BEC (bacon, egg, cheese) croissant...say what, say who now?! Lol...ALL AMAZING DISHES! If you want delicious pancakes that require no syrup, please go to Bongo...from red velvet, white chocolate-caramel-pretzel, and raspberry oreo flavors...these pancakes alone sells this place. Nice job Chicago!
