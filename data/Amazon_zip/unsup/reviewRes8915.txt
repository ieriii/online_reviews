Went to Spacca Napoli for the first time tonight. At the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the margherita pizza. It was good, but it tasted like something I could have gotten at Sbarro. We ordered a bottle of wine and before we were even finished with it, the manager was trying to make us leave because he needed our table for a party that was waiting. We paid for our meal and were just trying to finish what we purchased. ????? His rudeness will be the reason that I will not be returning.
