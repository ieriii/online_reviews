$40 of goods for $10, courtesy of Groupon - the deal was $20 but I had a referral bonus too. For the last week, I was able in indulge in some nice treats - most notably some pate and coppa. The real negative part of my experience was realizing after my 40 minute bus ride home that I had purchased something that was expired...by four months! Luckily, I had another reason to be in the downtown area soon after and was able to get a refund. Another somewhat negative thing - the waiting. You'll wait at the deli, you'll wait at the bakery, and if I had bought something at the meat or fish counter, I'm sure I would have waited there too. Just come expecting a very leisurely shopping experience. The market itself is like a scaled down version of Whole Foods. If you can shop at Whole Foods, you can shop here. In other words, I won't be coming back.
