Reading everyone else's review -- I have to agree, I love this place. I moved to chicago recently from the SF bay area, and being half vietnamese, I had to scour the city for my vietnamese fix. I have literally tried dozens of Vietnamese restaurants around and this is among the top. Their lunch special is amazingly good, and a ridiculously good value. For the cost of a hamburger meal, here you get a banh mi (vietnamese sandwich), salad, soup, and dessert. That's a 4 course meal, and tastes infinitely better. I have been to argyle and literally tried every restaurant there, gone to chinatown and tried everything there. This place is great. You won't be disappointed, and living downtown much closer than argyle. The sour shrimp soup is my favorite. Additionally, it's not pretentious, BYOB, the owner is there every day talking to you, making sure things are to your liking. If you want great food at great prices, with a homestyle feel to it where if you go more than once they will recognize you, come to this place. My search for a go-to vietnamese restaurant in my adopted home of chicago is over. Yum.
