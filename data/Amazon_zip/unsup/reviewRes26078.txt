So, I had to downgrade. After dining in, I gave this place 5 stars and a rave review. I loved it so much, I ordered delivery not even a week later. Big bummer. The fried rice, which I had already had and loved, just wasn't as good this time. And the two entrees I tried (pineapple calamari and catfish in a clay pot) weren't nearly as good as the shrimp one I had the first time. And, to top it off, delivery took forever! They quoted 45 minutes to an hour, and it was a little over an hour. If I were going off of just this experience, I'd rate it a 3. So I'll average them out for a 4. Dine in, folks!
