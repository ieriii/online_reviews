Brunch was delicious! My husband and I enjoyed our food (he had pork belly and rabbit hash, while I had pb&j french toast and fries with wasabi dipping sauce). The cocktails were good, the ambiance was nice, and the service was excellent. The restaurant caters to adults (no children), which is a nice change of pace.
