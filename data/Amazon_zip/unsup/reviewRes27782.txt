Take out only! Highly acclaimed by Rachel as the best Deep Dish Pizza in all of Chicago-land, I opted to grab some take out from Pequod's to sample their offerings. Extra-Large Deep Dish Pizza w/ Sausage & Onions... Perhaps the monstrosity of the Pizza is the first most notable feature of Pequod's offerings. At first glance, the size of the pizza resembled that of a car tire, rather than "Pizza". The weight alone is enough to scare away any willing participant.  Of course, sampling the offerings should be the most judged critique in the Pizza's execution. At first consumption, the gluttonous amount of ingredients used in the application is the most noteworthy attribute to Pequod's rendition of Deep Dish Pizza. The slightly burnt, crispy crust is the first detection during consumption; which acts as the foundation of the monstrosity. The mild detection of mozzarella cheese is the second of many flavors available. Although the slew of contrasting elements in both flavor and quantity is the emphasis of Pequod's creation, the taste is ultimately the binding principle. Patrons consuming this pizza will find that the gluttonous exertion of flavors produced from all elements ranging from the starchiness of the dough, the robust and tart nature of the tomato sauce, and meatiness / mild saltiness from the sausage work in stark contrast and conjunction to create a superb edible. The excessive amount of all the ingredients used works remarkable well in the creation of both a burdensome but welcoming edible. What Pequod's embodies with their rendition of a Chicago staple is a perfect example of the city's food offerings. It is through Pequod's embodiment of the mentality of Big Food / Big Flavor approach, that the foundation of their Pizza is created. With most food, large quantities do not equate to excessive flavors. Luckily, Pequod's manages to find a balance between both, while supplying an excessive amount of consumables within it's Deep Dish Pizza.
