I've been coming here off and on since it first opened several years ago. I really like some things about this place. The gumbo is the best I've ever had. When it first opened the restaurant brought delicious boiled peanuts to the table (like edamame but better). That didn't last long, alas.  I feel like the restaurant has steadily gotten more pretentious, offering worse service, and (most important) less tasty food. To give an example, a while ago they had a cassoulet (white bean casserole) special. The chef had a blog post about it, outlining the elaborate steps in the recipe, which used local duck and pig skin, house-made worschestire sauce, stock, etc. Seemed like it would be impressive, but what I ordered tasted incredibly bland and was so fatty that it was almost inedible. It was also very expensive. I had the same complaint about a prix-fixe meal, with pea shoot salad and fried chicken. Both dishes were almost flavorless. I didn't even think southern fried chicken *could* be bland! I love southern food. I don't care if it's fancied up or down-home, and I don't care if cooks experiment or "break the rules" of the cuisine. But it should taste good! And the gumbo is the only thing on the menu I've ordered that consistently does. I respect that the chef uses high-quality ingredients, and I still think this restaurant has potential. But the service and the often disappointing food just aren't worth the price.
