I really want to give this place five stars, but don't want to seem too eager. I have been twice in the past couple of weeks, and I really love the food here. The ceviche is the best I've had, and everything I've tasted here seems to have a bit of magic in it. The first time I was there, I had a pork and bacon special, it tasted like I had died and gone to heaven. The drinks are really good as well, tequila connoisseurs won't be disappointed with the menu. Negative points... it's not cheap. It's not the most expensive restaurant, either. The first time I was there, the service was really good, the second time our server was a bit off, there when we didn't want him to be, and not there when we did, but he was friendly. The people at the host station tend to be a bit snooty.
