Amazing food!!!!! Everything I have ever ordered from there was incredible.The service had been prompt and the employees are helpful, friendly and knowledgeable of the choices on the menu. I've never been steered wrong! The atmosphere is exciting and upbeat and the ambiance goes well with the cuisine. There is a fabulous sake list of which I would highly recommend the Dreamy Clouds! (sigh) :D The tuna melts in your mouth, the dragon roll is fantastic as well as the rainbow roll. We have mostly stayed with sushi with the orders but the other menu choices are definitely perfect. Like I said.... everything I have had there is scrumptious! I definitely recommend it and will be going back!
