Pros: - Great location in the center of Michigan Ave - Decent rates ($150-$200/night) - Friendly staff Best of all, they have this special 'sleep system' in your room where you are equipped with a sleep CD, eye mask, ear plugs, and lavander linen spray to ensure the best sleep possible! Cons: - No grandeous entrance into the hotel. Door is on Huron, not Mich Ave. - Crazy elevator system. You have to first go to the 3rd floor, which is the real entrance/lobby. Then you have to transfer to another elevator to get up to your room. - Restaurant Taps on Two is sub-par. Do not trust their "Express Lunch"! It takes at least an hour!
