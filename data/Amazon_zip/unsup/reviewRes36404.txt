I think I've been to every Asian restaurant in the city, and this is by far the best---the ambiance, the food, BYOB! Some of my favorite dishes---Bangkok Roll, best Crab Rangoon I've ever had, Tom Yom Soup, Smoked Chili Combo, Basil Chicken, Green Curry and Crispy Chili Heaven.  I think that was my last meal :)
