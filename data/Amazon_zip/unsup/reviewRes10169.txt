Super busy place - better have a reservation on the weekend. Nice setting - outdoor space looks killer. Excellent service. Food ranged from very good to excellent. Pizza was true to what you would find in Rome - it was just great. Pastas were delicious. We had the Osso Buco special - good but not great. Vast wine list with moderate markups. Great spot.
