I went here for my birthday dinner with my fiance. The atmosphere is very unique, there are little booths and tables in a candlelit room. The bar in a corner of the place has crackers and spreadable cheese which is really fun for before dinner! We printed off a coupon from online (just google it) for some extra savings. Everything was good, but it might have been too much food. We may just order the cheese and then the chocolate next time. A great unique and tasty time!
