Stayed here St. Patty's Day weekend so I will admit I was barely in the hotel, BUT great experience. 4 of my girlfriends got a double room, comfy beds, nice big bathrooms, so we could all get ready without getting in anyone's way. My only complaint is next time I'll try and enjoy the hotel more during my stay.
