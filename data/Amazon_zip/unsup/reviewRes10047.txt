Love this place! Originally recommended to me by my 100% Italian friend, so I knew I was in for a treat. I've been back several times since, most recently last night, and the food has always been top notch. We arrived around 6 during Restaurant Week without a reservation. They were accommodating and sat us at the tables near the host stand. Not my ideal choice, but we didn't have a reservation and they could have turned us away.  I started with the ribollita, which I was expecting to be a soup, as that's how I've always had it before. Piccolo Sogno's take is a little different but, man, it was awesome! Ribollita literally means "reboiled" (thank you wikipedia) and other iterations are more of an Italian bread soup with beans and veggies. Here, all the components were there, except it wasn't in a soup. The bread was soaked in broth, then combined with the beans and veggies and pan fried until it was lightly crispy on the outside. So good. For my entree, I had the potato/fennel tortelli with their housemade bolognese. Slightly heavy after the ribollita, but this was another outstanding dish. I don't care much for cheesy filled pastas, so it's rare that I actually have an opportunity to order one, so when I saw the tortelli were filled with potato - I jumped on this one. The bolognese tastes just like what my grandmother used to make - or more accurately, what my grandmother would have made if she were an Italian housewife (it is one of my life's greatest disappointments that I have zero Italian blood. Thank goodness I married into an Italian family so I can pretend). You could put this bolognese on shoe leather and it would taste delicious. I had to roll myself out of there after so many carbs but it was totally worth it. I tasted my mother in law's gnocchi too and they were outstanding. I live so close to this place, yet I never come here as often as I would like. But each time I go, I remember why I like it so much.
