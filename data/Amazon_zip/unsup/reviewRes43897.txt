definitely good...possibly worth the wait on the weekend... i won't lie, i don't dig the wait in line thing...just take my name down so i can go do something else for a while instead of standing in line and losing my mind watching over people eat delicious food on a beautiful patio while i'm hungry as shit... sammies are actually better than the almighty brunch in my opinion...each one i've had has been fresh, delicious, and the perfect size... the big draw is the brunch...the orange french toast is amazing if you like fruity french toast, i don't really...the huevos rancheros in the earthware bowl is excellent, definitely the brunch highlight since everyone around me always seems to have it...
