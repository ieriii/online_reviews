although you have to wait outside, it shows that the food must be good and boy was it worth waiting for, I went with a friend who lives in Chicago and another friends kids who we had taken out for the day. one had a child's meal the other joined us in having possibly the best pizza I've had. Lots of meat sausage cheese and that base is the best, the atmosphere in this place was also great with lots of graffiti on the walls they even gave us a pen so we could add ours. cant wait till i visit Chicago again next year
