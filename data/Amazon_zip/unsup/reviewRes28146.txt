We recently enjoyed the tasting menu at Graham Elliot and I couldn't have been happier with the entire experience. The food was perfectly prepared for every course. We had a beautiful tuna sashimi that had the most excellent flavor. The sweet corn bisque was silky and delicious. We had a sauteed whitefish that had the most delicate crust. I was wary of the lobster corn dog - but it was fabulous! Each course was better than the next and the wine/beer pairings were expertly chosen. Even the popcorn appetizer was tasty, and we certainly got our fill of it! Service was great - our waiter had an excellent personality and was happy to go along with our bad jokes. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very chic, yet cozy. Moody, but not too stuffy. On a weeknight, the place was pleasantly packed. Lively, not loud. Overall, I left feeling satisfied, delighted, and without complaint. The food is truly excellent and I look forward to returning.
