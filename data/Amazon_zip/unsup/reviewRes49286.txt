I love Bin 36. It is a great place to try some new wines. Their wine menu is huge. The food is very good, and the portions are so much more reasonable than the huge touristy chain restaurants.  I had the crab cakes and they were delicious. The atmosphere is posh without being stuffy and the wait staff was very helpful with wine selection. This would be a very nice restaurant for a date in my humble opinion. Classy enough to impress, quiet enough for conversation, and a great location to boot.
