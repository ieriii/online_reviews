Really great gourmet grocer. Open till late but apparently the employees all fell asleep because no one was able to help us at any of the counters. What's the point of staying open late if your customers can't shop the entire store? But other than that great selection of gourmet candies, chocolates, and juices from around the world. I like a specific French brand of lemonade that they have and a specific brand of Banana juice that they have (was super ecstatic, as I could only find this juice in the French Polynesia). Definitely come here if you love gourmet finds!
