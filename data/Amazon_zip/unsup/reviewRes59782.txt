Every time I come back to Chicago I have to eat here at least once. This place is better than Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, or Uno's! Art of Pizza wins hands down in both the pan pizza and deep dish pizza categories. The crust is buttery and crispy and the sauce has a slight sweetness. Plus I like the complete informal/casual atmosphere: Pick up your pizza at the counter and then sit down wherever you want. The guys behind the counter are friendly and easy-going.
