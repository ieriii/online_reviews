Pequod's was my first Chicago deep dish pizza experience and it was awesome! After waiting for the 40-minute cooking time, our pie finally arrived and not a moment too soon because I was starving after a long day of sight-seeing. Our pizza came loaded with big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, and copious amounts of stringy, molten mozzarella. The thick crust had a beautifully caramelized, chewy ring of cheese surrounding the edge. It was hands down the tastiest-looking pizza I have ever laid my eyes on.  With a whirl of knife and fork, I inhaled two delicious slices before hitting the food wall. Deep dish pizza is deceivingly filling so if it's your first time having it, don't be surprised if you are full after two pieces.    I've since tried Jordano's deep dish and while very very good, I'd still say Pequod's is number one for me. Lou M's is next on my list to try!
