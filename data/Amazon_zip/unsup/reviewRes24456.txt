This place is amazing. Strolled in on Friday night around 720 with my cousin in from out of town and this place was hoppin! We ended up snagging the only spots left at the bar downstairs but before our first delicious bites arrived, we had managed to grab a table that had been recently vacated. The food...incredible. We started with the chef choice cheese sampler which comes with 3 cheeses-each with an amazing sauce...I could have eaten just that all night. But no! Next were the bacon wrapped dates, which were also amazing-and I don't even like dates...guess I do now! Third was the paprika potatoes which simply stole the show. Finally the glazed pork belly. Words cannot describe. For dessert-the pear hibiscus pound cake and the chocolate marshmallow bites of heaven! Neither of us drank but the sangria looked amazing-next time for sure! I'm not a super huge south-loop fan but I might have just turned a pivotal corner...I'll certainly be back to this place-next time though, I'll make reservations for the full experience upstairs in the dinning room.
