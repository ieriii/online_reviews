I'm a huge beer aficionado, and the Hopleaf is my favorite bar in Chicago. Many other bars serving Belgian beers on tap often don't have enough throughput to keep the beer fresh. There's nothing worse than paying big $ for Belgian beer only to find that the flavor is muted and stale. Bartenders never believe me on this, either, since I'm not the stereotypical beer-drinker (read: bearded, burly dude). Hopleaf's taps are *always* fresh. The combination of consistent quality plus a very interesting, ever-changing beer list makes for unrivaled educational boozing. The food is fabulous, too. Prices are a little steep in the absolute sense, but you get a really amazing meal for what you pay. Their menu has elements of Belgian, French and New American cuisine. It's interesting yet simple, wholesome, and tasty. That said, you have to be strategic when coming here due to the crowds. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, show up on the early side even if you're just drinking (6-7). You may still need ninja-esque skills to grab a table, even this early, but it's likely you'll grab one before too long. They'll serve food to the bar area, but if you want to eat in the restaurant (it's nicer) on a Thurs.-Saturday, put your name down by 6:00 or you could easily be waiting until 10:00. The Map Room is the only place that rivals Hopleaf in terms of beer selection and tap beer quality, and it's plagued by the same crazy crowds. The Map Room is a little cheaper, but it's smaller (even harder to get a seat) and they don't serve food.
