Yum. I guess that is a good start for any restaurant review. There are really four food items here: Salad bar, meat!, side dishes, and dessert. I didn't make it to dessert. Salad bar: Very large, very diverse (lettuce to smoked salmon etc etc) was fun to pick over while knowing full well I needed to save room for the steak. Meat!: Oh man, green means go, red means stop for just a sec, I'll make more room somehow. They are kind enough to only serve you small portions of the meat as it passes by, but a person can only hold so much. Best lamb I've ever had (some sort of lime-something flavoring), excellent sausage, and or course varied and interested beef options. Side dishes: This was almost cruel. Things like polenta and fried bananas were delicious, but how to balance nibbling those vs. meat? Also very tasty, which was the problem! The place was packed, reservations seemed a good idea for dinner. The staff, especially the gentleman with the skewers of meat, where very nice and happy to answer questions. The lunch price for the same meal is significantly cheaper, so I will probably go that route next time, but even if it was a bit steep, I enjoyed the evening.
