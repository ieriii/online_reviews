I read all the good reviews on yelp and my co worker also told me how amazing this place was. So I decided to give it a try. A HUGE disappointment!!!! The front of the menu reads "Hong Kong Style" Chinese food, but there's nothing Hong Kong about the style. The food was horrible!!! We ordered a barbecue pork dish, the skin of the pork was so hard!! It was so difficult to eat. And then we ordered a vegetable dish, the vegetable was supposed to be stir fried with garlic and salt, if it's HK style, the dish would come out crisp with not too much sauce at the bottom of the plate. But the dish came out with lots of gravy like sauce, so the vegetable was soaked in the sauce which made it so soft and affected the texture of the vegetable. We also ordered the peking duck due to numerous good reviews I read here, I'm sorry to say but the Phoenix restaurant in Chinatown makes this dish 10 times better than Sun Wah. If you haven't tried Phoenix in Chinatown, please try and compare. They took the duck meat from the peking duck and made two more dishes - a soup and fried rice. The soup was bland and tasted like salty water and the fried rice was cooked with too much moist. Basically, all the dishes I tried there were bad and NOT authentic HK style at all!!! I don't think I'll go back.
