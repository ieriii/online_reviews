fast and friendly service.  ordered the lamb shawerma.  enjoyably messy and cheap goodness was in my hands in .47 seconds. the pieces of lamb were a little tough, but was generally tasty. my hungry friends (who have bottomless stomachs) actually had trouble finishing their food! i'll definitely return for the generous portions and low prices.
