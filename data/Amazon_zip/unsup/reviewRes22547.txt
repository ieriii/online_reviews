I started eating here about 15 years ago and over the years it has only gone from greatest to greatest-er. The people are super nice, the food is awesome, and the price is low. I just love stopping here when I'm in town. The oatmeal shakes and the guanabana shakes are awesome. Traveler's tip: if you're taking the el to O'Hare for your flight home, leave an hour to get off at the Western stop on the Blue Line and walk south on Milwakuee a couple blocks to pick up a shake and a couple of sandwiches for the road. It is such a great capstone to a Chicago trip that I now try to book flights that will allow me to do this (if you have time, eat in the restaurant AND take sandwiches to go).
