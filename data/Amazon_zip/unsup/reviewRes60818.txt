I went here on a Saturday night with 5 other friends and we had a really great time. The food and service were excellent, although I personally did not enjoy the swordfish. My favorite was actually the duck breast. The ambiance was also really nice and although we did not get to stay long, the rooftop lounge was a nice touch. The most impressive part for me was the fact that they provided a shuttle to and from our hotel, which saved us a ton on cab fare. Now I'm on a mission to find a place like this in Houston.
