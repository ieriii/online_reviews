ORDER THE PANCAKES!!! All of the food at Bongo Room is good, but the pancakes are phenomenal- not like anything you'd find anywhere else. I suggest going on a weekday, if possible, to avoid the hour-long wait to be seated, but if you choose to go on a weekend (and you stand in line forever and a day) the pancakes can not be missed; they are indulgent. Tip: if you have your heart set on a savory dish you can order a side of a pancake/flapjack or french toast. You get one pancake at a fraction of the cost.
