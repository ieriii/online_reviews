I took 3 out of town guests here for a Sunday night dinner. No reservations -- no problem. We arrived 30 minutes before closing -- also no problem. No one pressured us to hurry up, which is a good thing, because we ordered a lot, and would have stayed for more had our bellies been able to accommodate it. One of my guests said it was the best meal of her life. That's a strong statement, but I would say it was one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. The four of us had separate plates, and each plate provided a different taste experience, which is nice; so many restaurants "recycle" their sauces so that they can have a huge menu, but just a few stock ingredients in the kitchen. Not so here. Each plate was different from the next. Desserts were absolutely top-notch as well. Part of the reason my experience was so good was the atmosphere of the place. I loved that certain customers would come in and be whisked to special tables in darkened corners. It felt very mafia, only in a safe way.
