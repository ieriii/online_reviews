My husband and I had tried to go here when we lived closer to the neighborhood without realizing you'd need a reservation. Well, I should say, HE didn't realize we'd need a reservation. At a "happening" sushi spot in Bucktown. At eight o'clock on a Saturday night. Nice try. But we tried it again on a night when we were meeting people down the street at Lemmings, so I had made early reservations (it was his birthday) for like 6:30. It wasn't too busy when we got there, but oh my god was it packed by the time we left at 8pm. I was so glad to have gotten there early, because it was before our server was caught in the weeds (she was so nice and sweet, but toward the tail end of our meal, she was getting a little frazzled because it got really busy). I think it was Girlz Night Out, too, because by 3/4 thru our meal our table was surrounded by tables of girls who sounded like they hadn't seen each other in sooooo long, Like, OH MY GOD! But I digress. The food was some of the best sushi I've had in a while. (We went to Kaze the following week, so Coast was one-upped in seven days, but that's another review!) They were offering some special appetizers that evening: The crab cake things were tasty but I thought a little dinky. But they had a hamachi sashimi app that was incredible!! Five pieces, and they were drizzled in a subtle garlic sauce and served with sliced jalapeno and cilantro. So good. And the nigiri pieces were super fresh and tasty. Like buttah. The spicy creamy crunchy tuna roll was definitely worth another visit, but I think I'll make sure to head in earlier in the evening than later.
