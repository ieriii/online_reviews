One of my favorite places in Chicago. Good food, great service. It can prove difficult to get a reservation the weekends and it'd be nice if they had a bar so you could have a few drinks while you wait for your table.  As for appetizers, the tuna tartare and pan seared scallops are amazing. Most of the rolls are delicious, but I don't recommend the spider roll here.
