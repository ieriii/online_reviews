I live right down the street from this restaurant and am so happy to have such a great find in the neighborhood! I have now been to Chicago Q twice, and both experiences were fantastic. Not only was the food great, but the atmosphere was comfortable and the service was unbelievable. One server in particular, Alfredo, made our experience absolutely wonderful - I cannot say enough about him. I will definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.
