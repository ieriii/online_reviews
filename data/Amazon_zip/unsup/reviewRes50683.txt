Recently went to Big Jones for Sunday brunch (Aug 14). We sat and ordered our entrees, then ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes appetizer. The app was dropped off at the table. On it were 3 ramekins of sauce and....TWO slices of fried green tomatoes. TWO SLICES, for which we charged $10.00. AT BRUNCH!! What a ripoff!!! If you go to Joe's near michigan avenue, you receive ~10 slices, and are only charged $7.95. We were served our entrees after finishing the app in about 20 seconds. While the main plates were good, something was missing. My partner commented a little later, "It's like I didn't eat anything". Yeah, the missing something was SPICE, of any kind. Seriously, if this restaurant takes its culinary cues from the South and, even New Orleans, why didn't the food taste like it? I emailed the restaurant with my complaint, but they never responded. And, it's not like I want something in return, especially since I will NEVER waste my money by going there again.
