Went for lunch on a beautiful, sunny Friday afternoon.10 minute wait for a table for 2 on the patio.Shared the appetizer sampler (for 2) and the carne asada a la oaxaquena, and a round of drinks (including a margarita that made short work of knocking me on my ass) and got out for around $60. Frontera feels like an affordable luxury, something I like to see in restaurant. Why make great food if no one can afford it? Might not go back because it was kind of just something to say we did, but it was great!
