I've heard about Yolk several times, and finally decided to get in line and try it. Yolk certainly does not live up to its hype. You'll wait in line at Yolk for 20-50 minutes before being seated, unless you go on a weekday, and even then, it's crowded. Nearly all of Yolk's customers are tourists staying at nearby hotels, so there are lots of big groups and families. The decor is completely forgettable, and the noise is deafening. I didn't find the waitstaff particularly friendly or helpful. If anything, our waitress seemed to have more important things to do than refill our water glasses or ask if we needed anything. Sure, Yolk has an expansive menu with plenty of interesting sounding options, but the food itself is what you would find at Denny's under another name. Perhaps I'm too harsh - my companion said it was "decent." And yes, the portions are huge - probably too big in all honesty. Either way, it is not the best brunch you'll ever have. I'd suggest Bongo Room or Elate over Yolk any day.
