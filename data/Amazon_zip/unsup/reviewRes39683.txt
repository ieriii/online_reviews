I'm not an expert on korean food, but I've always liked the trip to San Soo Gab San. I often host guests and I once took a Korean and Taiwanese traveler here in a nice-sized group and got one of their group, sit on the floor tables -- definitely the way to go. My korean visitor was so happy with the place, he immediately took over the ordering and we almost had more bottles of alcohol on the table than bowls (which for this place is a miracle). Somewhere later in the meal, another Korean guest in the restaurant asked him how he came to the best Korean restaurant in the city without knowing the city.  Now, I don't mean to boast, and like I said, I can't truly judge the authenticity myself, but I've always had a great time here. 24 hours as well -- can't beat it.
