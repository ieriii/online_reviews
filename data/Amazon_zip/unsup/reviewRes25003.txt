The booths are backed by shelves of wine bottles and highly uncomfortable, and the place sounds and smells of sizzling hot oil, so I would hardly call it the most romantic restaurant in Chicago...just a decent one-time experience. They also keep it really cold inside...which makes sense later when you have to cook your food in a vat of hot oil in front of you...but I was freezing at first. Not romantic. I suppose the most romantic aspect of it all was the interactive dining. Having to cook our own food kept us pretty busy throughout the meal, and we found it to be a rather fun experience. The meals come with eight dipping sauces, and it was a good time mixing and matching and figuring out what tasted best with what. I suppose I might recommend it to those with poorer social skills (and deep wallets) who need a place to take a date. The food by itself, however, only tasted okay. It's just stuff cooked in oil - LOTS of oil. For the cheese fondue, I found the bread a bit stale, and some of the fruit in a questionable state. For well over $50 per person (excluding wine)...this shouldn't really happen.
