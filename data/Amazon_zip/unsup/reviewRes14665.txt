Riddle me this: If the food you get at Sabatino's was served in a plain dining room or even your own home, would you like it? The answer is maybe, but unquestionably* not nearly as much as you would eating at Sabatino's. What you get here is the "old school" shtick, which at least feels genuine as I believe it mostly is. This place is a snapshot in time -- a scene from Goodfellas could've been shot here. We went with our three kids last night and it was fun place for that purpose - they could be loud (as if we have a choice), we could all plow our way through countless appetizers, side dishes, and mains, and walk away pretty happy. Will I go back anytime soon? Absolutely not. My wife makes a better red sauce from scratch for a small fraction of the price. We can also boil pasta pretty well. I can also make thousand island dressing out of ketchup, mayo, and some relish. We're moved past paying a premium for either "shtick" or massive quantities of food you end up taking home but never eat because reheated it tastes like crap. So...enjoy...seriously, it's a fun place, check it out. But it'll likely be a one-time thing.
