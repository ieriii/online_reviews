Another place that doesn't need any further description. Just know that this place gets extremely busy (as in line out the door busy), it's open only from 10:30 am to 4:00 pm, duck fat fries are Friday and Saturday only, and that they have a crazy selection of sausages/dogs. If you're a first timer, I suggest checking out their website to see the different type of dogs they have. My only suggestion is that you try one of their specialty dogs. It's worth it. Hell, get two dogs while you are at it. Oh and the duck fat fries are money, but it's even better with cheese. If you love hot dogs or are a foodie, then this is a must. Others might be put off by the wait and hype for "just" a hot dog. Oh and how many places still have the owner working the front? Doug is one classy, cool dude.
