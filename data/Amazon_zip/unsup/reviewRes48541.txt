I don't know if I'm just a pork hater or what, but our table of four all disliked the food at this place. The beer and ambiance was killer but could barely get some of that food down. I usually have no problem eating diverse choice in food, but I had real trouble with the food here. We even used Yelp to decide on what to order. Service was great. Maybe go for a beer and try yourself.
