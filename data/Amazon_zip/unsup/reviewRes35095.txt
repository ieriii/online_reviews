Probably the best freaking oyster I have had, as well as the best sushi at a non sushi restaurant. It was so good, I got a 54 year old guy who never had sushi in his life, blue collar as all hell, try sushi and he loved it. Tuna and Avocado, simple roll. I brought clients in here, and sweet talked my way to a table in the main dining area after being told the wait was over an hour, we waited about 30 mins, 15 of which we were waiting for the lunchroom style area. Brought 2 clients here from Philly and they loved it. Filet: Delish, and perfectly cooked. Crab legs: Huge and amazing, the y Philly guys loved em, ate 4 lbs total. (oof) Sushi: Devine, as good or better than any fancy sushi restaurant. Oysters: Fresh and succulent. Got em raw, which i rarely do. Drinks: Tennesee Sunshine, hyaayyaay!
