I've eaten here a few times, and certainly prefer it when it's less busy and more attention is afforded by the staff. My favorite dish was the cappellacci di zucca (squash-filled pasta in a sage and brown butter sauce), and the lasagna was also excellent. Portions are huge -- you likely won't need (or should share) appetizers. Most recently, I tried the cappellacci all'aragosta (lobster-filled pasta), but was less impressed -- I was expecting large chunks of tender, fresh tasting lobster, but was met with a densely packed tiny pieces of overwhelmingly fishy-tasting lobster, slightly overtaken by lemon. I will certainly be back, but will skip the lobster pasta, which wasn't for me.
