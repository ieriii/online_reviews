I'm a big fan of unique brunch spots in Chicago and Yolk is no exception! The cute name and decor really draw you in, so now it's all about the food and it was time to see if they lived up to it's name, and they did! Like typical breakfast spots, Yolk offers the typical pancakes, waffles and omlettes. But what they do offer are a few unique twists on your classic favorites. I ordered the banana nut French toast and it was quite tasty and satisfying for brunch! It tasted just like friend banana bread and who can resist banana bread?! While there is nothing very unique that's sets apart Yolk from the dozens of other brunch places in the city, the food is good, service is great and you won't be waiting in line for hours! Parking isn't too hard to find either. We were able to find parking only a mere block away and didn't have to park in a garage! Recommended!
