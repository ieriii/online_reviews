Another hit for the Supper Club Monday crew. Since I can't think of that many synonyms for "amazing" I'll just tell you about what I can remember... - Pitcher of Java Juice or Lava Juice... watermelon and lime slushie that we mixed with tequila... delicious and refreshing. - Casado and Tico platter... both looked like shit tons of good food. Get it with spicy gallo pinto (black beans with white rice and spices and jalapenos). - Veggie Burrito with plantain... as good as what everyone else says. i might skip the plantain, t'was literally a huge plantain running down the middle of the burrito. Made for easy cooling bites after bites of jalapeno, otherwise slightly overwhelming but still tasty. - Spinach and Cheese Empanada... it is crispy. It's kind of like a rangoon... small pocket with delicious filling and large flat non-filling edge to grasp and then dip in pico. I don't know why everyone be hatin'... Delicious. - Oatmeal shake with milk... yes please. Like an oatmeal cookie in shake form. Sit outside when it's nice out and enjoy the fun servers, ours were super.
