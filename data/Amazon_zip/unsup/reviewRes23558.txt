Let's start with the service - The server had a very interesting attitude and approach. The manner in which he spoke to us was as if he was another patron who just happened to love the place. Not in that fake salesman-like way but in the genuine way that makes you forget for a moment that he is your server, not your fellow diner. And his service level was certainly acceptable. There wasn't entirely much for him to do as we were not refilling drinks or needing extra items but the minimal work required was completed as it should be. As for the rest of the staff, I certainly have no complaints. In fact, it was obvious that everyone got along well and actually enjoyed working there. When I originally walked in, I was carrying a present for my friend. The host and one of the servers quickly joked "Awee, for me?" which was cute and fun and overall made me feel like a regular. The food was pretty good. This was my first Costa Rican experience and I'd say that I will be trying more in the future. I ordered the Casado. Upon the suggestion from the server, I upgraded my rice to the Costa Rican rice and I'm glad I did. It was very tasty and probably my favorite part of the dish. I must admit, however, that I had a few too many chips before my meal and found it hard to eat much of my entree. The chicken was very moist. My only complaint was that the seasoning wasn't consistent and some parts of the chicken had significantly less flavor. Our appetizer was the Chifrijo.... it was delicious and hard to stop eating. The venue itself is a bit of a dive... but in that "good" dive way. It added to the character of the place.
