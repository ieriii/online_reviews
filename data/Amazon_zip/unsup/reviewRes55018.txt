To preface this, it probably it not really 1 star. If I knew nothing about the place, I'd give it 2 or 3. Seeing how it has a Michelin star and everyone raves about it, this was one of the most disappointing experiences in my dining history. We caught it on a Tuesday relatively late, so there was no wait, which is nice. The wine list is less than stellar -- the place focuses on beers and bourbons, which should have been a red flag for us to begin with. We had tough time choosing what to order: everything seemed covered in butter, sugar and cream. I'm not some celery-obsessed crazy person, but I don't want my dinner to be 3,000 calories either... We had 2 appetisers and 2 entrees. They weren't bad, but they were not great either. Simply average.The place had no privacy. I was literally bumping elbows with a girl at a table next to us the whole time. We were in the back room, and a couple other parties arrived half-way through our meal. Sweatpants and baseball hats sideways kind of crowd. As they settled in, the noise level became pretty much unbearable. I wanted to try dessert, but figured out we'll just cut our loses and call it a night. If this is your neighborhood hang-out, that's great, by all means go there and pig out. However, it's certainly not worth the drive to get there from the center of the city.
