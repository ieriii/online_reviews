New York has terrible Mexican food. Singapore has worse Mexican food than NYC. But Chicago, that is a city that does it right. There are only a few things that I was really, really craving when I lived abroad and good Mexican food was one of them. For me, Nuevo Leon is the gold standard of Mexican food. Although they'll give you a heart attack, the Nacho Dias are amazing. For breakfast, I like the machacado. I also like the taco and burritos, so much food that it's tough to finish. And then the bill comes...and it's like $11 for 7 people. It doesn't seem right but you pay your cash at the counter, dancing on clouds on the way out because not only did you get a good deal but your belly is full of a ton of sour cream and all of those BYOB beers that you brought with you.
