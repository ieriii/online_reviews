Gilt Bar, you rock. Brought my out of town friend here for dinner last night. I didn't stray too far from what I ordered last time I was here, why mess with perfection? We started with the sweet balsamic on toast and moved onto the apple and fennel salad. The toast was perfect, loved the sweetness from the balsamic mixed with oil and garlic. Salad was refreshing- apples and fennel worked well together. We both went with the salmon entree per our servers recommendation. Again, delish. They sear it so there is a bit of a salty crust on the salmon that works perfectly. Ordered a side of the kennelbec fries with a garlic aioli dipping sauce. Yum. My friend has a more sophisticated palate than I do and she loved everything as well! Our server, John, was fantastic. Great personality and was able to give great recommendations with the food and drinks. Definitely one of my favorite spots to dine in the city!
