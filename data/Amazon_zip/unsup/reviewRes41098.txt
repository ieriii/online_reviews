I would like to note that the one star is solely based on the fact that they are diligent in noting guests' allergies and preparing every course accordingly. I have several food allergies, so eating out is not always an easy venture. Bonsoiree deleted my reservation twice, and when I called the week of my trip to verify, they had again said that I wasn't on the books, but they could "squeeze" me in. I had read the great reviews and was excited to treat my younger sister to her first fine restaurant. When we arrived, we weren't spoken to by the staff. They gave us water and no menu or drink options. As food started arriving from the kitchen, I realized that the menu was chef-inspired and gladly enjoyed the food in front of me. When I asked cost, they acted insulted, and didn't respond immediately. After our third course, I checked their website via my smartphone and was shocked to see that the nightly menu was $85 per person. When I told the waiter that no one had explained the menu or price to me, and that we couldn't afford a $200 dinner, he again acted insulted and said that he would "ask the chef" if it were okay to stop our meal at the third course. After some back and forth arguing, they agreed to charge for a four-course meal and let me leave. As we signed the receipt, and left feeling embarassed, the staff collectively stared at us without any motion of apology or thanks. Even though I has looked up the reviews of the restaurant, and had called three times prior to our visit, I was not informed that we would be served an $85 meal without being asked, and would be then insulted and made to feel stupid. I rarely research a place's menu prior to visiting, but instead prefer to ask the staff what is popular or their personal favorite menu items. This restaurant is not attempting to gain new clients, but to rip off those who walk in uninformed.
