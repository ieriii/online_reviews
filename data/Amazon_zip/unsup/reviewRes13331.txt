It's Tuesday!!! That means that its all-you-can-eat-crab-legs night at Glenns! Guess who has reseverations? Thats right, this gal.  Jealous much?! If not, you should be.  My bros go a lot, and are pretty much obsessed with this place, this will be my third time but if it is anywhere near as amazing as the last 2 times I ate here then I am one lucky broad. Absolutely Incredible. Do not eat the whole day if you plan on really taking full advantage of Tuesdays at Glenn's Diner.  If you go any other day during the week make sure you get there relatively early because sometimes they run out of the best stuff early on. It is really so good if you love seafood and dont live near a sea. Thanks Brothers for the intro to Glenn's
