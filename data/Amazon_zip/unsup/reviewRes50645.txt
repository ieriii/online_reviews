I've only been here for brunch and although I have pretty low standards when it comes to breakfast food (I love golden nugget, for example), I think this is one of the best places in the city. The wait is long on Sundays, but what awesome brunch place isn't packed on Sundays?! Get their fruit bread. I don't know what they put in that stuff but it's like crack. I would eat a whole loaf. I have to ask them if they would sell it by the loaf next time I go because I could easily live on that stuff. Crunchy french toast, omlettes, you really can't go wrong here. Oh, and Thai Iced Coffee. Good wake-up treat after a long night out!
