Just tried out Meli Cafe today for the first time, and I'm happy to report that it's very good! I arrived with a friend at 12:30 and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated - I don't get upset when I have long waits, but I was pleased that this one is short. What was not so cool is that there's not a lot of room to wait in, so we had to stand outside. Thank goodness it wasn't that cold today!  Speaking of not a lot of room, it's true of this restaurant more generally. I've been in some restaurants that didn't have enough space (hello Lula Cafe!), but this one was definitely one of the worst. I could barely walk to my table without hitting people seated at other tables, especially all bundled up in a big winter coat with a backpack on my back. We were also able to listen to the entire conversation of the people next to us, which was something I didn't enjoy very much. But the food is great! I ordered the Meli Chicken sandwich, and oh my is it delicious! The sauce on the chicken is just perfect, and the wheat bread they serve the sandwich on is tasty, too. They served my coke in a fancy little glass bottle, which I found charming. The only part of my meal that wasn't as good as it could have been was the fries. They were okay, but a little bland. I'd probably get a different side in the future. Overall, I'd definitely head back for the food even though the place is tiny and it seems like there's always a wait.
