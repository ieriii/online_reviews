Maybe I've come to be spoiled in my 28 years and some change of living, but the craft cocktails here do not amaze. In fact, at the price point they are offered at, they disappoint. The service I received was fairly absent and it took down the mood of a fun night out with my sis. The interior is beautiful and the barseating was nice. I like that their stools are so oversized, made this big girls behind feel average sized. Hushed discussions over candle light would've been perfect for a date night, but not necessarily the appropriate space for cutting up. All in all, I probably won't make a point of coming here again when in town.
