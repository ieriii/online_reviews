A trip to Italy!! Hands down one of the best places in Chi town to savor thin crust pizza. Now, that its getting warmer don't go here without a reservation. I can definitely imagine swarming crowds once the outdoor patio is open. We got the antipasti burrata and its the most deliciously salty stretchy mozzarella I've tasted in a long time stuffed with delicate and melts-in-your-mouth mascarpone. I was already in heaven and my expectations for the pizza had sky-rocketed. We got the margherita pizza, the Buffalina and Bianco Nero. I loved the perfectly seasoned soft and yummy crust. The Fior di latte and Buffala mozzarella made a world of difference between the Margherita and the Buffalina. I was a little disappointed with the Bianco Nero because I expected a strong whiff of the black truffle and white truffle oil but the truffle was subdued. How can a meal end without dessert?? We got the Spumoni which looked pretty and fun and also the Tartufo, which is a serious desert that means business and its business is to transport you to the wonderful world of chocolate.
