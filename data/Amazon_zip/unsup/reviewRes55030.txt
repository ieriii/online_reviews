I'm not sure where to start. I'm slightly upset with myself to give this place a thumbs down. I wanted my experience to be like other experiences I've heard about from friends but it just wasn't up to par. The server Molly was nice but did not know a whole lot about the menu items. She just seemed to have the same answer for everything and was a bit indifferent. The food was okay, nothing memorable and the drinks are a bit over priced for the amount of ice shoved into the glass. I was built up with such high expectations and was completely let down. The ambiance is nice.
