Probably won't be going back any time soon. Why? Because the place evidently DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CLEANLINESS. While waiting for our order to be taken (for quite some time, now that I think of it), I saw a waiting patron knock over the Rubbermaid storage bin that holds the silverware. The contents spilled out onto the floor: napkins, silverware, chopsticks, all on the floor. Some stayed in their neatly-folded napkins, some did not. The server simply picked them up and started placing them back in their napkins, then placing them back in the container. The red lights were flashing in my mind because I got the impression nothing was going to be done about this. I was hoping they would at least take them back to the kitchen for a cleaning. Nope. I told my fiance, who was sitting on the outside of our table/booth. We discussed the proper course of action, and after waiting to give the servers ample time to take them back (benefit of the doubt) and seeing other servers hovering over the container, we decided to tell management, or at least whoever it is at the front door taking delivery orders and reservations. "Oh, I'll tell them (the servers)," was the response. Nothing was ever mentioned to the staff. I was watching. Eventually, the whole container was empty. Granted, I did not see the silverware's final resting place, so perhaps they did make it to the sink. But only one or two were taken in a given trip. Had we not already been seated when the container spilled, and we saw this during our wait, we would have left right then and there, and made a much bigger stink about it. I'm feeling evermore guilty for not just announcing what we had seen to those waiting. I apologize. OVERALL: It's all well and good to have pretty good maki and very fast delivery within a couple blocks (which is why 2 stars, for past experiences), but when you don't trust the cleanliness of what you are being served, what good is it, really?
