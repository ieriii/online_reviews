Amazing food, fun atmosphere, great wine list that doesn't break the bank. Some snout to tail eating (pigs ears yum! Think slightly crunchy potatoe chips) The beets were oustanding and I enjoyed the fresh flavors on the Mint and Pea Arancini. We also got the roasted marrow which you spread like butter on bread and then top with vinegary herbs to cut the fat. Everything was fantastic! Wines come by glass, by .25 liter, .5 or whole bottles, so you can try different wines and everything was quite reasonable. Add great service and a groovy casual vibe and this is our most memorable meal in Chicago and one of the top meals I have ever had, I believe!
