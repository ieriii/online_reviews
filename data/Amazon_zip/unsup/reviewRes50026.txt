Can we say "delicioso"!?! My boyfriend and I wanted to try this restaurant ever since a couple of people recommended it. It definitely met my expectations. We started off with free sangria (printed out a coupon on their website), and ordered a couple of appetizers; chicken empanadas and arepas con chorizo. Both were very good. The empanadas were made with masa, and came out hot and crisp. The chorizo was yummy! The main dish we ordered was the flank steak, ordered medium rare, and made with perfection. It was definitely big enough to split. The chimichurri sauce, plantains, and yucca nicely complements the dish. The service and food was great! I'm definitely coming back for more!
