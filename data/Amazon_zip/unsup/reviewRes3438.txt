I really resent enjoying trendy places, a la Hot Dougs or Kuma's, because they can quite busy. Crisp was no different judging by my 25 minute wait. That being said, I really liked Crisp. To start, the menu is really unique with shades of Korean and comfort food blended together. You can find fried mushrooms right along side kim chi here. I tried the fries, which were fresh and delicious, very good. I also had to try both of their signature sauces, bbq and sweet, so what better vehicle than fried chicken wings? I absolutely loved the wings, only slightly enjoying the sweet a little more. I would absolutely go back here for one of the most unique treatments to good old fried chicken.
