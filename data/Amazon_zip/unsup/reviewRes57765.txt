I just moved to the neighborhood and everyone kept asking me if i had tried 3rd coast yet. So today i had some reading to get done before my night class and figured i would try it. I had lox on a bagel, which my inner new yorker has been searching for ever since i moved here. It was lovely. Bottomless coffee is always a plus. It wasn't too busy, so it was nice and quiet.. but seemed to be full of regulars, which is always a good sign. Everyone was so nice and when they heard i was there new neighbor was more than welcoming. I sat there for about two hours drinking coffee and reading. They played really good music. I even had to iphone shazam some of it. everyone there was so nice. i'll be back there, maybe even tomorrow!
