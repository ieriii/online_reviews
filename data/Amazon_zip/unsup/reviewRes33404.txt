I've been to Yolk a few times since my original review and I think it's earned its 4th star. The food I've had the past few visits has been really good (I still stick with the savory egg-based items). And the service has been really great. Friendly and quick. One of the other things that I've recently come to appreciate about Yolk is that the counter seating makes it an easy place to go to solo if no one wants to wake up and join you for brunch (but you're really hungry and feeling deserving of a nice brunch).  I do prefer Yolk in the summer to the winter, because it's much more pleasant to be able to wait outside. And while the wait can suck, at least you expect it (and they do turn tables over quickly).
