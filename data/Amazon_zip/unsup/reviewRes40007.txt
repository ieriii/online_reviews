Stop 2 of the Drunk Monks Bar Crawl. Had the privelege of bellying up at the bar with Derek Anderson, who is a great bartender and mixologist. I don't know if it was fortunate or unfortunate that we had this pleasure as we were partook tasing several whiskey shots which L&E is very well-known for. We ordered 2 IPA's that weren't very memorable, and would most likely continue to go to MapRoom for my hopfix; however, we will be back here for the mixed drinks and creative dinner menu.
