I think if I lived closer this would be a regular spot for me for a casual beer and meal. While I wasn't blown away by my food or beer it was pretty good and there were lots of other things on the menu I would like to try. I really enjoyed the blue cheese mussel appetizer my party and I split, the pretzel was relatively underwhelming. It was better than Kirkwood's...but wouldn't order it again. I had the pulled pork pizza and it was really good! Of course with bacon, pulled pork and pizza...can't go wrong. I tried my friend's twice baked potato pizza- definitely very glad I didn't order it myself.  As I said, nothing blew me away but if I am close by I can see myself heading back to try some different beer (they were out of the one I really wanted to try) and some other pizzas and appetizers.
