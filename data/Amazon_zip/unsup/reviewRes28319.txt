Friday afternoon, just closed on my condo. Where to eat? Frontera! We walked to Frontera from Chicago Title and luckily got there around 4:30P. I did not know that Frontera does not open til 5:00P. At 4:30 there was already a line, we were about 10th. It was nice out and I wanted to see what Frontera was all about. We were let in and seated by 5:25P and I overheard that the wait was already an hour and a half for people who were just showing up. The decor was pretty nice, music was kind of loud but bearable and our waitress was awesome.  We started out with the ceveche trio, and chips and salsa. I ordered the lamb shank special and I was not disappointed in the least. The sauce was awesome and the lamb shank was so tender that it literally fell off the bone. Great flavor and great texture. I would definitely recommend frontera to my friends and family, but only if they invited me to go as well...:) Try frontera, you definitely will not be disappointed. Only reason I took off one star was because of the price. I don't think great food and great service should cost that much.
