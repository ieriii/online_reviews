Okay, this is a gourmet food place, so don't expect anything to be cheap. But for the prices you're paying, you have access to hard-to-find products of wonderful quality. I love trying exotic fruits, so imagine my surprise when I found star fruit, passion fruit, and guava! They weren't cheap by any means. But when I took them home and sliced away, the fruits were juicy, sweet, and ripe! Maybe I was just lucky in selecting them, but that left a def impression on me. I really like browsing through the selection of fruits, breads, chocolates, fish, etc. Everything they carry are imported, expensive, rich, gourmet, etc. Just wondeful! If you want to eat something before you go, just head to the back where they have a soft of gourmet cafeteria. I love their chop salads. This is def a place worth visiting!
