I really enjoyed every aspect of my dinner at 90 Miles. The staff is warm and welcoming and the food is delicious. They have a great outdoor waiting area where you can sit, enjoy your BYO beverages and visit with your group until your table is ready. The area has multiple heaters and a fire pit...a great escape in the middle of the city. It was so nice that I was a little bummed when our table was ready early....that was short lived once I started eating 90 Miles' amazing cuisine. We started with empanadas that were perfectly crispy and fat with fillings. Yum! Our group ordered one beef dish and two pork dishes...each was better than the next! The food is flavorful and the portions are plentiful. My only complaint was that they were out of bread pudding and flan, but they gave us a rice pudding on the house, which was delicious. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere is delightful. I felt like I was on vacation and there's so much attention to detail from the center pieces to the artwork. The owner sat down and chatted with us while we waited for our table and you can tell he's truly passionate about making his restaurant great. This place is a gem and I can't wait to go back!
