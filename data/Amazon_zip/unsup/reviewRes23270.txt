I agree with Jennifer S. in regard to, " I was thrilled to bits when I recently went back with some friends". The bottom line is: How does it TASTE? Personally, I think it's a "craveable"! If you know the portions are small and expensive, and also sooooo tasty- you can get your head around it & enjoy the experience.  I went there with awesome company, we were both very hungry, and it all was tasty (esp the salmon & goat cheese!), but... we *did* hit Einstein along the way back, lol. I'll go back. :)
