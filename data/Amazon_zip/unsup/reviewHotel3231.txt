There is nothing really special about this hotel. It has a rock & roll theme so basically means that there's a picture of John Lennon in your room instead of.. umm... dogs playing poker? The room, bed and bathroom are fine but the details are where this place misses. For example: -no free wifi in the room -the service is friendly but not good, i.e. really slow -the tv is fine but the remote is so crude and cheap that it's just not worth it -lighting in the rooms and lobby that is truly terrible -the hotel bar looks like it belongs on MTV but feels out of place in Chicago Do yourself a favor and book at the Renaissance across the street--same price point, same location, and free wifi.
