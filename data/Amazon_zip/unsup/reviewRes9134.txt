I am a Vietnamese who was born and raised there and I have to say I was fully satisfied with the food here. Me and my friend had number 4. "Chao tom" for appetizer which was exactly how it was described in the menu (Grilled shrimp wrapped around sugar cane, With angel-hair noodles, mint, cilantro, & lettuce, with peanut plum dipping sauce ) . Perfect portion for appetizer. Then we had number 25. "Bun thit nuong" for entree. It was a great combination of noodle, bbq pork, different kinds of greens and a special mix of lime garlic fish sauce. I totally love it. We also had some cocktails .. I definitely recommend the Lychee Shangri la for ladies who have low alcohol tolerance like me :P so yummy !! The place is so cozy and homie that I felt like eating in a restaurant back home... with all the old b&w photos of Saigon and small indoor palm trees .. A 5-star for this :) Oh yea, did I mention all the small sofas and tables upstairs ? Super cute ! All the hosts and servers are really friendly and helpful. A small minus is its price but with all the mentioned above, it's worth a try.  PS: such a great spot for dinner dates ;) but remember to make reservations in advanced tho'.
