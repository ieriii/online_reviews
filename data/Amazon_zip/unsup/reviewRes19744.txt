I stopped in here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed! As I approached the hostess she asked if I had reservations. I didn't..who makes reservations for lunch on a Friday? Anyway..it was a 30 minute wait, but the hostess directed me to the bar where I could sit down right away. As there were no high top bar tables available I ponied up to the bar to enjoy a TGIF lunch.  The lunch menu is great - there's plenty of choices from soups, salads, sandwiches and even some bigger entrees. I went with the soup of the day (that's the soup de jour for you Dumb & Dumber fans out there) which happened to be sweet potato. You can also get half of a sandwhich to enjoy with your cup of soup. I went with the House BBQ Roasted Turkey on a pretzel roll, which comes with fries. Yum! The food came out quickly and it was great! The sweet potato soup was yummy and you can never go wrong with a sandwich on a pretzel roll. Some guy, who I assume was the manager even came up and asked how we were enjoying our meal. Great service and great food! A great loop lunch spot for those who work on or near Michigan Ave or those checking out the Art Institute.
