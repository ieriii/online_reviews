We celebrated my best friend's birthday here on a Friday night. Our party of 10 was a pretty big group for this size restaurant, but they were nothing but welcoming and helpful. I absolutely LOVED the food at Simply It. Everyone at the table loved their meals. I ordered the Asian vegetables with crispy noodles, and the meal was perfection. I am still craving it 5 days later. Also delicious were the avocado wontons, like crab rangoon but with avocado and cream cheese!  Next time I get to go out to eat, I'm going to seriously want some Simply It. Just fair warning, it is kind of loud on a Friday bc it is so crowded, but I once it died down after 9pm, it was the PERFECT atmosphere for a dinner party.
