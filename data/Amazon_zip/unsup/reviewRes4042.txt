Well, they finally called me back.  How do people get reservations at this place? Is there a secret club? I had the pleasure of FINALLY dining at Schwa last weekend. I must say that I kinda dig the joint. I loved the music, and laid back vibe. The space was very cool, but the decor needs a makeover. The service was very good but I did feel a bit rushed. The food was absolutely excellent... but all over the place. We had the nine course dinner and it just didn't flow.  I need to go back to make a final determination of my rating. Does anyone know how often they change the menu? I'd look it up online, or call them... but, well.. you know. About a week later, I was at a wine bar and the guy sitting next to me was making that awful "hock a loogie" sound. When he saw that he was disturbing the people around him, he would do it louder. Finally I turned around to say "Do you mind!?" and it was one of the Chef/Waiters from Schwa!!! He remembered me too, because I was "the girl on crutches" when I dined there. I wonder if he does that kind of stuff in the kitchen..
