Ok but can it be better in the Gold Coast! I love the cute decor in the place. The theme runs true throughout the hotel. The room was definitely cozy and reminded me more of a bed and breakfast than a hotel.  The place is nestled right off the lake. I was thinking it should be a bit more opulent but its okay. One thing that I appreciate is free wifi in the rooms. It makes a heck of a difference when you are trying to get work done.  The price was okay but make sure you check out http://hotels.com for great discounts on them before paying a hefty price. The service was moderate. At times, you could miss them. However, the morning time is when they flourish with many greetings and "hello, how are you doing today"! It's worth checking out.
