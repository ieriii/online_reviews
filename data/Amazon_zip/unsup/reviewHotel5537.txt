This hotel sucks.  It was recommended to me by the hiring manager for my current gig, but I'm not sure why they suggest people come here because I think it is, quite frankly, an overpriced Travelodge.  I had a pretty crappy room (516) for the duration of my stay there and there was this smell that would welcome me every night when I came home from work.  Wet carpet smell, perhaps?  I dunno...  I actually looked on http://Hotels.com to change after about a week here but I was unfortunately not able to find anything else within the same price range.  Luckily, on my next trip, I booked Hotel Felix for $45 less per night.
