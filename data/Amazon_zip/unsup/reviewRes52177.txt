I saw the long line to this place the day before so I decided to try it. Simply went for the obvious- deep dish pizza; chose the supreme with sausage. Took maybe 40 minutes to cook the pizza. It was quite good. I was fearing a thick crust but it wasn't bad. It was baked to perfection- a golden crust. But I thought the crust was made of corn of some sort- if it had sweetness it couldn't have been mistaken for cornbread. Not bad. good service.
