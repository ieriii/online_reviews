I finally got to try this place a couple of weeks ago! I love how colorful and huge this place is. My cousin and I had a reservation for 630 and were promptly seated. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. We ordered the fish tacos for an appetizer...yum!! Cooked perfectly, a lil crispy but not at all greasy. Then, we both got the chicken dishes for our main entree. I got the chicken Billy or something ? It wad delish. By the time we were leaving this place was getting packed!! Oh we got a side of Brussel sprouts (not my idea) there was something weird tasting about them...couldn't quite figure it out!
