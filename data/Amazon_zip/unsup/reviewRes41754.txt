I read a few of the bad reviews which made me think that I may be too easy to please. Oh well ... I love Tank Noodle. I'm not Vietnamese and the 20+ times I've visited, I've only gotten their Pho Special. In other words, my ability to judge whether this is authentic Pho or their overall food options is limited. BUT ... I have had enough Pho from other places to know if this is good Pho or bad Pho and this is good Pho. Be ready to wait or share a large table with strangers during peak hours. There are a couple of other smaller places down the street, a few of them pretty good but there's something about going to the place where the crowds of Vietnamese people are that makes me feel better about my Pho. BYOB.
