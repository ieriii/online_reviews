After following some many great review for this place, I checked this out the food was just OK I've eaten much taster middle eastern food else ware. I had an Chicken dinner which was served with spicy rice and salad with humus and pita bread. The rice was dry, cold had uncooked lentils the salad had too much tahani sauce and had no taste. The chicken was again cold and little flavor with humus being the worst i never had eaten humus so bad. How ever there are a few good things about this restaurant the food quantity is huge for the price i guess so many good reviews are due to this fact alone, it was a BYOB with out a corkage fee again a good one. I would suggest this restaurant if you wanted a BYOB with out corkage and did not care much about the taste of the food but was more interested in getting a huge quantity.
