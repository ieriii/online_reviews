What can I say? I married into a Superdawg family. My father in law started going there as a kid and my husband and his siblings all LOVE it. I love it too. My standard order is a Superdawg (no tomato no peppers) and a chocolate malt. Every once in a while I branch out and order something different - the Whoopskidawg (Polish sausage) or Supercheesie are quite good. And the french fries. Dude. They're like little fried pieces of potato heaven.
