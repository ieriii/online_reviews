A carnivore's wet dream. 15 different cuts of meat, servers that keep giving you food until you plead "stop" and flip your little disk to red... Come only if you're hungry. We celebrated here a couple days after Match Day... and didn't eat for a couple days afterwards. The salad bar is quite good, too, but who comes to Fogo for salad? Lunch is definitely the better deal.
