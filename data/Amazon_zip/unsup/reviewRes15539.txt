i wanted to love this place from the moment i saw it. i thought during the first couple of weeks it wasn't going to happen since it was packed to the gills something ridiculous. this place still does a slammin' business don't get me wrong, but thankfully you can breathe a bit now. at first i didn't think the food was doing anything drastically different, but it is--just a bit more subtle than some. their own beer is good--some better than others. i lean towards the eugene or the other porter as standby faves. they have a nice rotation of guest beers on tap that have sometimes been enough to get me in the door (oh pumpking beer i miss you!). the decor is super cute. it is loud though--be warned that on a busy night you may have to shout to be heard. the best thing hands down on the food menu is the feta & beet salad. their hamburgers are awesome and their brunch is pretty good as well. do yourself a favor and go for dessert. you will be stuffed from a burger most likely, but you need to have one of theirs--jon neiser you are a gift!
