The service at this bar was so bad I can say with certainty that I will never return. Three of us walked in one Friday evening around 7:00 p.m. and immediately found a table (well, a tree stump accompanied by three logs we were apparently supposed to sit on) near the fireplace. There we sat for 20 minutes without so much as a drink menu. One of the girls I was with went to the bar counter and asked if someone could come over to serve us. We were told it would be just a moment. Ten minutes later, we still hadn't seen any sign of a drink menu so we walked out, but not before mentioning the reason to the hostess. No apology, just a shrug and some comment about it being a busy night. How busy can it be if you were able to seat us immediately? Funny enough, we were actually looking at the place as one of several options for a bachelorette party. I don't think I have to tell you Zed451 didn't get our business on the night of the big event...
