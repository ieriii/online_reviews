I really want to give this place 3.5 stars! I will probably return, but wasn't blown away. I ordered the crepes filled with eggs, avocado, and cheese. The crepe itself was pretty good, but too sweet for the combination of fillings - the flavors didn't mesh well. The potatoes were REALLY good though. I had decent service, sitting at the counter on a Sunday (after watching friends run the lovely Chicago marathon!). Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. I have heard that the wait can be bad on the weekends, but I guess no one wanted to come downtown to brave the marathon. The menu is huge, filled with the basics: eggs, omelettes, pancakes, also scrambles, skillets, fritattas, crepes, and lunch items: sandwiches, salads, and burgers. The restaurant itself is pretty big and has nice trendy, but simple, decor. Overall, this is a good brunch place, especially if you are looking for something on your way to Museum Park or Grant Park.
