Grand Lux is great! It is definitely all that it should be for its location on Michigan Avenue. The whimsical decor is fun, especially with the view over the city! Any place that offers to make me fresh baked desserts while I wait is cool with me! Their breakfast menu is quite large with unique options - and the portion sizes are ridiculously large (and definitely not over priced). They do not serve breakfast all day, so my experience with it has been limited. Not only would I have to wake up before 11 am, there is always a line waiting for their breakfast before they are even open! Their appetizers are unique and delish, as are their lunch and dinner entrees. This is just a fun place to bring people visiting Chicago or during a shopping trip downtown.
