I found this to a pretty generic Indian brunch. Not wanting to risk the bacterial bloom, I skipped the buffet and ordered some kofta and naan (at about the same price, I would add). Not bad, though not remarkable either. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but seeing as it is on my way to a lot of places I'm sure I'll be back.
