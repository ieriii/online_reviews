It's really an up-scale cheesecake factory. My friend and I got there at noon on a Sunday. We expected to wait for at least 20 minutes, but were seated after only a five-minute wait. The service is proper and good. I just had a seafood salad. It was huge, but nothing too impressive otherwise. I give it a four-star overall. Everything is fine, I just think that it should be more unique in its cuisine.
