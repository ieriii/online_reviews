I went here for sushi. While the sushi I ordered was just so-so, I was very impressed with the service and enjoyed the ambiance. What we ordered: The shellfish sushi platter, which comes with about six different rolls. The rolls weren't anything special, but the four accompanying dipping sauces are an added bonus. Also, the California roll was made with real crab (not imitation as it is often made in the Midwest), but whoever prepared the crab, did not do a good job because I came across a couple pieces of the actual shell.  Despite my so-so feelings for the sushi, I would still go back again because I feel that it would be a lot better if I opted to not go with the pre-picked platter and just order ala carte.  Other notes: The asiago cheese bread is delicious. The prices are a little on the high side. While toro is the best, $10 for one piece is a little pricey, especially considering that you can walk down the street to Oysy and get 2 pieces for $8.
