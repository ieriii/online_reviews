I had wanted to go to this place for a long time and finally made it there. IT WAS MEDIOCRE AT BEST! If you like the taste of burnt pizza crust you'll love this place. The center of the pizza was soggy and under cooked, the edges were black with charred dough. The place was extremely noisy as if I were in a tin can (poor acoustics!). The eggplant appetizer was mushy and tasteless! The mozzarella appetizer was just ok, once again the bread served with the mozzarella was BURNT! The meal was $100.00 for 2 MEDIOCRE pizzas, and 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine. Just about everyone who has written a review loves this place..... I don't get it. I've had Much better pizza in Chicago at a fraction of the price. SKIP IT!
