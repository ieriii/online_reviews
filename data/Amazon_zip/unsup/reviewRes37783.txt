I recently took a cross-country road trip with my son as we moved him into LA. This is a review of one of our many stops across the good ol' USA As we usually do we ask the door man, valet, front desk staff about local places to go In this case we had just arrived in Chicago and wanted to have the famous deep dish pizza. Giordano's was close and clearly a local favorite and a tourist hot-spot. They were ready for the crowds. Ordering in advance, friendly service and front desk folks. I wish the bar was larger and the bartenders more friendly p but the beer was cold and the prices reasonable. Pizze was good and worth making a stop in the Windy City.
