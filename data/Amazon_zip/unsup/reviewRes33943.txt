I really like this restaurant. It's a little too far for me to walk there, so I appreciate the discounted parking next door to the restaurant. The food is wonderful and the coffee is really good. It's a large enough restaurant to accommodate allot of people, which is great considering so many people have moved into this neighborhood since Millenium Park has been developed.  The place can get really busy on the weekends, especially with families. So, I like to get there early to avoid the crowds. But, sometimes I go a little later in the day, during the week, and that works out well too.
