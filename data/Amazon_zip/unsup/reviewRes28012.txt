I only ate here once, but it was SOOO GOOD. Great appetizers, good portions, and of course excellent main courses. Parking kind of sucks, because street parking is limited like anywhere else in the city and as busy as this place is, their small private lot is usually packed (and a pain to pull in and out of). Not sure about credit, since I used cash at the time, but as long as they have seats and tables available they will try to accommodate larger groups.
