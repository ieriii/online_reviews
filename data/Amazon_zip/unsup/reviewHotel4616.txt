Cool boutique hotel. The room is very well designed and feels quite modern. The room is a little small but isn't uncomfortably small. They have central lighting in the rooms which makes the whole place bright and gives you the feeling they have nothing to hide. There's also free WiFi throughout the hotel which is a very nice plus.
