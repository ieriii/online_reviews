mmmm, very good coffee. the scones are rockin and the filled croissants also winners. Good for picking up on the go, sitting outside in the sun, or chilling in their 'lounge' next door. The 'lounge' is a bit funny, some kind of cross between a living room and a cafeteria. Don't be afraid to go all the way to the back and explore, there's better tables back there. free wireless to boot.
