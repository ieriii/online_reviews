Went to Glenn's after I searched high and low for an affordable seafood restaurant in the city. After seeing Million Dollar Quartet @ the Apollo, Glenn's was just a short drive north. My hubby is not a seafood lover, but he was really pleased with Glenn's. First of all, you'd never know they serve fish ~ absolutely no fishy smell in front of or inside of the place. We were there about 6pm on Sunday and didn't have to wait for a table, there were 2 empty. Hubby ordered a burger and liked it. Was a little disappointed they didn't serve fries. His burger came with a potato pancake, which I absolutely loved. He just thought was OK. For me, there were so many entrees to choose from I asked our server several questions to narrow it down. He was really helpful and knowledgeable. Finally decided on the scallops and was not disappointed. I was surprised they were only $21, not bad at all. I started with a cup of chowder that was the best chowder I've ever had. Period. Not kidding ~ it was that good. The scallops arrived and were they ever tasty. Nicely seared on each side, covered with mushrooms and bacon bits and a light butter/wine sauce with just a little hint of garlic.. It was kind of like eating a scallop steak! The broccoli was crisp and well prepared. I couldn't eat it all. Never do I take seafood home, but this was so darn good I just couldn't leave it. It's quite a drive from my house, close to an 1.5 hours. I'm willing to make that drive to go back! Thanks, Glenn's Diner for helping us celebrate 26 years of marriage with a fantastic meal : )
