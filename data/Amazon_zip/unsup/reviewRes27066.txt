Over hyped, over priced... I'm totally lost as to what is so great about this place. Great chef that made a huge mistake I guess everyone watches way too much top chef and like foam in every dish or everything deconstructed. The only thing missing is Padma telling me to pack up my knives and go. I don't need my waiter to explain what deconstructed means...you mean if I swirl it all together then it tastes like it was all one dish? I get it, I get it, we all get it, its great. If that's the case then why not just serve that way to begin with? The waiter raved, and raved about the truffle oil popcorn. He raved about it so much that he forgot to bring it until the end of our meal. Sad part was it was the lone highlight Service was pretentious, food was fun to look at but disappointing to eat My advice, pop some jiffy pop, buy some good truffle oil and save yourself $100
