This was my restaurant of choice for restaurant week. I've been wanting to come here for a long time, but Geja's is a special occasion type of restaurant. I decided to go with the chicken & beef, the bf had the chicken & shrimp. The first course was the bread & fruits with cheese fondue & a salad. I really liked this course. I would take a bite of the salad and than a bite of bread dipped in cheese. Super yummy. The second course was the veggies and meat. It was a little hard keeping track of everything that we put in the pot of oil, but it was fun. It came with 11 different sauces. My fave were the bbq, dill, and some spicy sauce. My favorite course was the chocolate fondue. I'm not going to go into detail since most reviewers have. The reason why Geja's doesn't get 5 stars from me are the fact that the cocktails were weak and very small. I had a martini and it was the weakest and smallest martini I've ever had. If I'm spending $12 for a drink I expect it to pack a punch. I had another drink that I can't remember and it was weak and small too. Since Geja's is a litte pricey I would only come back with a coupon and not order any drinks.
