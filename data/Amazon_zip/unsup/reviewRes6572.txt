Bachelorette party from Hades. Girls crying. Girls yelling. Girls spitting in fake plants at the airport (alcohol involved). The definition of a shit show on wheels. Lo and behold, Chicago q. I had my fingers-crossed that this sure-bet restaurant would save the day. I've always had a way for blaming frowny faces on empty stomachs, so I was hoping q's homemade bbq chips and house sweet pickles (crazy-good) would start steering this party in the right direction. Ya know what else makes people smile? A damn good Blood Mary. Please, oh please, waiter - pour some alcohol down these unhappy souls' throats! My mother is the Queen of Bloody Marys and I, well, I'm not a huge fan but q's smokey/meaty tomato kick-in-the-ass Mary is an exception. It may not have been what the group needed, but it sure as hell was what I needed at the moment. Our waiter handled our group very well. It seemed to be difficult to keep everyone at the table between the bathroom stall crying sessions and phone calls to home outside the restaurant. This social/company side of this sacred meal was nothing like I had envisioned it when I originally chose q for our dinner stop, but the food was exquisitely predictable. My kobe beef sandwich was piled high with juicy, lean chunks of meat and left me wishing I wasn't from out of town so I could party the night away with a to-go box in hand. So, maybe we weren't able to salvage the remainder of the evening, but we were able to fill the tummies of a bbq-loving bunch with juicy meats and bloody Marys. One more note - q is quite possibly the prettiest BBQ restaurant I've ever been to. It's like a worldly farm boy - hard to come by, but magic when you do.
