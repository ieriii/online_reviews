Don't have too much to say about this place based on my first impression. I had soup and a salad and ias pretty tasty stuff at a decent price. Sat outside which was really nice! I especially liked that they had flat screen tvs outside, so I can enjoy the great outdoors and catch the Sox game at the same time :) Lots of good food choices. I will definitely go back!
