Milk and Honey is a hip little brunch place on Division. When coming here you may want to plan for a little extra time to find parking as it's a bit difficult to find nearby the restaurant. When you order - it's at the counter when you walk in - then you are given a number and a seat in the restaurant. Your food is then brought out to you when ready. Another note is that you need to pick up your silverware, napkins, etc. from the counter before getting seated. I noticed that the first couple of items that I picked up were either dirty or had fuzz on them. The food itself was pretty good - two of us had the breakfast burrito which was tasty and filled with egg, tomato and black beans. It could have used a bit more salsa but having some Tabasco helped. The other person had the waffle of the day which was good as well. For the food Milk and Honey is worth the trip - the service is OK and I'd agree with other reviews where the lunch counter approach is a bit informal and takes away from the ambiance of the place.
