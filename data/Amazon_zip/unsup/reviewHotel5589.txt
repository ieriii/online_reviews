Great location ... DAMN, is everything expensive ... rooms are pretty nice but not out-of-this world good. Was a bit ticked off that despite the standard nightly rate going above $340, they still want to ding you $9.99 a night to use internet. Really? Anyway, that led to another argument until they agreed to give it for free.
