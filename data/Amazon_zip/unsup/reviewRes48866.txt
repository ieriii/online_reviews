I'm not terribly into pork but this place has a lot of personality: big pig paintings on the walls, communal tables or pig-pen style enclosed tables for small groups. Seafood was delicious and I'm glad I finally got to try "head cheese" for the first time (not bad but I don't need to order it again). Service was efficient and friendly and despite being there on a work trip (hence cost not the highest priority) we managed to get out of there at a reasonable $50/person.
