Best Deep Dish pizza I have ever had in my life! My fiancee, myself &his cousin went to lunch here on her work hour because unfortunately she had to work the following day we got into town. Although it ended up working out because we were able to explore the city which may have been extremely boring for her. Anyway, this place was perfect as far as location &because we had eaten at Lou Malnati's the following night &I had skipped the pizza after not wanting to have a heavy meal so late.. I decided to have pizza &a salad because we had &planned to be walking a ton. Well, I was very very happy after waiting that 40-50 mins for the pizza to bake to perfection. SO YUMMY!! Was not heavy or greasy like the poor excuses for pizza we have here in CA. I was only able to handle one slice but the days after I was still thinking about it. A small fed myself &my fiancee... as well as the poor guy across the street asking for money. Service.. was so so, but she was busy &the pizza def made us happy. Cool atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!
