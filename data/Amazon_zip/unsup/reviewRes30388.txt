Decent place for a girls night out if you're looking for a place with an energetic atmosphere. Reservations: If you don't want to deal with the reservation hassle, go early 5:30-ish (they open at 5) and sit at the bar. On a Saturday night they don't seem to start get going until around 7 or 7:30. If you do have a reservation, they only hold the table for 15-minutes so don't be late! Cocktails:  (+)  bd's super fresh sakitin - I'm not even a sake fan & I liked this drink. (+/-) singapore sling - too sweet for my liking Food: Overall the rolls I had were good, but not earthshattering if I go back I'd probably stick to sushi/sashimi. Here's what we had. . . (+) spicy "tail of two tunas" (+) crunchy pig, hidden lobster      (+) suzuki (seabass)  (+) escolar (white tuna) (+) hamachi (yellowtail)
