Yeah it was A-ok and tried coz everyone suggested that I should check out deep dish pizza - the signature item of city of "Revolving doors".. Took about 45 minutes to get our special small sized deep dish pizza.. Lots of mozzarella and less meaty. Fried zucchini was heavenly. Would suggest the appetizer platter if you are a big group. Tried their pizza and got out with their Tshirt as a souvenir :-)
