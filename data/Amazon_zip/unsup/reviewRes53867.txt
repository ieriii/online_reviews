Who says you HAVE to get the pig stuff? Got the chicken kebabs and the fried sardines! (both of which were very good: the chicken was juicy and tender, if not a little boring; the sardines were fried to perfection)But, of course, our group ordered lots of pig stuff (you have to you have to...both because this is the purple pig and also because its so good). 1. The bone marrow was very good and obviously quite rich. I found after the first couple slices of toast it became too much, but I definitely encourage you to try it.2. The pork shoulder is a favorite of mine. I've been to the purple pig a couple times now, and this is one of my favorite dishes. 3. Finally, the pig's ear with crispy kale! If you could only order one dish, get this one! The pig's ear is deliciously fried, complemented with cherry peppers and a fried egg, and of course the crispy kale, which is so well fried.
