Took my boyfriend here for his birthday on a busy Saturday night. We had a reservation for 7:30, which was honored within minutes. The salad bar is outstanding and honestly, I could've made a meal just out of that. The selection of meats is amazing and the service was very good. Don't forget to turn over your card to "red" otherwise you will be overwhelmed with servings of meat. Overall a good experience for a special occasion but more food than I would normally want to eat for dinner.
