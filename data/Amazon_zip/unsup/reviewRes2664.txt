It was a bit overhyped, which I think dampened my experience. I luckily went earlier on a weekday during early lunch hours so waited only 30 minutes versus the other crazy amounts of times I've heard. The hot dog was good. I had the duck foie gras dog. It was good, but got a little too rich towards the end. My bf had two other hot dogs of which I don't remember the type. His was good. I don't think i'd wait any longer than we did. about the max amount of time I think that was worth it for our meal that is normally considered "fast food type". But I am also maybe not a huge hot dog lover. Despite that, I think it is a good establishment, and if you like hot dogs more than I do, it's probably a good place to go.
