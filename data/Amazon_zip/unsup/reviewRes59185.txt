I have been getting sushi X delivery for years but there is one dish that stands out for me and its the spicy tuna salad. I love that its basically the inside of a spicy tuna roll on a salad of greens topped with avocado. The best thing is that it is an entire meal for $9 there is soo much tuna on top. I have to admit that there have been some issues with a couple of orders over the years but the customer service is great. They fixed any problems quickly and very courteously and what more could you ask?
