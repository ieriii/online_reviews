Wow I really liked this place. I ate here right after I ran the half marathon so the wait was long but the food was worth it! If you like eggs benedict, they have about 5 different types. I had the regular eggs benedict even though all the others sounded so good... and it was amazing! It came with red potatoes and fruit, which was really good as well. Also, what's cool about this place is that if you get an omelette or a skillet (and possibly one other type of entree)... you get the choice of having toast or pancakes for the side. Most restaurants don't give the option of pancakes for your side so that's cool, tasty, and accommodating if you can't decide between an egg or a pancake entree. They also have lots of different pancakes (and french toast) ranging from buttermilk to chocolate strawberry. Weekends are busy there so expect to wait between 30-45 minutes for a table on Saturday and Sunday mornings but weekdays seem calmer according to the waitress.
