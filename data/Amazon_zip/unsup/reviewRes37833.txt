Somethings just really make you miss home. One of the main things for me is good pizza. being a Chicago native stuck in Cambridge, Mass for law school sucks if you like pizza. No offense but Bostonians think that pears, lettuce, avocado and anything else you can think of belongs on a pizza.  If you don't believe me check out this place and you'll get great deep dish pizza, plenty of cheese and the crust is great. A true Chicago staple. I been going to the one on the southside since I was a kid and this one is better than that one. Beware, this place is popular, so expect to wait for about an hour for a table. Fortunately we put in our name and order, left and came back. We ordered a 10" deep dish and the 2 of us could only finish half. Next time I am home I will likely come back to Giordano's. Also very friendly waitstaff. I had to give it a star deduction because too many tourist and the line but it's still an awesome place.
