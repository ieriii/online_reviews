I have only ordered take-out but the pizza is very good and worth the price. It feels light in the your belly too, which is good since I like to snarl down many pieces in one sitting. *Added April 17, 2007* I had lunch in Piece last week and I must say I'm dissapointed. The beer and pizza were good, however waiting 30 minutes for a personal pan pizza is just retarded. The place wasn't even a quarter full and there was plenty of staff abound. Somewhere in the chain of command there was a delay, and when you have a certain amount of time for lunch during a work day it leaves you dissapointed. I'm knocking off one star and sticking to take-out.
