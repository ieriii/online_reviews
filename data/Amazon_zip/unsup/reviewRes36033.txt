Ok, I came here with my sister in law, and seriously, this place is rock solid awesome.  apple stuffed french toast with marscapone cream in between was delicious. Smoked Salmon crepes were tasty Lavazza coffee was nice and strong, perfect pick me with breakfast. I have to go back and get their natural juices or their pb smoothie....I hear they are dope! Service was nice. GO
