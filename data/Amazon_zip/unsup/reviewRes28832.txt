Well, first off. . . do yourself a favor and go to Pasta Palazzo! Similar concept and much better food! I went here last week with a colleague. It took a long time to get service at 1pm and with a semi empty restaurant. It was after m colleague waived her hand that our server came. These are the things we ordered: Salad with berries and nuts with raspberry vinaigrette: Quite tasty! When I asked if the dressing was homemade (because I liked it) I was told it was Kraft. That's great; but I'm not sure that you want your customers to know that. Mussels with Linguine: My colleague ordered this. Mussels were tough and lacking a great taste. Tortellini with Pesto and Alfredo Sauce: Recommended by the waitress It was good; but not amazing! Terimisu: It tasted like the inside of a refrigerator. Not good! My advice is to go somewhere else. Noodles and Company even one up's this establishment. I like the concept, but unfortunately the service and food fell short.
