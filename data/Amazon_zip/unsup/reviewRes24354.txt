4 and a half stars! Mercat a la planxa offers a very sophisticated and intimate dining experience with some great tasting tapas. The ambiance is very beautiful and sexy. I loved the decor of the place, the dim lights and the high ceilings. I was also surprised at how big the place was. On to the food - delicious! They have quite a few vegetarian dishes. We started with the complimentary tomato bread - delish! Then we had the butternut squash dumplings with mushrooms and truffle oil. It was so smooth and decadent. We loved it. Then came the wild mushrooms with confit potato and onion - this dish was the star of the meal. I am a big fan of mushrooms and this was a superb dish. The next time my husband and me go here, we are going to order one for each of us :) Cauliflower dish - this was ok, good but not great like the previous two dishes Patatas bravas - am not a big fan of potatoes and I dont enjoy smoky flavor. My husband ordered this and he absolutely loved it. For dessert we got the hazelnut-mascarpone gateau with apricot sorbet and dulce de leche - it was heavenly. I love apricots and the dessert was the perfect ending to the meal. The service was adequate - no complaints. The restaurant is a little too expensive for the tapas dishes, but the flavor of the food totally makes it worth it.
