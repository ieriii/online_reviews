Ooh, bf and I love the Amalfi. Please don't get too busy and make it harder to get a room here! First off, you're in a really prime location. Quiet street, but an easy walk to Whole Foods, nightlife, and the major conference hotels. Next, the rooms are great. They are immaculate, quiet, and equipped with highly effective "black-out" curtains. In addition, you're going to get a solid breakfast and a wonderful happy hour! Each night, on two floors, the bartenders and snackys come out and you can drink to your heart's content. A great idea, and a wonderful start to an evening in expensive Chicago.
