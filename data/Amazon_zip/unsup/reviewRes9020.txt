So glad to find such a restaurant that serves legit Asian food and is NOT in Chinatown. That means greater services and much better ambiance, which make your dining experience holistically better Bamboos, mirrors, and wooden frames dotted the dining area while bamboo chopsticks are neatly placed on the ceramic place waiting to serve. It's a great night dining in the illusion of space and time. We ordered: Fresh Spring Roll: all materials are tastably fresh, but not very flavorful without the sauce Roasted Duck: best roasted duck I've had outside of Asia. This entree was downed in no time. Sliced beef sirloin with lettuce wrap: WARNING! this shares the same idea with a lettuce wrap appetizer. Beware what you order SIDE DISH- Grilled Eggplant! This is heavenly. It's nothing like the soggy grilled eggplant you get in Italian restaurants. This is legit thinly sliced small cut eggplants marinated with Asian spices, garlic and a kick of lemon. I would come back just for this dish, to be honest. Overall though, entree could be better. if you are craving for real Asian food, go to Argyle/ Chinatown. yet if you are willing to budge on taste and get compensated in ambiance, come to Le Colonial
