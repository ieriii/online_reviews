I've heard so many great things about TPP that I absolutely needed to try it before leaving Chicago. My friend and I spontaneously decided to dine here, since we both wanted to come here for the longest time. We were quoted an hour and fifteen minute wait, but were given a table after only 45 minutes. TPP has a huge menu and everything sounds so amazing that it's hard to choose, so we just ordered the three most popular dishes that the waiter recommended: bone marrow, fried pig ears, milk braised pork shoulder. I gotta give it to them, the bone marrow is quite good; I didn't like it initially, but it grew on me. The fried pig ears however arrived at our table lukewarm, were too salty and vinegary, and I just wasn't a fan of the texture. I didn't like the pork shoulder either, which is supposedly their iconic dish. It's basically mashed potatoes and gravy with pork, and it reminded me of Thanksgiving dinner. Everything we ordered (and everything else on the menu it seems) is extremely heavy and is pretty much just fancy man food: tons of fat, pork, and more fat. I was dying for a palette cleanser by then end of the meal, but they were out of their lemon panna cotta and everything else looked heavy. The prices were at least decent; the three dishes between the two of us after tax/tip was $20 per person. I can't help but compare this restaurant to Girl and the Goat (similar price range, entree size, tapas style, and cult following) and GATG wins hands down as the more delicate, creative option.
