This is a veggie mecca. Seriously, people worldwide should make pilgrimages to this place and set offerings from their CSAs at its doorstep. OK, no, it's not making bacon-infused caviar foam or whatever. It's not Alinea. It's just a diner with pretty delicious food, whether you are a vegetarian or not. The menu is lengthy and chock full of drool-worthy options. Fake meats abound, but if that's not your thing, they are easily avoided. Most have an option of dairy or soy. I had the enchilada with black beans, rice, tomatoes, peppers and a bunch of other stuff I can't recall. Dairy style, please - no soy cheeze for me, thanks. Others in my party had the reuben, the burger and chili fandango. Sighs of satisfaction rose from our table throughout the meal. The vegan milkshakes are delish. Not in a "this is so good for me, look at what a responsible individual I am" way. More like a "this is the creamiest, tastiest, gigantic-ist shake I've ever had, refill please!" way. Best $6 you will ever spend.
