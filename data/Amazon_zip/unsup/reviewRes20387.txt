I came here for lunch on a friend's recommendation during my recent trip to Chicago. My bf and I shared the elk poutine for an appetizer, which cannot be even compared to the Qubec poutine. Fries were from frozen and there were not enough cheese curds nor meat. Skip it and save your appetite. The soup and sandwich combos we both ordered however were fantastic. Soup was pea soup, which I would never normally order except it sounded heavenly with bacon, crab and crme fraiche. Delish! My sandwich was the Roasted Turkey Salad filled a creative combination of walnuts, grapes, red onion, thyme, mayo, avocado, iceburg lettuce and tomato on ciabatta. Probably one of the tastiest sandwiches I had ever eaten. Unfortunately I ended up in a serious food coma later that afternoon. Definitely one of the restaurants I'll be returning to when I take another trip to the city.
