After passing up a 2-hour wait here on a recent friday night, my boyfriend and I finally made it for dinner (on a much more reasonable monday.) I arrived first, straight after a looooooooooooong day at work, and decided to treat myself to a cocktail while I waited. The bartender, who was awesome, asked all kinds of questions about what I like in a drink, and he ended up picking a drink from the early 1900s. It was so delicious, and clearly something I'd never have ordered otherwise. I know this sort of bespoke cocktail making is very popular right now, but I'm not much of a drinker so I'd never experienced it before. Major, major props to this awesome bartender. Once my boyfriend arrived, we still had about a 25 minute wait at the bar. Not too bad. We were finally seated in the rear room, which was fine, though our table was kind weird. It was a two-top, but it was RIGHT NEXT to another two top, practically one table. When a couple on a first date came and basically joined us, it was hard not to be distracted. That's where my 1 point off comes from. Because, MAN, was this some good food. We had two starters-- meatballs and the pretzel with welsh rarebit. I could have eaten that cheese sauce with a spoon. For our mains, we had butternut squash risotto and the wild boar sloppy joes. The sandwich was excellent, but that risotto, WHOA. amazing. So good! and clearly, we're not even vegetarians or anything! mmmmmmmmm. We were so stuffed we couldn't even get the highly anticipated gruyere donuts, which I'd tipsily been calling cheese donuts all night. Oh well! We'll be back, for sure. But it'll be on a Monday.
