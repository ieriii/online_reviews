This is my current favorite place to eat in Chicago. To put it simply, the food is fairly cheap, and incredibly delicious. I always get the 5 whole wings (they're HUGE) in Sassy Seoul sauce with french fries. The whole wings are super crispy and the sauce is sooo good. If you eat inside, they have additional homemade sauces on the table to put on your fries.
