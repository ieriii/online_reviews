How this place only has 4 stars is beyond me, those folks must not have had the pork belly. I enjoyed the Oyster Sampler, Chicken Liver Pate, Pork Crepinette, Smoked Arctic Char, Pork Belly, Bouchot Mussels, and a Carmel Peanut Butter Pie. All I really have to say is everything was delicious and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not visit The Publican.
