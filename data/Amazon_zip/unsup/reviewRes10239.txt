To put it as bluntly as I can, Chicago has shit pizza. Unless you want deep dish, you're basically out of luck. Enter Piece. This is, hands down, the best thin crust (excuse me, "New Haven style") pizza I've had in Chicago. Thus far. Which might not be saying much, but trust me, this is good stuff. The crust is very thin, but also a bit chewy with some toasty burnt edges. Perfect. I recommend the white pie, which is simply brushed olive oil, garlic and mozzarella, with toppings to order. It's fantastic with a glass or three of their Dysfunctionale APA beer. And as a beer guy, this place brews great beer. I'd even go so far as to say that some of their brews beat out their stylistic counterparts over at Revolution Brewing. But take note: this place gets LOUD.
