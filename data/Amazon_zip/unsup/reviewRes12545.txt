I have been dying to go here so I finally find a friend to accompany me last week. My friend had the Veggie sandwich which came with banana chips and I had the Chicken Torta (hold the mayo) with banana chips (included in the price). Plus you get a little basket of complimentary thin sliced buttered french bread (yum!) It was good but the only bad experience I had were chasing the fruit flies away from my meal ..the thing is we're in the middle of a cold brutal winter so it didn't make sense.That was absolutely weird but maybe it was just not a good day.
