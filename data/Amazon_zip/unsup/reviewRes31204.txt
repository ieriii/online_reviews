If I'm in the Lakeview area, this place is one of the restaurants I'll attend (being a vegetarian makes this option easier). The negative: Many of the dishes are rather... not mouth-watering? It's not quite bland, but it isn't quite what I look for when paying the price that this food demands. Much of it just seems imitative of meals I could have eaten with much less hassle were I not vegetarian. That being said, I do love their gyros, but have found very few other dishes that I really find impressive or of note. The positive: The wait staff has always been extremely polite, conversational, and friendly. Their shakes? Delicious! The desserts? I highly, highly recommend the raw vegan cheesecakes. In fact, I have yet to have a dessert here I did not like. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time unless going during an off-peak hour, as the place has been quite packed most times I've gone.
