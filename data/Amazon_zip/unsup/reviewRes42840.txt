I hate to review this and risk turning people on to it where it looses its charm, but Gilt Bar's new downstairs cocktail lounge, Curio, is amazing. They bring back the "gentlemen's" drinks of yesteryear and make them cool again. The atmosphere is chill and quaint, with a max capacity of maybe 40 people behind the dark velvet curtain. Don't go here looking to drink Jack and Coke all night and expect a hook up, go to Barleycorn for that. The drink prices are in line with the neighborhood, plus most drinks on the menu are pure alcohol, well worth the $12 price tag. Amazing waitress, can recite the menu drink by drink, know every ingredient in each, and explain what is what. There must be something in the basement air at Curio, as I also noticed couples going at it in the faint yellow-orange hue darkness. So for a good make out session :-P, and a great drink, head on down to Curio in River North, Cheers!!
