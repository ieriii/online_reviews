A top Chicago experience in my opinion. Is it the food, possibly...is it the beer, possibly. The reason this restaurant tops many others is the environment and the combination of food and beer. The food is incredibly unique, like the CB & J sandwich, which I highly recommend for a lunch. The beer selection, although pricey, is one of the best you'll find in Chicago. All in all the quality makes this place unique and well worth the price of admission. The neighborhood surrounding it is also very clean and friendly.
