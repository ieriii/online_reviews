I took my wife here for her birthday a few weeks ago and we had a great time overall. Geja's Cafe has great fondue, the meats very plentiful and the sweets were filling. Our waiter was great, had a hard time understanding him a little bit but he was nice through out the night. Now if you're wondering why I only gave 3 stars besides 5, I will let you know now. When making the reservation over the phone, I told the man that I would prefer a booth and his simple answer was I can't guarantee that. I said no problem but please try to make it happen. I even called the night before to confirm and all was good. When we arrived, the reservation was no where to be found. Manager was present along with the host...and still could not be found. I was pretty annoyed to say the least. They finally said they would take care of us and after waiting almost 1 hr and 30 minutes we were seated. We were not offered the bar or even shown where it was in the meantime, which didn't flow well with me. All in all, the food made up for the mistakes of the staff and wait.
