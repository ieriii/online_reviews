This sadly is a case of the food was good, but the service was NOT.We arrived at the restaurant and received no direction on how to sit or contact a hostess and basically stood there lost along with a horde of other customers at what we thought was the hostess station. Turns out they don't even use it. You have to wander some 10 feet back to get your name on the list and people kept cutting in front of us due to the lack of order. Rude.We were then placed at a table devoid of any condiments and place settings. After we were seated the couple behind in line were seated next to us. Although we were seated first, their order was taken before ours. Rude.We ordered the Fried Wontons for an appetizer. These were not that great compared to other restaurants we have been to. For our entree, we ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken, which was REALLY good and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. Sadly we do not know how that tastes as that dish was never brought to us and nobody seemed to be able to address our problem. The sweet and sour chicken was brought out first and it sat there because we had no rice to eat it with. They never brought us our BBQ Pork fried rice and we ended up paying for it and taking it home. Rude.The service was the WORST I've ever seen at a sit down restaurant. The restaurant seems fully capable of providing for the needs of all their customers, but it seems as if they could care less about us. There was no greeting by the person who took our order and no "excuse me" as the several other random servers shoved the food in front of us. They were hasty to give us our check without asking how our meal had been and whether or not we had received all our food. When we were ready to pay, NOBODY was there to take our check. Rude.All in all this was a terrible dine in experience. Only eat here if you have the patience of Mother Theresa. Good luck.
