Longman & Eagle is all about pig and whiskey. 1. Don't go there if you want well bourbon. 2. Don't set foot in the door if you are a vegetarian. 3. Don't give a Yelp review of Longman & Eagle if "the place was okay, but I don't really like whiskey, and I'm a vegetarian." I, however, am a fan of both the swine AND the bourbon. And, now I'm a HUGE fan of Longman & Eagle. Despite the overly hip clientele, I will go back for more food. The bar would be the perfect place to drain some rye and pork snacks. In addition to shots and flights, we ordered the pork head appetizer, sweetbreads, wild boar sloppy joe, pork belly and beet salad. The pork belly was excellent. The appetizer and sweetbreads were small but delicious. The beet salad was okay. (Too much pork, too little beet.) The only thing that I could have done without was the wild boar sloppy joe... and that's just because everything else was so good.
