What started out as a tragedy turned into a fine meal and story. My family went to Caf 28, its one of our local joints, on a Friday night, had a mojito each in the bar while waiting for a seat outside on the patio. We were told there was a large party in one of the dining rooms but we could wait a few minutes for the patio and we should be fine. It was a beautiful night and we were promptly seated. After being seated at about 6:00 (yes, we eat early) we waited a couple minutes for menus and water but attributed it to the large party indoors. We were quick to order once we received them because I always get the jalapeno pork chops and my son got the duck breast so we could swap. Wife got the steak and my daughter, the vegie quesadillas couldn't have been more than 6:10. By 6:30 when we hadn't even received bread for the table we flagged down our waiter and he said our food was on its way. By 6:45 we asked to see the manager, who came to the table and apologized and by 7:00 our food finally arrived. We had stern conversation with the manager, expressing our dissatisfaction, he agreed. Once we ate the food however, all ill feelings were lost (almost ) the pork chops were tender and delicious, the duck was rubbed with spice chile and wonderful. My wife's steak was juicy and tasty and the additional mojito's washed it all down well. We were expecting at least our drinks to be comped but the manager did a real solid by us and comped the entire bill. It was an unexpected surprise but he did the right thing. We will continue to go back and enjoy the excellent food and he'll make it up on us ten times over. -Satisfied customer
