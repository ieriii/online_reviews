I love this restaurant. Its not only has fantastic food, but the ambiance sooths and transports me. The candle lit upstairs lounge is also very romantic. Its a great date spot. The bamboo fans and leafy green plants makes me think of Casablanca every time. I believe it is reasonably priced. Le Colonial is a place that will impress a date or a client. The Banh Uot and Ga Xao Xa Ot are two favorite dishes of ours. I have never been disappointed. A true gem.
