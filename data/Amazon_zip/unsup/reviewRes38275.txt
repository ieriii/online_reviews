Likes: CBJ sandwich Great beer selection Frites Cabbage salad Atmosphere (cozy) Dislikes: Poor service. Inexperienced, sometimes unfriendly hostess. It may have been the waitress' and hostess' first job in the restaurant industry 1 hour wait=2 hour wait, with no mention that the wait may be longer than initially anticipated. Almost got trapped in the bathroom stall with their industrial-type door latch. Needed WD-40 to get out.
