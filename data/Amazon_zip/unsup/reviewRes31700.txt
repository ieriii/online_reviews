We tried Nana today, for breakfast. When I first walked in, I was totally impressed with the decor of the restrauant. The only thing that I was taken back was the music, it was a little to loud and we could hear the coffee grinder. The combination of the sound was loud. Though after sitting there, you just adjusted to it. The service was great, very attentive.  The menu is a step above then your regular breakfast menu.  We enjoyed everything.  Would I go back, Yes! This place is great, Bridgeport does not have any place like this, and I hope it sticks around.
