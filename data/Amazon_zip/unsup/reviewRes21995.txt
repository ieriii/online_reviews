When you get that phone call from Chicago and they mention Superdawg...ugh I can almost taste the dawg! from the pickled tomato, to the fries that are slightly over cooked this, drive in joint...ROCKS! and I mean that, we sat there one day and watched as cars from all over Illinois came with their owners to get their fix as well. Something special about the soft bread and the meat with the obnoxious green relish that makes me wish I was in Chi-town right now. Oh plus it is 125 degrees outside in Austin...ha, man I want a Dawg, FEDEX me one Chi-town folks!!
