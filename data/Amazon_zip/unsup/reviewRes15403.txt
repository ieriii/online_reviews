Came here for my girls Birthday. Greeted by a friendly and quick employee we were seated immediately. Awesome chairs and booth space where everyone can see and talk to each other. Our waiter was attentive and was knowledgeable with suggestions. I am a Vodka fan and the 3 drinks I had were all stupendous. The boyfriend is a fan of Manhattans and he really enjoyed his as well. Very reasonably priced and great atmosphere, it was dark but I guess everyone looks better in the dark!
