Finally had a chance to try Piccolo Sogno on a beautiful evening with clear skys and perfect temperatures. The outdoor seating was fanatastic with flowering trees and enough room to feel really comfortable. It took a while to get out there (1 hour) but not too bad on a great night with out reservations. It is one of the nicest outdoor dining areas I have ever been to. Somewhat busy but roomy enough to relax and have a comforatble private conversation. The food was excellent, we had the mushroom risotto and the wraped pork tenderloins. Both were great but the pork was the tastiest I may have ever had. I could have used one more tenderloin but not really complaining. The risotto portion was very large and filling. The wait staff was fantastic to us. They were patient and went out their way to explain the dishes and help with a wine selection. Overall a wonderfull experience, I'm looking forward to going back .
