This is not SSGS's fault. But someone must have made some secret announcement I don't know of. On the times I've been here, there has ALWAYS been a super loud obnoxious group messing it up for other patrons here. I couldn't even hear my bf or friend across the table without screaming. Even the waiters here look annoyed when this happens. But.... i dunno. I also come here when it's the middle of the night too. Drunkies. Not that it's bad, just that there are bars for that. I typically don't expect asian restaurants to be loud and obscene. But.. on to food. The greatest highlight of this place is that they give you easily 18-20 banchan plates. IF anyone in your party isn't familiar with Korean BBQ, there's bound to be a hit amongst other possible misses. I also have to say-- I like the banchan plates served here than in other BBQ joints. They serve several different kimchi plates and a good variety of other things too to mix it up, or break up the pickled veggie flavors. For meat, I've tried both the bulgogi and kalbi. The marinated kalbi is a total win. Great flavors, Great thickness, and SOOOOO yummy. I crave this place often. While their banchan plates vary from day to day, it's ability to satisfy my hunger has never failed. Just come dressed in clothes you don't mind smelling like charcoal. =)
