I came here with friends on a Monday night- the place was packed! It's a very laid back, beer, pizza and sports place, fun to visit. It was very loud, so not the best to catch up with friends though. They check your ID as soon as you enter, so I'm guessing not a family place. Now I am always a deep-dish girl, but I really enjoyed their thin crust. You have three options for thin crust- regular with sauce and mozzarella, red with sauce and Parmesan shavings, and white, with no sauce, olive oil, garlic, and mozzarella. Get the white- it's amazing! We got a large white with pepperoni, half olives and peppers. It came fairly quickly, and out on one of the largest asking sheets I've ever seen. Besides pizza, they are known for their beer. I'm not a beer person, but had their framboise which was good. Not too expensive, and our server was good too. It's a long way from home for me, but I'd go back again if I was in the area.
