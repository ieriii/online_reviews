I like Carnivale. I have been a couple times and think the place has really good food. The decor and feel of the restaurant is nice. It is a big restaurant though, and so does not have an intimate feel. I think this is a good place for going out with a group of friends. I would highly recommend their ceviches and their mojitos. The mojitos were very very good. I would suggest this place if you want good Latin food in a more upscale setting. I would also suggest going on an evening when they have dancing.
