I can't believe it, but I don't think I've ever been to a Vietnamese place. They won my heart, though, as soon as they seated us at a great table by the window and served me my perfectly crafted martini. We came in for restaurant week and started with the Cha Gio (spring rolls) and the Goi Cuon (salad rolls). The spring rolls were heavenly. Rich and delicious and served with cilantro, pickled carrots and lettuce. The salad rolls were light and refreshing, although a little heavy on the mint...for me anyway. For the main course, we went with the Bo Sate and the Ca Nuang. The Bo Sate was filet mignon in a nicely spiced sate sauce. It was good. The Ca Nuang was comprised of a perfectly char grilled fillet of salmon with vermicelli noodles and a light salad. I'm not usually a big fan of salmon, but I loved the preparation. If only I could do it myself at home... The service was attentive and friendly and I definitely think that the atmosphere, service and fresh cuts of meat and fish make this place. Otherwise, I feel like you could do just about as good on Argyle.
