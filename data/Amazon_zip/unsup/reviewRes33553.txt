A bit noisy, music too loud and it is very packed which can be a good or bad thing. The food was very good but it is not your "typical" Italian food place so if you are expecting "meat lasagna" go somewhere else.  I will say that I loved the food and the service was very good but the cramped seating (as noted by another reviewer) and the noise level made it for a rather unpleasant full dining experience. It does not help that the bar is right in the middle of the dining room.  Because it is near Wrigley I would suggest avoiding it near a cubs game. People come in dressed shabby and usually drunk. If the restaurant was in a quieter location and was not so uncomfortable I would have given it 4 stars as I did like the food.
