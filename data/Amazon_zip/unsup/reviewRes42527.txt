Maybe I ordered on an off night, maybe this type of pizza just isn't my cup of tea. To those that love The Art of Pizza, please don't bite my head off, just hear me out. I was so pumped to try this place...I love pizza (check out my "list" of pizza joints to try here in Chicago.) This place just didn't deliver for me; maybe it just wasn't what I was expecting. We ordered on a Monday night and I spoke to a very helpful person on the phone. I asked a few questions and ended up ordering the Art's special which is sausage, onion, mushroom and green pepper. I was pretty excited because in my opinion that combo on a pizza truly is Art. Our order arrived in about an hour...time to eat! I tore into my pizza like I had never eaten before. Wait...I am not a fan of this cheese, or the sausage...or the crust. And it's not that the pizza is not good, it just isn't amazing (in my opinion). Now with all of this said, I plan on trying the Art of pizza again. I refuse to believe that all of you Art of Pizza lovers are wrong. I am convinced that it was just an off day, we all have that right? Well, we shall see. Until next time.
