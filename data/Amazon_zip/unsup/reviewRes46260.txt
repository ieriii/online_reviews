NIce decor but thats pretty much it. The food sucks. Went there for lunch so portions were smaller and the prices reasonable. Had a berry fizz which was the best part of the meal. Had the chicken parmessan and it was not good at all. Super greasy and its not good at all. I think my local diner has better food than here. 1st and last time here. Service just ok. We were seated immediately so they get a star for that. We were seated at the windows overlooking Michigan Avenue so that was nice. With so many better places around seriously just save your money.
