We placed dozens of calls in order to get the reservation. The night before we got a call telling us the chef was hungover, not able to accommodate our reservation. We get a new date on the books, show up to a broken down store front with bent blinds and cracked glass, no host, loud music . . . just some guy pointing to a table. But that guy does apologize for our trouble, give us a great deal and is generally pleasant the whole evening. They even gave us a nice discount on our meal. And I can't stop thinking about that meal. That was special.  So I am realizing I am just repeating all the rest of the reviews. If you can get a reservation and if they actually honor the reservation, you will never forget the food which is extraordinary. If I wrote this review moments after they canceled, probably would give 2 stars. But somehow I now just think it is quirky, almost growing respect for the brothers . . . they are doing it their way. It's up to us to decide to deal with it or go elsewhere. I'll deal.
