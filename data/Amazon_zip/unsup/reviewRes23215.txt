This has been one of my favorite finds in town. The unassuming outside leads to a lively little interior with vibrant decor and upbeat Middle Eastern music playing in the background. The crepes are unlike any I've ever had. Complex, inventive and absolutely delicious!  The Iberica and Chicago savory crepes tantalized our tastebuds with perfectly balanced fruity, savory, crunchy, and creamy flavors. Side soups with zaatar bread were nice too as was the side of Merguez sausage. The crepe fillings are delicious and quite substantial, almost too much for the delicate crepe to handle. I thought the crepes could easily have been turned into burritos. The Icosium dessert crepe, a fruit compote with orange blossom totally rocked and was my favorite by far. I would come back for that alone!  Staff was very nice and accomodating to us and our 7 month old. I'll be back soon to sample more crepes and to try the Algerian coffee.
