Food is delicious, wonderfully seasoned. I want some right now. BUT I will never go back (to this location) due to their management. I bought a gift certificate on http://restaurant.com after having such a wonderful first experience. We walk in and ask the host if they will take the gift certif, just to make sure. He's not sure, so he calls the manager over. The manager looks at the paper, honestly looks us up and down, then says "no, we won't take this." WTF!!! Seriously??  We are a young, pretty good looking couple if I do say so myself. We have good jobs. "I have money to spend in here!" Totally NOT cool. We were dressed in jeans and nice tops. The restaurant was less than half empty, oh well, we spent our money elsewhere. And I spread the word about our awful experience there whenever I can.
