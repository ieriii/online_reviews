I have only lived in Chicago for 4 weeks and have been there twice. I dream and think about this mouth watering fresh food!! It is a great restaurant. The food is out of this world, always get appetizers and split, because you really don't want to miss out on anything! The scallop and lime salad is amazing and the beignats are great too!! The cocktails are great too especially the Lychee martini! Great great food. The atmosphere is perfect, I prefer to sit upstairs because its more exclusive and only light by candlelight. I go around 9:00pm , its just on of those places you go kind of later. My fav in chi town!
