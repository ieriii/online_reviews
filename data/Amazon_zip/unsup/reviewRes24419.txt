I don't think there is any city in the US that can compare with Chicago on the concentration of tapas-style restaurant.  Mercat a la Planxa is one of the last Chicago restaurants I visited before relocating out of the mid-west. I made the mistake of reading the dinner menu before heading out there for lunch, so I was a little disappointed with the offerings. However, the chef was kind enough to let us order a few items off the dinner menu. The waiter was also very patient. He went back to the kitchen a few times to check with the chef on our special requests. They deserve extra points on the service front. The dishes we ordered off the dinner menu are Jamon iberico, and bacon wrapped dates. The Jamon iberico didn't quite measure up against my experience at De Rosa in Paris, but it certainly had the hint of fruitiness. The bacon was overcooked and slightly burnt on the dates. There seems to be a debate on whether the bacon wrapped dates here are better or worse than the chorizo stuffed dates from AVEC. For me, the AVEC version is still the winner hands down. I wouldn't mind coming back for dinner, but the lunch items we ordered weren't too impressive. Well, the black angus hanger steak wasn't too bad.
