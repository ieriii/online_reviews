The reason I chose this particular place on this particular evening was because I wanted to sit outside. My friend and I stood for about fifteen minutes on the periphery of the outdoor patio waiting for a table. I'd have had no problem with this had there not been about nine empty two-tops. My friend, a Logan Square resident, seemed to think nothing wrong with our standing around and receiving unhelpful glances and stolid expressions from the waitresses and bussers who passed. He said this was the custom: since the kitchen is so small, they parcel out the tables gradually. To this I say, Bullshit. I didn't even go there to eat. I wanted drinks. I could have had (and paid for) two or three in the time they kept us standing there doing nothing. Finally a hostess presented the option of the neighboring beer garden. Beer, whiskey, no by-the-glass wine, but okay. The problem? Cash only. What a nuisance. We got seated, had food and drink, but I couldn't shake my annoyance with how we'd begun. Maybe the hipster locals think the convenience of the staff and kitchen comes first, but I don't go for that. Cheap whiskey and so-so affordable bar bites are, sadly, not enough of an incentive for me to set aside the services and courtesies that restaurants are typically expected to provide their patrons, and in other, less cultish parts of town, taken exception with for not providing.
