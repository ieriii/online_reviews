I like to hit Chicago once in awhile, this place is in the perfect location.....located in the middle of everything.....Victoria Secrets and Tiffany's nearby....(it's always a happy day at Tiffany's or whatever that movie quote is right). I love the location, great bars, restaurants and shopping await....just a couple bucks cabride from Union Station (I take the Hiawatha down from Milwaukee) and you are there....excellent service, old school feel. The rooms are nicely appointed and yes the Hotel is an old landmark but very nicely done.....I have stayed on two different occasions and will definately come back......if you give them your e-mail they will send you deals once in awhile. It is somewhat pricey like all Chicago hotels located in this key area.
