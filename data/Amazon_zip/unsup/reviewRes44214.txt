I took my mother here for a "make-up" Mother's day. She is a huge sushi fan which is in contrast to myself who is new to the sushi scene but absolutely in love with Ping Pong, Wakamono's sister restaurant. We started off sharing a bowl of the Jalapeno Miso Soup and the House Salad with Ginger Dressing (a staple of all good Japanese restaurants, if you ask me). For $2, the soup is a steal! There was more than enough to share (for an appetizer) and it had just the right amount of kick. Their house salad was simple but had a great ginger dressing, also with a little more kick than I am used to but delicious none the less. Since I am new to sushi, my mother and I ordered the sampler plate which comes with a variety of 4 maki (of the chef's choice) with a total of 24 pieces. Our sampler included a tuna roll, a California roll, an unagi asparagus roll and a spicy tuna roll. All rolls were great. To top off our meal, we ordered the Godzilla roll because of all the wonderful reviews I had read. It was also great and presented beautifully, better than any sushi I have ever seen. We dined in on a Tuesday. There was no wait for a table of 2 and the service was attentive for the most part. The music was a bit loud which my mother (of course) commented on which prompted the server to kindly turn it down for her. For two people, our bill was just under $50 which is perfect for such an enjoyable meal. I would definitely go back to try more of their "contemporary" rolls. Go to Wakamono at least once. It is a great (relaxing) experience and worth the time and money.
