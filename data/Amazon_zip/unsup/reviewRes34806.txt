Sushi X is awesome. I went there with my girlfriend Saturday night. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's BYOB. The on-street parking is a little tricky, but metered parking isn't too hard to find - just don't get hit by some crazy rice-rocket like we almost did. The atmosphere was nice, it struck me as a very New York vibe: nondescript entryway, dark blue walls, warehouse space, screen playing video clips. I like this neighborhood for this very reason: it's very urban but not ultra-trendy (yet at least). But I digress. First, the Miso Soup is delicious and cheap ($2 - but they ended up not us at all for them!). For the main course, We ordered the Spicy Tuna, the Unagi, and the Godzilla rolls. They were all good, but the Godzilla was simply incredible. The presentation (for what its worth) was excellent, on par with Indie Cafe. The spicy mayo/soy-type sauce that was poured artfully over the whole tray was so good! For dessert, we had the mochi ice cream. They were all decent and the waiter gave us extra free of charge. I must comment on the service: outstanding. We were well attended to in every way and even though we were first-timers, they made us feel like regulars. Plus not charging for the soup was, to me, a great way to get repeat customers - by making us feel like the waiter was taking care of us. There was this ridiculous drunk rich lady and her husband next to us who kept pointing at our food and loudly saying she wanted it. She also dropped her menu near us and kept saying really odd things about the restaurant.  In conclusion, if you like sushi, especially if you're a rich drunk bottle-blonde, you'll love Sushi X.
