Holy cow! If I could give this place more stars, I would. I stumbled across this pizza a few months ago. My friend was touting it as "world famous". I've lived here my whole life and had never heard of it that I could recall. Bottom line: It is a pan pizza with a ring of caramelized cheese [parmesan?] around the edges making this pizza really jump out and grab your tastebuds by the balls and yell, "EAT ME!!!!" I love Chicago pizzas like the thick crust at Aroma [off Broadway], and the pan and stuffed varieties from Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, Giordanno's and Connies. Pequod's is now my ultimate favorite! Thar she blows... speaking of the service, that is.
