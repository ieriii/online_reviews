I couldn't wait to try this place out, as it's one of my snowboarding friend's fav restaurants. I can see why it's such a big hit! 12: dollars a watermelon mint martini costs. Our charming waiter gave me the disclaimer that this concoction could get overwhelming for the palate, with its cucumber, watermelon, and mint components. It was refreshing, but I wouldn't order it again. 4: hours we spent at this fabulous establishment dining, conversing, and dining more. 11: rating on a scale of 1-10 that I would give the chipotle chocolate ice cream palate cleanser. Usually, you expect a sorbet or something light and refreshing, right? This was ingenious. I like how Zed rolls. 13: roughly the number of meats we had brought to us on skewers. My favs were the seasoned rump roast and amaretto and pistachio duck breast. 1.5: number of times I went up to the "harvest" tables to get my appetite roaring before our meatfest. The plethora of cheeses, cold cuts, and salads will have you feelin' like one jolly Pilgrim. Go for the red wine poached pears, goat gouda, and caprese salad! Dessert: not a number, but don't pass up on it! Butterscotch bread pudding and chocolate mousse, what what!
