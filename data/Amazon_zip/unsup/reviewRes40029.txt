Flour-less Chocolate cake with Bacon Ice Cream and a Cherry Sauce. AMAZING!!!! When my dinner companion cut into my cake before I had a chance to and said wow that really taste just like bacon I was a little afraid but once I bit into it I could taste how everything went so well together. It was sooooo gooood..... Overall out dinner was excellent from the service to the drinks to every plate that hit the table. We had the artisianal cheese delicious! I had the foie gras which I can never get enough of. My dinner companion had the duck fries which of course I also tried two thumbs up. Then he had the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe and I had the Sturgeon. I don't know what kind of sausage was under the fish but it was terrific along with the potatoes and the greens oh it was all so good. You already know what I had for dessert but my friend had the balsamic strawberry short cake and he's just lucky that my dessert was so go because I would have helped him finished his if I wasn't so focused on my own. Can't wait to go for brunch, lunch and again for dinner. Oh go early if you want to be seated quickly we got there around 6:30 and sat inside I don't like to sweat while I eat and it was hot out yesterday. We got seated right away!
