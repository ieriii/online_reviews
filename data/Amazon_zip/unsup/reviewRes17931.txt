if it werent for the craptacular tunes this place would have easily gotten 5 stars from me (case in point...who turns down janis joplin and turns up meatloaf??!) now then...A+ arrangement & menu (props to any place that places a description of their drinks on the menu) i luv the freaky fun artwork and ample seating with several spots to choose from for whatever suits ur mood at that time (bar/window space/tables up front and in back) the beer list is amazing and im not joking when i say it took me 15min to decide exactly what i was gonna order...mixed drink list is unique and creatively named/described prices are right on (maybe even dare i say cheaper than some other bars) food looked smelled yummy...u can bet ill be back for another round :)
