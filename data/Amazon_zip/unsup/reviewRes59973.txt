I think I just had the best meal of my life. It's Sunday night and I walked in pretty late. The host sat me on the patio and was super sweet. No one rushed me or said the kitchen was closing, even though it was 9pm. My server, Matt, guided me through the menu so I got exactly what I needed. He was very knowledgable and cute! Try the green bean salad and the burger! It's to die for. And the Brunch Menu looks Fab. I'll be back for sure.
