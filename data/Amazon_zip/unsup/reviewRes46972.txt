Girls' brunch out! So after standing in the cold for about an hour watching a football game I didn't understand, I was rewarded by sitting next to the fireplace while waiting for a table for 7. The wait was about an hour, which is fine for a large table for Sunday Brunch with no reservations. Had a bloody mary while waiting, pretty delish...but could have used a bit more of a spicy kick to it. Service was great. Had a cup of coffee....ok 3...and I'm still suffering from the jitters an hour later...great coffee....so strong. Ordered the lamb benedict which was a special...only for $12. I was so excited...I really was in the mood for sausage but this caught my attention. The benedict came out, served with mushrooms, onions, and a side of potatoes. It was good...but the lamb wasn't what I expected...it was a little fatty and made me wish I had ordered sausage. Plus, it came out a little cold. Hash browns needed a lot of salt. Price wasn't too bad...so for coffee ($4ish a cup), my meal, a bloody mary, and tax + tip...I was only in a $30 hole. Will I be back? Probably not unless someone offers me a ride...it's too much cta for me to get out here, especially when winter is on its way in full force.
