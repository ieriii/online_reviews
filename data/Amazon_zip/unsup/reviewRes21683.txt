Good, solid food. I read a lot about the lines but didn't experience problems when I visited Xoco. Walked right in - got right in line. Ordered the Ahogada torta. I found the broth to be a bit spicy, but that's my own fault. The flavor was good, although I didn't find myself raving about it as much as others have online. The guac and chips were very good, as would be expected. The churros were amazing.  Drawbacks: the entire menu is pretty much tortas/sandwiches, so as long as you're ok with that, you should be fine. I also find the layout of the seating area to be a bit annoying. Only a couple tables and the rest bar-stool seating. Very limited space to walk around with greasy floors. Not the most comfortable place to be for more than 5 minutes.
