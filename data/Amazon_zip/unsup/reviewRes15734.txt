You walk in here & it's like BAM. COLOR COLOR COLOR! love it :) Anyways, I've been here several times w/ my boyfriend & friends and the food is always consistently good. The Ropa Vieja is delicious (but it can be a bit salty) & good to share. We've always tried the guacamole & flores y camarones. The guacamole is delicious and fresh, but it shouldn't be any less, right? The flores y camarones are just whatever. For dinner, we have tried Costilla de Res, which is a short rib. It is a VERY SWEET dish. I didn't really enjoy it fully, but I like to have a variety of flavors on my plate :) The meat was very tender though! The Arrachera is DELICIOUS! It's so simple (just skirt steak, rice, and onions) but it tastes so good. Tender meat & amazing rice. The Pollo was good as well (not excellent), but I really don't enjoy their pickled veggies. Definitely not a fan of those. The best part is the dessert. We had this chocolate cake w/ 3 different ice cream flavors with hot fudge poured over it. This cake is massive, so it's good to share it w/ others.
