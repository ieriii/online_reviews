I've stayed here twice now and would go back in a heartbeat. If I'm looking to save money in the city and still stay at a central place in a nice clean hotel, this is it. The rate was great (around $150 I think). The restaurant next door (Viand) is connected on the inside and you can bill your meal to the room. They also do a decent breakfast. It's close enough to go for a run on Lakeshore and close enough to shop on the MM. Great restaurants are all walk or short cab ride away. The room was exactly what you expect from Marriott and perhaps a little nice than some Courtyards I've stayed at in non-urban areas. Always check here before you book a room in the city.
