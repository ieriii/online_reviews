I visited this place based on Yelp reviews, and because it's only a couple miles from my apartment. It wasn't bad, but I can't say that I've found THE Mexican place I will always visit without fail. As I saw mentioned in another review, the service wasn't the fastest, but we weren't ever really waiting for anything, either. The quesadillas looked more like tacos than what I was expecting (and different from what I've had at other Mexican restaurants), but that's ok. The other person in my party ordered chicken fajitas, which was HUGE, with lots of veggies (always a good thing). He also liked the guacomole a lot, and I thought the rice and beans were good. Would I go again? Yes, but I've got a few more Mexican places to check out first.
