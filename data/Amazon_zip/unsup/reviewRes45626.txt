Its a very unpretentious place to meet eat and drink;) We sat at the bar for a minute while they got a table for us, because we went during prime time Saturday night, because most places needed a reservation or had crazy waits. So 5-10 minutes seemed like a gift. The bartender helped me pick out a beer and actually let me sample it before I ordered it. I am now a fan of Afligem Blond Ale;)  The atmosphere was busy, but not overwhelming. Towards the middle and back it was more cozy with booths and library areas to chill in and there are two bars so I am assuming it might get a little busier in later in the evening.  The menu has a lot of options for restaurant style food and bar grub. We opted for some real meals. My boyfriend got the steak that was on special which was excellently cooked and came with some awesome mashed potatoes that were not boxed which you often can find at a bar, but instead they had a hint of lemon butter flavor;) I had the Pork Chop which is on the regular dinner menu and it was excellent with the potatoes it came with. Both of us were that sick couple eating off one another's plates, but we were thoroughly enjoying the food and drinks. OH and we started out with the Potato Pie "Rissoles" which we were more curious than excited about, because we're like appetizer connoisseurs... but oh my goodness its like french frie meets an onion ring in a blissful tasty bite;) They also came with two great sauces that made it all the better. If that's all we had we woulda been happy, but we genuinely had a nice time and already discussed other things we wanted to try on the menu NEXT time. And next time I want to sit in the big comfy chairs by the books if we get there early enough;)
