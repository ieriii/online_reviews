The location of the hotel is the major selling point for this hotel (which gets a plus one star) Located right on Michigan Ave which has a lot of restaurants and shopping. It also is several blocks away from the Chicago Art Institute (I walk fast so if you walk slow or don't like walking take a cab). The staff is very friendly and courteous. The views from your room on the top floors are pretty cool (request that if you are staying). The lobby has a bar right there which serve excellent strawberry mojito ($15). They have a lot of elevators but can still be an issue during peak times (7:30 AM and 5:30 PM) with it running slow or filled with people. The rooms are not as large as most standard Marriotts but that is usually expected for hotels within a city. They had water issues where they didn't have very hot water or if you are taking a shower the water would get cold then when you turn it up suddenly it's gets scalding. Despite some annoyances it's a nice stay.
