My first time at Xoco (finally) and Rick Bayless was walking through the restaurant. Made the trip! People in the restaurant were so excited to see him and he was smiling and looked excited to be there. My husband and I went for dinner on a Friday after work. There was no wait to sit inside (there was a short wait for outside). We ordered and were seated in less than 10 mins. We started with chips and guacamole. I agree with the comments as to the size of the guacamole portion but for $4.00 it somewhat makes sense (avocados are expensive). However, my one gripe about the whole place is that they did not have salsa on the table. I guess you have to order an extra side which seems odd for a Mexican restaurant considering its salsa, the one thing that should be complimentary. I guess we are talking Rick Bayless salsa, so again, it may make sense. My husband and I each had tortas. The portions were huge!!! Way too big!! I had the Milanesa (breaded chicken) and it was amazing. There was some sort of avocado cream salsa with poblano peppers. It was nice and spicy. My husband had the Cuban (pork and bacon) and to me it had way too much bacon (Wait, is that possible). The bacon kinda stole the show for me. He thought it was fine but did comment that mine had better flavors. We finished with just one churro bc we read they were to die for. It was hot and tasty .. super good but I am glad we only got one because we were stuffed. I am docking one star because of the lack of extra salsa on the table and the prices. Ok, the prices are not horrible for this type of gourmet street food but there is something about going for chips and tortas and spending $40.00 that seems wrong to me. Will that stop me from going back: no way!
