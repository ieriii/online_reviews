Glenn's used to be our FAVORITE place to grab a nice lunch. Today is the first time we've been back in over a year since our previous not so great experience. Every experience can't be stellar and I understand that. Unfortunately, this place has gone down hill. Service is rotten, and the food is mediocre at best. HUGE disappointment. I ordered the blackened barramundi, which had nice flavor but was overcooked and mushy. The broccoli was also overcooked, mushy and cold. My dining companion ordered the ribeye. They covered the steak in at least a cup of fresh diced tomato and onion. After finally scrapping the 'salad' off of the top she discovered that her steak was tiny. The price per portion is not worth it. When we told the server about our issues with the meal he let us know that he would inform the kitchen. When he returned he returned with our check he said "I hope you girls' day gets better". No apology from the kitchen, no adjustment on our check. I'm not sure what happened to this place, but I will not be returning.
