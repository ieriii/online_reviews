The best tapas restaurant in Chicago! This restaurant is friendly to both vegetarians and non-friendly. I love eating the crunchy pistachio together with the sweet beets and soft cream. The peppers were colorful and the spice was brought out by the garlic. Finally, I had the best cauliflower dish in Chicago at Purple Pig. Most restaurants cooked cauliflowers with cheese, but Purple Pig cooked two types of cauliflower with salt, which brought out the freshness of the vegetable. I heard that the fried eggplant is also great at Purple Pig, and would love to try that next time. My friends also mentioned the amazing flavor and texture of the bone marrow and the pork cheek. Although the food at Purple Pig and Girl and the Goat are very similar, I like the food at the former more, since the quality is more consistent. I love the food and the service of Purple Pig, and would definitely come back with friends. Food: 5 Service: 5 Decor: 4
