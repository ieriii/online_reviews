Found out The Bad Apple was voted Best Burger last year by Metromix... so we thought we'd see if they were up to their title! We loved it! Nice crowd and little wait to get seated. Our waitress knew every single beer on the menu... and there are hundreds (impressive). The drink/beer list blew our minds! Such a wide variety- they get an A+! The cheese curds are dynamyte and the homemade dressings/sauces/ketchups are great (don't listen to the reviews about the ketchup- people just like to complain when things are different from the norm). The Elvis burger rocks! Another kudo's to the artwork in the place as well- super cool. Only negatives are the cheese on the burgers is nill- make a bigger slice please! And the bathrooms suck (one bathroom for her/him) tell your current hostess to take a dump at home next time- disgusting, I went in right after her-ugh! Bottom line: We will be back again and again- great job!
