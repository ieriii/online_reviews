I am always amazed that Nuevo Leon has such a strong following. As a lifelong Mexican Food aficionado, IMHO the food at NL is not just bad, it is horrible. There are no redeeming qualities to this restaurant. I believe that it is successful because many are unfamiliar with real mexican food and/or have such low expectations of mexican restaurants. Every couple of years, I am compelled to give Nuevo Leon another try because so many folks rave about the place. Yet, on my last visit, a bland tasteless salsa was brought out (we even witnessed salsa, after a customer left, being put back by the waiter into a large bowl, only to be scooped up again to be served anew; yuck!), the chips were soggy, greasy and tasteless, and there was an energizer battery in the soup (yes, this happened to us!). No apologies for having a lithium battery in the soup. The only explanation was that the cooks are a playful bunch and like to prank each other. It is a wholly unsannitary and tasteless experience. There is no charm to roaches, rats, spotty service, tasteless food, unsanittary conditions and, on top of that, long lines. Never again!
