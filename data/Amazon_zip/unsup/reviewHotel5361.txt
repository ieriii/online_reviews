Good place to stay. We took the metro from o hare to our hotel, but had to transfer to the red from the blue.....a little metro talk for you. the staff was super friendly and aimed to please. Drawback was my wife and I went on the hottest week of the year and the room really struggled to keep cool. Not to mention we were on the top floor, and heat rises. We had a constant temp of 76 degrees....now that wasn't too bad compared to the face melting 103 outside temp. So I can't put much blame on the hotel. The location was great and centrally located to anything you wanted. Like most big cities, you mostly wall or sell your unborn child for all the cab fare you'll rack up. We would stay here again no problem, and the area was clean and trash free. Thanks and come again
