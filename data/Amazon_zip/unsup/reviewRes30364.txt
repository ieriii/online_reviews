I eat here on a pretty regular basis. My favorites are the Firehouse Wrap and the Gyros. The Buddha Burger is phenomenal also. As a longtime plant based eater I find a lot of comfort at the Chicago Diner and get a lot of great ideas for recipes I can make at home. The service is always fantastic, it gets crowded at times, but that's to be expected at any restaurant. The food is fresh, everyone's friendly, and the price is right. Been there at least 25 times and never had a bad experience! I'll be back soon for sure! Thanks Chicago Diner!!! Edit: Wow, this was the 1000th review! Really shows how outstanding this restaurant is!!
