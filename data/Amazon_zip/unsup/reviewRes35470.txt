Sun Wah Bar-B-Que has a lot of the classics with regional touches at are sure to please. When you walk in, the odor of fried poultry is a bit overwhelming, but after taking a seat and looking at the menu, that thought quickly vanishes. Duck seems to be their specialty as there are many preparations for it. I had the duck fried rice and I see why. There seems to be many items in the menu that required great though and execution, but some seemed to slip through the cracks. I'm not saying their eggrolls come in frozen, but I'm not not saying that, if you know what I mean. Also, when ordering a fried appetizer, whether it be and eggrolls or not, should be served with some type of sauce for dipping. This was not the case. All in all, I would visit Sun Wah again, but not before I try some other Asian restaurants in the area.
