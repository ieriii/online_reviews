The line............ This line was never ending. I ordered some sort of chicken torta, my boyfriend the same. It wasn't good at all. There was no seasoning on the meat, the bread used seemed stale. The smell of these sandwiches was phenomenal, so I expected to be blown away by the taste. I wasn't. There were onions on our sandwiches but they still lacked serious flavor. Eventhough I waited in line forever, I thought the sandwiches would be hot, they weren't. The churros were really good though. Mr Bayless describes his cuisine as authentic Mexican. LOL. Authentic and delicious tortas can be found in Pilsen and Little Village, by people who didn't need to go on a trip Mexico or a culinary school to learn how to make them. If this speaks to what one has to look forward to at Topoblamo, I will not not be going. So thanks for the heads up.
