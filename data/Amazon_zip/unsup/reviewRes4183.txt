Every 5-star rating is spot on. Laid back atmosphere, BYOB & the most amazing food. Certainly not anything a home cook could ever replicate. Each of the nine courses was fantastic- no duds or only so-so's. And yes, they cancelled on us once before we actually got to eat there. I can't wait to eat here again.At $110 p/p a great value & well worth it. I think it blows away Bon Soiree. I left BS hungry & wasn't yearning to go back.
