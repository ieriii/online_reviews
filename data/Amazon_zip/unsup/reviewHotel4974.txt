My husband and I stayed at the Allerton hotel from 05/27/2010 thru 05/29/2010 The outside of the Hotel was very nice however the room itself smelled terrible, there weren't any face towels, towels or a floor mat for the shower. During my stay there we could hear every other guest flushing there toilets and closing there doors. We went to bed to these sounds and was awaken to the flushing of the toilets all night long. When we went out for dinner the next night we asked a staff member if they would make sure that our bed was made while we were out and guess what it was not. So the Allerton hotel was not a great experience for our celebration. Gail
