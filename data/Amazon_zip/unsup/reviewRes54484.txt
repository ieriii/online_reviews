I respect their history, as being a long time running vegan/vegetarian diner and I think that's great. I only first ate here 3 years ago so it may have changed since the 80's/90's, but I was never that impressed. There's only so far seniority can take you. Many of the fake meat dishes are made with seitan (wheat gluten), which is not rocket science to prepare. Most of the time I had it, it was more like very flavorful, savory chewing gum. Last time I had the chocolate raspberry cake....that was pretty amazing. A+ for that dessert. Anyway, if I can make it better at home and not pay top dollar for it, why go to Chi Diner? (dessert)
