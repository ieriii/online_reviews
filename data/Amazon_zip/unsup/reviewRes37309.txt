Unfortunately, I have to agree with Sharlene. Check Please pretty much ruined the Hopleaf experience for me (and my husband) We both loved the place 3 years ago before it was on Check Please. The place wasn't a completely crowded zoo and the wait to be seated wasn't an hour and a half. The bar on the main floor is usually packed with people 2-3 deep at the bar. The bar upstairs tends not to get as packed, probably because it's cash only and doesn't have as many taps. However, it will still get crowded upstairs because people will make the trek back downstairs to the main bar to get more beer. The Hopleaf does have a great selection of Belgian beers. However, the Hopleaf takes me 45+ minutes travel time on the cta. I live much closer to the Map Room, and I honestly think they have a comparable beer selection. So, if I just want some tasty beers I'll hit up the Map Room. The food is still pretty good, but I don't think it warrants a 1.5 hour wait for a table! Since the atmosphere has become pretty unpleasant I doubt I'll be making the trek up to Andersonville again to visit the Hopleaf any time soon. It's such a shame, because I really used to enjoy the place. :(
