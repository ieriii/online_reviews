My boyfriend has been getting take-out pizza from here since he was a little kid, and now we go there for date nights and dinners with friends. Take last Saturday's amazing dinner...we were able to order a white wine that we've wanting to try, the standby grilled calamari which was perfectly cooked with a hint of grilled flavor, and one of their specials - pasta purses filled with cheese with sage brown butter, roasted pears and peas. It was heavenly!  I'm already eagerly anticipating my next meal there...
