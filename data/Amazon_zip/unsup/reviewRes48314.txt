Was dying to try Publican since before I even moved to Chicago and finally made it here for brunch. A-ma-zing! Went with three friends and we went tapas style and shared everything at the very keen insight of our waiter. Started with the bloody mary with the beer chaser and it was nice and refreshing especially after a few too many cocktails the evening before. Then the fun began...red wine poached egg with prosciutto was absolutely delicious, schnitzel with eggs was awesome, omelet with fried oysters was good as well but not as much of a stand out as the first two. Lastly we had the waffle with berries and honey butter everything that a waffle should be--soft and crunchy, sweet but not too sweet. Great ender to the meal. We also shared plates of the maple braised bacon that was more like pork belly which is a good thing and the frites with fried eggs which is as awesome as you can imagine. All in all it was a great brunch, one that i wouldn't do all the time but definitely for an occasion or when you're craving some a bit more decadent. A great experience, can't wait to go back for dinner!
