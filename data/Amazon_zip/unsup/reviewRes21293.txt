5 stars if you go on a Tuesday or Thursday for the margarita special and request to sit on the patio on a nice day. Great summer experience! The margaritas are normally less than $8, but on Tuesdays and Thursdays they are less than $4 a piece! They have 10 flavors and they are all made with REAL FRUIT JUICE! They are delicious and not too sweet/syrupy. The patio (which opened just this season) is small, but very pleasant. There are hanging lights, a waterfall fountain and lots of flowers. We only waited 10 minutes on a beautiful Thursday night, but it would have been worth a longer wait.  Both of our dishes were delicious - the Steak Diablo was very tender with a unique sauce. The Pollo Adobo was delicously char-broiled and seasoned with an array of tri-colored bell peppers. Portions were large and the service was very attentive.
