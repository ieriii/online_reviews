I have been here a couple of times when visiting the Windy City, and it does not disappoint. Tip: Make a reservation, it fills up quickly. The service is top notch and super friendly. Not sure what you want? They offer suggestions and are happy to swap it out if you prefer something else. Great drinks menu, and the sides are delish. Shout out to the pickles and the mac and cheese. Oh gah, I think I need another trip soon back to Chicago...
