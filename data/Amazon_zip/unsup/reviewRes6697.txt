My favorite new place in Chicago. Excellent service, fall off the bone ribs, perfectly prepared brisket, and the list goes on. It's unlike any BBQ joint I've ever been to. It's easy to miss if you don't know what your looking for because it looks like a house with a small "q" on the front. When you get inside, it's pretty large though. There is a downstairs and upstairs and it's very trendy. I'll definitely be making a few trips back in June.
