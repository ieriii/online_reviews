I'm shocked how I missed that place although it's very close to my house - OK may be it's because I'm new around-.We went there for my bday and it was the Karaoke night.We were planning to hit some clubs but then I didn't feel like it and we ended up here thanks to a friend. IT WAS FUN. I just could have loved the place for it's service but it's not just that: Their pizza IS good. We had white pizza with onions and chicken. It was heavenly good. And their chocolate cake was good too.I could have finished one by myself -as it was my bday ;)- but I wanted to have pizza too. Can't seal it without talking about the girl that served us: She was great!! So sorry that I cant remember her name :( We didn't wait long although we were there pretty late for a table. May be it was because that was Thursday.It just took 5 min at most. Finally: Definitely going there again
