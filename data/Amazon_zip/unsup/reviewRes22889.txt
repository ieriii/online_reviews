This is the ULTIMATE Chicago Hot Dog place. Delicious dogs and burgers, with lots of ice cream and fountain treats. Not inexpensive like some other hot dog stands, but the quality of the food, the heritage of the location, and the uniqueness of the setting make the trip to Milwaukee and Devon well worth the price. My kids are the fourth generation of my family who have eaten there, and I try to hit Superdawg at least once on every trip to Chicago.
