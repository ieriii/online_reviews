On the upside, this is a classic piece of Chicago kitsch and tradition. Old time drive in with the requisite corny statues on top of the building. Drive ins are making a come back but this place's drive in has survived the era where drive ins almost became extinct. Hot dog itself is a classic, all beef hot dog with the works with fries packed into a unique box. Hot dog is bigger than most joints, a 6 count dog (six dogs to a pound) as opposed to the usual eight or ten counts. Fries are surprisingly good too. On the down side, the service is abismally slow, the food is over priced and that pickled green tomato doesn't do much for me.  Great for the atmosphere and the food is good. Too expensive and slow to make a regular out of me.
