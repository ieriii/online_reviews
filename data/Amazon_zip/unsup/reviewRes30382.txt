I kinda feel like I'm betraying my brethren by not giving this place five stars. However, I made it through high school without succumbing to peer pressure, so I guess I shouldn't let it influence me too much now... Okay, so there are a few things that I do like about the Chicago Diner: + It's completely vegetarian/mostly vegan. + The menu has a wide-variety of creative dishes. + There are lots of brunch options (which usually isn't the case w/ veg menus). + The wait-staff is friendly & helpful, especially if you have questions. There are also a few things that I don't like: - Most of the dishes are based on meat substitutes (while this is good for some people, I don't eat most of these). - Some of the menu items are kinda expensive when it really comes down to it. - They were "out" of the dish that I tried to order when I was there. - The taste/texture of the Polenta Fiesta, which I ended up getting, didn't sit well with me.  (It was basically presented like a plate of salmon, & my dinner mate even commented that it reminded him of a salmon dish that he had somewhere else. Admittedly, the fish similarity subconsciously freaked me out a little bit...) Anyway, Chicago Diner is great if you like tofu, seitan, "bacon," & other meat substitutes, but I'm not sure if it's for me. While I will give it one more try, you won't find me chowing down on that polenta thing again any time soon...
