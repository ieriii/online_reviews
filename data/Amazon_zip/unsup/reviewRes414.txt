A must dining experience at least once in your life. I'd wait until your first credit card at least. Superb service, that of which can be compared to the royalty treatment. And the food, O M G the food. it's unheard of-- imaginative, creative, totally outside the box. Avant- garde at its best. 1. No menus- you choice is either a 12 or a 24 course meal. We had the 12 course = 4 hrs. 2. Between the two of us, we had one wine pairing. 8 different wines paired with 8 of your 12 courses. I ordered a glass of champagne and sipped my boyfriend's wine pairings every now and then. 3. Sit back, relax, and enjoy.
