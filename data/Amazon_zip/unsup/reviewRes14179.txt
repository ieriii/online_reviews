Man, do I love this place. Everything I've ordered is amazing, and I've never really had Cuban food before this place arrived across the street from me. I have no personal experience as to it's authenticity, but I do have personal experience as to it's deliciousness.  The paper menus at the register have explain what each dish is, if you are unfamiliar with cuban food. Or just order randomly. You won't be sorry.
