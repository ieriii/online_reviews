I want to like this place more for the service and attention to detail. I can't in good conscience give more stars than 3 though because I'm disappointed in the food here. Yes, I said it, the bbq here needs some improvement. Five of us came in on Friday and we waited for the rest of our party to show up so those of us that were there went to the bar. Their whiskey selection was impressive and when I sked for a little bit of water the bartender gave me an eye dropper of their house distilled water. Nice touch, impressed so far. Our server, Shawn was awesome, quick with the chips and pickles and refills as we needed it. When we told him that we were thinking of sharing four entrees between the five of us. He not only let us know that it would be enough but he suggested that we add the mac and cheese as an extra side. The pulled pork was tasty, a lot like South Carolina style hash and which went well with the mustard sauce. The St. Louis Ribs were a good choice too with a slight sweetness to it and the vinegar sauce, which was something that was hard to find was also tasty. The chicken, well it was chicken and the spicy sauce made it better. I had such high hopes for the Kobe brisket, thinking that Kobe beef plus BBQ would be terrific but I found it terrible: rubbery, over done and just about inedible. I gave my share of it to the others and took an extra helping of ribs. Side wise I thought the mac and cheese was just okay while the 2 cornbreads were indistinguishable from each other. The slaw was pretty good and the dusted fries were also pretty tasty. Between the five of us with a good tip it came to around 30 bucks a person, which isn't too bad but I expected a lot better food wise, particularly from the brisket and the corn bread.
