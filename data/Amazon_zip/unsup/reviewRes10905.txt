Hands down, my FAVORITE place to eat in Chicago! I am a huge breakfast fan and can eat it for lunch and dinner...unfortunately this place closes at 2PM! Be prepared to wait in line for about 45 min to an hour but don't fret...it's well worth the wait!!! Portions are huge and I love that they have come up with the most unique pancake creations known to man. I'm like a kid in a candy store when selecting what I want to eat and wish they had a sample pancake platter to have one of each pancake, french toast, chocolate tower on it!!  *sigh* Now I'm getting myself all worked up and hungry... :)
