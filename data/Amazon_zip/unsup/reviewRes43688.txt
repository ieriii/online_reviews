Kinzie Chop House is fine; I've been here a handful of times for both lunch and dinner. When I lived in the neighborhood a few years ago, it was fairly easy to get a table on a Saturday night sans a reservation, so it came in handy for those last-minute red-meat cravings. On one of my last visits for lunch, I got the steak risotto, which was a hot mess, so when I went for lunch yesterday, I knew to steer clear of that. My friend had arrived just before I did and already had a table. I liked that they will seat you even if your entire party isn't there, as so many places refuse to do that during peak times. I joined him and our server brought us menus, but never asked us if we wanted beverages, so it's a good thing we were given water, which was all we wanted anyway. He came back to take our order; a cobb salad for me and a crab cake sandwich for my friend. Food was served promptly (by a runner), always appreciated at lunch when time is of the essence. My cobb salad was kind of boring. I expected chunks of turkey but instead got small pieces of what looked like slices from a deli counter. And there were also far too many mushroom stems. I usually discard stems when I'm cooking so I don't expect to see them in salads. The ranch dressing that came on top didn't have much flavor either. For $11.95, I was hoping for better than what I got. My friend enjoyed his crab cake sandwich so next time, I'll take a cue from him and order that. Our server dropped off the check after our plates were cleared. In fact, other than to take our order and drop off the check, we had no interaction with him at all. I don't need a lot of fussing and fawning, but a quick "Do you have everything you need?" is appreciated (and indeed, expected in a place like this). I've always enjoyed dinner at Kinzie Chop House, so perhaps it's better to go there for dinner as opposed to lunch. You'll get a better meal and a bit more attention, service-wise.
