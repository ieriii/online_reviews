Wine was excellent, lively atmosphere. The meat I had was well spiced and flavorful. I knew I shouldn't expect the variety of meat you get at, for instance, Carnivore in Nairobi. However I was almost exclusively presented beef. Couldn't they do a bit more chicken and pork? and add some more exotic meat like Buffalo? Wouldn't necessarily come back if it was on my own buck.
