1) Burrata Pugliese with Peas, Radish, Celery, Spring Micro Greens & Aceto Balsamico: if you like burrata cheese, you'll enjoy this plate. small but delicious. 2) Rabbit Panzanella with Mixed Herb & Lettuce, Crispy Capers, Pickled Fiddlehead Ferns & Black Truffle Vinaigrette: decent sized salad, loved the mint herb, and truffle dressing. good portions of rabbit as well. Just be careful, i got some rabbit bones!! 3) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: This is a very rich dish, and the pickled peppers help to cut through some of the fried fatty goodness... if it weren't for that tart, crisp flavor, you'd taste a lot of the oil/fat from the pig's ear, kale, and egg yolk. i liked how the ear was sliced thinly. 4) Dessert: Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche}--this is a donut filled with ricotta cheese and chocolate. fresh out of the fryer and topped with powder sugar. it is a regular-sized donut, so the portion is good for sharing. great service!
