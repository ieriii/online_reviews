I am staying here while my condo floor is being fixed. I got a good rate through AAA ($186, not bad for Chicago). The room is nicely sized, and has a refrigerator and microwave, which is one reason I chose the hotel--makes it much more affordable to stay here the week, I don't have to eat out for every meal (and there is a Jewel across the street and a Trader Joe's a couple of blocks away). There is free internet access, perfect to feed my yelp addiction.  Business center is open 24 hours, and printing and computers are free. I came here late last nite after the yelp event, and they let me check in by phone, which definitely scored bonus points. They have a fitness center (3 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 2 bikes, free weights, and a multiuse weight machine for lat pulldowns, shoulder work, etc) and offer access to Crunch a couple of doors down. They also have an indoor pool and hot tub. Adjacent to Weber Grill, their room service is from there or Buca di Beppo. Location is right at the red line, in the heart of or accessible to most everything. Housekeeping was great this morning--I popped over to Trader Joe's for literally 15 minutes at most and they had come in and cleaned while I was gone. Awesome. Nutragena shampoo, conditioner, soaps, etc are a nice extra.
