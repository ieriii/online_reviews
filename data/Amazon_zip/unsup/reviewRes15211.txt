This place totally wowed me. The ambiance as you walk in is amazing. Nice & relaxed... Definitely what a lounge should be all about. Decor is awesome. Reminds me of Alice in Wonderland or something. Cocktails are set at $12 each... A little pricy but worth having there. I didn't get a chance to try the food I'll have to go back. Thought it was sweeeet that they brought us a bowl of nuts halfway through our visit. Waiting 30 minutes out in the cold was so worth it! Love the fact that the rules include NO CELL PHONE USE! Your there to enjoy the place not be on the phone. The croud was really cool... No need to watch your back here. Lot's of security, to the point where you can leave your purse alone at the bar. Bathroom wasn't really what I expected but it was nice. I like how it feels like your in your own personal bathroom... Hard to explain lol. They don't take Discover so -1 for that. This kind of place should take every card!
