I won't eat here again. It had been a long time favorite but their tacos at now teeny, tiny! I have never seen such a small corn tortilla. The steak tacos were grisly and the corn tortilla's were stale and dry. They charge .50 cents per taco I'd you want to add cheese. So that ads up quick and you get a pinch of chihuahua cheese. The black salsa is really good and the only reason I give it one star. Their tacos end up being the most expensive smallest tacos ever. $16 for 5 steak, a side order of beans and rice. I won't be back. Best taco place is up north called the chicken and taco place on elation and foster. Not far off the expressway and worth the drive.
