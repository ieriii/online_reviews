Ever wonder what an Iron Chef judge feels like? If you're a foodie, and you can afford it, then you should visit Tru and find out. One thing you'll get, that the poor Iron Chef judges won't, is a spectacular atmosphere. No kitchen stadium here. Pure white and black everything. Live pianist, impeccably dressed waitstaff, and all the convention and protocol of fine dining, including escorts to the washrooms.  And speaking of service, when you walk through the door, you can actually feel the ground shift as the world starts to revolve around you. But lets talk about food. Tru's $125 prix fixe offers a wide variety of spectacularly displayed food experiences you can write home about (I'd recommend the beef cheek ravioli). You pick an appetizer, entre, and a cheeze or desert course. Between each course a mini-course is offered as well. Though it doesn't look like much, you will leave feeling sated. Delivers exceptional atmosphere? Tru Delivers exceptional food experience? Tru Delivers exceptional service? Tru Delivers? Unfortunately, there's no take out or delivery. :(
