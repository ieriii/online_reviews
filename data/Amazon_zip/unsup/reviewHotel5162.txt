My experience at the W, was fantastic. I went with the suite. It was AWESOME. I checked in Thursday afternoon,and the bellhops were super helpful loading and unloading all my luggage.  Parking at the W is a total rip-off but I so is majority of the chicago hotels. Getting the car from the valet usually took about 20 minutes so I learned to call ahead.I enjoy the club atmosphere on the first level (and in the elevators). I thought it was really fun.The drinks are pricey but very good.
