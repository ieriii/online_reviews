The first thing that I noticed about Sunda is that is is CLAsSy! The waiters are all dressed up to the 9's and service is amAzING! The decor is ultra swank, and me think it be a perfect place for a date. I loved the organic/natural elements mixed with mod. I tried the miso soup and california rolls. Both were delicious! I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. I wish that they had a few more veggie options like some sushi spots up north, but I was satisfied with what I had and would definitely go back.
