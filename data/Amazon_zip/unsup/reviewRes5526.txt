Never again. Okay, I should preface this review with, I don't really eat pork...So, why would I go to a restaurant with pig in the title, you ask?? Because I felt like it dammit! And, the other non-porcine dishes on the menu should be just as good. Well, from my companion's response to her pig dish, which she called greasy and not flavorful, the pig isn't all that impressive either! I think it's a very cute idea and I adore tapas style eating, but the only dish that really stood out and might bring me back was the chicken thighs...out of the 5 dishes ordered. That's just not enough, Purple Pig, it's not enough!
