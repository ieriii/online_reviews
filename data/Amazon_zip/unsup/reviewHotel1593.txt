Formerly the Executive Plaza, the Hotel 71 (named after its numeric address on Wacker Drive) has a nice location along the bend of the Chicago River. This makes the rooms on this side much more desirable than the ones on the opposite side, which looks over an alley and assorted buildings. The standard rooms are very sizeable and comfortable here. I hear there is a plan to convert this property soon to a combination condo-hotel tower.
