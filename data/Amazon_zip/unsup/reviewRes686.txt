Best. Meal. Ever. Dining at this place is an experience - it's amazing how the courses manage to appeal to all of your senses. They're just astounding, with cauliflower cooked and plated to look like trees, pillows of air that emit scent when the plate is set, little spheres of stuff that explode in your mouth. Everything was imaginative and revolutionary. Service was great - attentive but not pushy. One thing to note - budget a lot of time for this dinner. The 20-course meal took three hours!
