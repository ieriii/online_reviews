Best steak I've had in years. We were visiting Chicago for the first time in 20 years from California. Just can't beat Midwest meat. It tastes completely different than the jokes they call steaks in California. We had late reservations here and we closed the place down. The prices are about average for a steakhouse. We brought our own wine from California to save the huge markup. They charge a $25 corkage fee if you bring your own, All the other reviews about the food and drinks are dead on. I think I got almost 3 drinks out of my shaker. Steaks were great. We had so many left overs we took them back with us to the hotel and had another dinner in our room the next night.  Service was impeccable and ambiance was great. Quite dressy as we saw a lot of guys in jackets. No one dresses up for dinner in California anymore so it was a bit surprising to see people dressed well. Jeans and t shirts would not cut it here. Our bill came to about $225 for 2 drinks, crab filled mushroom appetizer ( very yummy), split a Cesar salad, bone in fillet ( big), KC strip steak, 2 sides, 2 coffees, corkage fee and a butter cake. Looking forward to trying their Las Vegas location as we go there annually for a convention. I doubt that it'll compare though.
