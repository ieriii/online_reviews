Went here last night for the first time. I think I found my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. They are BYOB which is always a plus and even though I didn't take advantage of that last night it's nice to know the option is there. Service was very friendly and attentive and pretty fast considering how busy they were. Started out with plantain chips and the avocado side and it was just so simple but absolutely perfect. The avocado was very fresh and the plantain chips were light and crispy and very garlicky. To drink I had the Salida del Sol which was earl grey tea with mango and it was very refreshing and not overly sweet. I ordered one of the specials which was pork loin marinated in white wine and orange and it was so tender. My friend ordered the oxtail special and it was falling off the bone and the sauce was incredible. Would have liked to try dessert but we were too full and we had leftovers. Definitely a good value for the quality and quantity of food you receive. The only slightly negative thing I can say is I wish they had a second bathroom. That being said, I can't wait to go back. I really want to try the goat cheese empanadas.
