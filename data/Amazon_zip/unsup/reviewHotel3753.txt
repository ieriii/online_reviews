We enjoyed a 3 night stay here early Dec 2011. After some research on the River North hotels, I thought that Dana Hotel would be a good choice. I was not disappointed! I found this hotel to be trendy, some highlights include full length windows that provided great views of the city (we had a corner room), a rainfall shower, iPod dock. The hotel staff was super friendly and very eager to please during our stay. The hotel was also centrally located to what we were doing and everything seemed walking distance. In the winter months, we also enjoyed the fire on the rooftop lounge with blankets and robes provided for warmth.  The negatives are that during the Christmas season the rooftop lounge was not always avaiable to us. Also, take note that while the beds are comfortable, the pillows are waaaaaayyyyyyyy too soft. We did find a firmer pillow in the closet and I have no doubt the hotel staff would have provided firmer pillows, we didn't bother asking.
