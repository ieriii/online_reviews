Mia Francesca's has mouth-watering itialian food, from thier lobster bisque to thier over-roasted chicken and everything in between! Although the seating was a little tight, it makes for a delicate intimate atmosphere. The service in Lakeview was not as delightful as I would have liked but the food made up for it. :) Definately recommend this place!
