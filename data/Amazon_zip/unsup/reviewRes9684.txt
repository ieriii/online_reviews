Maybe the expectations were set too high, but I was a bit disappointed with the food at Sunday brunch. The restaurant itself and decor is nice. The staff is friendly and professional. The cocktails are delicious. My friend's steak and eggs dish was better than mine. I had the caesar omelet. The potatoes were bland. The omelet was indeed a flavor-blend of caesar salad and omelet, but it was not a particularly fascinating new interaction of well-thought-out flavor that I had been hoping for. As someone else pointed out, the place does not seem to be as busy as one is led to believe. It seems like they might be creating an artificially inflated sense of demand, although maybe the bad weather kept people away. I'd be willing to go back and give it another chance.
