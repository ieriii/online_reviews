Carry-out service is awful. Phone staff and manager can definitely do a better of retaining customers or being respectful to first-time customers. Understand this place has old business or regulars but that doesn't mean they should not put effort into treating first-time carry-out customers well. Dine-in is okay, menu has a good variety of items and some waitstaff clearly shine but, again, only if you're a repeat customer. WIth so many pizza and fine dining options in the neighborhood, would recommend findining another one and avoiding Calo unless it's for one-time dining.
