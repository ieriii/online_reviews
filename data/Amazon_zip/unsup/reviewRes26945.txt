This was one on my list of places to try after reading countless praises of Rick Bayless. We went there for brunch. I knew this place always had a wait and I believe it was about 45 minutes to an hour that day for a table in the main dining area. What we didn't realize, however, was that you could sit immediately in the bar area, so once we realized this, we were able to snag the very last table, a very small high top, immediately. We both had their special cocktail of the day and had the quacamole with two salsas, to start. I honestly cannot recall what I ordered as my main dish, but it was one of their specialties with the mole sauce and we both really enjoyed it. I believe their menu changes monthly. Two cocktails, chips/quac/salsa and two brunch/lunch entrees got us a bill a bit over $100, so be prepared to spend! :) But the food is excellent!
