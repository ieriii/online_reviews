Inda House is in central Chicago (10 minute walk from State and Wacker). As such, it has to be a little upscale. The quality and quantity of the food make it one of the better values in the area in my opinion. Mains included chicken tikka, shrimp masala and chicken curry - all well prepared. The masala had a nice little kick. The carbs for the meal: nan (sesame and plan) and jasmine rice was done right. Service was exceptional as well. My advice is to split two entrees between three people (or some ratio like this), otherwise you will have leftovers. Dinner and drinks for three: $120 including tip.
