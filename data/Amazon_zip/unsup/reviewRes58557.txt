We've only ordered delivery from here. The delivery staff is excellent -- while they all look like they should be opening for a White Stripes concert, they have in every case been timely and incredibly friendly. I would give this place five stars if my review were based solely on the original, New Haven style crust -- but we ordered the red pizza a few nights ago and found that the crust was almost too dry and tough to be able to chew all the way through. I would order again, but just stick with the original crust from here forward.
