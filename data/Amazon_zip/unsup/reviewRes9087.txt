I am one who loves to try new foods so my friends and I decided to go to Noon O Kabab. I wasn't too sure as what to order but I have to say the food was delicious. I can't remember what I ordered exactly but it was chicken breast portions simmered in some kind of cinnamon sauce that was sooooo good. The staff are not only friendly, the entire atmosphere is nice and relaxing.
