I love beer. And this place is mecca for beer lovers in Chicago. I can't believe it's been a year since I went here for a friend's birthday party last December. Not only was the beer selection beyond extensive, I ordered the CB&J (Cashew butter and fig jam sandwich with mac & cheese side), and it was pure foodie heaven. The frites are also SO SO good. God, I need to go back, like, yesterday!
