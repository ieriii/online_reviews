You might have to wait upwards to an hour, but if you go right before the lunch rush, it's only about 15 min during the week. On the weekends... well good luck. They have the most unique and delicious sausages you can order on a bun. I've tried my share of about half the animal kingdom in sausage form from this place and it's always been good. On Fri+Sat they have fries that have been cooked in rendered duck fat which is delicious, but their regular fries during the week are just as fine. Cash only and long wait. Most people would say the food is worth it. I would have to agree.
