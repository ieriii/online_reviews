'Delish' I say... 'delish'! This place was awesome. The atmosphere was fun and exciting from the entrance and waiting area to the main dining room. The decor is incredible and the food is even better. Granted, I've only been there once but I loved it. I had the 'Pernil' which is pork off the bone on rice and beans with fried sweet plantain around it. It was the perfect portion size, so I left feeling satisfied but not stuffed. I also had a wonderful cocktail whose name I cannot remember but it tasted like alcoholic fresh lime juice which was so good. Definitely recommend going here and I think you should dress as if you were going for a night out on the town.
