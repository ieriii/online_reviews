This place has been on my radar forever, and when my girlfriend sugested it last night, I was in! Great atmosphere, BYOB, unique sushi rolls, I'm loving Coast right now. I heard it is always packed so be prepared to wait, but at 7:00 on a Wednesday night we were seated right away. The White Dragon Roll was fantastic. Decent prices and BYOB, I will be going back to Coast!
