Looking for a place to get real seafood in Chicago? This is the place. Fresh seafood, fancy decor, and very polite staff. I've been here multiple times for dinner and only once during happy hour. Never left disappointed. They sometimes have jazz musicians performing in the oyster bar, which is pretty sweet. Don't be intimidated if you're a newbie to seafood. I didn't even know what an oyster was until I went to this place. The waiter was very nice and explained things very patiently. I've since gone back about 10 or 15 times, as I am hooked. It's a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. If you're on a date (not to mention a budget), order the lobster or crab dinner for two and a bottle of wine and you can keep your tab down to around $100 for the two of you. I've heard that Joe's Steak and Stone Crab is the only rival in town to Shaw's (never been to Joe's), but I can sincerely say that Shaw's is my favorite place to get seafood in Chicago.
