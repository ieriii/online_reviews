Definitely cultivates the hush-hush, high chair, swankly old school speakeasy vibe. The inside is hella dark, which just makes the glowing spirits behind the bar even more alluring. Very good menu. Most of the cocktails are originals. I of course had the juliet and romeo, which was great but I think I liked the Art of Choke the best (artichoke liqueur, chartreuse, a couple other things I don't remember). You can get cocktails based on rum, vodka, gin, tequila, whiskey, or cordials. There is also a decent but not out of the ordinary beer menu. Or you can get lots of nice Scotch, Mezcal, any other liquor, by the glass. Again, their selection of liquor by the glass is not huge, though it will certainly appeal to most tastes and every medium to super-high level of sophistication. The food was surprisingly good, as well, with some interesting bites that come (surprisingly generously) portioned to share. Cocktails are $11. Liquor ranges from $6-$25 a glass (with a lot of good stuff around $10). Most of the food is around $10 and is a larger portion than the appetizers at many restaurants.
