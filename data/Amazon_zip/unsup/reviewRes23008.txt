We ordered the famous spicy chicken, the fried duck and the mapo tofu. My thoughts on each: Spicy Chicken: This is unbelievably hot. Once you see the dish, you'll see that this is obvious by how many peppers are on the plate. The weird thing is, it's not the same type of heat you would receive from most hot foods. I would classify it as a "dry heat" that kind of keeps burning inside. However, it is very, very addicting and I couldn't stop picking at the plate to find bits and pieces we had not eaten. Fried Duck: One of the most delicious pieces of duck that I have ever had. If you love fried chicken or duck in general, you should not pass on an opportunity to try the duck here. The duck is cooked perfectly and I had to have my friend restrain me from eating the bones. Mapo Tofu: Once again, LSC does not mess around when they tell you a dish is spicy. This compounded with the fact that we had already eaten the aforementioned chicken probably burned a hole in our stomachs. However, that just means that we just have tofu bits floating in our bodies which I'm pretty sure is okay because tofu is healthy. So if all this food was so good, why is it only getting 4 stars? Well for one, the food comes out unbelievably slow. I understand food service can be slow at times, especially when the restaurant is packed, but there were empty tables there (3:30 PM). It took us about an hour for us to get all of our dishes. I can't imagine how long it would have taken if we came during a normal dining hour. The other con is that their portion sizes look big at first, but they are actually smaller than you expect. Just be prepared to drink a lot of water. Recommendation: For the faint of heart - fried duck, for the bold - spicy chicken
