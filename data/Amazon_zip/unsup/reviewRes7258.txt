Sapori is one of my favorites, but tonight, sans dining companion yet avec a craving for the divine avocado crostini, I got carry out for the first time. Um... I was a bit annoyed that it was $11, but I also thought I'd need to stop somewhere to procure bread. Not so! They gave me mounds of their delish bread in the bag, PLUS grated parm! Hooray!!! So lovely. Love that place.
