This is one of the coolest places in Chicago. The atmosphere is warm, comfortable, and relaxed, even though the place is busy. The interior design makes it very unique and the cocktails are amazing. I wish I could afford to drink them more often, but I am not that wealthy. The food is also very good and consists of a little different selection than what most bars offer. Violet Hour is highly recommended.
