I really enjoyed my first time. I didn't like the fact that they don't have a coat rack, and there really isnt a good place to put one's purse. The seats have a round back so you can hook it. The tables are a little too small and hard to fit all the food. I had the black widow and the philly - both very nice portions, the taste was good - but the miso soup was to die for and had plenty of sea weed and chunks of tofu! The staff was very helpful and accomodating. I would love to return. Although, the art was a little odd, random pictures of famous people and some Japanese art. Not sure if they need an interior designer or they sell the art on the spot - looked like some pieces were literally removed from its place. Good job guys! I will return! Oh and i really enjoyed the music and the movie they played!
