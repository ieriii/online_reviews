Oh this place is so good. I first went with some people from my office and we had the best time. The atmosphere is amazing and the staff can definitely keep you entertained, or maybe that's just the groups I've been with. Greek Islands did an awesome job for a huge graduation luncheon I went to and they were just as awesome when I was there with a few friends. The food is top notch and I'm disappointed in myself that I don't go more often.
