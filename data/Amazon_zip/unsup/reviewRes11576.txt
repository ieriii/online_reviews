my favorite brunch spot in the city. i never go during peak times so i usually don't have to wait long....go early or go late. don't show up at 10AM or else you won't eat till noon...no joke. anyways, everything is great here...the hollandaise sauce they use on the benedict...so good. also, their sausage has a good kick to it. i love their breakfast burrito and their crossaint sandwich is great.  ok...so why do i really go there? pancakes of course. i'm sure you've all read about the magical powers of these things but seriously, nothing is better bongo's pancakes. they use intelligensia coffee i believe...it's strong flavor really helps balance out the sweetness of the pancakes. my recommendation: for 2 people: each order a non-pancake breakfast and share a half order of the pancakes. for 4 people: each order non-panacake dish..share 2 half orders of 2 different pancakes. for 6 people...good luck finding a table. i think there's like 2 that can hold that many. if you happen to be one of the poor suckers that gets there when there's a line and can't wait, head down the street to Feast. not as good but a decent alternative.
