Ahhh, Hopleaf. This is really the perfect bar in my book: lots of good beer and interesting food. But it seems like every time I'm here someone I'm with is behaving badly. There was my friend who was generously offering to screw everyone's girlfriend, assuring them he wasn't too drunk to get it up. Yeah thaaaanks, dude. Good thing Hopleaf is a mellow crowd. Then there was the online date who was easily 60 pounds heavier than her picture. And 60 pounds more boring. But she loooooved me and kept asking for a kiss. Ummmm, no thank you hey I think I left the stove on gottagobye! Next time at Hopleaf will NOT be a disaster. I swear.
