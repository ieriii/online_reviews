Yes, I'm a fan. When it comes to BBQ in the city, you can either go old school or new school. Old school is more hole in the wall spots dotted around Division and Wicker Park or the near south side, new school is Chicago Q. With a beautiful dining room and thoroughly attentive service, "Q" has become one of our favorite comfort food spots in the city. From the pulled pork and chicken sandwiches that are accompanied by BBQ sauce flights, to the kobe sliced brisket, you really can't go wrong if you're craving some well seasoned, simmered, and grilled meat. Oh, and don't forget the massive slices of cornbread or baked mac and cheese. Outside of maybe the County Line in Austin, I think this is the best brisket I've ever had. Bring your friends and family, great for groups, and generally just a really good time, Q definitely has a future as a staple in the Chicago restaurant scene.
