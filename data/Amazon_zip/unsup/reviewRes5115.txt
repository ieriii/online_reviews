I love the name of this spot. Makes me giggle. Ok, first of all, I'm NOT a pork eater -- however, after having a few pork related dishes at Publican and the pork belly tacos at Big Star, I've started to come around -- slowly. I came for lunch and to start had the marinated olives and the eggplant -- both excellent. From the "smears" portion of the menu I had the pork liver pate -- never had this before but it was excellent! I also had the mortadella panini -- divine! I truly enjoyed this place and the service was great too. I'll be back -- I'd like to experience it for dinner!
