I LOVE LAVILLA! Everything about this place is to die for. The food is authentic Italian and if anyone doesn't like it then they must not know what real Italian food should taste like. I've been going here since I was baby and it is the only place I can actually think of that has the total package. The owners are sweethearts and are always there to satisfy everyone. No matter what I have ordered from the menu I have been pleased. Famous for their pizza (which is awesome) I like the baked mostoccioli. Whether I get it delivered, which is fast and prompt, or go there and eat in their dining room, I am always pleased. Also their banquet hall is very classy and can be used for any type of occasion. As good as it gets, best italian food!
