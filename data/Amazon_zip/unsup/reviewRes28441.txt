Had a good experience at Graham Elliot---was a little weary after reading some reviews, but overall, no problems. Showed up, had about 10 minutes before our table was ready, parked ourselves at the bar where the "mixologist" talked us through a few drinks. She was VERY nice and fun to talk too--I had a beer, girlfriend had some pear cocktail which was quite tasty (you'd hope so for $13).  Food was small portions overall which isn't the best thing, but they weren't small enough to the point that they were annoying. Seated us, very friendly staff. Started off with truffle popcorn (complimentary), very good. I had the Octopus and the Beef Stroganoff, great flavors on both. The Stroganoff tasted very good. My girlfriend had the duck ravioli which was also very good, in addition to the pumpernickel sturgeon which sounds odd, but had a great flavor. Great atmosphere and wait/bar staff were very friendly. Overall, the food was very good. The only negative was maybe the price for the amount of food. 1 cocktail each, and the food was about $135 without tip.
