This place was really interesting. The ordering process consisted of putting your name on a list to be seated, waiting in a line while waiting for your table, placing an order, and then waiting to be seated after your order is placed. It was really crowded when we went but got lucky and got a table for 6 fairly quickly. Once you are seated you wait for your food to be cooked to order and served to you at your table. The food was pretty good (nothing really special) and was definitely unique, and the sipping chocolate was yummy. Dessert really is the best part here and if I ever go back, I'm going for the dessert.
