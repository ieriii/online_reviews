Seoul Sassy --- bottle that stuff and distribute on the streets, amazing flavor and the service is speedy. Great servings, I normally venture in solo as seating gets tight---but there usually is a good ebb and flow so if you show up in a small group(think less than 4 people) you will be fine! Must try, if you are thinking about it, just go!
