I SING YOUR PRAISES HOPLEAF! Great Beer. Amazing food. Perfect atmosphere. Mellow music. Chill, pleasant crowd; both staff and patrons. I have never had a bad time at this bar and honestly love everything about it. It would get 5 stars even if they didn't serve food and they would get 5 stars serving the same menu as a BYOB restaurant. Yes, the food is that good and yes, the place is that great. Go here. Now.
