We went visited this fabulous little restaurant on our spring break trip to Chicago with our exchange student from Romania. My husband and I couldn't tell you if the delicious food that we ate was authentic, but she said it tasted just like home. The owner was extra attentive when he discovered that we were hosting a student from Romania. It was so much fun and he even gave us a ride back to the hotel after a tour of the loop. He didn't want us to have to take the train back to the hotel. We would definitely return to Bucharest Little Bistro if we go to Chicago again!
