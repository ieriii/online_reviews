I love pizza and dig it here, so therefore I heart Piece. One can often bump into someone they know. I don't care much for the closeness there is between tables however. It's tight. Especially during colder months when people have colds. I've gotten some residual sneeze on me once or twice. That's yuck, freakin' cover your face yo! It's loud, sports could be on, good beer on tap and grab a couple different foo foo pies for the table to share. Good stuff.  The wait can be obnoxious sometimes but if you aren't shy and can hang at the bar till, you'll be fine. I've hosted a few BYOpizza share parties; where everyone brings a pie from a different place and often someone or my darling cuz' Anisha will bring a pie from here. Which the group is usually happy about.
