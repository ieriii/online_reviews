A friend decided to hold her birthday dinner here, and a quick scan of the menu already prepared me for what was coming. What the heck is going on? Their entrees include the three following items: grilled salmon, chicken pot pie, and something called "Irish style curry". Why would these 3 things ever be on the same menu? Why does Irish style curry even exist? Irish + curry?? Regardless, I figured ordering a burger would be pretty safe. I mean, it's a bar, right? Well, me and my friend that ordered the same item got food poisoning.
