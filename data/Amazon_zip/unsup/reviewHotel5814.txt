The place is expensive, not very organized (mixup with a couple of bookings in our group), and most impotantly does not free wifi or parking. You have to pay $20-30 per night for parking!!! I was really disappointed with Marriott.and when asked about it, we were simply told that it was chicago, no one has free parking...for the money we paid, i dont think im going to come back here again
