When tourists think of good Chicago pizza, most will picture a big slice of deep-dish. A visit to Piece will make them reconsider. The pizzas are think crust. We like the "white" crust, which means olive oil, cheese, and no sauce. Chicken and fresh basil on white is the first pizza I ever had at Piece, and it remains my favorite. Don't be afraid to go crazy with your toppings - meatball pizza on red is better than it sounds, and mashed potatoes with bacon on white is sinfully delicious; ask your server if you don't believe me. Piece also has a good selection of their own brews. Golden Arm is crisp and light, while the Worryin' Ale and Baron Von Awesome are heartier, fuller choices. There's lots of TVs for watching sports, valet parking available, and the bathrooms are big and clean (well the men's is, at least - I can't speak for the women's). It turns into more of a bar later at night, so it's not a great place for a family outing. Piece doesn't deliver, but they do carry-out.
