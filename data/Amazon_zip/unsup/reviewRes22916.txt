For making on the top 84 list of some top 100 list for restaurants (they post this in their restaurant) I am disappointed with my experience here. My friends and I ventured out to check out some greek food, and we had two locals with us, who suggested Greek Islands, mainly because it was reasonably price. We all felt like screaming "OPA!" as well to enhance our experience. Yet...this is my experience from dining there: Appetizer:  Flaming Saganaki: Yet it came flaming to us, however, it wasn't amazing. It tasted like a cheese stick overly grilled, and if you want to simply have the experience of having Flaming Cheese then cutting the cheese right after, go for it! Grilled Octopus: This dish was interesting. It has a tinge of lemony-zestness to it, and overall, I was pleased with dipping my bread into its olive oiled sauce. It tasted like it was drizzled in olive oil and the octopus suction cups were grilled still on it. That made it hard for me to swallow, but overall, it was tasty. Entree: I had the Combination plate, because they ran out of Spartan Chicken. I was looking forward to trying Spartan chicken, mainly because I imagined myself ripping into a Spartan-like body and not ever having to work out again! YES! Combination Plate: Came with Beef meat ball, Pork Loin, Lasagna-like square, grape leaves wrapping a rice ball filled inside with meat, rice and some veggies. I'd say out of the entire dish, I enjoyed the rice and vegetables the most. The meat, didn't have any distinct flavors, the meatball, nothing to rave about, but I've had better meat balls, and the grape leaves was not my cup of joe.  *My friend also ordered the combination plate and she also wasn't too impressed. Service: Was Ok. Nothing to rave about and our food took awhile to get to us. So, when asking my friends what they felt about the place, they all gave it, 3 stars.
