This place is good. We saw a review for it on "Check, Please" last week and managed to get a last minute reservation on Friday evening. We were seated immediately in one of the private booths. The place reminded me of some of the old school Italian restaurants we've eaten at in New York--Manhattan and Queens. The food was great and they have a lot of standards on the menu. I had the Chicken Parm and my husband had Veal--not very creative, I realize, but those are our tests for good Italian food. The pasta on the side was delicious. Very generous portions--I took more than half of mine home. Between the pizza bread, salad and soup (all come with dinner), I was overwhelmed by the amount of food. Our bottle of wine was priced just right, and we had a great time. It was packed when we walked out about 8:30pm; clearly they do a roaring business. This is not the place to go every weekend, but fun once in a while for the complete "dining" experience.
