I am not normally a fan of the sweet-only meal, but here i made an exception and OH how decadent and delicious it was. My friend Kirsten F. and I met for a late weekday brunch, so we avoided the much-lamented weekend lines and rushed service. Already it was a treat, as we got a bright and sunny window seat and could sip coffee and catch up to our heart's content. I ordered the Tarte Tatin pancakes, and every single element of it was pure heaven. The pancakes would have been outstanding just on their own, but with the oozy caramel sauce, perfectly cooked paper-thin apple slices and HUGE dollop of whipped cream, it was in the coma-inducing category. I ate and ate until I was so full I thought I would pass out, and even though I could only get through about half of it, something in me still wanted more! If I hadn't had an appointment to get to, I would have lingered well into the afternoon...but with how good that pancake was, it's probably a good thing that I didn't. This is a special breakfast meal that I would say is worth the wait. Tart Tatin Pancakes, mark my words, I will be back for you!
