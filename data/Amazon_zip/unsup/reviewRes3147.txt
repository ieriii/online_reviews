Oh my goodness..oh my goodness! & THAT IS WHAT Crisp is all about ... G-O-0-D-N-E-S-S Whether you want delivery, take out, or if you are lucky you might be able to grab a seat inside, either way Crisp is one hellova place. I ordered 5 Seoul Sassy wings, two steak bowls, and two drinks. It was $30 dollars but this chiquita is not complaining. I had left overs for the next day AND some. First off, the 5 wings are equivalent to 15 wings. They are HUGE... made for huge appitites. I had one wing and could not even bare a second one ( I was THAT full) The breading on the wings is super crunchy and soaks up all that sassy sauce. Like another yelper said, it's almost like the breading is some sort of crumbled up Special K cereal- at least that is how I can decribe it. The steak bowl had plenty of rice at the bottom with plenty of sauce over the bulgogi steak ( Bulgolgi=thinly, sliced marinated beefy goodness) which is a plus if you do not like your meat dry -like this chica over here. They have a delivery service on a different pair of wheels.... I figure the area it is in is so congested that they have a delivery boy on a bicycle! I am from surburbia and this is just not seen everyday. I was totally impressed. The guy was gone for 5 minutes legit. I swear if I lived in this area I would totally tip that boy well ;) heehee . Anywhooo... you need to try this place at least 15x just cause it really is THAT good. Oh yeah, prepare to be messy. Take someone here on like your 5th date with them. Im writing this review and drooling at the same time... so I need to go grab a napkin byeeeeeeee. P.s. Get the wings! P.s.s Get the seoul sassy sauce P.s.s.s. save me some of your leftovers =) MEOW!
