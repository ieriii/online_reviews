I drove a 12-cylinder 420 HP luxury car through the upstairs hallway of the Drake...and I have had the pleasure of an Easter brunch there the last two years. Needless to say, I have some very good memories of the place. It's one of Chicago's older landmarks, and will not disappoint in terms of elegance, and style.
