First a few things:IF you want to go to a namesake Indian restaurant and get ripped off for eating there then you might think of this place. Next IF you want to go and figure out that that is not how anyone would cook, you would surely visit this place.This is no where near authentic Indian food. I bet the chef is not Indian. The flavors were so off... like the vegetable jalfrezi had too much vinegar in it. My husband who usually is incapable of recognizing flavors was also able to pick out the fault.Lets just say we ate because it was late at night, had a groupon and both of us were hungry and we would have eaten anything edible then.Please dont be fooled into thinking that this is authentic Indian food!!
