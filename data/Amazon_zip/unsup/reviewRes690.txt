Alinea was amazing. The food and service were spectacular. Our waiter had lots of interesting things to say about the dishes and seemed happy to answer our additional questions as well.I did the wine pairings and the 12 course meal. Each dish had it's own unique presentation, including one that was placed on some sort of lavender scented pillow that slowly deflated during the course. I was expecting that it would be great, but have to mention that I do not consider myself a huge foodie. I'd rather go to a good BYOB place and bring my own medium priced bottle of wine. That said, I think Alinea was worth every penny.
