Came back here recently to try more food. We had the bread and olive oil, apple and fennel salad, beet salad(repeat) and two pastas: spicy pork and mushroom truffle. The spicy pork pasta was awesome. It was indeed spicy, but not too hard to handle it all if you're worried. The orrechiette pasta was more small shell actually, if you know the difference like I do. The mushroom truffle pasta was perfect. The noodles were drenched, but not overloaded with oil. The pasta was cooked very well, I could have gone for another bowl! Note: They pasteurize all of their cheese. Another note: Their service is cooky (in a good way) but also a little off. The original maitre d said she was giving us a table by the window. Then, when our final party arrived (only 3 people totals, the place was NOT crowded at 6pm on Thursday), another girl sat us in the dark part of the bar. I asked why we were moved and she just said "oh, because she(other maitre d) changed her mind". Um ok, I thought I was the customer and if I wanted to sit by the window that would be ok. Well, whateves, I was with good company so the seating didn't matter.
