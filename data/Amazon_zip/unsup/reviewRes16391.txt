Authentic Indian food and perhaps the best in downtown Chicago and beats the competition hands down! I have been there several times and they have never let me down. Pricey but well worth it including the $12 Valet Parking right in front of the restaurant. Hassle free, friendly atmosphere and upscale but down to earth - unbeatable combination. Try to go there with someone - I usually go Solo and they do not have good seating arrangements for a person dining alone. However, do not make the mistake of using delivery or pickup - you will miss the true essence of the food served hot. You must have the time to eat in the restaurant because that is the only way you will do justice to the food and have a good experience. Indian food does not travel well, so it does not make sense to take it out of the restaurant. Money well spent and you will never go wrong. A well patronized restaurant means the food is always fresh and always good on your stomach! No old stuff.
