I had some great fish there, but I think I need to give it another try. For the environment and the price it could have been better. We did pick the two most expensive fish on the board (tuna and halibut), but still, with two appetizers and two glasses of wine each it turned into a $120 dollar dinner. For that I want a littler romance and some better service, not this no-frills setting. The fish was pretty good, but the tuna we had was pretty tough. The sauces you can dip in are great. More in the 3.5 range and could easily earn a 4 to 4.5 from me. They get another shot some time soon!
