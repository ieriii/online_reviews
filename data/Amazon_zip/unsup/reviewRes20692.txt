Drool! The trick is to get in line around 11:45am and beat the crowds. I've tried a few tortas and the Pepito was my favorite. The quality of the local ingredients really shines through, this is no ordinary sammich! One day Rick Bayless was working behind the counter, have to admire that ethic! I have yet to try the soups and salads, but I want to.
