After our diseasterous experience Athens melting pot many years ago, I thought that gejass cafe would be better. After all it is hailed as one of the most romantic restaurants in chicago. Right. Well the romantic part is kind of correct in that it is dimly lite with tiny tables and fake grape vines everywhere. But thats where the romance ends. We were seated prompted with a reservation on a saturday night to a side enclave away from traffic. Our waiter basically told us to ignore the left side of the menu and just choose the "premier fondue dinners". We ordered the Connoisseur and the seafood. The cheese fondue - ok with stale bread. I preferred the fruits. The oil fondue - the waiter informed us the cooking time for the seafood, which turned put to be completely false. The seafood came out raw and the vegetables were over cooked. Chocolate fondue - ok but not enough fruits to dip with. For $50 per person I expected more food! Plus we ended up smelling like oil, even the coats we checked in. How is thar possible?
