Yes, this place can get crowded. And loud. And it has TVs (at least in the bar part) that you can see from most of the restaurant. That said, this is not your "only good because its local," could be rebottled heineken kind of beer. This is really good beer. Its popular with both families and bar crowd, frequently at the same time, so if you go on a Saturday you might want to go early. Like, 5 pm. The pizza is good. The white pizza is a little heavy on the cheese for my taste - and I like white pizza often - but the ingredients are fresh and tasty and the grease level is low. I grew up in Chicago, and the unique beer/fresh pizza/nice dark booths here really say home to me. Well, that and greek food. And also stuffed pizza. And some other stuff...
