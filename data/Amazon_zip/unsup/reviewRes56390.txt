I'm a local that gets to come in quite often. As much as possible whenever I get the craving for vietnamese!The owner is always so nice, he always gets us seated promptly, or when it's too busy he'll make sure we're comforted with some mini eggrolls to keep us munching until our table is ready. Once seated, the service is fantastic and the food is delicious as always. I tend to like the beef noodle soup as my appetizer and then move onto an entree like the sate shrimp, simply it's beef, or the pineapple callamari. Then comes desert, my friends and I love to order a round or two of the crispy fried bananas.it's also byob, a definite plus!
