I love Zed, but I love when my grandmother visits the most. Zed was the first stop of far too many to count the week she came into town. We started off with drinks at the Sofitel Bar and made our way to the rooftop at Zed before settling in for dinner. The ambience and decor is better than that of Fogo de Chao's or Brazzaz (yuck). The harvest table and salad bar though at fogo is better, but who comes to Zed for that crap? The meat selection is upscale and superb, with choices ranging from seabass, ahi tuna, lamb, ribeye, sirloins, pork belly, venison...you name it. It's a glutton's dream; therefore, my freaking dream. I'm DYING to come back. Waiting for a groupon or till my gma returns because with drinks the bill can be quite substantial...
