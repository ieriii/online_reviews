After receiving a personal invitation to dine at Zed 451 I thought I would give the concept a try. I was very impressed by the edginess of the atmosphere. From the floor to ceiling it was amazing. The " Harvest Table" was full of fun and delicious options. If you decide to give this restaurant a try I recommend to pay the price discounted from $50 and only have the buffet. The chefs drop by with different low end cuts of meat. Paying what I would pay to enjoy a filet of beef or have quality seafood at any other restaurant in Chicago i was disappointed. I can get chicken legs and salmon at fast food restaurants. If your dining for quantity and not quality this is your place. At the end of meal I thought the only thing that would bring me back is the atmosphere and the service. Then I changed my mind. The young lady who served us informed me that she had to give half of her tip that I was leaving for service, to pay the kitchen staff. Is this place for real? They want to serve low quality food at a high price AND use their servers to pay the kitchen labor costs. I will not be back.
