I took my partner here for his birthday and we had a very nice time and the food was great as well. I have to say the reservation process was the best part of the evening though. Not only were they friendly but they were extremely accommodating. I wasn't sure if there were going to be 10 people having dinner or 7... they told me "No problem at all, we will accommodate you no matter who shows up!" When we arrived there was a greeting printed on the menus wishing my partner a happy birthday and after dinner a desert was brought to the table with a candle... sans singing but it was very nice! Our friends took on the duty of singing Happy Birthday much to the dismay of the others in the restaurant! The food was good but I am not sure it worth the money. The experience was excellent though so I would have to say we will try it again soon.
