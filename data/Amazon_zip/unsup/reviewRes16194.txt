Such a cool place! I really loved all the vibrant colors and the high ceilings - lots of nice little decorative touches too (roses on the lamps, anyone?). It'd be the perfect place for celebrations or group dinners. For drinks I started with the raspberry mojito...which was actually a bit too sweet for me. I tried a taste of my friend's classic mojito & definitely preferred it over the raspberry. My second drink was much better - a simple caipirinha. Loved the lime-yness (word?) of it & the perfect combination of sugar & cachaca! For an entree I had the skirt steak with beans & rice - it was de-li-cious! I love how thin skirt steak is, yet it's still so tender. The chimichurri was tangy & juicy and the rice and beans were awesome - so comforting :) Such a fun dinner!
