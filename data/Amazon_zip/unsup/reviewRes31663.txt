After hearing lots of good things about this place I decided to go check it out last Saturday. I went early (9:30ish) to avoid the brunch rush that some people have complained about. I didn't have any issues. The place was half full. I took a seat at the small counter area, order a cup of coffee (beans from Metropolis Coffee Co) and the nanadict. A successful play on eggs benedict with papusas filling in for the english muffin and house made chorizo for the canadian bacon. Great flavors and definitely plenty of food. My only criticism was with the papusa. In my opinion, it was a little over cooked. Typically papusas are more tamale like in texture; they're soft and can be cut with the side of a fork. These were cooked until crispy on the outside. While it was tasty and texturally a good compliment to the poached egg, I still would have preferred a more traditional, softer consistency.  One thing I learned at Nana's is that they offer "soy-rizo" as a substitute for the chorizo if you're pork adverse. As horrifying of a though of not eating delicious, delicious pork again, I know it's not for everyone. One of the owners was kind enough to bring me out a little to try. Honestly, I was shocked how good it was. If they had put that on my plate I would not have been able to tell it was regular chorizo. It didn't have that spongy texture some faux-ground meat products have, plus it was seasoned perfectly.  I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to Brideport and another delicious meal at Nana's!
