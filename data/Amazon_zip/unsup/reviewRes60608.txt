I was taken out to eat by my parents, which is always nice when you are a college student. It actually holds some history within our family because it is where my parents had their first date. The menu's had entertaining little stories behind each of the items on the menu, and often times contained funny sarcasm. The food was Delicious and the salad bar was fantastic. A very good time 4 stars.
