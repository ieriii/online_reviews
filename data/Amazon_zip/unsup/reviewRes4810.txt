Purple Pig, I love you. But really, how could you NOT love a place who's slogan is "Swine & Wine"? Whats not to love? So, my wife & I stopped here looking for a really great meal and we found it! We sat at the bar & asked the bartender what the "protocol" was. What she said was like poetry: "Well, you just keep ordering small plates one at a time, and we will just keep refilling your wine glass. Take your time". And take time we did! 2.5 hours later, we walked out full, tipsy & completely in love with everything about the Purple Pig. I would NOT miss coming back here next time we are in town. Thank Yelpers for the help finding this place!
