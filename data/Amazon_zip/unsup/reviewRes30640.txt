I love NANA! NOT BECAUSE FOODNETWORK OR GUY WAS THERE! hahha okay maybe a little, but are you kidding with me, a great organic and healthy choice chic cafe in bridgeport! its really as good as it gets and the po boy is to drool over for. Their breakfast is great too! Don't ever order it for delivery, it will get nasty and soggy, its best to sit down and enjoy the food right there! =]
