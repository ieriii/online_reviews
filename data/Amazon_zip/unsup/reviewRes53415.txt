I really Like Hot Dougs. I think he is an innovator and pioneer in this area. After going there many times, I believe each time is a little less great as the previous time. I guess this is statistically consistent given the standard deviation of your first and ultimate experience; it would be nearly impossible to replicate that feeling every future visit.The only thing that has changed for me as far as Hot Doug's goes is that amount of time I am willing to wait in line.After going over 5 times, I wouldn't wait more than 15-20 minutes to get in, and for those who know, this is almost an impossibility.
