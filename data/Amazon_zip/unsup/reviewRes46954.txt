A spacious (especially to this NYC-dweller) restaurant with great local, veggie and other notable choices. The back room had live singer-songwriters performing on a Friday night--a nice touch.  It's kind of expensive, but very good. The roasted pepper gnocchi special was great! My friend and I kept talking about the rhubarb strawberry dessert with goats cheese ice cream on the way home. With warm wood tables, a martini that plants a tree, and good lighting, it'd be a great date place.
