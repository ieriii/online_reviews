One of the best dining experiences in Chicago. Tons of tasty small plates and an extensive wine and beer menu makes me wish I lived in the area. Better enjoyed with a group of friends, so you can try more of the amazing food. Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. Several dishes where from his recommendations and they were all great.  Oysters: nothing special but a nice starter. Fresh and clean. I had the Chef's dozen. Ham: skip the two younger varieties and go head on into the "rich/wild" (seriously that's what it says on the menu). Very tasty like a properly aged wine which coincidentally would be perfect at this point. Pork rinds, were a bit of a let down. A little too much like the crinkly bag variety especially with the powdered cheesy hot powder on top. (insert beer at this point) Little gem salad: eating those pig ears was like getting a little gem in every bite! Like crispy bacon chips! Octopus was cooked perfectly. Nice bite without being chewy. Potee, I know pronounce it wrong and you may be turned off. Order it and the only downside is that there isn't more.
