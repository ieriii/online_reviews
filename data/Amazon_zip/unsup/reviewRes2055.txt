I seriously wonder if people are responding much more positively to a place like this, to reduce dissonance when they have to do things like wait over an hour for a hot dog and fries. I'm not of that ilk. This place is pretty good and nothing more than that. The duck fat fries are not all they are hyped up to be, unfortunately. The gourmet dogs are good, though borderline overpriced, while the standard selection does not stand out like I hoped it would. A solid 3 stars...but 4 or 5? No way.
