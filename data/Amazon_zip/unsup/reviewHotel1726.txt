Really? For a 3-star hotel I get... a noisy hallway, the binging of the elevator clearly audible in my room, the world's teeniest room with smaller yet bathroom, long waits for the elevator, a crowded lobby, a swamped front desk staff and half the lobby blocked off for a private event. Harumph. We chose this place because they're dog friendly, but the accoutrement that according to their website were supposed to come to our pooch were complete no-shows.  Instead, the noisy hallway and banging of doors and elevator noises kept her up all night, pretty much ruining any chance of sleep. So the decor is quirky. And for $1 extra you can get "continental breakfast" (really, just Costco mini muffins and danishes). But it ain't all that.
