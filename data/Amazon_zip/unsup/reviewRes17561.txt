Love the decor. Hated the food. We had several appetizers did not like none of them. Our entree was just okay. I looked at the reviews on the site before attending, and they were pretty decent. I guess you have to have a taste for this type of food. It was three of us that ate, and none of us liked it. The drinks were good. I had a frozen mango magarita, and my friend had a mango mojito, these drinks were good.
