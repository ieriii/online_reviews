Pequod's pizza was quite possibly the biggest let down of a recent trip to Chicago. My host loves LOVES their pizza, and quite frankly, I've had better from a roach truck in downtown Los Angeles. They don't skimp on the toppings, that's one thing that is a positive I guess. But there is too much (bottom) crust, too much sauce, barely enough cheese, and not nearly enough flavor. We got a simple pepperoni pizza and I couldn't even taste the cheese. The crust was SO dry and bland that it almost brought me to tears. I love pizza, we're really good friends and after this experience (we got delivery) I was let down so incredibly much. If you're looking for a delicious Chicago style pizza, you're better off checking out SUPERIOR Chicago style pizza at PIZZERIA DUE. They actually put cheese on their pizza and along with a wine-sauce, it tastes AMAZING. Brutal honesty coming... I felt like pure SHIT after 2 slices of this pizza, I thought hey, maybe it gets better if you have more. WRONG. I'll keep my more personal notes to myself, but really, you won't want to eat this pizza because it was have some down right terrifying effects on your insides.
