Full disclosure: I did not actually stay here. But my friends did! And I was with them during check-in and saw their room and all that, so I deem that I'm qualified to review the Amalfi. I actually work next door, so I can tell you that the doormen are super friendly - they always have a nice smile for you or a quick hello as you walk by, guest or not. Every once in a while, they've even helped me get a cab - thanks guys! The desk staff is equally pleasant. They couldn't have been nicer during check-in! There were a lot of people waiting around, and while they were efficient about getting you settled, they never made you feel rushed. The room was nicely decorated, very clean, and a good size. Everything looked fairly new - they seem to do a good job of taking care of things around here. There's also a complimentary happy hour for guests starting at 5:30 and let me tell you - it is wildly popular! At 5:30 on the dot, there was pretty much a mad rush of people going up to the Ravello Lounge. It's probably a little less nuts during the week, but I'm betting the place was packed based on how many people were headed up to the 6th floor. Overall, my friends had a good experience here, and I was pleased with everything I saw - I would certainly recommend the Amalfi to Chicago-bound visitors!
