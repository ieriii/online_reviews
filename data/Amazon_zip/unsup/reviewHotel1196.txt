I worked on a startup in Chicago in 2010. I have stayed in this hotel for 115 nights since then..so there's little I haven't seen here - good or bad. One time, I hadn't slept in three days and was looking down at my phone while walking, so I even saw the ladies room. It smelled like roses. As someone who travels a lot, the single most important thing to me is service. You get used to the TSA, you can live with bad food, but the last thing you want is someone pissing you off or not meeting your expectations. This Hyatt consistently went above and beyond and earned every one of their five stars. What's good? Very nice building/rooms, amazing view, incredibly friendly staff, easy taxi access, nice gym, and pretty good food. What could use work? The prices are tough - room service is overpriced, and if you aren't a Diamond member, wifi could get expensive. Also, although it's extremely close to downtown, it's not quite walkable, and there isn't much directly surrounding the hotel. Staying there as much as I did, it was like being at home. 99% of the time everything was perfect (I even got scotch and cake on my birthday). What mattered more, though, was that when things weren't right, like a messed up reservation or loud neighbors, they were taken care of immediately. The Hyatt O'Hare is a slightly more modern hotel (less convention-y) but I stay here whenever I can. I saw the staff do extraordinary things for people time and time again, so I know this wasn't all because I stayed there so much. I'm actually coming back in August with some friends just to visit. I highly recommend the hotel and still hope that one day, I will marry one of the girls from the front desk in the Forno Italian Trattoria.
