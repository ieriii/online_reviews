I am almost afraid to add another 5 star review to this place. See, I live 2 blocks from here and was hoping to make this place my new second home. It's going to be hard to do that if all these great reviews make it impossible to get a seat here!  My lady and I went here for dinner on Friday evening thinking "let's check out the new place". Little did we know it would be one of the best meals of our lives. Maybe that's a bit of hyperbole...but it was damn delicious.  We waited patiently for our table at the bar and became jealous as amazingly presented plates passed by us. After only a few minutes an employee came by and offered to take our coats! We ordered a second round of drinks and because of a slight mix up were given them at half price. Once seated (a little over an hour), and despite being at capacity, the waiters made sure we were well taken care of. And they were friendly! Unfortunately, they were out of the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe (which can also be looked at as; they get their food fresh). So instead we had to "settle" for the Duck Egg on Beef tongue hash and black truffle sauce. I never knew an egg could be so delicious! It cut like a piece of meat. We also had the Ravioli with shaved foie gras and mushrooms, Kobe beef meatballs and creamy polenta, and Candy apple & butternut squash puree in salty caramel sauce. Everything was outstanding.  Final bill: $40 (not including 2 rounds of drinks at the bar). I would not have been surprised if we paid double that considering the food we ate.  Reasonably priced food + great, friendly service + good beer = my new favorite place.
