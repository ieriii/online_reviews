The food and beer were awesome, really tasty and not crazy expensive. The wait staff wasn't great - but they weren't bad. They were pretty busy, so they seemed overworked. I don't know how a restaurant can avoid that when they get big crowds like ours.I'd still recommend it, I just say go when you know it's not busy.
