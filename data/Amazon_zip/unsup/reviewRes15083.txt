This place is amazing. I can't believe it's taken me this long to get there. The Violet Hour is an institution in itself. We came here for date night before our reservation for dinner down the street. We'd been warned about the wait, so we got there right at 6 when it opened. I LOVED the atmosphere. It's amazing to walk into complete darkness when it's still light out! We were seated on the side in two tall chairs and a table that was candlelit. Very romantic. And the way it's set up, you really feel like you're in your own little corner. It's very intimate. I ordered the Berry Cobbler drink (I think that's what it's called) and it was delicious. I then ordered the She'll Never Settle. Both were so well thought out and wonderful. My boyfriend had the Juliet and Romeo, which was delicious as well. We got the olive appetizer, as well as some cheese and sausage. The service was impeccable. The waiter was super helpful with drink suggestions. I will be back!
