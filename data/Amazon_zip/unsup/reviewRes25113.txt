For a special night out, my girlfriend and I recently used a $25 off Geja's coupon I had lying around. Since she and I are both vegetarian, this meant our entire 4 course meal totaled around $30, pretty much a steal in the city. They run offers like this all the time, and while the surf and turf style meals are pretty pricey, veggie or chicken lovers can really come out ahead on these things. The full meal includes a salad, cheese fondue with fruit and bread, the entree of your choice, and chocolate fondue with coffee or tea. The meal was epic. I mean, aside from the lovely cheese and fresh bread, the amount of vegetables we were given for our entree was intimidating. We definitely left about an entire eggplant behind (don't hate, we had to limit ourselves somewhere, and between mushrooms and eggplant, mushrooms will win every time). All in all, the service was excellent (we lucked upon a fellow vegetarian who didn't judge out non-meat loving ways or think we were trying to skimp out on the expensive stuff. The food was great. The atmosphere was lovely, and we enjoyed our time together.
