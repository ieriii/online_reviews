I very much enjoyed this different Gastropub! Although the service was a tad slow (just a bit), and we had kind of a hard time even finding a seat/getting a table cleared off in the bar area, the staff WAS nice and quite charming. I especially liked that the GM came over and said, 'hi' to us (a lovely Irish man). Now, the food...  We popped in for a quick glass of wine and some apps before a musical we were seeing at the Auditorium Theatre. We started with the sea scallops, which did lack a bit of flavor, but were perfectly done. No harm there. We also had the haddock cake, which was excellent! Although we had NO IDEA what one was when we went in, we knew we had to order the famous Scotch Egg. I'm very glad we did. Now, if you're watching your cholesterol, or fat, or calorie intake, this dish is certainly not for you. Egg - meat - breading - fried! It WAS different, and seemed a bit scary at first but...WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE!? Seriously, it was tasty! The mustard sauce was quite yummy too! With a very nice choice of wine and European beer, I think it's a great after-work spot for cocktails, and also a wonderful and different place to dine. I'll be back to try a full dinner!
