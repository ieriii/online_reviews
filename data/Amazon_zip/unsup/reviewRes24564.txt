Delicious. Came here for Restaurant Week and was not disappointed. Ambiance is so nice. Dimly lit, romantic and very relaxing (which is good because you will be there for a couple hours). Food is very good. The Restaurant Week menu included a salad, cheese fondue app, a selection of meats for the entree and a chocolate fondue dessert. The cheese wasn't my favorite (found it to be a bit gritty in texture), but the husband really liked it. I ended up eating some of the bread, apples and grapes without cheese and was happy with that. The salad was good, but the lettuce at the end was soaked in the vinaigrette, so I would request light dressing next time. Entree was awesome. Almost perfect portion of meat and veggies for the two of us - only had a couple of pieces of chicken and veggies left between us. Husband had shrimp, beef and chicken; I had chicken and beef. Very good (especially the choices of sauces) and directions were clear - even for a fondue newbie like myself :) Dessert is where it's at. Fresh strawberries, pineapple and bananas, as well as pound cake, marshmallows and rice krispies (meh). Be sure to save room! I'd go again. Yes, it's a bit pricy, but you get very fresh ingredients and will have a great time. Service was very relaxed and non-pushy, though I wish we could have moved through the process a bit faster. You will smell disgusting afterward, so make sure you have some Febreeze on hand at home if you don't want to wash/dry clean everything you wore at Geja's!
