Imagination is rare, hence the line but imagination is worth waiting for. I had the game of the week (this time Ostrich with cherries and cheddar) which was mind blowing. The veggie dog while nothing as creative as the others tasted just like a real hot dog, which I suppose is quite creative if you've ever tasted one of those horrible Smart Dogs from Whole Foods. Although the line was long, it seemed directly matched up with tables making it easy to get one right after you ordered. Duck fat fries: put this on Randolph and we'd have an Iron Chef Doug.
