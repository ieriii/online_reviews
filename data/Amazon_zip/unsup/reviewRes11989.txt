Ha, Piece! I don't knead you...I mean NEED you anymore. I live on the East Coast now, and I can get pizza uber cheap, super delicious and by the slice! But OMG if I am ever subjected to Chicagoan/Midwestern life again (DEEP DISH style), I promise...I swear on my life...I will never degrade you again.
