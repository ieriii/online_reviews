I'm between 4 and 5 stars...I've been here several times w/large groups of clients, drinks with friends, and family dinners. Without fail, the service has always been flawless, which is huge in my book. Obviously they have won many awards for the stunning patio in back; a favorite spot for dining al fresco. I also think the food is pretty delicious. All time faves are the piccolo ravioli, arugula pizza, and most specials. Their specials are seasonal, and usually delicious, and I love that you can do app portions of their pastas. Oh, also you can't go wrong with one of their templeton rye Manhattans.
