Stayed here while visiting family in the area. The room was lovely, very comfortable. We had dinner one night in the Italian themed restaurant -- my risotto was top notch, my son's fettucini great, and my wife's salad also great. Good chianti by the glass if a bit sparing on the pour. The pools on the third floor (indoor and outdoor) are designed for lap swimming.
