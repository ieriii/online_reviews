Wilde is a good place grab dinner and drinks with friends on a cold winter night, and the food is pretty good. The atmosphere felt very cozy, though anything besides the 10 degree weather we had would have probably felt cozy at that point. I was satisfied with the food, though nothing was wildly amazing. We started with the wings -- they were ok, not as much flavor in the sauce as I would hope for in wings. My sister and I split the wilde burger and the mac 'n cheese. Macaroni was the best thing we had -- it was a creamy mixture baked in a boat topped with bread crumbs and some type of ham or bacon or something. The burger was fine -- good sized, juicy, overall better than your average burger, but still just a burger. Menu prices lean toward the higher end in comparison to most bar fare, but the whole experience is nicer than your average bar, so its worth the few extra dollars you pay. Next time I might come just for drinks to check out the weekend scene. **UPDATE -- Went here just for drinks on the Sunday night of memorial day weekend, and loved it. Sitting in the library was the best part, mostly because they have Goosebumps books in their collection. Awesome.
