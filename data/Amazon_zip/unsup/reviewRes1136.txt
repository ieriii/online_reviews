A friend of mine was in town the other day and was determined to go here. So who am I to deny a friend some encased meat?! We got there early -- we were in line at 10:20 a.m. behind five othe people. Got in quick, got our food quick and enjoyed every minute of it. Just get the foie gras dog. I'm not going to describe it -- I'm sure others on here have already beaten me to the punch -- just get it. I didn't think I'd like it; I loved it. My friend gave it her four curse-word salute, which is basically like a critic giving a movie five stars. Go there. As soon as you can.
