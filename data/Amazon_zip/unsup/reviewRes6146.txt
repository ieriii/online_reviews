Outstanding. Expect to wait. Expect the wait to be worth it. Really hard to go wrong but we love the foccacia with soft cheese, the spaghetti with black pepper and pecorino (sounds boring, but by god, it ain't), the giant rigatoni with sausage, and the single massive ravioli you cut open to reveal a deliciously gooey egg, ricotta and spinach mess.
