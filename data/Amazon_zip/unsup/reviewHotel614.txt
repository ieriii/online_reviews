As others have mentioned, warm chocolate cookies upon check-in were delicious! A great treat after a long flight from the west coast to Chicago. Great location. Walking distance to Navy Pier and to Magnificent Mile. I got a good deal from priceline but unfortunately, we got a room on the 3rd floor with basically no view. Beds and pillows were very comfortable! Room was cleaned everyday with no issues. Sucks there is no free wifi in the rooms but there is AT&T wifi available as well as free wifi down in the lounge. Didn't use the gym but the equipment looked new. Overall a pleasant stay for our trip to Chicago.
