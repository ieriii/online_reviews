If you go there, it is of course for having a hot dog. But a very special hot Dog ! This place is a place to go especially on Friday. Fries are cooked in duck fat ! Amazingly good (Do not eat on a regular basis :-) ) Even if you are not a Hot dog person, i recommend to go at least once. The owner is a really nice guy. Cash only
