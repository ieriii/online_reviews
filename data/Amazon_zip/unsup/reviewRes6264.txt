Davanti has a great atmosphere, but I don't know that I would call it romantic or intimate; the volume is a little too high for either. The ambiance really is a great fusion of popular music with a classic, earthy Italian interior. The wait staff here was really sweet and attentive, and the whole place gave off a cool, casual and fun vibe. The food here really is delicious. The truffle egg toast lived up to the hype. It takes 10 minutes to prepare, but it's worth it. The richness of the eggs and truffle oil was perfectly offset by the sour bitterness of the asparagus. The risotto carbonara surprised me with an earthy and almost oaky flavor, but it was rich and delicious. The pizza della terra was good, though I think the braised leeks were a little too dominant.  Hopefully I'll get to go back soon and get to try the dessert I was too full to sample. The wait can be a bit daunting -- my date and I went there on a Thursday night and had to wait about an hour -- but it was well worth it.
