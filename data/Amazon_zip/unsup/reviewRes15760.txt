Recently went here for lunch and had a great time. The staff is very friendly, they didn't mind the strange man eating by himself and reading the paper on his phone. I had the chivito; any sandwich that has steak, ham and bacon on it has to be one of the greatest inventions since the sliced pretzel roll it was on. The place just looks great also, and if you sign up on their mailing list, they send you all kinds of cool deals. I had dinner hear last June and again it was an awesome experience, I just wish I could remember what I ate. Rum drinks will do that to you. If you get a chance, head here for lunch; by Loop standards it's pretty reasonable.
