I've gone back since my first review and found a whole lot more to like about this place. They have three times as many burgers now. Downside is still no more sides (fries and mac & cheese only). I would like to see a salad, white bean chicken chili, soup, pasta salad or something else as a healthy side. Huge upside is they have one of the best margaritas I've ever had, it was amazing. The night I went was a total sausage fest, I guess the rocker, punk and metal chicks haven't found this place yet, but hopefully soon. I will definitely be back. Ken
