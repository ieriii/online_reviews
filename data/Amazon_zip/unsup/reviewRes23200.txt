Not that this place needs any more good reviews: I've been coming here since I moved back to Chicago and a friend started working there. BYOB which consequently translates into drink-all-you-can-drink for me, only adds to all the perks of this place. (cash only) Inexpensive, delicious and great portions. Not to mention the eye-candy that is the Irazu staff. Hey boys! I've probably tried just about everything on the menu. I love the chicken soup, as a soup addict, you cant go wrong with either, the black bean is also very good. Appetizers: The ceviche is delish, (i would skip the guac, although its good, $6.00 set back on something I can make at home) Yuca, fried or baked is bomb. patacones or empanadas come in a close 3rd. Sandwiches: I would go costa ricon or pepito unique: I love the veggie salad! cabbage and beets! Veggie burrito is great as well. I love the chile relleno especially, and the tilapia is awesome If youre in the mood for meat I would go with the casado or the tico and get the mixed rice (as opposed to just white) Desserts: im a big bread pudding lover or an oatmeal shake is a people pleaser ;) OH and the coffee/horchata mix I haven't found elsewhere and is a great delicious pick me up!
