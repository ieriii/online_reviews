The Hopleaf Bar is a great place to go and enjoy a nice craft domestic beer along Clark Street. I visited this place with a buddy and we both got a couple of beers and were able to hangout and enjoy the environment. One downside to this place was that it was very crowded, even on a Tuesday night. Other than that though, this place is a great place to visit with friends. Though I didn't have any of the food, I saw a bunch of people enjoying appetizers and meals, and all of them looked great. I even heard the customers raving about the food here. I will be returning in the near future to check out the menu for myself. The beer selection is fantastic, with well over a hundred beers available from all over the country. The service here is fast, friendly, and professional. I highly recommending coming out to the Hopleaf for a fun night with great beer and food.
