I cannot give a well-rounded review of Hot Doug's because I only tried one hot dog, the Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage w/ Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. http://bit.ly/doFHN9 After hearing and reading so much about this infamous dog, not gonna lie I had high expectations of it. But to be brutally honest, the dog deserves 2 stars because indeed, it is "meh" and "I've (definitely) experienced better." --the sausage itself was okay/mediocre/nothing special --hated "havin to pick the skin of the sausage out of my mouth" http://bit.ly/dyVvNZ every couple of bites --the truffle aioli condiment was perhaps the tastiest thing about this hot dog --the foie gras mousse was "velvety & feta cheese-y in texture... yet a tad funky, taste-wise" http://bit.ly/dyVvNZ --the sprinkle of fleur de sel on top does nothing to complement the already very complex flavours in the dog --since all the ingredients in this dog are quite soft, another reason I didn't enjoy it very much is that it lacked contrast in textures (i.e. crunchiness with tenderness, etc.) --eating this hot dog felt like eating pure mushiness Overall, I'm glad I went the adventurous route (as per usual) by trying the Foie Gras dog. Certainly can't wait to try many of the other hot dogs at Hot Doug's... like the Keira Knightley or the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage.
