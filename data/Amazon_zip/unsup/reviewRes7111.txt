I have to say, I went into Chicago Q with low expectations and emerged a convert. I mean, knowing it's in the heart of the Gold Coast, you'd think it'd be a scene, with overpriced drinks, food and douchebags galore. You'd be wrong. The restaurant is beautifully designed. Gorgeous. Really tasteful, white coffered walls, rich leather seats, lovely flatware and open, high ceilings. The staff are all extremely friendly--from the Manager and hostesses who greeted us to the servers who guided us through our meal. The barbecue itself is awesome--the meats are moist--I had a mix of Chicken and Pork and the Chicken was perfectly done (usually it's the worst meat at barbecue places--dry and tough, but not so at "q"). They bring the table a selection of three sauces to choose from (nice touch), and the sides are heavenly. The wine list is also AWESOME. Amazing, diverse and totally fairly priced selection. And perfectly paired with the food. Whoever wrote it did a great job. The best thing about this place (and the thing that surprised me the most) is that even though this place is an "Upscale BBQ joint", the prices were totally fair. I hope this place does really well--it's a great spot with awesome, fairly priced food and wine, beautiful ambience and kind, helpful, friendly service.
