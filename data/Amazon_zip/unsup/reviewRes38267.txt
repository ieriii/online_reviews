Our pizza came to the table not quite hot all the way through. Like, solidly warm, but by the time we moved to our second slice, it was cool enough that the cheese had congealed into a superdense mass. It was plenty tasty, but I wouldn't wait in line ten minutes for it, much less the hour + we waited. Nothing life changing is happening here. Move along.
