Came here for brunch, which I might like even more than their dinner. Lighting struck, and our party of three was seated immediately. Chicken and waffles were great, but the pork belly hash was the star of that dish. Tried my friend's biscuits and gravy, and if I could, I'd bathe in it. The sausage white gravy was what my dreams are sometimes made of. Extra points for the coffee presses they provide. Service was decent, and they didn't pressure us to leave our table despite the growing line that was forming by the time we left. Little more laid back on Sundays, which was a relief. Sunday is a day of rest, even for hipsters.
