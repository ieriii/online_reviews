we waited 1.5 hours for this. great reviews on yelp and heard from some other folks that this was the place to be. here's what we ordered: foie gras and sauternes duck sausage w/truffile aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris --- tasty sausage. i'd give it a 7 out of 10. smoked applewurst pork sausage w/sweet curry mustard and tomme de savoie cheese - tastier, slightly sweet. i'd give it a 9 out of 10. corn dog - basic corn dog. it took me beyond full at this point. nothing special, but at least it was only $1.50 fries - we got two kinds: regular with cheese on it (it was good, not great). and fries that are fried in duckfat. to be honest, i could tell the difference in terms of richness in the duck fat fries, and the fries were good, but nothing spectacular like holy shit i gotta grab a handful of them and jack off w/them. the richness you get with the duck fat isn't worth the premium price or the bad cholesterol. all in all, glad we did it. it lived up to its hype and it was certainly the best hot dog i've ever had. however, it wasn't at all the best $9 meal i've ever had, you know what i mean? i wouldn't eat there again. i like gourmet burgers, but when it comes to hotdogs, i guess basic ones are best. they didn't have the greatest buns, just plain, unwarm, and pretty dense -- delivering a concussion to your self-consciousness.
