Why would I want to crowd into smirky Hopleaf, with its bitchy door guys and arrogant bartenders when friendly Simon's and Konak's are only a couple yards away? Skip it. Just 'cause Dan Savage hangs out there and they serve some Belgian ale made from polar bear pee doesn't mean you should go. The food is good, but so is the food at my mom's house and she won't pick a fight with you if you burst into song. Seriously, don't try that here. Hopleafers hate joy!
