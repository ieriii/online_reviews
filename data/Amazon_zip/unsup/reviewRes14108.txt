I went to Glenn's again on Thursday of this last week (4/8/10), and had a Grilled Chicken w/ Bacon sandwich on texas toast, and once again it was great food, the manager there at the time was super friendly and made conversation with me because I was there eating by myself, which I think is very nice because they don't have to. And my waiter was also great, I'm pretty sure his name was Roy... if not I know its close to that lol So if someone in management checks this, give him a pat on the back because he was very friendly and did a great job! :)
