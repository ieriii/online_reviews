Flavor explosion in my mouth with every bite. My mouth literally just watered thinking about my dining experience last night. I had heard of this place, but not a lot. I didn't know what to expect... so expect a long wait. We waited an hour and a half, but we were content sitting on the bench with a bottle of red wine and we talked the bartender into letting us order an appetizer while we were waiting (that's what you can do when you're a group of cute persuasive chicks). The appetizer we ended up devouring was the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta smear. NOM NOM NOM. It was so good. Reminded me of a ragout almost - slow cooked tender pork in a red sauce with a big hunk of creamy cheese on top with toasted bread slathered in olive oil. You just can't go wrong with that. So finally we get seated (small restaurant - not a lot of seating inside - there is a nice outdoor seating section). Tapas style - who knew? We ordered the: -Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes -Jamon Serrano with Oyster Mushrooms & Fried Duck Egg over Grilled Bread -Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde -Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. SO much flavor, SO delicious, SO going back. The only thing I have had better elsewhere is the octopus (it is the BEST at Caf Iberico - just an fyi). The chicken was the best chicken I think I've ever had - crispy skin, tender meat, fresh tzatziki. Milk braised pork shoulder - holy scrumptious, amazing food experience. You will not want to share it. We finished this incredible experience with the Sicilian Iris (Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche) Sinful. Best dessert I have had in a long time. You have to get it. Basically... you have to try this place. It is worth the wait. It is worth the price. It is just ... a necessary experience.
