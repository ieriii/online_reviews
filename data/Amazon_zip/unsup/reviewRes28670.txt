I must say THE best Mexican food I have had outside of Mexico. I went there on a date who promised me that I would enjoy it since I was complaining I haven't had good Mexican cuisine since I used to live in L.A. The decor is colourful and lively, and even on frigid Wednesday night it was jam packed. Reservations are a must, though, there is a bar in the next room which is just as packed for waiting. I saw people of all ages and in all group settings come from laid-back rocker types to business men and women in suits. The guacamole was perfect, and the ceviche Yucanteco and the ceviche Fronterizo (my fav!) were not too acidic. Their margaritas are made with fresh squeezed lime juice, not the typical sirop mix they sell in the stores, which is a definite palette pleaser. The tamales as well were delicious and served in authentic banana leaves. All in all, it was a very pleasant meal and all the dishes were beautifully served. Service too, was impeccable. I would definitely return for a good quality Mexican meal.
