Stopped here for dessert after a less than ideal experience at Urban Union down the street and our experience at Davanti Enoteca salvaged our night. The ambiance is great -- everyone was having a great time over a great meal and drinks. The staff was very friendly, whether it was the host or the bartender. We had the carrot cake and the chocolate mousse desserts with some moscato. Everything was delicious and the service superb. We'll definitely be back for dinner next time!
