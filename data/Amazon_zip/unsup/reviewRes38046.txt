This place never fails. Great beer, great food and an even better atmosphere! The beer selection is stellar and, unlike most places that have specialty beers, they have a decent selection of wine and liquor as well. My two favorite things about this place are the mussels and for a few months a year they have smelt! It's fantastic! Also, the staff is very friendly and easy to get along with. The only reason I gave it four stars (versus five) is because it can be really noisy in there and the wait can be longer, depending on the night. I would recommend this place to anyone.
