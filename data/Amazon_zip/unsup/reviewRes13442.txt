I CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK HERE! We pass Revolution all the time and it was always SO packed...and now I know why! We came on a Sunday night shortly after six and although it was crowded, it wasn't packed and we were sat right away! The decor is beautiful! I love the custom fists they have at their bar, very cool! Our server was Matthew, who was just awesome! He was patient and answered all our questions about their microbrews. And when we couldn't decide? He brought us samples of what he thought we would like! For drinks I had the Coup D' Etat (7% ABV) and then the Iron fist pale ale(I think that was 5.5% ABV) both were great! And all of their microbrews are either $5 or $6! For food I had the Smokehouse burger, which had pepper jack cheese and pulled pork with their hand cut fries, truly amazing!!! My bf had one of their margherita pizzas that he killed in like 5 min, so I assumed he liked that as well! Food, drinks, service was all GREAT! I'm so stoked I was *finally* able to experience Revolution and I will totally wait an hour for a table next time!!
