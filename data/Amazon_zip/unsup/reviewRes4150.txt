Wowie-wow-wow-wow. Speechless (almost). The most stunning food experience I've had in ages (similar to Alinea, but cheaper, more casual and more culinarily edgey). It's certainly not for food pussies. A great deal of the menu would be lost on a lot of people. F*cking amazing. Example: Bacon puree: tastes like prune + yeasty beef bouillon (vegemite?) + furniture polish. I know, WTF??? It works, trust me. Service is private, personal and enthusiastic. The BYOB feature is a good one BUT, I swear to Jesus they were over pouring the ladies. Hic!
