I've been here twice. The first time was for a business dinner with a large group. In this setting I was able to try a wide variety of dishes, all of which were good but not great. That said, I think it was more my preferences than the food that led to my average dining experience. I made reservations to go back with a few friends to try it again and order a few different dishes. We showed up on time and were asked to wait for our table. Over an hour later we hadn't been seated though numerous others had come in and been seated since we arrived. We asked when we might be seated and the hostess was rude. We left without being seated and I will not be back.
