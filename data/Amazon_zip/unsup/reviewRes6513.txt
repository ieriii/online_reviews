Awesome... I've been here multiple times (it doesn't help that I live down the street). I love this place. The food is great, the prices are better! I once placed an order for carryout and arrived a little late. They actually made my order again and gave me an order of their truffle egg toast (which is amazing!!!), while I waited for my food to come out, and comped a beer. This place has lots of small dishes which are perfect for sharing also!
