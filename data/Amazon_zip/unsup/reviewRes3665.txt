I wish I could parallel park better! I wish they were open 24 hours a day! I love this place! I've been there 5-6 times and have preached the glory of the food to several of my friends- who are now loyal followers! The Seoul Sassy- sweet, tangy sauce with scallions on perfectly fried chicken! *drool* It's 9:18 am and I am drooling at work! The Plain Jane- just as good as the Seoul Sassy, but I have to say the Seoul Sassy wins. It's something about the sauce! I get the whole chicken. I know people like the wings, but I like the variety of having different cuts of the chicken...white/dark.. you know? The bulgogi burrito with the atomic sauce- spicy mayo-ey sauce! Always ALWAYS ask for extra sauce! The burrito is filled with rice, carrots, lettuce, corn and bulgogi, wrapped in a nice tortilla. Now, since I try to stay healthy, I only share the burrito- it's huge anyways! And the fries.... *drool x2* I need to learn how to parallel park better.......
