We lucked out and got in on a last minute cancellation after much phone and walk-in stalking by my cohort. Utter serendipity, as it was his birthday. Schwa is brilliant. We splurged on the 9 course menu and were there for 3+ hours. The dishes were complex, stylish and- most importantly- phenomenally tasty. Overall, it's the ideal balance of sweet and savory. Their take on beer and pretzels was wildly enjoyable. It was some sort of beer brewed by monks in a land far away that was injected with cheese. Coupled with the best pretzel morsel I've ever had, garnished with a mustard chip and dill sauce. Was also wowed by the jellyfish pad thai and sea urchin sorbet (an extra course they threw in). But my 2 favorites were the most unexpected ones. First, the liver and onions which was served with a textured risotto. Sounds gag-worthy but I wanted seconds. And then the antelope (yes, antelope). Don't want to know how they got it, but it was perfect and now is my protein of choice. This is a tiny, almost dumpy spot. But it gives this fine dining extravaganza an unusual neighborhood feel that is endearing. The chefs serve each course, including the brainchild, Michael. He's the frazzled mad scientist, with veins popping, who you know is a culinary mastermind just by looking at him. The experience abruptly ended with my alcoholic friend spilling a glass of red wine that vaulted over half the restaurant. And then he fled with one of the chefs chasing after. I think I'm blacklisted by association. But am willing to sport a disguise so I can return.
