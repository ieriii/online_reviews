This was my first time at Geja's Cafe. It definitely is a really romantic atmosphere with cozy seats (bordering on the cramped side) and dim lighting. Loved the decor. We ended up ordering two entrees, and each came with cheese and chocolate fondue: 1) Prince Geja's Combination: aged beef tenderloin, lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, and chicken breast ($48.95) 2) Atlantic Sea Scallops ($33.95) Tip: If you're into scallops, order the Atlantic Sea Scallops. They were 3 times larger than the scallops in the PG Combo. I'm not usually into cheese, but the cheese fondue was phenomenal as it was admixed with white wine. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. It was served with apples, bread, and assorted veggies. The chocolate fondue was okay -- would've liked more pound cake for dipping. It also came with strawberries and bananas. The entrees themselves were fresh, and the accompanying eight sauces were a nice touch. Will definitely return once I have a pretty penny again.
