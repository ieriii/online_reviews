If you have read any of my reviews for other breakfast places in Chicago you will see none of them are that great. The reason why is because good breakfast is tough to find these days in Chicago. Everything is too trendy, too expensive and does not get back to basics. Wishbone is none of those things. A friend and I had a quick breakfast at Wishbone earlier this week before work and it was out of this world! I had the cornmeal pancakes and the home fries and my friend had the black bean cakes which came with your choice of bread, grits and eggs. All of it was absolutely outstanding. I could not stop eating the cornmeal pancakes, they were so unique and flavorful and I loved the scallions baked in and the red pepper topping that came with it. My friend's black bean cakes were delicious (and I don't even LIKE beans) as were her cheese grits. I would highly recommend Wishbone. I cannot wait to go try it again, I also want to try their lunch or dinner!
