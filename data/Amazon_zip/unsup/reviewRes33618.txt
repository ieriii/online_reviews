I have to agree with all the falafel love. I've eaten so much falafel from all sorts of places, and I've made much myself. Their falafel is definitely one of my favorites (the other top being Pita Inn way out in Skokie.) I had the medium falafel sandwich. I didn't care much for the spicy sauce because I think it took away from the taste of the falafel. I also had some lentil soup, which was pretty good. I prefer my lentil soup with vegetables and chunks of things though. Their pita tasted fresh and held up well. I can eat here for super cheap, and I will definitely keep going back. Also, I really enjoy reading the bathroom walls.
