Alinea..... Grant Achatz you're a genius!!! My friends and I came to Chicago over the MLK weekend for the purpose of trying out Alinea to see if it lives up to all the hype... food has never been the same since leaving Alinea. My favorite was the canard, puff pastry is just not the same anymore. =(  Presentation was awesome and dessert... Chef Achatz can make my desserts anytime!!! This place is a must try before you die! period!
