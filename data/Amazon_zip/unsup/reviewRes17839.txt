this place made me feel like i was somebody... great vibe/ atmosphere. wonderful drink selection, stuff you wont find anywhere else. very smart bar tenders, who were only mildly douchey, which is understandable because they all probably would rather be modeling for a living... besides the crafty drink selection i think my favorite part of the place was the entrance... from the outside it looks like there is nothing there. but then you walk in and... well. you'll see.
