Eesh, even those that take the money at the front door of a historical poetry and music place can be broken and bitter. I arrived at the door on Poetry Slam ngiht with my writer professor friend from Cleveland, editor of a national magazine. Myself, a professor too and software entrepreneur, two Masters, musician, newspaper editor, author and poet -- listed in Poets&Writers Directory. So we're not slouches, and upstanding.Yet upon walking off the street out of the light into the Green Mill entrance area, we were met by a bullying bald bouncer in biker wear. When he wouldn't stop loudly accosting my unassuming friend for being too loud -- I think we said finally here to each other when we walked in -- I politely stated that he was the loud one, not us. Then he kept pressing, pushing obnoxiousness. Threatening us! We couldn't understand what was going on. Then some old lady slurping a drink at the bar chimed in, You're out of here. Leave. In retrospect, I often wonder if she was the owner, or just some slobby drunk. We left, went to Kingston Mines and then Buddy Guy's -- had a great time. Laughing about our experience at the Green Mill. Wondering if the owners knew how maniacal the door-tender is. How he chases away customers. And that witch. The image will never leave our minds. I had been to Green Mill many times, especially back in the 80s, even reading my stuff there. That's the only disappointment about being refused entrance to the Green Mill -- we wanted to read our poetry. Oh well, we thought, their loss. Not sure if or when I'll ever return there again. Not sure if that bouncer mentality will greet me or us next time. No, we hadn't been drinking. Yes, we were very professional, as always, and well-behaved. I just hope that type of treatment doesn't greet you if you dare to visit the Green Mill.
