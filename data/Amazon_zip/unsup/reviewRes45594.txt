A cozy place to grab a meal and relax. The decor and ambiance are top-notch, with a real fireplace and a library! It's not loud at all, and not too dark. The staff are courteous and very knowledgeable. Things get busy at times, but I think the wait is worth it. The food is great for the price. Typical dinners run $12-$18 and are sized well. There really is something for everyone, from burgers and sandwiches to soups and salads. I had the meatloaf and LOVED it, and my company had the mac & cheese -- also tasty.
