I hate that there is just a scale of 1-5 with no middle points or anything. Anyway, simply awesome. I love traditional Mexican food and this takes it with a twist. Nice and simple preps that show the flavors off superwell. The cocktails are nice as well. The best part of the menu is that they have about a dozen small plate options which gives you the best opportunity to try as much as you can. Plus, this place offers a very reasonably priced choice, just expect a long wait.
