Incredible!My fiancee and I brought some friends in from Boston last week and we were all blown away by our experience. From top to bottom, this was a great evening. First off, the restaurant is beautiful. Although a little difficult to find (it's inconspicuously located in the Blackstone Hotel) the decor and vibe is perfect. Great attention to detail.We were seated within five minutes of our reservation and our table was smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. Great views and plenty of space.Our server (Fred on the check) was over promptly to tell us about the menu and offer drink suggestions. Although the restaurant was packed, we all felt like we were shown plenty of attention. After a great description of the menu and cuisine, we decided to be adventurous and go with the chef's tasting menu. We were not disappointed! It was three courses and about 16 different items, all spectacular. Fred was there throughout the meal to make sure we knew all the ingredients and flavors as well as to explain the wine pairings we decided to get.Food highlights: Bacon wrapped dates; serrano fig salad; short rib pizza thing; lamb chops; patatas bravasWine highlights: Gine and Gine was our favorite on the chef's wine pairing. Fred wrote down all of the wines for us so we could buy them at home!For dessert, Fred had the chef make a dessert sampler for us as we couldn't decide between the four or five that were offered! Desserts were OK to good, but didn't quite hold up to the incredible meal we just had.Our friends were very impressed and even more impressed when we found out that the chef just won the Iron Chef competition! We'll definitely be back! Thanks, Mercat!!!
