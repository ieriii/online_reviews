Came here with my friends for dinner last Friday and was not disappointed. I had the torta ahogada, chips and guac, and Barcelona hot chocolate with churros. Everything was spot on! There were a few things that kept the meal from being perfect, mostly the wait and the seating, but I feel my trip to XOCO still merits a 5 star review. Definitely stop by here if you are visiting town and want to have a phenomenal eating experience for a decent price.  XOCO is 100% satisfying and we all left very happy.
