Great bar, it's really pretty inside. interesting, it's got a little library. Was there on St Patty's (Saturday) and it was a blast. Good music, dancing, not too packed. Staff is fun, I didn't have to wait for a drink. Definitely recommend, definitely going back. -------------------------------------------- Update: So I haven't been back to Wilde at night, just too many other places to go, I guess. I have gone twice for lunch and I must say, the food is NOT great. The presentation is lovely, everything looks great. But there is a weird taste that somehow has been in both dishes that I have tried. It's like the food is stored with some sort of cleaner or something. The service is good, but the food is not good at all. I will definitely not eat there again. Down to three stars for gross food.
