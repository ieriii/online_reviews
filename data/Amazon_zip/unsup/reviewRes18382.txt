Absolutely delicious. Places like this make me a happy human. Wonderful beer selection, fabulous burgers and a kid friendly area secluded from the main restaurant - I may have died and gone to burger heaven. Just don't tell my doctor. The only downside was running out of several menu items. Being a Sunday, their fried cheese curds were no longer in supply as were a few other items. It's a Sunday, I guess it happens? I always find it interesting when waitresses tell you why they are out of something. If they haven't received a shipment in a while, it always makes me think about the other food I'm eating. Anyway... I started off with a Grimbergen blonde. I figured you can't go wrong with a brewery that has been producing quality suds since 1128. I'm picturing castles, kings, Robin Hood and the black plague. Gladiators with big muscles fighting in slow motion while peasants tend to their animals. Men toasting one another with large gold studded steins while jester's do magic tricks - you know, the whole medieval thing. My assumption proved true; at least about the taste of my beer. It was nothing short of perfection in a glass. The burger was outstanding. I went with the traditional (Bad Apple burger) sans pretzel bun. It was juicy and bursting with flavorful burger prowess. The traditional fries had the skins left on which helped boost their spudness. These fried tubers were salted well and complimented everything nicely. My christmas wish is for my neighborhood to have a Bad Apple. I would love to eat here for weekend lunches or after work for a nightcap or 4. Hooray beer!
