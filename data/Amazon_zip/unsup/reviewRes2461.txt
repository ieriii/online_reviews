Hot Doug's is very good. They offer a lot of unique sausage options like Foie Gras, alligator, crayfish. The service is also very good! The guy who took our order is very friendly and energetic. The food came our really quickly and everything was very tasty. I even loved their fries. I order the regular Chicago style hot dog and a truffle infuse chicken sausage. Both were awesome. I also got a large side of fries which were also very good. I really wanted to try their duck fat fries, but unfortunately they are only served Friday and Saturday. The line can get very long. I think we waited for about 1hr. It's a great experience with good food and interesting options. However, I don't think I'd do too often. The wait is just too long for hot dogs. And while the regular dogs and sausages a decently priced the specialties are quite pricey in comparison. The regular dog was $1.75 while the truffle infused one was $7.25. It's definitely worth a try though.
