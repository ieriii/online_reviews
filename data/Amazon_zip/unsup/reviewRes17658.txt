They can make a great drink for anyone. If you don't see something on the menu you can always describe what you're looking for to the mixologist. One of the drinks made was only the second time the mixologist had ever made it (and the other mixologists had never even heard of it) but it was exactly what my buddy was looking for. Not fun to wait outside but very much worth the wait. Wish there was something like it in SF.
