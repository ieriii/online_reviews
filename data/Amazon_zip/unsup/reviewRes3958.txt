although i don't live in the neighborhood, it's worth the trek. after a helping of friendly, accommodating service and an absolutely delicious buddha bowl (bi bim bop) i leave very happy and more than satisfied!! although the restaurant's concept is it's own take on korean/fried chicken, the buddha bowls taste pretty authentic to me. the veggies involved taste so fresh and are perfectly seasoned. i'm not a big fried chicken eater, but my next visit will have to involve some chicken so i can experience what everyone is raving about!! try it, you won't be disappointed!!
