This place is totally awesome on so many levels. 1) They were just named the greenest restaurant in America. We should all be running to support establishments that attempt to limit their footprint. 2) They support local bands and musicians. My husband and I saw two great folks bands while we ate dinner - Greenleaf and 3rd Sunday String Band. Both were phenomenal. 3) The food is unique, delicious, and affordable. Try the squash risotto. Seriously. 4) The building is gorgeous and the atmosphere is really romantic and calming. 5) I can't even talk about the desserts because I would drool all over my keyboard. Check this place out - ASAP.
