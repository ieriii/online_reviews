Delicious beers and food! I don't eat meat unless it is super legit, grassfed, humane, no hormones, etc. They had a fantastic pork belly sandwich that fit the bill and I was not at all disappointed.  The beers are all outstanding and the place is very nice and fun to hang out at. I recommend bellying up to the bar where you can grab your server relatively easily considering some of the other reviews having some trouble when it is busy there. Plus the bar tenders tend to know a little more about the beer selection and you can get some tastes of stuff if your not sure you'll like it. If you are in the Logan Square area you have to stop by this place.
