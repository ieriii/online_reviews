I guess I don't have anything new to add that hasn't already been said but I couldn't not add my name to the list of people who love/crave Hot Doug's. Went there again a few days ago and again left completely satisfied. I had the following: - Spicy Beef Hot Link with Coca-Cola BBQ Sauce and Applewood-Smoked Cheddar Cheese - The Teuben - The Dog (Chicago Style) I know...lots of food but too great to pass up. The Spicy Beef Hot Link is now my favorite sausage available at Hot Doug's. It is seriously unbelievable and I am most likely going back on Saturday to get a few more (with some duck fat fries of course).
