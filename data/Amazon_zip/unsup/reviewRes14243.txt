Such a good burger! I had the Workingman burger. Heavenly. It was like something off of Man V Food when it came to my table and I defeated it. That's right. I ate the entire thing. I just couldn't stop. ahhhh. Beermosa was great too! Nice and smooth. Oh, and of course the bacon fat popcorn. I want a bucket of that to take with to the movie theater next time...
