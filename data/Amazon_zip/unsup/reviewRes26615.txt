Great food. Horrible service. We arrived 10 minutes late for a reservation. We apologized for our tardiness and checked in with the hostess. After waiting a couple of minutes the hostess came over and without even a smile told us they don't hold a reservation past fifteen minutes. Since this was still now just twelve minutes past our reservation time we figured that was still ok. Instead, we were informed we could sit at a high top table in the bar but she'd need the table back in 45 minutes. We asked to see a manager and suddenly there was a table available for us. We were so frustrated with the horrible service we couldn't stay to eat. We have been to Mercat previously and have always waited at least 15 minutes for a table when we've had a reservation so you would think they could have been more understanding. We love the food but there are too many great places in Chicago to spend our money at such a rude place.
