I've been to the Vatican, Notre Dame and Westminster Abbey....and now Hot Doug's. Needless to say, I felt close to God here. The hot dogs are unbelievably exquisite. I had the swiss cheese smoked pork knockwurst with bacon-garlic mayonnaise and vintage van gogh cheese and coupled this with duck fat fries. Very few places I've been to provided as awesome of an experience. Some may complain of the long wait. However, I would gladly wait for hours longer just to have half of one of the dogs. Do yourself a favor and go to Hot Doug's. You won't regret it.
