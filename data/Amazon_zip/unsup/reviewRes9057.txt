Love this place. Have been here more than a couple of times for their Kebabs. Love their food - it is authentic Persian/Middle Eastern food. I have tasted their chicken kebabs, shrimp skewers etc with the dill rice and salad. The kebabs are invariable tasty and juicy. The dill rice is fabulous. Also tasted vegetarian options like the Shirin Polo (totally rich and fab), Lobia polo, the curry and the eggplant plate. I don't think I have eaten anything here that I didn't like. The service is good and friendly, a definite visit if you are into Middle Eastern food and kebabs.
