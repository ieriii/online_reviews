Every time I go to Pilsen, Nuevo Leon is always a must restaurant to go to. The place has a really authentic feel and their murals are very pretty. As for food: First, as most Mexican restaurants do, they give you some warm tortilla chips as well as some yummy salsa. However, here they also give you their bowl of chicken noodle soup and another bowl of peppers and carrots (which are surprisingly good). By the time you are done with this, you will feel pretty full. However, the entrees are amazing AND cheap. From the burritos, combination platters, tostadas, and even the lengua is really really good. You will feel very full after this, but keep going... THE TRES LECHES CAKE. nuff said. Finally.... It is a good place to bring just one or a couple of friends. Probably not more though because the place is often crowded. So what are you waiting for? go go go!
