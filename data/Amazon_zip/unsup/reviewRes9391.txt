I came back here to try the brunch that everyone seemed to like so much. I have to say I was not disappointed. We started off with cocktails, I had the vodka and it was light and refreshing. Our server talked of the amazing bacon buns which I had read about here on Yelp so those were a must have. They were delicious! You must have these! Then I had the skirt steak and eggs and my mother had the short ribs. My steak was encased in a hush puppy batter that had crab in it. Really tasty! My mom said the short ribs were one of the best things she's eaten. To finish off the meal we had the chocolate crepes which were the perfect way to end it. They were light and sweet and tasty. I will be back to try other things!
