unless you've been living in a cave in chicago, you should know that sun wah is famous for their peking duck. although i've never actually had peking duck in china, i'd like to hope that it's the same as sun wah's, just so i know i'm not missing out on anything.  i actually quite enjoy the presentation there. they roll out a cart w/ a beautifully bbq'ed duck, and skillfully cut it up for the first course. the restaurant is family owned, and this time our duck connoisseur was one of the daughters (who apparently has gone to culinary school). she encouraged us to ask questions, and we found out that they will serve/sell up to 1,000 ducks per week. that's crazy! anyway my fave is always the first course, where you eat the crispy duck skin &amp; thin slices of meat in a man-tou taco shell w/ scallions, pickled daikon &amp; carrots, and plum sauce. soooo delicious. second course is a soup made with the duck bones, and third course is your choice of fried rice or noodles with leftover duck meat. leave it to the asians to leave no part of the duck to waste. other dishes are all pretty average i feel, and most pretty oily. drink lots of tea.
