The food at this place aims high but falls flat. If you want great pub food just go to the publican. I've eaten the burger which was kind of pathetic and the marrow bones which were great but served with some kind of disgusting mystery relish. The sausage is pretty gross too (how about setting your grinder to a thicker setting?) My friend ordered a soup that had about four spoonfuls in it.  They do have a respectable beer selection at fair prices and alcoholics will love the $3 whiskey menu.  I'd recommend going here after dinner at Lula but avoid the food at all costs.
