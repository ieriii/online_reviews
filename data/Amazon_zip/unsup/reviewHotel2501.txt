The Hilton and Towers is one of the more elegant hotels in town, and it is worthwhile to stroll through the public lobby areas. I have been to many a dinner function here and it is always a filling and fulfilling experience. The hotel is on South Michigan Avenue not too far from Soldier Field and Buckingham Fountain. Rooms with two beds are noted for also featuring two bathrooms as well.
