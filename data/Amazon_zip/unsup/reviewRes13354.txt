This place is the best! Great food, good beer, good service and a pretty good bourbon selection. Its defiantly worth checking out if just for the bacon fat popped pop corn w/ bacon, sage and parmesan. The only downside is that it gets pretty crowded the latter it gets. Other than that it's just about perfect.
