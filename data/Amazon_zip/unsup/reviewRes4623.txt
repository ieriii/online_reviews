Stumbled in here after a game at around 11:30, I swear, we had some of the best service ever in Chicago. Ordered a bottle of Burgandy, and a couple piggy treats. Our server (as mentioned) was cheeky, helpful, but not overbearing. While we were trying to decide what to order, the girls at the table next to us told us how everything that they had was delicious, and to order as much as we could stuff in. They were right. 1. Cheese board - brilliant, the right amount of cheese and accompaniments. 2. Pig Shoulder - braised to perfection 3. Sweetbreads - never had pork sweetbreads before, this will have me trying them again and again 4. Brioche with pork and duck egg - amazeballs 5. Pork tenderloin - tender, fatty, huge. Add wine, grappa and port to that, and you have my favorite meal ever. If I lived in Chicago I would come here at least once a week.
