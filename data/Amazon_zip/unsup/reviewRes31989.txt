Yum! Now, Demera is the only Ethiopian food I've ever had, so I can't speak to its authenticity or compare it to other restaurants, but I can say this: I freakin' love this place. There are a few dishes I don't care much for (I think the michetabish is just gross, and I'd recommend you skip the tuna sambussas), but I've really enjoyed almost everything I've eaten here. The sambussa turnover was a pretty lame dessert, though, and I wouldn't recommend it. Didn't seem likely to be even remotely authentic, especially given that it's served with a fork. I'm not in love with the honey wine, but I'm glad I tried it. The first time I visited, it was right after a Groupon came out, the restaurant was slammed, and service was really, really slow. Last time, though, everything came out really quickly - but not quicker than it should have! The servers here are really friendly and chatty, and can easily answer any question you have about the food. I wish we lived in Chicago and could come here more often than once a year! Oh, and I love that the bathrooms are set up with "eating with your hands" in mind. Touchless faucets, air blade hand dryers, and a no-hands door handle means you can take your clean hands all the way to the table with you. It would be cool if they did a hot towel service or something at the table, though.
