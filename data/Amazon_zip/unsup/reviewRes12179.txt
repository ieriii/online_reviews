Ate here today with 5 friends for lunch, we ordered a medium red pizza shortly after realizing the large was massive! The pizza is really cheap and good. I have tried the white pizza before, which is also good. Definitely one of the best thin crust pizzas Ive had out. Also the service was great which is a rare occurrence considering how skeptical people usually are about serving teenagers. Definitely try it here!
