Came for brunch on new years day and didn't have to wait! We were seated immediately and started helping ourselves to the selections. I thought the food was ok, besides the seafood buffet (which was good), the normal buffet is overcooked and kept heated indefinitely. I loved the dessert bar (yay chocolate), but wish that there are more fruit selections.
