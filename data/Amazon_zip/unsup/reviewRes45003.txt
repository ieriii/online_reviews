My buddy Brian, transplant from NY state who lives in the Chicago area, took me here for lunch after a cool tour of Millennium Park. The pizza was GREAT. Never had authentic deep-dish before so I was quite impressed. And like a moron, I tried picking it up w/my hands like I'd been conditioned to do all my life & found that a knife & fork are essential.
