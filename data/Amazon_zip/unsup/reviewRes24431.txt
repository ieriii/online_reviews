Would like to say that it is more than amazing food that makes this restaurant one of my favorites in the city, it's their appreciation to their customers. After learning about a mistake with an order that my coworkers and I put in, the owner and staff went above and beyond to make it right and make us happy, even personally delivering yummy shakes to work as an apology. Irazu, you definitely have proven why you are a successful restaurant and one of Chicago's staples, and I will be a lifetime customer!
