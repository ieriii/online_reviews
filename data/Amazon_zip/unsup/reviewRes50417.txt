We went here with a coupon from http://restaurant.com...sometimes waitstaff get pissy about that but our server was aware that there was a minimum to spend so kept us updated to make sure we werent screwed on something...the waitstaff were all very nice...we both had burgers that we customized pretty specifically and they both came out completely correct and delicious! sweet potato fries were awesome, we also had the cheese fries app which was good...peppermint gelato wasnt all that authentic but it was good...i would def go back
