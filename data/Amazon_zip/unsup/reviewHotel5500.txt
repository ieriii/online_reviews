Chicago Insider's tip: Advantage: This Best Western is the BEST and ONLY place to use the bathroom in this part of Lakeview before 7 a.m., when Ann Sather's opens, if when nature calls and last night's Metamucil DEMANDS, you happen to be having coffee at the Starbucks at Roscoe & Broadway, which doesn't have a bathroom. Disadvantage: The bathroom in the lobby is locked, so you have to sweet talk the key from the desk clerk while doing a song-n-"toe dance" to make the point that you really have to go.
