okay. its a nice hotel. brand new, really. and i love the natural earthy-ness atmosphere... but i paid WAY too much money to stay here. watch out for the 'cozy king' room... i either got the crappiest room in the hotel or they are all this tiny. i have never been in a SMALLER hotel room in my life. ive stayed in hampton inn's with bigger rooms! the balcony they advertise (which sounded so freakin cool) was about a good 3 feet wide and not as fun as it initially sounded. also, my room had NO WINDOWS except for the window of the 'patio' door. heeeyyy clausterphobia. the shower was nice, but also cramped. with a little plastic toadstool for a seat. not sure who would venture sitting on it? ew.  the bed was really comfortable but when they place you next to the staff stairwell and housekeeping room, you're not gonna sleep anyways. GUH! the place was virtually spotless clean and the bellstaff/valet were out of this world nice. but my bill came to nearly $350 and i feel 100% cheated.  p.s. room service isnt worth it. my breakfast and dinner were very odd tasting. almost tasted straight up like cafeteria food. you're better off venturing over to the whole foods for some food. the other star, the location is WONDERFUL to so many things. sorry, dana. maybe next time you can give me a decent room and i wont have to be so mean to you.
