Piece is great... awesome pizza (you must try their mashed potato topping!) and great micro brew- I like their Golden Arm. There is karaoke on Thursday nights, and while you might think- wow, that would be annoying while I'm trying to eat- it's actually quite amazing. Each week there is the same cast of characters who is (I think) trying to be discovered or something. The shining star here is Stosh, a wayward karaoke star who sings, *ahem*-shouts, favorites like Crimson and Clover, Ring of Fire (...and it BURNS BURNS BURNS...!) and Let's Spend the Night Together. Even if you don't like pizza OR micro brew, it's worth the trip to see him. Sometimes the service can be bitchy, they get frustrated when it fills up and you keep ordering beers... go figure. Overall, I'd highly recommend it both for food and entertainment value.
