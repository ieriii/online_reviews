As a store manager I am constantly reading reviews to see how we are doing and couldn't wait to write a review about a place that gives exceptional service! I absolutely had to write a glowing review about my experience at Spacca Napoli last Saturday.  I normally dread the no-reservation's weekend wait but here it was made so pleasurable. Not only were we given a glass of wine while we waited we were greated with a gracious smile, this is not the norm for a busy weekend hot spot! We were seated within 15 min, our food arrived promptly and perfect! After we were done eating we were given a kind goodbye and handed canolli's. I do have to say these are not things I expect at all but it was really nice to have!
