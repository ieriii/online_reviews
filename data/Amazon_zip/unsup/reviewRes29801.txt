Frontera Grill is a fine-dining Mexican restaurant, so no greasy tacos here. This very popular and celebrated restaurant serves creative dishes at a premium price. If you are waiting for a table, have a margarita or a cold cerveza. The vegetarian-style enchiladas were delicious to this meat eater. The outdoor cafe seating faces the blinding sun at dinnertime, but the area is remarkably insulated from the sun and other annoying urban factors.
