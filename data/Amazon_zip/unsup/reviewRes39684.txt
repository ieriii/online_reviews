This is the best Korean BBQ joint I've been to in Chicago! The marinated beef and chicken are amazing. Like others have said, the short ribs are not worth it. The bachan are numerous and flavorful, as are the soups. My only complaint is that the ventilation system is awful and the place is always full of smoke. You'll walk out smelling like Korean BBQ, every time.
