Sushi on a silver platter, what a world. A couple things that stick out from my trip to Coast. This would be better served if http://Yelp.com learned how to use bullet points: - They have a bizarre kind of teetotaling BYO policy restricting you to 1 bottle of wine or a sixer per 2 people. They will heat up the sake for you if you pour it into the container. 1 bottle isn't quite enough for a medium length meal unless you're a total lightweight as far as I'm concerned. I assume we can thank the christian right for this. That's bad. - The maki and nigiri were delicious. That's good. - The $22-25 sushi and sashimi plates come with 6 different types of fish but aren't quite enough food, order another maki or something. They do come with a choice of soup. That's good. -You have the option of ordering real fresh wasabi root for $2 extra. -The toppings contain potassium bonzoate. (that's bad) Ok some I'm watching Treehouse of Horror 3.
