Admittedly, we did stop in on a Sunday night, which tends not to be "peak" timing for most restaurants. I was very impressed with the ambiance- this place has a great space. The fireplace in the bar area was epic. We watched a football game while we ate. Our food came out right after we ordered it, which was great. I had the brisket, which left a little to be desired- it was a little cold despite coming out fast and not very flavorful. The BBQ sauce selection was fun- you get four choices. My buddy ordered the ribs, which I had a few of- they were delicious. Next time, I'll order those.
