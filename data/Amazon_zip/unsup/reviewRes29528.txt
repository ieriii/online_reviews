Opart Thai has, by far, the best beef salad I have ever eaten. It was perfect. The spiciness and the beef to vegetable ratio were perfect. I loved it!! I found myself taking sips of the leftover sauce. I've tasted my friend's chicken panang curry and that was delicious as well. I will definitely come back here again for their beef salad and also try something else! Service was great as well!
