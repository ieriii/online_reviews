Damn you, Hot Doug's. You are always my first choice, and you are ALWAYS busy. :[[ I have yet to find a strategy for avoiding the lines that plague you, but I will never stop coming to you because of it. Even Joey who "never waits in lines" and is the most impatient person I've ever met will willingly wait in line to get a dog from Doug. The food here is great, honestly. It's reasonably priced, and Doug really is an amazing personality. He never makes you feel like you are the 1 millionth person he's seen that day. I always attempt to get something from the daily specials, as well as a regular grilled dog. I only ever finish about an entire dog between both of them, because I am so into their fries. The duck fat fries really are fantastic and I am never disappointed when I get them. Hot Doug's gets 5 stars. Even though I'd like to give them 4 because of the constant line, I can't bring myself to do it. The food just really is that fabulously simple and glorious.
