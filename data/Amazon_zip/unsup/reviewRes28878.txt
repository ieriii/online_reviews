Our meal was fine, but everything we ordered was too sweet. Maybe it's because I haven't had Thai food in a while, or maybe it's just the dishes we ordered. But I may have to try some of their non-sweet dishes next time in order to have a well rounded review. For appetizers, we ordered the beef satay and the crab rangoon. The beef satay was delicious. It was marinated, grilled, and very tender. It was so good, it didn't really need the peanut sauce (too mild and sweet). The crab rangoon was ok, but the filling was too sweet for me. I like crab rangoon that's just crab and cream cheese - no sugar. I avoided the sweet & sour sauce, as well. For our entrees, I had the Gaeng PIa Dook, which was a red curry with catfish and basil. And instead of the usual steamed rice, I ordered sticky rice with my curry. The curry was ok, with slivers of fresh ginger and Thai basil in every bite. But again, the dish was a little too sweet for me. The catfish wasn't melt-in-your-mouth soft, either. It was tough. But I did enjoy pinching off mounds of sticky rice into my hand and dipping it into the curry. The sticky rice was chewy and had the unmistakable flavor of bamboo from the steamer.  He ordered the beef Panang curry. I tried a bit of his and it tasted exactly like my curry. I just imagined this huge vat of red curry in the back, bubbling away. The beef wasn't as tender as the beef in the satay.  As far as drinks go, I had the Thai iced tea (good) and he had the Thai iced coffee (eh, it was weak). When we got the check, we saw two small pieces of candy and said "Nooo more sweets". Overall, our dinner was fine, but next time we'll have to try something different on the menu.
