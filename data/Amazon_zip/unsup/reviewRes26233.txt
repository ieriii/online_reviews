The pizza sounded good in theory - caramelized cheese on the edge, deep dish, lots of sauce and toppings. It was October 2005, the night that the Sox beat the Angels to win the ALCS. Living in Evanston at the time, this was a nice halfway point (believe it or not this place is a Northside Sox bar. Or at least was then). So we went. 2 tiny TV's with the game on does not qualify as a Sox bar. But I would've been cool with it if the pizza was good. However, the pizza was so greasy that I had to shit 5 minutes after I ate it. This coming from the girl who eats White Castle sober and loves it. Needless to say we were on the southside for the world series games. No half-assing my team ever again.
