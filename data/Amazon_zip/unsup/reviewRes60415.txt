if I could give this place a 0, I would. after being told it would be a 45 min wait, it was really 1 hr., 45 min.any pizza lover knows the secret of a good pizza is the crust and cheese texture. Crust like cardboard, cheese like silly putty. it was obvious they and cooked the pizza early and reheated hit when we finally got to our table.we had the thin crust and it was still over a 1/4 inch thick. veggies on one of our pizzas tasted terrible. others in our family went to another location and had the deep dish. they were very disappointed too.will be sure to tell anyone we know visiting Chicago to never go there.
