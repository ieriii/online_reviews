Wow... The decor is phenomenal here! The moment you walk in you feel like you are in an old castle and this feeling of luxury continues into the dining rooms and makes for a fantastic display. It has finally arrived and not only is the service fantastic so is the food. There salad bar is almost as good as Brazzaz, but what Brazzaz and Fogo don't have is the side dishes, great soup and sushi that TdB's does. The meat was definitely up to par with my favorite Brazzaz, and what really blew me away was there house specialty of Prainah(?)- I know I butchered the spelling. Soooo tender, so flavorful. Something that I REALLY Loved was that you could get your meat "less salty." Although I love the full bodied rock salt seasonings they use, this would be ideal for those with more sensitive palettes. Overall fantastic experience, and we will be back!
