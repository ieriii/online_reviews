i use to love this place but one cold day i was craving their crab cakes, so i went there 10 min before opening and the hostess was soooo rude. she was like umm we arent open yet. (ok i get it its can be annoying when your rushing to open and someone is breathing down your neck) i apologized. my friend and i walked around went to reckless and came back 15 minutes later. she walked up and huffed " its you again?! we still arent open" i appoligized again thinking i was wrong on time. and was waiting outside. and in ear shot she talked about how she hated her job and hated putting up with customers... i put my craving aside and went else where.
