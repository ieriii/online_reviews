AMAZING! We came here on a saturday around 7:30 and the place was packed, the wait was about 25 min, not to bad for not having a reservation on a sat. Plus they have a bar located right by the waiting area that you can hang out in while you wait for your table. Once we got seated the waiter brought out our saganaki very quickly. It was delicious maybe the best saganaki i've ever had. The rest of our food came out impressively fast. Everything was delicious, the spinach pie slices were huge.  The service was great to, our waiter was very observant and polite, he never let our waters get down past half full. The food is very reasonably priced for the quality and quantity.
