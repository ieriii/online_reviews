DELICIOUS!!!!! My husband suggested going to Fogo de Chao. The food was absolutely delicious. The salad bar was absolutely delicious. And then came...the meat. The selection of meat was vast and delicious. The service was excellent. My glass was filled everytime I took 2 sips of water. The rolls were replenished immediately. Great experience. Great dining.  Definitely a meat eater's paradise.
