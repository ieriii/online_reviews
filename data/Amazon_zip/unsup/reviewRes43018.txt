Being from the South Side, I have certain prejudices about the North Side. One being that no one is actually from Chicago up here, everybody's from Detroit and Cleveland and Indianapolis. Two being that there's no good stuffed pizza. Wrong on Two, devastatingly right on One. This pizza is fantastic. The guy behind the counter has every single price combination memorized in his head, and he's fast. The crust is fantastic as is the sauce. Wonderful.
