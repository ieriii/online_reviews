Working in the hospitality industry I am rarely impressed with many dining experiences, but this was a wonderful and welcomed exception. Everything from the greeting at the door to the service and quality of the food was fantastic. Our server was only there for two weeks but was extremely knowledgeable and unbelievably friendly and personable. Brian has created a great gem that truly makes each guest feel like royalty. After all, isn't that what we want when we are dining out?
