This was my first time coming here for dinner with friends. I've been meaning to come here for the last year, and I've heard good things and bad things about the place. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was really disappointed. Nothing was terrible, but nothing was really very good either. It was all just OK. Maybe the slightest bit less than OK. Each of us ordered food, and none of us particularly enjoyed our meal. The fish and chips were huge portions, but fairly bland, and way too heavy. The salmon was OK, but at that price you can have much better nearby. I had the Tofu Revolution sandwich which was dry, and only tasted like spicy pickles. The Veggie Reuben was just OK. The service was fine, although they forgot to bring me a set of silverware, so I had to grab one from a nearby table. The beers were all fine, but none of them I'd buy in a store. I'm really surprised this place was so busy for so long. Maybe the food has taken a bad turn lately?
