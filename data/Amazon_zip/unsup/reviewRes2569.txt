This newer location of Hot Doug's is at the relatively obscure corner of California and Roscoe. You wouldn't think it was too obscure once you see the lines to this popular joint that always extend past the front door. The menu features various encased meats named and renamed after celebrities (Madonna, Elvis, Jennifer Garner, ex-Cub Shawon Dunston), plus various daily specials that can be quite exotic. I had a pheasant sausage topped with rich dabs of cheese and cognac mustard, and my friend had the "Louis Nye" with Greek sausage, feta cheese, and artichoke. If buffalo and rattlesnake are too wild for you, the menu also has regular hot dogs and plump corn dogs too. On Fridays and Saturdays splurge on the duck fat fries, a heap of crisp shoestring potatoes that can otherwise be found only at a good bistro. If you are dining in the colorfully decorated seating area, get a small pop and get free refills while jamming to the rockin' soundtrack. The line is always long, but it moves fast thanks to very friendly and efficient service.
