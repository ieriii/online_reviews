Grand Lux Cafe is my go-to restaurant when I have friends or family visiting the city. This place has EVERYTHING. You can have specialty drinks, wine, and appetizers in the bar or you can have a nice sit down meal. I like this place because it is not as expensive as other nicer Michigan Avenue restaurants but the waitstaff and hosts make you feel like a million dollars.My friend recommended this place and we paid for her food because she did good by taking us there. I had the Asian salad, it was the best salad I've ever had.  You'll see all walks of life in that place from beach goers to people who seem to be on a romantic date. Totally recommend this place for any type of outing, casual or a bit more upscale. I will definitely will be going back, it's very much like the Cheesecake Factory experience - large portions, pricier dishes, good ambiance. Their selection is also pretty spread out, so you'll be able to find something you will inevitably like. The place is definitely worth checking out.Also there is one located in Las Vegas
