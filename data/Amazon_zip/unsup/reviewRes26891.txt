Wow, I didn't realize this was such a popular restaurant on Yelp! We were out running some errands and decided to stop in and have lunch on Saturday. I think this is the best Mexican restaurant in Chicago! Here was the conversation between me and my boyfriend: Me: I looooove this place, so good, I wanna live here! BF: You're gonna yelp the shit out of this place, aren't you? Me: Absolutely!!! Food is so cheap and good! Chips were perfectly fried, and the salsa had the perfect amount of heat. Asado de puerco was the complimentary appetizer, and it was soooo delicious! Came with a corn tortilla. I could have eaten a whole plateful!!! Then I had the machacado con huevo dish (shredded beef with egg), and it was amazing!!! The beans were chunky and didn't taste processed at all!!! Horchata was also delish. My boyfriend had the enchiladas, and that was super yummy too! And don't get me started on the homemade flour torillas!!! When we asked for refills on our water, they brought us a whole pitcher! Go to Nuevo Leon! Bring Cash! I know I'll be back!
