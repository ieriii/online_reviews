Love it, love it, love it -- never had a bad meal here. It looks like a dump from the outside, but is only semi-dumpy inside. Ok, it's really not that bad inside. I'm sure the methodone clinic across the street is worse. Just kidding. I think that has been torn down to make way for $800K condos. I used to live right over there and had a tin can telephone hooked up to the el platform so I could converse with the gen pop on my Evita-style condo balcony. I enjoyed viewing the scissor fights in the alley from up there as well. Ah, youth. Good times. Anyway, since the place is so small, you might end up smelling like one of their delicious sandwedges. Only because of that do I recommend taking it out. Place your order with the people at the counter. They are friendly. Get the guac, spicy, and be delighted that they leave the pit in the dish with it. How marvelously rustic! Order the pepito sammidge, and a mango shake with water. So fruity! If you like rice pudding, get the oatmeal shake with milk. Sublime. I want to take a bath in that stuff. Take it home, eat it and then take a nap. In that order.
