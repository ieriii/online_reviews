brought my girlfriend there last week and as expected it was filled with people. Love the conecept of the place... Food was ok.. a large selection of wines. The service is terrible. Our server never checked up on us even though he knew it was our first time there. needless to say we wont be back and that the server didnt get a good tip. I would rather spend my money somewhere else.
