You should know in advance what your getting yourself into. My new favorite steakhouse in Chicago. They entered a crowded space here in Chicago and was able to effectively execute. Steaks, seafood, and their family portion sides are all made to perfection. The piano bar is great way to begin your dinner. While it is expensive, if your going to treat yourself it's well worth it!
