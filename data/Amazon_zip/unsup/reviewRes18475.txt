2 days later and I am still salivating. Swoon worthy lobster ravioli in marscapone cream sauce nearly put me in a coma, which is the highest compliment that a restaurant can recieve from me. The staff was friendly and didn't push us to order a bunch of apps or desert - hate it when they do that at BYOBs. The dishes were HUGE; I think everyone at our table had leftovers, and everything tasted incredible fresh and homemade. Will be returning for sure. My waistline is not happy about this unexpected discovery.
