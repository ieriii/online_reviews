Today, my office ordered in from Piece Out for 'Bring Your Kid To Work' day. I have to say, this pizza is some of the worst stuff I've put in my mouth. That's saying a lot, but I won't go off on a tangent. I sampled a slice each of: (1) plain cheese, (2) spinach, mushroom & cheese, (3) tomato & basil. Which varieties were edible? None of the above. The crust was soggy, yet strangely tough. The sauce was salty beyond belief and I'm not sure that the red colour came from actual tomatoes. As I type, my eyeballs are shrivelling as their moisture is being diverted to my parched mouth and throat. I've been told that the pizza is pretty good at the dine-in location so maybe this terrible quality has something to do with the fact that we had delivery. I will probably never know. For a memorable experience with salt, I'd rather go with a therapeutic soak in the Dead Sea. It's mentioned in another review that this is New Haven style pizza. Well, I've had New Haven style pizza -- IN New Haven -- and loved it. This, this is something else. On the bright side, the salt appears to have stunned the kids, who are now quiet as can be.
