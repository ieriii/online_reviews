I read today that Giordano's is filing for bankruptcy, and sadly I can't say I'm that upset. It's good, and I could see where some people would like it, but not something I really enjoyed.  I had a slice of the spinach, a tastes of the tropical (their version of hawaiian) and veggie-sausage combo. All of them had way, way too much cheese for me, especially the first few bites, I might as well have been biting into a big block of cheese with bits of bread and veg stuck in. I personally would have liked it a lot more if they cut the cheese by about half, and made the bread thicker, since most of the other ingredients were quite tasty. The crust (where I could actually taste it) was also pretty decent... it's thick and bready but has a good crunchy crust to it at the same time. I also think the sauce was pretty good, you just couldn't taste it past all the cheese. If chewing through tons of melty cheese is the sort of thing you like though, you'll love this place!
