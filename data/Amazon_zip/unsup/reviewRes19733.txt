Coast rocks. Best sushi in Chicago, I'd say. Very fresh, killer creative and innovative rolls, delicious soups, salads and apps. The staff is surprisingly very nice and not at all pushy, unlike staff at other sushi places like Wakomono. The only downside is it's soooo busy, so make your reso far in advance. No way you are doing a walk-in here, at least on the weekend. They jam you in pretty good but this doesn't bother me at all. Also, remember it's BYOB. And, don't bring your kids here. That would be annoying for all parties involved.
