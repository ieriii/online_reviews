I was in Chicago visiting an old friend and we had brunch with a few of her friends here this past Sunday. I have to say it was one of the best brunch meals I've ever had. I had the Eggs New Orleans and it was just so delicious. The crabcakes complimented the poached eggs and popovers very nicely. The bearnaise sauce wasn't too rich but very creamy. Everyone's meal looked great too. Service was friendly although drinks took a little while but our waitress said it was because the bar was a little behind so no big deal. Atmosphere was simple and a subdued elegance without being too stuffy. As a back story, this place was a little out of the way from where my friend lives in Chicago but we were told this was one of the best places in the city to get brunch and overall, we were definitely not disappointed.
