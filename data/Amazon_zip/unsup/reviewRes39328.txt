This place was absolutely fabulous. A definite must for all whisky lovers! The tasting menu for drinks is out of this world. Go for the bourbons and leave out the scotches. This place has an absolutely fabulous collection of bourbons and you should take this change to definitely get an old-fashioned or a bitter redemption. This place had the full package. I think the burgers/sandwiches were definitely great value for money and the fries were soooo soooo good. Personally, I liked the veal but wasn't too impressed by much of the other meat entrees. Desserts were absolutely great. Definitely shareable after a long heavy meal. The beaver beer was pretty good too. In terms of atmosphere, it was decent. Our waiter was knowledgeable, super chill and had great recommendations!
