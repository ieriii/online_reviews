I dined here with a friend over the weekend and was really disappointed. The food as OK, but the prices for what was served is ridiculous. I spent $45 for a stuffed pepper and one crab cake (split an appetizer order with a friend) on just myself. That doesn't include any drinks other than water. I left hungry still and certainly wasn't going to spend money on dessert at those prices. I have no problems spending money on a good meal but I should leave full and feel it was worth it!
