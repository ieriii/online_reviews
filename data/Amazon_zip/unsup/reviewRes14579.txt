Super friendly staff and excellent menu. I've been trying to force myself to try other things on their menu other than the Cubano, and I'm always pleased with the results. Although I love the Cubano, I doubt there is another in the city that comes close to comparing. I also found the following really good too: Media Noche, Bistec, Croquetas, Yuca fritas and Maduros. I thought the Lechon was good but a little on the dry side.
