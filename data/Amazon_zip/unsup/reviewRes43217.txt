Meh. Thoroughly mediocre. Milk and Honey has their system down to an art - you line up, look at a menu, place your order, and then loiter around with a number. The hostess seats you sometime between when you order and when your food arrives, and there's a posted sign asking patrons to kindly give up their tables as soon as they're done eating on the weekends because the small restaurant gets so busy. I get it, but I wasn't impressed by how unfriendly they were. The menu had a number of delicious-sounding things on it, though I wasn't particularly hungry and stuck with a bagel (mediocre), which still wasn't cheap. My friend's eggs looked good but not great and were also pretty expensive. I would consider coming back to Milk and Honey if I lived in the neighborhood, but I won't go out of my way.
