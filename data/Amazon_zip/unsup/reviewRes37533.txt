Everybody knows that if you want an amazing beer that you can't find anywhere else in the city that this is the place to go. I've been here tons of times (great prequel to a Neofuturists show) and love the selection... had fries once or twice, but that was about food-wise. And then we had dinner. And it was amazing. We started with the mussels and were duly impressed. I've lived in Chicago too long to be a seafood snob, but the beer broth that they were cooked in was amazing. I got the duck Reuben for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed that as well along with the incredibly spiced fries. My wife had the not-so-regular "peanut butter and jelly" which was equally delicious, and kind made me a little jealous. Over all a wonderful experience which I hope to repeat soon.
