I really really wanted to like this place more than I did. My boyfriend ordered from the Thai menu, and that I would have given a 4 stars; Panang and basil fried rice were so good! But I ordered the yummy crunchy roll, and it ended up being deep fried (not stated on the menu) and the spicy tuna cooked through which was weird. Tom kha Kai soup was okay, but a little on the sweet side. After adding siracha it was delicious! Adegashi tofu was Delish but only 3 pieces in a serving ? Cmonnn. Cool decor though, and I like the atmosphere. Will be back
