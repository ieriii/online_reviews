I dined at Bonsoiree a year ago, today, for my birthday. I'll be reviewing based on my experience at that time. A year ago, on Sundays, you could get a special Chef's tasting menu at significantly reduced prices - there was the 5-course for $40, and the 7 course for $55. I ordered the 7-course, my parents and guest got the 5-course. I don't believe there was any corkage fee at the time (course, I didn't pay, so maybe there was). I remember the meal FLOORING me. At that point, I had never dined in such elegance, and in such extravagance. Every course of my meal was superb; I particularly remember the braised oxtail course, which more or less caused a simultaneous group orgasm (awkward, I know). The host / waiter knew everything about the food, and explained each course in exquisite detail.  The whole experience was an utter joy, one that I have not forgotten. The place is tiny, as many have noted, and the atmosphere is romantic, low-key, and had a warm feeling to it. I definitely remember leaving with the feeling that (my parents) had underpaid for the culinary experience in which we had taken part. Highly recommended.
