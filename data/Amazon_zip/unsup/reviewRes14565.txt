Revolution Brewing takes local to the next level. The food is fantastic, and the beer? Well, the 3 or 4 that I have tried are fantastic, and brewed right there, on site, in Logan Square. How can you beat that? I've been there twice now, once with a large group, and once with a few in which we ate and drank at the bar. Both times the food was amazing. They have plenty of vegetarian options, in addition to one hell of a burger that rivals those long line fancy burger joints.  The place does get a noisy, as do most huge open restaurants, but to me, it adds to the charm. The open kitchen, woodwork, exposed brick, and large glass windows opening up into the brewery make this place very visually striking. Keep an eye out for those growlers heading out the door. Do you know any card carrying members of the brewery? I bet you do. I was surprised to find out how many people I know that get an extra special mug every time they visit!
