I have been to Carnivale a couple of times and I would like to say I am quite pleased with their food, atmosphere, and wait staff. The only thing I don't like is that their menu tends to change. I don't really like change so when I went for my second visit on my birthday I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have the lamb shank. The waitress was very helpful in picking out an alternative which was just as tasty ;the tuna. I really enjoyed the ceviche and my friend told me that the mojito was quite tasty. Although the prices are a little steep, it is a great place to take a date.
