This review is based on two visits.  The pizzas look scrumptious sitting under the heat lamps and there is much variety. The ingredients, whether large slices of ham and pineapple, specialized sausage, or vegetables look high quality, generous, and irresistible. BUT THERE IS LITTLE TOMATO SAUCE AND THE HEAT LAMPS DRY OUT THE PIZZA, ESPECIALLY THE CHEESE! And if you want to take the pizza home and freshen it up by reheating, forget it, it comes out of the wood oven overcooked and after sitting under the heats lamps, it's already been reheated. SUGGESTION: Buy slices from a pizza just coming out of the oven OR buy a whole pizza, ask for extra sauce, and ask for it to be "partial baked," perhaps 75%.  FO2GO means well. Give them a chance.
