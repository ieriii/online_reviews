This review is for the one that does mainly carry-out business and has the extremely limited menu on the west side of Ashland. My friend swears these are the best in the city so I decided to pick some up one day. While I have to agree they are delicious, they are also a bit too greasy for me and I'll definitely remember to ask for other ingredients the next time. It's almost like eating a mouthful of meat wrapped in a corn tortilla. Would I return? Definitely. In truth, this is probably a 3.5 star review.
