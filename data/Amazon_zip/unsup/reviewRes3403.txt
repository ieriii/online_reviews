When my friend told me about bulgogi burritos, I knew I had to go to Crisp! I love Korean food and fusion Korean food is no exception! When eating Seoul Burrito, dipping it in the provided sauce is a must! The burrito is huge, just like Chipotle, tasty and filling! No need to order extra food! But if you're a big eater, which I sometimes am, I'd pair it with the Crisp BBQ fried chicken. If you're looking for a good contemporary twist on Korean food, then Crisp is the place for you!
