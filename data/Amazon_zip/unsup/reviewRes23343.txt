Food (when it came) was great. That's the only thing keeping this from a 1-star review. Here's my service experience: Arrived at 10am on a Sunday: --stood in the doorway for 10 minutes awkwardly waiting to be seated --had to request for someone to wipe down a table so I could seat myself --no menus, silverware, or water --we go take two menus from the adjacent table that was fed-up with waiting and left before someone took their order --waitress finally came around, introduces herself and took our order (no apology) --food arrives relatively quickly (we request silverware) --the wait for the bill begins... ... ... ... --we consider leaving $$ on the table and leaving... ... --bill arrives, we pay, and leave This place is tiny so I have no idea where the waitress kept running off to. When I did see her, she was futzing with something (coffee??) near the kitchen. This is surprising as I never saw her bring a single cup of coffee to anyone. And this is not the Icosium Kafe's fault, but on a humorous note, I definitely got a parking ticket cause I fed the meter for 1 hr, 10 minutes, and was 20 minutes over.
