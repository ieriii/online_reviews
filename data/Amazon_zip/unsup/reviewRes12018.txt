I have been wanting to go to Piece for a very long time! I finally made it out today for lunch. I was not disappointed! It was incredible pizza. A friend and I split the white pizza with spinach, tomato, and pepperoni. It was so good, we ate the whole thing! The service was a little slow and not the friendliest, but the pizza was well worth the trip!
