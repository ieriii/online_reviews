I took my boyfriend to Brazzaz for his birthday. While it was good, I prefer Fogo.  The salad bar at Brazzaz left much to be desired. I've had more selection at a soup and salad place then I did here. Yes, I realize you come for the meat, but they also try to sell you on the salad bar as well. I didn't feel that there was all that much variety in the meat.  The meat was excellent and the pineapple is to die for, but overall I've been to better Brazilian Steakhouses.
