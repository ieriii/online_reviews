This place is just way too good. That's all I could think of since the CMYE here. Now, what do you do when everything is so damn delicious, but upwards of $20 a pop? Well, you hit them up on Tuesdays for their live jazz and tapas, when you can easily get 2-3 smaller dishes for the same price. Of course, when you have my luck, you'll arrive to find out that you've come on the first Tuesday they've ever had to cancel it, due to too many reservations. Luckily, the manager was awesome, moved us to a corner table, and let us order off the tapas menu. With two requirements: 1) we understood that not all the items were available and 2) we didn't wave our tapas menus in the face of the other suckas, mocking them. No problem there. At this point you might think, Jen keeping her mouth shut?! Impossible. Well, not when the food is this good. Everything we ordered was delicious, from the Cappellacci di Zucca (my fave - order it and thank me later), to the Rigatoni Caprese, and the Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs. As Mr. Scott D. would say, they were the truth. The Crostone Di Avocado is a must for any avocado lover, and the Chicken Tortelini and Veal Meat Balls were ridic. And the Tiramisu freebie for all the confusion? Perfect. I so need to become a regular here. Conclusion: It's worth the waddle when you're stuffed with a Sapori Trattoria baby.
