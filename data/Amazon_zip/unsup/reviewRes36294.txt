I really want to give Meli 4 or maybe even 5 stars. Let me state why I cannot first: *Service Service Service. It's horrible. Honestly, it's pathetic. Thats the only reason for a lesser rating the FOOD is fantastic... My favorites: Paninis French Toast SMoothies Monte Cristo Sandwhich My advice- do takeout and save yourself from the ill service. When they improve their service, i'll improve my rating.
