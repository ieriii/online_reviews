Really great meal. Best part about Sunda is the dcor and ambiance.  The sushi is quite good, and even though we sat at the sushi bar on a Friday night at 7pm, our service was great. I highly recommend it for some drinks and bites before going out in the area. A couple bourbons, Rock shrimp tempura, duck bao, and lobster rolls are a great way to start the night.
