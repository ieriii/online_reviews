Piccolo was quite good. Interesting Northern Italian fare in a pretty space. (Always loved the spot since it was Time) I thought the pricing was a bit high for Grand Avenue but the service was crisp. We ordered a cold antipasti, which was varied and fresh. Loss of points for bringing me a warm plate though. I tried the short rib special with polenta and it was fantastic. The pizza special with black truffles was a bit disappointing. The black truffles tasted beyond their prime. On a side note, the once rare truffle has become ubiquitous so I figure plenty of fakes are hitting menus. I would definitely go back. It is a nice spot outside of downtown or on the way to the UC.
