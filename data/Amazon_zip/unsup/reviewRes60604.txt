The salad bar has a good selection, and the food is pretty good. The menu is fun and most of the people working are in good spirits. Unfortunately we got the one that wasn't as our server. The place wasn't busy when we were there, but she was still very slow and inattentive. It was hard to get new plates, new bowls, drink refills, etc. Luckily some other servers noticed us and filled in where she lacked.
