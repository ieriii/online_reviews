This Old School Italian is one of the highlights of the Portage Park/Old Irving neighborhood - you kind of get a "Godfather"-like feeling from the place. My boyfriend and I went their on our anniversary but its also a great place to take a group of friends. The food was outstanding and so was the service. We did have to wait a bit to be seated even though we had a reservation but it was worth the wait. And, believe me, you won't come away hungry from this restaurant!
