This was a very disappointing experience, because heard good things about Pequod's. Unfortunately, that wasn't our experience. It took us an hour to get a SMALL THIN crust pizza and when we got it, it was burned! We'd have sent it back, but we didn't have another hour to wait... See the picture attached for the burn evidence...
