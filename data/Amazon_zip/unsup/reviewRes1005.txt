Totally worth the wait! Funny that I came all the way to Chicago thinking I would try a Chicago-style dog...maybe I failed by not trying one, but damn, Hot Doug's just offered so many great choices! I would've tried everything on the menu if that was humanly possible. I went with Mitchell P. so I'm not going to repeat everything he said...just that you've got to try these dogs! I haven't been to any other gourmet hot dog joints that would even be worth comparing to the awesomeness of the ones here. Top your order off with some duck fat fries and you're set. (I think they only offer this on Fri and Sat?) I'm not going to be bias on which dog you should try...all seemed to be fab and I love how they don't shiest you on the toppings, they load 'em up! You know how to visit a city and try out a place, think it's good, but the next time you visit you think, "Oh maybe I should try something different"? Not Hot Doug's. It's permanently on my Chicago must-do every time list. You just can't get enough!
