First and last time here. The food is decent, but as soon as you sit at the table you can notice how uncomfortable the chairs are and the tables are tiny. We had a server which was very polite but he pushed us to give him the full order when we ask to start with some appetizers! We said, sorry we don't know yet, can we start with some appetizers? And he said, sorry but the chef would like to have the full order! Wow, who is the customer here? At the end we eat, feeling a little uncomfortable, the food was OK but not great, and the final check was way too high for the quality of service and food. Definitively not coming back
