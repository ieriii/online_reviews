Woohoo! My fiance and I just returned from a wonderful dinner at Icosium. This is the first restaurant we've tried based on yelper recommendations. We've been to La Creperie before and were in the mood for a crepe and trying a new place. While we were concerned about the service, all I can say is that there were no issues tonight. We were promptly seated, given menus, and water. The waitress appeared a few minutes later and we put in our orders and a few minutes later our soup arrived. As we were finishing our soup, the crepes arrived. About one minute after I finished my crepe, someone took away the plate. Well, they should have left my plate until my fiance finished her plate, but hey, this is a little neighborhood restaurant. The bill also showed up a few minutes after I waved at the cashier. The restaurant was a bit more than half full. The food was also delicious! I think we might have preferred a bit more cheese in our savory crepes, but each bite was delicious. So many different tastes and textures. It was interesting to think about how the Algerians had adapted the french crepe into something very different. Soup now comes with the meal - it was a vegetarian soup with some mint and peas. Thanks to all the yelpers for reviewing this place!
