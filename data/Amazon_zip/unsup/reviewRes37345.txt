+ Best grocery store bakery... best baguettes I can find in Chicago, best caibatta, great pastries (cakes + cupcakes too...) + Best selection of cured meats & cold cuts that I know of. Several types of prosciutto alone. Many great Spanish jamons, etc. They let you sample so you can really find what you want. They'll have all sorts of Specks, Salumi... + The wild boar bacon + Great fruits & veg without having bazillions of everything + Great prepared & packaged food sections + Very good cheese selection. This is a great place to buy Raclette and all the necessary accompaniments.  Just go and get a baguette and some jambon madrange, take some butter and make yourself the best Parisien that can be had in America. - Its kind of hard to actually do a full "shopping" here. I usually just buy a few items to complete a meal or things to eat right away. The selections are limited and the price is pretty high. - They lack some vegetarian items. We asked them to start carrying seitan a long time ago and I don't know if they've started to carry it yet. I could get some better veg options at da Jewels which is kind of disappointing for such a great market.
