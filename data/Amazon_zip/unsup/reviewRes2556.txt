If I were an incased meat lover, this would probably be a five star review, but I'm not so much. I tried one of the fancier dogs-they have a good variety-and it was good. I did think it would taste better, but I think I just made the wrong choice-I hope. I do like the atmosphere-not fancy, kinda quirky pictures of all things hot dog. I'd even come back to try some other interesting meat concoctions, like the foie gras dog (i know its wrong, but i LOVE it!)
