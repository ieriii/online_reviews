I will be critiquing primarily on the food since I ordered pickup or carryout yesterday. So I couldn't decide between the vegetable omelet and the stuffed strawberry french toast w/ the layer of mascarpone inside...the sound of both made my mouth water. I wish they had a special including all of the above in smaller portions(*hint,hint*); the best of both worlds(salty and sweet). I ended up ordering both w/ a wheat grass,carrot,apple and honey juice blend. .I very much enjoyed the veggie omelet, because it was hearty and chock full with a variety of veggies! I say the more the merrier! The seasoned potatoes that came with it balanced out the saltiness so i didnt have to eat my omelet w/ ketchup or sprinkle a dash of salt over my omelet. It also came with toast (your choice of bread) and this raspberry preserves or marmalade...which was a compliment to my toast! The french toast on the other hand, there was no syrup supplied or powdered sugar dashed over my french toast!!!!. What is french toast w/o the syrup and powdered sugar?!!!...even if strawberries engulf the french toast and the mascarpone is graced with a strawberry tinge...this does not suffice for its true indulgence if you have an absence of syrup and ps!... Nonetheless, I decided to venture into the french toast...it was alright, i ended up saving for the following day for breakfast...this is the reason i knocked off a star because they did not supply any syrup or powdered sugar. For the record, I decided to order the french toast to see if it would outnumber my current favorite french toast and the answer is no. I am still hooked on my fave and dare others to sway my vote and transform me into a french toast convert. The juice blend was delicious! I like this place because of the healthy,fresh,wide range of foods offered on the menu...they have juice blends, smoothies and offer a unique twist with more variety!
