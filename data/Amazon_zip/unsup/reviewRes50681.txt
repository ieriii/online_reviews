Big Jones is an overlooked gem on Clark Street, the main stretch of Andersonville bustling with dozens of restaurants all vying for your attention. While Southern-style cuisine isn't my favorite, I found a few tasty, well-presented dishes of good proportions. The New Orleans eggs with crab cakes is one of the best brunch meals I've had in the city. For dinner, the crawfish boudin was a nice appetizer to start -- three perfectly-shaped fried balls of crawfish and sausage with cayenne mayonnaise. I also sampled the sweetbreads appetizer, my first foray into fatty, fried thymus. The verdict: While I wasn't a fan of the calf organs, the leeks and greens on which the sweetbreads were served added tasty vegetables to this heavy, high-fat meal. The house burger with Gruyere -- one of my favorite cheeses -- and garlic aioli satisfied my red meat craving that night. It's no Kuma's burger but still provides a nice hunk of meat with toppings that complement nicely. And who can forget the cornbread -- warm, moist comfort food at its finest served with honey-whipped butter at the start of dinner. I could eat a whole meal of this soft, hearty goodness.
