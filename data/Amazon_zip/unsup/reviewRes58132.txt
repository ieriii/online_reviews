We loved this place! My sweetheart took me here for Sweetest Day and it was an amazing total experience - from the decor to the personable staff to the wonderful 'Iron Chef' food! We spoke with one of the chefs which was informative. After a variety of tapas (try anything!) we had the round chocolate churros (yummo) and took a walk around the beautiful Blackstone Hotel. Overall, this is a must for food lovers and we will visit again soon for more tapas.....
