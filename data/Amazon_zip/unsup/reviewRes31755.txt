I love this place. I have been eating here for years. Their menu is not super inventive, but that's the best part. You can get all the wonderful comfort-food dishes you grew up eating, veggie-style. The sandwiches are really the way to go. Get the vegan mac n' cheese as a side. Vegan gyros! Ruebens! Dagwood sandwiches! And then just when you think you will die of gastronomic happines... vegan chocolate chip cheesecake! Holy god. I have strong and undeniable cravings for Chicago Diner foods at least two-three times a month. When I was in India I missed two kinds of food: Tex Mex and Chicago Dinner.
