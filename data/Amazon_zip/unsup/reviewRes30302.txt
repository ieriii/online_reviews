I was very excited to go here because I have been following Rick Bayless' career for a long time. And my food was good - but not amazing. I was also a little surprised that on such a large menu there were only a few vegetarian options for my friend. My poor husband, who has a garlic allergy, was told that they could make him a chicken breast with green salsa because everything else on the menu contains garlic. However, they did a lovely presentation and he said the chicken was really tender and juicy and the salsa was tasty too. They also discovered that the mashed potato side didn't have garlic so they brought him some of that. I had the jamaica flower agua, which was a little too sweet for my taste, but pleasing in flavor. I also had some really good ceviche and a bite of the vegetarian tamale. I had black rice with seafood for my entree, which was good, just a little flat. While everything was very well-prepared, I just felt like it was missing that something special to make it worth a return visit next time I'm in Chicago. I'll try and plan and get reservations at Topolobampo instead.
