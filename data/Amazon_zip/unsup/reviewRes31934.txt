The girls and I enjoy coming here for their happy hour specials that they have weekdays from 5-7pm. Not sure if I can justify coming here otherwise as it can get pretty pricey. The decor is beautiful, the food is solid and the drinks (esp the peared sake...that cinnamon rim works soo well) is great. We have only had great service there as well. It can get quite loud there though so might not be the best place for good conversation.
