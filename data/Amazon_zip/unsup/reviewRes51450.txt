YUMMY! i can't believe that I gave Chipotle the same rating. LOL! This place is awesome! I'll start by saying my mom has tried to copy their salsa, and while hers is great, Garcia's has a knack for some good salsa. And that's only the START.....they are cheap ( and not in the negative way), authentic, in a nice area, and.....have a juke box!!!! how cool? I suggest that anytime you go you MUST start your appetizer with NACHOS!!!! and from there.....anything goes! because there that good! also, my parents and aunt seem to really enjoy the margarita's here!
