Wow their food is awesome. I went here because my wife is Brazilian and she said this is the top of the line for restaurants in Brazil too.  The food was spectacular, from the salad bar, which had a huge variety including delicious smoked salmon. The meat was amazing too. The pieces were perfectly cooked and some of the slices tasted like steak bacon... yummy! The servers were on top of their game. Whenever we flipped our cards for more meat we got 3 servers over by us within 3 minutes. It wasn't slow either they had around 500 seats filled when we were there. A great experience and amazing food. Dinner is $50 per person, drinks are $10. Make sure to get a caipirinha otherwise you're not really getting the Brazilian experience. Plus the bartender seemed very nice. Although service was great, the servers seemed a little rushed, some of them were literally running in the place, great to see the effort, but I think a more subdued energy is appropriate for such a nice place. Also, I wish they would've played Brazilian music not US pop which I thought was weird. Brazil has great music so I thought that was a miss. Finally a little more space would've been ideal, but hey that wouldn't be as brazilian anyway. Overall, dress up but unbutton your pants.
