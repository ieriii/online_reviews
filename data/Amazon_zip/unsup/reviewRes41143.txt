I was walking around, looking for a place to eat. Nothing really stood out until I walked by Pho Xe Tang, which was slammed with business including many people who appeared to know what good Vietnamese food is. Because they looked Vietnamese. There's a reason you never see Mexican people in Taco Bell. The menu is outrageously long, the portions are obscenely large, and there is nothing offensive about the price. Booyah. I think I had the #85 - whichever one has three different animals in it, that's the one I got. I'll admit it's not the cleanest place, but then again neither is my apartment so I'm not qualified to talk on that point. Service was good. I imagine getting a table can be difficult at times because it's so popular, but then, the reason you're going is the reason it's popular...
