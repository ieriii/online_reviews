At the time of review Hot Doug's has 1034 user generated ratings and similar number of quality comments. There's absolutely nothing new I can add, but I had to give these guys my 5-stars. Why: 1. Doug spent about 5 minutes chatting with us despite a line about one neighborhood block long (which didn't take terribly long). 2. Very cheap, quality meal. The only 'high price' item is the duck sausage - but that has foie gras and truffles. That's a deal. 3. Duck fat fries - enough said. 4. Duck fat fries - where else are you going to get these Seriously, no hyperbole, tastiest meal I've had in Chicago. Doug is an inspiration for anyone who hates their day job, because it's very apparent that he doesn't.
