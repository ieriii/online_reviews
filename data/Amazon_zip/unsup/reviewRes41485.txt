Magnifique!! For starters, BYOB. I went here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. We had the option of fixe prix menu or choose our own. We decided to get the fixe prix another time. I had my eye on the sea scallop, seafood dish.  For apps, we shared the rabbit, which was wonderfully cooked in a delicious juice and the gnocchi were fantastic! My scallop dish did not disappoint. I was weary of the fact that there was only 1 scallop, but it was big and there were plenty of muscles and clams to accompany it.  Being a desert fanatic, I had to try something and went with the bread pudding. They were nice enough to change it around a bit because it came with a white chocolate creme anglaise and I don't like white chocolate. So the chef went with caramel on top, with a dark chocolate truffle on the side, with strawberries, and the creme anglaise in a cup. Silly me, cause I ended up loving the creme anglaise anyway. There was a personal touch to everything, from the service, to the food, so I will be back here again and again.
