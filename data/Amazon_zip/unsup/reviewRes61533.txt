So after all these years I decided to check out the Cafezazzo in the neighborhood and I was glad I did. I was pleasantly surprised at the place. It was very colorful and super clean. The young lady at the counter was pleasent and gave me a few suggestions for dinner. Although I was taking the dish home, I did order a Strawberry shake (which my niece swears by now, and tasting it was an attack of the taste buds) that was very much like tasting fresh strawberries. To go I took a chicken burrito that accompanied beans and rice, but the rice was not typical Mexican rice, it had a green shade and was beyond awesome. To top things off I got a homemade chocolate chip cookie the size of a soft ball that was scrumdiliumchious! Definitely will be back for the Sunday Brunch that everyone raves about. So I hope to see you there!
