Solid pizza, good flavors, props for microbrews. The service isn't that great, but it's a pizza joint more for hanging out, not for an intimate date. The space is huge and interesting. Come for the atmosphere, stay for the food and beer. They don't claim to be fancy and gourmet, they claim to offer good pizza and good beer to go along with it. Also, props to this place for their delicious goat cheese appetizer.
