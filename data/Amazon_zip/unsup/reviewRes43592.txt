Service was great. I thought the food was just fine, nothing crazy but still very good. But I'm not a foodie. However I ordered a strawberry lemonade type alcoholic drink...and THAT was insanely good!  Definitely recommend. We were very late for our reservation and I kept calling to keep them in the loop and apologize but they were extremely gracious about it.
