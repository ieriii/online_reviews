I don't like the Northside and I avoid it for the most part--The Pasta Bowl is one of the only reasons I would go north of Roosevelt (Okay I'm exaggerating but it's kinda true). There is nothing bad about Pasta Bowl. They have a good variety of delicious food and the service is very prompt and friendly. Try the fried ravioli ( I think that's what it's called) as an appetizer and I love all their salads, add chicken if you want. The salads are fresh and bountiful and not made with iceberg lettuce. The Pasta is really yummy and it totally hits the spot. They give you a very generous portion of everything. I could go on and on. If you're hungry and you want a big, delicious salad or indulge in a big bowl of pasta I would highly recommend The Pasta Bowl. Did I mention it is totally affordable? You can have an amazing meal for two for under $25 dollars.  Mmmmm...Pasta Bowl
