Only been here once, but i was very unimpressed. I had the rib-eye. A staple steak I order in many steakhouses. It tasted like I got a flimsy rib-eye at Jewel and put it in the broiler for twenty minutes. The steak had no flavor at all.  Oysters Rockefeller were mighty tasty though... I can't lie. Much better steakhouses in the city...
