I started eating here about 6 years ago, and I tried not to tell anyone about it because it was only a few blocks from where I live. I would in fact tell people how terrible everything was about this place like the food and service in hopes of keeping in "underground" In all my hipster efforts to keep this place secluded and underground, I have failed and now everyone knows about it. The food is the best. I only order one thing after trying everything, the Meli French Toast which I cannot find anywhere else with good reason. I spoke to the owner in great detail regarding the recipe and technique and he stated that he has a special Challah bread made for his restaurant and that is why the toast is extra soft and light. The rest of the plates are also fantastic like the Greek yogurt and honey which I normally split with another person.
