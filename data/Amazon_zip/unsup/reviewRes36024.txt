Having grown up and in Chinatown (Cermak & Wentworth) and raised on this food, this is the closest you will find on Chicago's Northside. This new location is better and nicer than the old place and everything is in one big room instead of two. The food is the best and priced very reasonable. And the take out up front is great for getting BBQ pork, duck, etc. to go. My favorite is their fish and spareribs.
