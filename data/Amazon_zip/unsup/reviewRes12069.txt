My gym is right by this place and the aroma that enchants your nose as you walk by is nothing less than mouthwatering. Or maybe I'm just always hungry when I'm done working out. Either way, I had to give it a try. We made reservations for Sunday night and the place was pretty busy when we walked in. The decor was very nice..artsy, latin and warm. Our waiter kept addressing us as 'lady and gentelman' which I'm still not sure how I feel about. The acorn squash soup was good..not the best I've ever had but whenever I see it on a menu, I have to give it a shot. I am not much of a carnivore but I'm trying. I decided to baby step it with the single pork chop. LADIES BEWARE --this is not a dainty piece of meat. The thing covered my plate and I felt like I was sawing into it. It was Good but a bit too much for me.  I will be back to try the scallops which looked delicious.
