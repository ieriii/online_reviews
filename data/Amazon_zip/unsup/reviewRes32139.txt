I have been passing by this place for years & wanted to try it. Groupon had finally prompted the venture & we ordered - sambussa sampler - WOW yummy!!! Especially the lentil & vegies. vegetarian messob - really good vegetables & bread! I was weary to try this place before because I heard the bread is very sour. However, it actually adds to the food perfectly and is quite filling. Maybe I'll try the meat one next time.
