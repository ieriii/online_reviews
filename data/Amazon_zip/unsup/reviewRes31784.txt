Loved this joint! It's nice to be able to get organic restaurant food in the city in a casual environment (versus some of the delicious yet very high end places that mostly serve it). We went for brunch w/my husband, aunt and uncle. I got the nanadict w/o chorizo. Great texture, fresh flavors and really good potatoes (and as an Irish gal, I'm very particular about my fave root vegetable). My husband got the huevos rancheros and my aunt and uncle each got a burger. I'm normally not a meat eater but when it's pasture raised meat, I'll make an exception and try a bite. The burger was flavorful, juicy and cooked to medium perfection just like they ordered! Service was friendly, helpful and warm. We absolutely felt like we were eating at a friends house! It's worth the trip down to Bridgeport even if you don't live around there. Enjoy the sun bathed, small and well decorated dining room as well as their yummy food and incredibly sweet staff.
