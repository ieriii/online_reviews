The service was quite nice and gracious, but the food, on the other hand, is quite mediocre. There may be some lucky spots on the side for free parking, but otherwise, it's either valet or metered. I had the daily special, which was the Pumpkin ravioli with some burnt diced butternut squash cubes in a 'burnt butter sage' sauce. There were about 3 raviolis there, and it was definitely filled with pumpkin puree. The butternut squash cubes that were burnt were kind of mind boggling, since I thought only the sauce was supposed to be 'burnt.' It was okay, but I believe that no one could beat the butternut squash ravioli over at the late Tucci Benucch on 900 North. My friend had the Risotto ai Funghi, which was a huge plate of Italian arborio rice sauted with wild mushrooms, herbs and parmigiano. That was an overwhelming portion, and I've never seen risotto served in such a way in which it just stops your heart from shock. It had a hint of wine, and the rice seemed a bit overly cooked. It was creamy, but it was just okay (The May Street Market had the best risotto, hands down). The restaurant itself was cute, and it seemed nice to sit by the open air; however, the food was just mediocre at best. Better food at the Olive Garden.
