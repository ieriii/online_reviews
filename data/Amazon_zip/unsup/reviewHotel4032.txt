Pretty nice hotel. Attentive staff, expensive restaurants and they don't tell you but if you go to the basement of the West tower and go into the building next door there are restaurants and a Dunkin Donuts! Since we don't have one at home that was a real treat! The location is fabulous for so much within walking distance, and if you get really tired, which we did the last day, taxi's are inexpensive to get back to the Hotel. The only complaint was the water pressure which wasn't good in our room in the sink or the shower, but since this is our biggest complaint no worries. Oh also the lack of a pool, would have been nice for our child to be able to swim a bit, but I noticed that not a lot of hotels offer a pool o okay I guess.
