Have you been to B&H Photo Video in NYC? It's an electronics store owned and staffed exclusively by Hassidic Jews. There are no women to be found. Everything runs very efficiently, maybe a little too efficiently. Sometimes it seems like there are more staff than customers. Greek Islands is a little like that. It seems like each server has only one table, and each table has it's own bus person, and they both hover over you ready to fill your water glass after one sip. The servers were mostly older men, presumably of Greek or Mediterranean descent, with Mexican sous chefs and bus service. If they have so many servers, it makes me worry about how well they are being paid, and the lack of women makes me a bit uncomfortable. My dad insisted that we go to Greek Islands again after he had been during a previous visit to Chicago. The best thing about this place is that it has room for large groups. We arrived around 4 so it was easy but I think they get pretty busy so maybe a reservation is best. My partner and I got a mix of different veggie side dishes. As vegetarians, the moussaka/eggplant and bean appetizers were the best choice. The flaming cheese was fun but salty. Nothing was too offensive but I'll try another place in Greektown before coming back here.
