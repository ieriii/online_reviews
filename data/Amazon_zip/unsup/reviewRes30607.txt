Underwhelmed. Noisy downstairs, we asked to be moved and were accommodated. We ended up on the 2nd floor which was marginally better. Salads were good, steak was just fair. My steak came out nearly rare, I ended up "butterflying" it and letting it finish cooking on the 400 degree serving plate. In my mind, the steak should come out perfect without any additional work necessary. The butter cake dessert was excellent - would recommend coming in for dessert and coffee only.
