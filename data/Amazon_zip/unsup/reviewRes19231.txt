The Gage is a favorite for me because of the food & service. The ambiance leaves much to be desired, though, due to dim lighting and NOISE! Even in the dining area (separate from the bar area) it is very difficult for me to carry on a conversation with my dining companion. But the food rules here. Tonight, we loved a rabbit salad. My fluke entre was perfect, light and fresh, delightfully plated, with interesting accompaniments. My companion enjoyed her special arctic char, too. A chocolate flourless cake with malted milk highlights was superb in every regard. Our server was very helpful and responsive and the bussers were polished, as well. I rate it highly, noise notwithstanding, though I have to think twice every time I return -- if only they could quiet things down...
