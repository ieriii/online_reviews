I've been coming to this place for over 40 yrs. and I love it. It is family-owned and still maintained that home-cooked meal quality about their food. It is quite popular so at any given time you might have to wait to be seated. The food is very tasty, portions are excellent and prices are hard to beat, especially here in Chi-town. The service is good, the servers are quick and very experience, I've never had to send anything back. Its a bit loud but bearable. It is a byob, no credit cards accepted.
