I only can't give this place 5 stars because I didn't actually sit down to eat. I went in there to buy tea-to-go while I was waiting for a show to start at the House of Blues across the street. The Host was extremely nice. Much nicer than other places I've been to. I was a little skeptical because some of these places often turn out to be really pretentious and their service will be down in the dumps unless you look like you're an executive. This was not the case, like I said the host was super nice and amiable . I definitely will make the effort to go there for lunch one day and try their wine. (Looking through their price-list it seems like they are pretty moderate which is always a plus especially in the downtown area.)
