you close at 4, omgwtfbbq!? We made the mistake of waiting until the last minute before we needed to head back to the airport and just called ahead and ordered (which was smart because after we left there was a crazy long line), but only ordered the basic dog in stead of the more exotic items on the menu. we didn't get fries, which after reading these reviews below, was obviously a mistake. I like Murphy's better as of now, but I want to come back and get something more exciting and some fries... Guy at the register, so god damn crazy nice, Chicago kinda weirded us out about how nice everyone was... weird.
