I came here for dinner early on a Thursday night (about 5:30) and there was no wait. Woo! Patience is not one of my virtues. A note to the underaged: they card. I've been legal for a few years now, but I don't know what the hell happened to my ID, so I ended up with hot chocolate. The rich, slightly bitter cocoa made me forget alllllll about that forbidden wine. I had the Ahodaga (mild because I'm a wuss) and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth. Carnitas FTW! The tomato broth was a nice touch. My friend had the Gunthorp Chicken, which was also good, but not as intense. I almost tripped over Rick Bayless outside. (He was measuring the sidewalk..?) Then I turned and stared, busted out laughing, and walked away. It was smooth. But yeah, he's real. ***** THE CHURROS: GET THEM! ***** You're welcome.
