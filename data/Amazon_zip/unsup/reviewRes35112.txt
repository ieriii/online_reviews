BF thinks I give out too many 5-star ratings, and I think he's right, because now I wish there was a 6-star rating to give to Shaw's. I've been jonesing for a crab cake from Shaw's so we headed up on a Sunday afternoon at half-time and parked ourselves at the Oyster Bar. I just absolutely love this place, and actually prefer it to the more formal dining area (which is lovely, but a totally different experience...also 5-star). The bartender was so attentive (not to mention gorgeous), and I proceeded to slam a microbrew (I forget which one it was, but it was something I've never had before). I ordered my crabcake and BF got oysters. If a restaurant can be judged by the bread they serve (as some say) I am sticking with my "6-star" rating, as the bread and butter were so flipping good. My crab cake arrived and it was exactly as I remembered, and BF's oysters were apparently fresh and delicious or whatever a good oyster is (I do not partake). Then he ordered clam chowder, which I proceeded to dip bread into. OMG was it ever good! I don't particularly love clam chowder normally, but I would totally order this next time. The service was so great that it's as if the kitchen had a camera on us in preparation to bring out the next item...perfectly timed and piping hot. BF got fish tacos, also excellent. I got the blueberry and peach cobbler...which I really didn't share with the BF as I think he was afraid he would lose a hand if he tried sampling it. It was the perfect Sunday afternoon. Thanks, Shaw's!
