Great brunch spot! I had the french toast and my husband had the jalapeno pork chop. Both were delicious! The service, however, was lacking. We came for brunch on a Sunday at around 11:30 with a group of six. Since we were a large group, we didn't mind waiting for the whole party to arrive before getting a table as they seemed to be a bit busy over the noon hour. We ended up getting seated around 12:30 just as their traffic was beginning to slow considerably, however, we didn't leave until almost 2:30. It took forever to get a server to take our drink/food orders let alone come back for refills. We will definitely be back as their dinner selections look tasty, but probably won't dine in a large group or during a "peak" time.
