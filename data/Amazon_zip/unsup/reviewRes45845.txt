Restaurant Review Average food, but great view of the Mag mile. Grand Lux is a chain restaurant with the only location in IL located right above the Mag Mile. This place always has a long line I believe due to it's prime location. You take the escalator up to the top where you are greeted with a spectacular view of the Mag Mile. Be sure to get reservations or prepare for a long wait. The food genre is your typical american food pasta, burgers, steaks, and fish without anything too special. Prices are above average, but you won't go bankrupt. One of the highlights are the desserts which are spectacular with molten chocolate cake and red velvet cake. Pro- great view, good portions, excellent desserts Con- long wait times, average foods Hidden deal- none
