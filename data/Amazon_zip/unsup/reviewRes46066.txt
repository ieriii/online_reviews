Can a chain restaurant blow your taste buds into outer space? Yes. Yes, it can. Grand Lux is a gem. It is easy to miss. The restaurant sits atop many stores on Michigan Ave, but the entrance is on Ohio St. Once you find the lucky door, go in, go up the stairs, and take a journey to heaven. Food heaven, that is.  I've gone to Grand Lux on multiple occasions. Once you are seated, a basket of bread is placed on your table. The inside of the bread is as soft as a cloud, and the crust is crunchy (yummy combo). You will likely get a wheat bread AND sour dough bread; both are fresh and warm just for you! If you go during the lunch hours (11am-5pm) then you can get sweet specials (great food at affordable prices). I usually get the half Margherita Pizza and half soup or salad. Their Cream of Asparagus soup is absolutely divine! The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is devilishly good. The Chicken isn't drowning in the buffalo sauce, that's refreshing. All great options, but they are not the reason why I'm writing this review. I went to Grand Lux last night in a spontaneous gesture. I ordered the Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich. If I thought the other foods were heavenly, this is definitely otherworldly. A grilled chicken sandwich with melted cheese, a little bacon, avocado, and lettuce/tomato. First thing that caught my eye was the amount of avocado on that bad boy! There was half an avocado on my sandwich! Even me, an avocado lover, thought that was a bit much...so I shared with my friend. However, you can never have too much avocado! Some places barely give you avocado scraps.  Their deserts are also godly. Grand Lux has deserts that are baked once you order them. I am a HUGE fan of their beignets and mini cupcakes. Props to Grand Lux for dishing out the good stuff! You've definitely turned me into a loyalist.
