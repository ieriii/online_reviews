This place is definitely lives up to the hype! I can't wait to go back again to try the crepes! The table next to us pretty much ordered every crepe imaginable and they looked and smelled incredible! I ordered the Artichoke Frittatas and was pleasantly surprised. This omelet was packed with all my favorite veggies and was much larger than I expected. My friend ordered the Cajun Scrambler which I will admit was better than what I ordered, but in my opinion a little heavy for breakfast. I definitely recommend trying both. Oh and order the fresh orange juice too! Just remember this place is a cafe so I wouldn't recommend it for large groups. It gets pretty crowded and the wait can be ridiculous, but luckily going at 8:30am on a Sunday morning worked out for us just fine. Cute decor, friendly staff, and great atmosphere.
