Love Sprout. Service is good. The food is amazing!!! My choices: Egg minus the pork (vegeterian) --- I was in heaven. If you're a truffle lover TAKE THE EGG. Omg I'm considering ordering it to go one day. The Mushroom --- Very very good. Love the flavors. Lemon --- I took it because of all the reviews here, but I have to say I'm not a fan.... We had a few drinks. My first one was a negroni (something like that) and I hated it! Tasted like nyquil. The second was the Aviator and that was much better. Overall the place is quite small, but very cozy and nice. Our server was very helpful.. The only bad thing about it all was that for the second course I only had one vegeterian choice (which was very good - so it turned out ok ) :(. Overall I will definitelly be going back - I loved the place. And once more - if there TAKE THE EGG :))
