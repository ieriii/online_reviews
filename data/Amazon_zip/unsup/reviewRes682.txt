i SO wanted to give this place five stars being a chi-town native AND for the wait and the expense but sorry they only get three. I made a reservation a couple months in advance for my dan mans bday. i thought what could be better then this futuristic concept? but when i got there i was disapointed to see that the decor was not inviting or worthy of the near 500 dollar meal. the website made the place look SO cool and pretty. it was cold, sterile, uninviting, and drab. it kind of reminded me of the movie 1984. the atmosphere was so quiet and echo-y that it made me feel uncomfortable and it was kind of dark. if you are going to make food of the future that is expensive as hell make the decor light, vibrant, attractive, and inviting. make it feel like you are experiencing something amazing. the food was okay. i liked that they were vegetarian friendly. but the rush of all these little food entrees at erratic speeds probably did not make me appreciate it as much as i should have. i felt uncomfortable like dining should be relaxed and casual not highly synchronized like clockwork to where you feel rushed. i will give them props for the dessert. it was a frozen mousse that they laid a rubber mat on the table and decorated it with chocolate drizzle and then they cracked the frozen mousse on the mat. like the dessert was table art. i thought that was pretty cool. but if they lighten up the decor and give the service a more relaxed feel i think it might be worth all that money.
