One of my favorite places in the city - not for the food but for the beer. The atmosphere here is very inviting. It's loud and dimly lit with appealing dark wood stylings. It's like someone made a pricy loft into a pub. In terms of beer, Bottoms up wit is the go to easy drinking beer. Gold Cross is so-so. I'm a fan of the Eugene when it's in - a pretty hefty drink. The food is good not great. The pizza is where you should lean towards here - although this is admittedly one of those "throw ten thousand things on a pie" places. The combinations tend to be well-balanced though. Best of all - they announced recently that they'll be bottling and selling their beers soon. Fantastic!
