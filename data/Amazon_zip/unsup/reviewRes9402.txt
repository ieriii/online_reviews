This place reminds me of the Raffles hotel in Singapore. Food was lovely, service was superb and the inside seriously took me out of Chicago and back into Asia.  The menu has a huge selection of choices. We went for a chicken salad pork ribs and spring rolls. Each dish was flavored nicely and pretty authentic. I am so excited to try the one in Midtown, NYC!  I would definitely say this is a great date spot. The upstairs was spacious and there was a bar. It is dark but inviting...definitely a great spot to grab drinks!
