Decided to have dinner with the girls here and my little one (5yr old), always drove past this place but never had tried it before until now. The place is really nice inside, lights are low but I guess works well with the music (salsa, tropical). We ordered the mix empanadas, chorizo, guava & beef. They were pretty good except the guava. I ordered the Pargo Filete and it came with white rice and black beans, grilled red & green bell peppers and 2 pieces of cooked plantain (which I find taste horribly). I was disappointed in the dish I ordered because the filete had no flavor to it aside from the bit of lemon juice I squeezed from the lemons I requested. My friends ordered chicken dishes which they were all satisfied with. For my little one I ordered a chicken soup, the bowl was really big, of course she just had some spoonfuls. The wait time to receive our food was about an hour and we had to ask the waiter for cutlery utensils. There is only one small washroom which is used for both men and women. The patio seemed nice, we were seated inside. Overall this place is a nice spot to have a nice evening with close friends or family.
