I highly recommend The Pasta Bowl, and I plan on returning. Service: Quick and Friendly Price: Cheap (2 people $35 w/ tip including appetizer, two dishes, and a dessert) Atmosphere: Surprisingly nice. This is a great place to just go grab a quick bite to eat by yourself, a group of friends, or even for a casual date. Food/Quality: Very good and filling/plentiful.
