My husband and I had our first date here seven years ago, when it was divey and the restaurant didn't exist. Needless to say, I have a certain fondness for this place. I don't come here often, but we went on Monday for his birthday. We arrived late - after 9pm - and it was still bumping. The food (mussels galore) was pretty stellar and while the service was less than impressive (they temporarily lost my credit card and charged me twice), it just added to the charm. Or maybe it was my beer goggles. Either way, the Hopleaf is a treat just for drinks, for dinner or both.
