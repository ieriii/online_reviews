First taste of the nightlife in Chicago consisted of hopping around a few bars. Then we stopped by a bar which I can not remember the name of. Watched an awesome baseball game between the San Diego Padres and the Chicago Cubs and played some photo video game. Let me set up the situation here; bottom of the 9th inning, San Diego was trailing Chicago 1-0 and were down to their last out. This is when Ms. Indecisive says whoever wins this game will determine where she goes to school. And guess what happened? San Diego ties it up 1-1. The Kyle Blanks hits a 3 run homer a few batters later to win the game. Can you say fate? Ok, back to Violet Hour. So the rest of the group decides to go home and as we walked by the Violet Hour we spot a celebrity: Juliette Lewis. Me and my rotund friend decide to go check it out since its her favorite bar and all. We were sat in the back bar near Juliette and her entourage. The bartender seemed really knowledgable and took his time making our drinks. I got the Juliet and Romeo(if thats sounds girly, blame Michelle). The drinks were awesome, it's too bad we got there late and near closing time. Coolest bar I have been to so far.
