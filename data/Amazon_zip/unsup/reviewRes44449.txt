This is one of my favorite summer spots. Get some iced coffee, a good book and a seat out in the patio. Nice and relaxing and makes you feel pleasantly alone in a big city . **Add this part on 12.27.07 Of late I've been getting friend's birthday cakes there, which have always been a huge splash at their parties. They're a bit pricey but well worth it, in every way. Normally when my friends have birthday parties no one really eats the cake, but every time I bring an Alliance cake they get eaten within a half hour. Also, their cupcakes are great. My fiancee and I always stop in here to grab treats and coffee when we visit my friend who lives a block away and they love it! so, yeah, I dig the place and you should definitely check it out.
