First time at Demera and also first time to an Ethopian restaurant. Atmosphere is nice and they have a live musician playing (Friday night). We got a corner table next to a window and people watching was great (right on Lawrence Ave.) Service was a bit slow; it took us 7-8 minutes to be greeted at our tables.  As for the the food: The honey wine was overwhelmingly sweet, I recommend only getting a glass per person. The food was the bright spot of the meal, everything seemed very fresh. We ordered a messob for two and we couldn't finish it. The injera was delicious and I found myself unable to stop eating. Overall: good food, terrible service, I would recommend it only for larger groups as it is a lively atmosphere.
