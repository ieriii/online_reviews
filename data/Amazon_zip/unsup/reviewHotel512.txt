I've stayed at the ES twice now, both for business. The rooms are very clean and modern looking. The front desk staff is quite helpful. The location is great for walking to Michigan Avenue and nearby attractions. A taxi ride to Wicker park for instance cost me about $6. The breakfast each morning is good, although I didn't care for the eggs. The gym is small: there are 4 treadmills and a small variety of free weights. I would continue to choose the Embassy Suites Lakefront as my hotel of choice when visiting Chicago.
