Greek Islands on S Halstead is my go to restaurant. Whether dining inside or taking carry-out to eat at home the food is always good. The wine list offers a variety of Greek and non-Greek wines. For appetizers the feta cheese with olives or the taramosalata spread on pita, the dolmades or hot lima beans are good starters. The lamb dishes are very flavorful and so well prepared. The kokkinisto, lamb in tomato sauce is a favorite as are the keftedes. The best way to end one of these meals is with a strong Greek coffee. The service was good..didn't hover yet didn't make you feel lonely. I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. Simple, beautiful decor and the lightening was perfect..not too bright, perfectly dimmed. Greek Islands is a restaurant with great food, a warm, inviting decor and friendly staff..it makes you feel at home.
