Meli has great brunch, and the omelets are absolutely huge! Enough for two meals. I'm docking a star for service, though, because if you want a waitress who will actually be pleasant to you, this isn't the place to go. The waitresses are pretty harried and consistently sub-par. I've been many, many times because I live around the corner, and there have definitely been occasions when I've had to stalk someone down to get a second cup of coffee. Luckily the food is reliably fantastic.
