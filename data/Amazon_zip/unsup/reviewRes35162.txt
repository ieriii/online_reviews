Disappointed at the food quality at this place. I like the old small restaurant on Argyle better. After the expansion at this new place on Broadway, the food does not seem to taste as good or as authentic Chinese food. food now tastes more like Chinese good catered to western customers. There are better authentic Chinese restaurants near by.
