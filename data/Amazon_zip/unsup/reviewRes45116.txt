Anteprima is a cute place - very inviting from the outside and the inside decor. However once inside it is jam packed full of people sitting practically on top of one another. This is an experience common in NYC but not so great in Chi-town. Plus it is so LOUD you practically have to shout to talk to your friends over dinner. The menu is diverse but I was hoping they would have a few normal italian items on the menu. Do I have to eat goats stomach or whatever the odd meat and seafood choices were. Chicken Picatta may be boring but I would have ordered it cause I like it. Mussels picata or whatever they had wasn't going to do it for me. The server was stone faced, cold, not friendly at all and barely interacted with us. In fact it took about 5 minutes for him to get out of my way so I could even sit down when I arrived. All the waitstaff seemed stressed and serious. I've definately been spoiled by the friendly competent servers from the LETTUCE ENTERTAIN YOU restaurants I guess. My friend ordered the ravioli and it was a couple teeny tiny pieces that tasted like oranges. Portion and taste were terrile. I think he had to eat something later cause he was not happy. Overall - too crowded, loud, expensive and we will not be going back. One thing to say about the crowd - it seemed to be a lot of Lincoln Park Stye yuppies over impressed with themselves. I had to sit back and laugh because this space used to be a gay male strip club. It made their pretentions being there seem hilarious.
