Lively yet cozy atmosphere. Spectacular service, the last (and first) time I dined there with my boyfriend we were served by Eric who was not only extremely knowledgeable but very attentive. All his recommendations were spot on from the sauce for steak to a white wine paring for my filet. They really took the time to make you feel special. I was impressed when the manager took a moment to introduce himself and ask us about our evening, worth every penny. Have already recommended and will certainly be back!
