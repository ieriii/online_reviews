Food is outstanding and the Porter is a great beer. I've been twice and each time we can only have 1-2 beers since the service is soooo slow. I understand it's busy and new, but I could see our waiter just talking to other waiters and actually had to ask the table next to us to share their ketchup. If you have time, its a good place with great food and beer.
