I keep on going here, and the Publican keeps on delivering. Not sure why I gave it only 4 stars before, because it really deserves 5. Sunday brunch is especially enjoyable and easier to get in . Great dishes like scrapple, red wine poached egg, weiswurst, waffles - and amazing sides like the super special Publican bacon, truffle oil hash browns, and pork rinds.
