Ree-dic-you-lus wings. In all seriousness though Crisp is serving up some of the best wings in town. Now yes, these aren't your typical leg and wing smothered in a butter based wing sauce no no, these are pretty damn authentic whole leg and wing deep fried and covered in one of four Korean sauces. I had the BBQ sauce and I entered meat heaven. Korea is known for their fried chicken and Crisp does a great job at keeping this tradition alive and well here in Chicago. I go to Chicago wing fest every year and can say that these wings blow away a lot of the places that are there. I had the Buddha bowl as well which was tasty, but the wings stole the show. If you're in the mood for some wings of a slightly different variety head over to Crisp.
