I like the food, but this place by far has the worse delivery service on EARTH!!!  I ordered delivery from there at least 10 times and guess what? 10 out of 10 times they forgot my hot sauce. I had enough and called them to remind them to bring the hot sauce.....THEY FORGOT IT AGAIN! Not only that, they forgot the extra falafel that i ordered....wait they forgot the original falafel that comes with the combo.  Oh yea, the 9th time that they forgot the hot sauce i called in to complain and they gave me $15 credit for all the times they forgot it.  A month later i ordered delivery to get my $15 credit worth of food. Guess what they forgot the hot sauce and the falafel!!!!! OMG they gave me $15 credit for the hot sauce and they forgot the hot sauce!!! What does it take for me to get the hotsauce????? SERIOUSLY SULTAN PLEASE bring the hotsauce and the falafel!!!  AIGHT I'M DONE WITH THIS PLACE! SERIOUSLY!!!
