My absolute favorite place for brunch in this city. And why is that? Two words: cheese grits. I'm obsessed. I often wonder why I have never gone in just to order a giant bowl of them. I'm very happy with my two eggs over easy, bacon, toast and of course, the cheese grits. Sure the side they give you isn't the biggest portion but I'm sure my arteries are thanking you for that. In fact, the only reason I like this location better than the one in the West Loop is b/c they put the side of grits in a bowl instead of on a plate. Really? That's like ladling soup on a plate. Maybe it's just me. Everyone I've taken to this place falls in love with it as well. My sister in laws makes me take her every time she's in the city just so she can get the scrambled eggs with cream cheese. I'm only taking off one star b/c I'm not as in love with lunch and dinner here. I keep it a strictly brunch place. And from the size of the crowds that gather on the weekends, I'm not alone. . .
