Perhaps I'm just not as picky as a lot of reviewers on this site? I really enjoyed my experience of Grand Lux. Yes we had to wait. Yes it was busy and noisy. Yes the food was good not great. That said, what a great room with an eager, young and helpful staff. Plus they've created a great "value for money" menu. My summary: great fun, great meal and I'll be back.
