Beer was good, large selection. Service is good too. BUT, the food... I got the brisket Reuben sandwich with fries. Fries were good, but the meat - the MEAT! The fattiest beef I have ever had. There was a quarter inch layer of fat on the meat. It was gross. I barely finished the sandwich and was sick afterwards. Now, no red meat for a month. Too much fat. I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be, but damn!
