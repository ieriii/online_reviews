So you're down on the mag mile, checking out the usual shops, spots and tourist traps, when suddenly you belly tells you that it's time for you to catch a bite. There's absolutely NO better place to grab some grub downtown, than Grand Lux. Whether a romantic date, a business 'thing', hanging with friends, or entertaining out-of-towners, Grand Lux is the answer.It's fairly hip, pseudo-upscale, but affordable, and relaxed. There's a great wine list, and the pasta dishes are f**king amazing. The wait for a table isn't too bad, even on "on-nights" like Fridays and Saturdays (the longest I've had to wait was like twenty minutes). The staff is courteous, quick, and knowledgeable about the menu, and the valets get your car back to you fast when you're done. The only downside to the restaurant is that there's no smoking, but nowadays, nobody has smoking. There are tons of places to eat in the Loop, especially on the Mag Mile, but the Grand Lux Cafe is the best. I can't recommend this place enough.....
