I admit it, I ordered a carry out and all I got was the Sweet Potatoes. I sat in front of my TV, and polished off every single bite. I was tempted to lick the container (OK, I DID lick the container). This has to be one of the most highly addictive dishes out there. I don't even want to imagine the number of calories I just consumed.....I'll be working out an extra hour tomorrow (maybe two extra hours and then I can order them again).
