I had pretty high expectations headed into my dinner at The Publican. Partly from the awesome reviews on Yelp and partly because two of my favorite things in the world are pork and beer. Not only was the beer list extensive, but it also met the needs of everyone in our group. I asked our server for a recommendation and she was beyond helpful. She made several suggestions, but was at no point pushy.  The food was excellent and the atmosphere was even better. I have every intention of getting a giant fattened pig portrait for my home. I have yet to inform my wife, but I think she'll get used to it. Back to the service and atmosphere. We tried a variety of smaller plates for appetizers and shared amongst our group. This worked out wonderfully. The dishes were tasted excellent and timed perfectly. We didn't even notice the lag time between our entrees we were having such a good time. Our server on the other hand did notice this however and was kind enough to give us a free dessert. That didn't stop us from ordering two more desserts which were fantastic. I count myself among the 1,000 + that love The Publican and plan to return.
