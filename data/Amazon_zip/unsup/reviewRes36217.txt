I have mixed feelings for Meli. I would return based on the fantastic carrot cake french toast special (would satisfy any sweet tooth!), the service, and my tall glass of orange carrot juice with a layer of honey on the bottom. Mmm mmm mmm. I would not return based on the crabcake benedict dish I ordered. The crabcake was really mushy and didn't taste fresh, and the side of potatoes were slightly undercooked and underseasoned. Cute place. Glad I came by for brunch.
