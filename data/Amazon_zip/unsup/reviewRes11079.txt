Great pizza and Great beer. The pizza has high quality ingredients and you can pretty much customize it to whatever you want it to be. Only problem is that the ingredient cost can add up quickly if you buy from the premium toppings list. The beers are great and fresh, nice variety. Piece is a tad pricey and the wait can be long at times. But its good if you have an open ended night and want to sit and chat. I enjoyed the music selection but it isn't too loud to have to talk loudly over.
