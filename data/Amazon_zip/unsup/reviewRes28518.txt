Went here with a group of 4 on a weeknight. Had a reservation but definitely didn't need one. There's plenty of street metered parking right by the restaurant. Started off at the bar and had an amazing sazerac. Really friendly and knowledgable guys working the bar too. Then we sat down to dinner. Beware: the popcorn they have at the tables is highly addictive. It's so good they must sprinkle some kind of magic dust on there. For an appetizer I had the cheddar risotto which was really good. It came with some kind of sausage too (venison I believe). The other people in my party had the Cesar and loved it. We each ordered something different for dinner and everyone was happy with their entree. I went with Wagyu Beef. It was amazing, but definitely a small main course. Others tried the fish and said it was excellent. I also had dessert - the s'mores. SO good. You have to get em. Comes with peanut butter ice cream, chocolate, etc. All the food and wine was great. Sorry I forgot what bottles we ordered (1 red, 1 white). But this place is really expensive, even by neighborhood standards. And although the food is delicious - you don't get a lot to eat, especially given what you're paying for it. Still if you want to treat yourself or you have serious stacks, go to Graham Elliot.
