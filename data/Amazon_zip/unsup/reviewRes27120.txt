Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 9 friends. Got seated right away upstairs. It took for-e-ver for the pizza to arrive and when it did I was definitely not impressed. We were not informed of the length of the wait and tables that ordered after us got their food first. To top it all off, we ordered a cheese pizza that arrived stone cold. The worst part was watching the waitress behind the bar take a huge paddle brush out of her purse and run it through her hair several times and pull her hair into a ponytail many times. And, she kept smoothing her hair back with both hands. Then, she served drinks and food without washing her hands. Eww. Never again.
