The dogs here are excellent. We came on a Saturday night because they have their duck fat fries and waited for almost 90 minutes. The fries were definitely not worth it so avoid coming on a Saturday just for that special. Wait for weekday where they let you call in your order if it is over $25 which is not hard because they are quite pricey. It was a great experience overall but definitely not the 90 minutes wait especially in extreme cold or extreme hot !!! Will return but won't wait again !!!
