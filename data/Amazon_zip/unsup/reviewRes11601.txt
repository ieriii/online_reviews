I love love love this place! the food is great and the peeps who work their are awesome!!! Sadly my son's aren't huge fans, hmmm....... I guess it's a bit to gourmet for them, tho I can't complain their the best dinning buddies ever and seriously I can't expect them to like everything I do!! Anyways, their breakfast is so YUMMY!!! I always make my own omelet with mushrooms, spinach, cheddar and Canadian bacon or I get the chocolate french toast which is amazing. Also for lunch they have a great selection of salads that are huge!!Tho their waiting line on the weekends is a bit too much, but if you give them your cell number u can take a stroll through the neighborhood and they'll call you when your table is ready.....seriously how cool is that?!!
