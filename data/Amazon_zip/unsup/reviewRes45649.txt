I've been there 3 times (2 for dinner, 1 for drinks). It is overpriced for what you get. Irish food shouldn't cost that much. It has an extensive beer list which is great. Pretty nice decor as well. I had a problem last time with our food taking 1.5 hours to come. Manager tried to excuse the problem with buying us dessert. I guess that helps, but, as I used to be in the industry, our waiter should have stayed on top of things.
