I may never do you justice with mere words. Photographs convey some of the deliciousness. Talking about you in person with gestures galore helps. But what I really yearn for is the ability to fly every single person I love out to Chicago for three days so we can eat three dinners or lunches at Xoco. There's so much to order that it pained me to pick just one torta and soup and churros. The Goat Barbacoa was by far the best sandwich of any kind I've eaten. Better than Banh Mi (and I'm vietnamese!), better than Bay Cities' Godmother, just better. By far. The bread is crusty but doesn't hurt, the meat was so tender and smoky, and the sauce was addictive. The carnitas soup was the best soup I've had. Better than pho? Well, it's different, but I'd say yes. It was innovative. Little dumplings and arugula and a bright, lime-y broth were unique components but they worked perfectly together. And the churros. It can't get any better than Xoco's churros. Crispy, doughy, piping hot. I can't get enough of this place!
