being a big deep dish pizza and nyc pizza fan, i was a bit skeptical of piece but was pleasantly surprised! the ingredients were fresh and pizza styles were unique. we had a plain (no cheese) with sausage and mushrooms, white (no sauce) with fresh basil and chicken, and red with pepperoni and green peppers. although skeptical of cheese-less pizza, it was actually my favorite! the red pizza was good but a bit on the greasy side. although the white pizza was my idea, it was a bit too dry for my liking. i gave up on the fork and knife and used my hands. it's a loud but crowded space. tables are small with the pizza pans overflowing the table tops, but it's a fun place to go with a group of friends for an informal dinner. although i didn't have any beer, they seemed to have a unique selection. piece is worth a try~!
