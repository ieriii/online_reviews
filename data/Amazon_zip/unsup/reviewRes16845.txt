I want to live here because it's so beautiful & tranquil inside. It's like stepping into another world and best of all this world doesn't allow cell phones! It is a world where you can actually hold a conversation without yelling and candles line the room giving an inviting feel. It was like being in the living room of someone's mansion. And the drinks and service - very happy with both. Why or why can't more lounges take lessons from this place? Forget the jukeboxes and noisy bars......this place is hands down my favorite. Yes it's sophisticated - people aren't going to be slamming shots and spilling drinks, but I didn't find it pretentious at all. Whoever owns this place and came up with the concept obviously went out of their way to make a very special place. I felt incredibly comfortable here and didn't want to leave. This place deserves all the praise it's getting.
