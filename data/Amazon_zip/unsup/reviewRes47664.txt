Wow and wow. This place is very cool. I went here on a Tuesday night and there was a slight wait to get upstairs to the roofdeck. But honestly, well worth a wait if you can snag a seat. I am big on being outdoors for drinking & dining and this place did not disappoint. They had a great wine selection, very chic crowd and good appetizers. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable - giving recommendations for all things. I can't speak to the full dining room experience, but I can tell you if you are looking for a great place to relax outdoors in a more upscale environment, this place is for you.
