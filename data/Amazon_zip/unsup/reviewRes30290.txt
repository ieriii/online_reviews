Besides their delicious bbq cheeseburger, the best thing about Chicago Diner is their patio, which makes you feel like you're eating in a friend's backyard. Unfortunately, today the patio wasn't open (opens Memorial Day weekend), so I had to sit inside.  I've been going here for a long time and never had a major complaint about any food or service-- except that their faux mac n cheese should be passed on. I got the bbq cheeseburger today and it was awesome. For a side I chose the bbq wings, which I really liked but my dining companion Stephanie did not. Stephanie got the black bean burger with a side salad. The veggies for the burger and the veggies for the salad were interchangeable. We really couldn't sort out how to divide up her sprouts, tomato, and carrots on top of lettuce-- and this cost a dollar extra as a side?! The burger was actually a bit dry but the issue wasn't the burger so much as the lack of the giardanera we had orderd. And also the ketchup and hot sauce that we asked for never arrived.... Which brings me to: our waiter. What an un-delightful person. Since when does Chicago Diner hire someone with no personality that can't even drop by to refill our water (and where was the ice? It was 90 degrees today! I'm parched!) or give us the ketchup??  One exciting thing, though. The little side sauces we had (because we couldn't make up our minds a lot today) were great. Creole mustard, a yes! Lemon Tahini, another whoop! And tasty tasty lime cilantro.
