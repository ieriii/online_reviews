My husband and I took my sister here for her birthday and we had the worst service ever. The food when we finally got was ok but the service was so poor that it ruined the celebration. When we shared with the waiter that it was her birthday at the start of meal the waiter said that it was his also. We order one dessert and thought they might bring one for her. The bus boy brought the desert and the waiter had him bring it back so he could add a candle. No coffee was offered. After a long wait two of us received our appetizer and my husband didn't get his soup. Long after we finished our appetizer we asked for the soup and the waiter explained it comes out separately. I finally came out with the salad, about an hour after we ordered. There was also no bread available all of that time either because they were baking it. Very disappointing to say the least.
