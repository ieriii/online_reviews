The food gets 3 stars, but the overall atmosphere gets an extra star. I've been here a couple of times, and each time the visit has been the same - just OK food (I choose to believe that the dishes I'm ordering are the culprit, not the preparation). Mostly comfort food of seemingly Irish roots, all of the dishes are guaranteed to make you sleepy. Couple that with a seat by the fireplace (there are 2!), and you are in nap-time heaven. The atmosphere is really nice, warm, and inviting - I find myself hesitant to leave.  I would definitely recommend a trip to Wilde for dinner and drinks - you will enjoy yourselves!
