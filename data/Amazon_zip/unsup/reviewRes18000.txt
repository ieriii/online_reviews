I went here with an out of town friend for dinner. Great service and friendly waitress. I ordered the spinach gnocchi (and learned the proper way to pronounce it!) which was rich but not too rich. Very flavorful and enough for lunch the next day. My friend ordered the lobster ravioli special which she said was excellent. Not too lobstery and just the right amount of richness. She also had enough for another meal the next day. My only complaint is that the soda came in a can and was $3. I wasn't aware this was a Chinese restaurant. Haha. I am definitely going back. Everything looked great! No soda next time though!
