My vegan friend with a ton of allergies wanted to go out for dinner for her birthday. Not knowing a ton of places she would want to go/could go, we told her to choose. She picked the Chicago Diner, and to say I was skeptical as I walked in the door is an understatement. No meat choices? I was sure I would be hungry when I left. That was not at all the case. I had the Buddha Burger with sweet potato fries and they were both delicious. I was a bit intimidated when the burger arrived, as the patty is made from sweet potato, but the second I bit in, all doubts washed away. It was really tasty, and surprisingly filling too. I could only finish half of the burger and fries, as I was told to save room for dessert. I split a vegan apple cider muffin with a friend, and I totally wished I had gotten my own after my first taste of it. It was mouth-wateringly yummy. I'm not sure I'd go to the place on my own, but the next time my vegan, hyper-allergic friend is in town, this is the first place I'll suggest we go.
