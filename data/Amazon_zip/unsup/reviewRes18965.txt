'Tis the season of Chicago Chef's Week as a friend and I booked an early weekday dinner. Upon entering, we were led past the after-hours drink crowd towards quieter, intimate seating in the back. SALAD Hard to mess-up, but I enjoyed the sharp smoky chunks of cheddar cheese, crunchy cashews, and bites of tart yet sweet apple TROUT It was either this or the lamb. The robustness of the southwestern-esque base with greens reminded me of Sepia's mahi mahi. It was decent. What really brought out the dish was our server's impassioned white wine recommendations. Since I was a lightweight, I was unsure about having a glass. He offered a half pour and we obliged. I was glad we did because it was perfect! BLUEBERRY CRUMBLE Arrived hot with great crunches of oat and cool scoop of ice cream. It was a little too sweet, but a good ending to the meal.  Service was super attentive, bordering obsessive. My water never dropped below 3/4th of the way. Throughout the course of our dinner it seemed as if three different fellows in suits from the restaurant approached us to chat and inquired about our meal. I'm sure they were just prepping for the heavy dinner crowd and were trying to make themselves present. Overall, a great dinner. I definitely plan on returning for the full gastropub experience.
