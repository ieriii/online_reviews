I'm not sure if the violet hour needs another superlative review, but here it is: I LOVE the Violet Hour. The decor is cool, the staff professional, and the drinks amazing. I especially loved the Barbed Wire, a whiskey drink, for making me believe in whiskey cocktails again. Definitely worth a try. Or three. (As a date place, though, might not be the best, since at least for us, our chairs were kind of far away, and it was quite loud.)
