All of the Indian restaurants I have been to, I think India House has the best service. When we sat down, a basket of chopped up naan and tomato sauce were placed in front of us. The carbaholic and hungry monster in me pretty much attacked the basket. They brought out another basket and it was even better since the naan was hot and fresh. We started with the tandoori pesh kush appetizer which came on a sizzing platter with a variey of sauces. We also had cheese pakoras, I wasn't too impressed with these. I would have much rather had a samosa but since I had never had a pakora it was good to try it. Then for dinner we had butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and a paneer with potato dish. The butter chicken was creamy and delicious. The lamb vindaloo was SPICY and the lamb was perfect, I would definitely recommend getting the vindaloo and the butter chicken. We ordered some naan and roti to accompany our meal.  For dessert I had the Gajar Ka Halwa which is basically cooked carrots in milk. It sounded so interesting I had to give it a whirl! It is not bad, but I don't think I will order it again. It was too sweet and didn't really have much flavor. My friend had the mango ice cream and I ended up eating all of her ice cream! It was different from any other mango ice cream I ever had, I only wish I knew where they got it from so I can buy some myself! At the end of the meal, the waiter brought us each a hot towel. I love when restaurants do that. Service is first class here and so is the food. I always forget that this place is around the corner from where I work. After this trip, I will try to remember to come back more frequently!
