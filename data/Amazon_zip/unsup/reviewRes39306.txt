Ok, so it's not like San Soo Gab San is some treasure that I'm sharing with everyone. My family has been loving their meaty grilled delectables for years, but I suspect we aren't the only ones. I do, however, have to take a minute to rave about their service. My mom hadn't been there since the 90's and after our last outing at Solga (my least favorite place, next to the proctologist's office), I think she was a bit weary of the whole Korean BBQ experience. Fear not, we've won her back! I feel as though Korean BBQ restaurants are known for their efficient, no-nonsense service, which was the case this time. But they were so friendly and incredibly helpful, I almost had to do a double take when one of our servers cracked a few jokes with us! The food is far more delicious than at Solga and the haemul pajeon (seafood pancake)? It almost stole the show from the galbi and squid we threw on the grill! The succulent sauce could be eaten with a spoon! And I have to say the leftovers are hands down one of the best breakfasts I've had in months. Work out your tong hand and get ready to flip some delicious meat on the charcoal grill! And you may want to also work out your chopstick fingers, because there are enough small dishes of tasty flavor-splosions to keep you busy for hours!
