If you like NY style pizza and a decent selection of micro brews, this is the place for you. I personally like a thinner crust and minimal topings so this was a good place for me. My fav was the plain with cheese. Not the best I've ever had but good and it was was a ton of pizza for the price.  Beers are also good. My fav was the Roland the headless stout but that is my style of beer. I also like the fact that you can get a sample of all of their micro brews for a few bucks each. I tried a few and most were ok. The Roland was the best. Other than the fact that it's in a congested part of town and the place is kind of trendy, def go back and try again.
