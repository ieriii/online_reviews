While visiting Chicago recently, my wife and I stopped in to have a quick lunch at the Cafe because both the store and the cafe looked promising. Unfortunately, the service was incredibly slow, ruining the whole experience. I had to go up to the counter to inquire, and in effect prod, the staff into serving us. My veggie burger was pretty good, but the staff screwed up my wife's order. We noted that at least two other diners in a not-particularly crowded or busy dining room (it was mid-afternoon, well after the lunch rush) also had to complain to get service. Based on this experience, I must recommend people avoid the F&O cafe.
