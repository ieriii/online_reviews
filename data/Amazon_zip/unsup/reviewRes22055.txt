Loved the quick and efficient free valet parking though I guess others also offer it in this neighborhood so that shouldn't seperate them. This is a huge place but getting their right before the Bulls tip off made it a little crazy. But it's a classic. Haven't been here since highschool and will not wait that long again.  The Tirokaf cheese appetizer of whipped feta with peppers was amazing on the fresh bread. Just the right amount of heat. ($6.50) The roast of loin of lamb with a rice and veggie side was also delish. Absolutely loved it. ($19) The baklava was also incredible. If I hadn't gotten so full I would have eaten the whole thing myself and it's big. ($4) The yogart is a little too tart for my liking and really more a breakfast item than desert but my girlfriends wanted it so we got it. It is served with honey. ($5) And, for those of you who know me, I had to have an old fashioned. Very nicely done. ($7) All and all, a grea meal and great experiece. Quick and effcient service, nice room.
