I've tried this restaurant twice in recent time. On both occassions I've had a bad experience. The waitresses were rude and would not let me finish telling them what I wanted to order. They just run off, to eventually come back and throw our million side dishes on the table. The bulgogi was good, but the giant tweezer that she used to throw the meat around the fire with, were not the cleanest. This is a typical restaurant that could have had ten chain restaurants around the city based on their food, but the waitresses are so ridiculously rude, that I know that will never happen. I will never set foot in there again.
