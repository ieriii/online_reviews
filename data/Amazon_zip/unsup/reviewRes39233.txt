It's getting close to my birthday and my sister refuses to go here again due to oversaturation, so i will review one of my favorite places instead. I would say i've been here close to a billion times, give or take 2. My advice is to come here with at least 5 people and you can get the group "A" package. Roughly comes out to about $20 per person before tax/tip, and around 1 order of meat per person (8 people, 8 meat orders, yada yada). You also get seafood pancakes, chop chae, sushi, and miso soup on top of the 978 side dishes. If we are short 5 peeps, i call my 10 year old cousin and have her eat with us. We all win...she likes the food, but has a small appetite, so in a more selfish sense, i win. We usually order a bunch of kalbi, spicy chicken, squid, and korean pork (bacon, pretty much). Here is my convo with the waitress whenever i order pork. ryan: and 2 orders of the pork. waitress: ok, 1 order pork. ryan: no, that's 2 orders. waitress: 2 orders too much, just 1. ryan: boss we're ordering 2, come back in 20 to see if we finished. Of course we finished it. Don't doubt my ability to plow through it! Besides the kalbi, the pork is my favorite meat. The food is just so freakin flavorful. I also on average go through 4-5 bowls of rice in one sitting. Service is spotty, but it's a korean restaurant, take it with a grain of salt. I actually find the staff pleasant. I come here after long races now (full and half marathons) and wallow in meat glory. Wear old clothes though, you will smell like korean bbq for awhile. The scent just makes me want to go back sooner. I wish it was still open 24 hours. That would be just crazy.
