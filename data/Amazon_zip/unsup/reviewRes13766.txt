Being a huge brewpub fan, I had to check this place out and came with my wife and friends. The joint was pretty full, but our wait was supposed to be 40 minutes and turned into 15, which was great. Our friendly server helped us with the menu since it was our first time, and we got down to brass tax (or tacks? I don't know). The food was fantastic from start to finish. We got the bacon fat popcorn and wings to split amongst us as a starter, and both were quite good. My wife got the burger and myself the vegetarian chili dog even though I'm a carnivore. Marinated tofu smothered in vegetarian chili and avocado on a bun, it was amazing! I rarely find a great vegetarian dish, but this one hit the spot (not too surprising given the owners have a hand in Handlebar, another great spot for vegetarians). My wife's burger was perfectly done as well. I think between the menu and specials one could never get bored with the food. While the food here is top-notch, the clear winner is the beer. We tried a bunch of the housebrews, all of which were great examples of the styles. My personal favorites were the Eugene Porter and the Anti-Hero IPA, which might be the best IPA I've ever had on draft (so much hop flavor and aroma, but totally balanced right). I'm quite psyched these guys are canning soon. In short, if you like brewpub fare and a great atmosphere, I cannot stress how good a spot this would be for you. Good service and great food and brew, check this place out.
