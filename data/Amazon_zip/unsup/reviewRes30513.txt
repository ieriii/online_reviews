One of my good friends is a vegan and takes all of our friends here when we visit. I am one of the last ones to finally make it to Chicago and get to eat at the Diner. And it was soooooo good. Veggie food scares me sometimes. I live int eh Bay area where there are mucho opportunities for me to eat "fake meat". And that just won't work for me. I'm a de facto sometimes vegetarian (I rarely eat meat....occasionally seafood...but mostly just veggies). So the diner was a good mix of veggie food - without scary fake meat. I had the sprouted grain salad which was HUGE (I was expecting a small side salad) and the soup of the day. THe soup was great and rich. Then my friend and I split the german chocolate cake. It was a little dry, but the frosting was great.  I can't wait to visit my friend again and give this place another try. And maybe, just maybe, try some fake meat.
