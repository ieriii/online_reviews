Walking up and seeing a line of hungry people that goes out the front door and around the bulding to Me means this place must be really good! Well it is more then good, it is AMAZING and well worth the wait!!!! Doug the owner works the front counter and is very nice and knows his stuff. Being our very first visit we had to try a few things, so we got the Corndog, which is deep fried making is even yummier then anywhere else. Also, the Uber Pork Garlic Sausage which was out of this world delish! Also the Turducken Sausage, which again was out of this world delish!!! And finally, you have to try the fries with CHEESE please :) We will for sure be going back here, its NOT pretentious like some of the other spots around the city!
