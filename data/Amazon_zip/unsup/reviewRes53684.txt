We went there a while ago. First impression walking in was, really? Is this all? But still, we were down for anything as long as the food was fantastic. The waiter (a guy from the kitchen) was perfectly nice. Foodies as we are, we were ready to eat! After all, we had an impossible- borderline annoying- time getting a reservation. Anyways, the food was only OK. We've had much better around the city of Chicago for comparable prices, and those dinners all came with a better ambiance. But the real problem was that both my husband and I got brutal food poisoning from our dinners. I mean, the worst we've ever had, ever. I actually called them early the next day, and I was very nice on the phone- especially given the fact that I was up all night throwing up our our $250+ meal. I told them we ate there the night before and had something that unfortunately gave us both bad food poisoning and that they might want to check on what it was (it's usually a sauce) to avoid getting others ill. The jerk could not have been more rude, he actually questioned whether we really had food-poisoning and never even apologized- he just said alright and hung up! Infuriating. I hope no one else became sick, and I hope no one does in the future, but looking at that cramped dirty little kitchen I doubt that's possible.Bottom line, won't be back, good luck to those who dare to dine!
