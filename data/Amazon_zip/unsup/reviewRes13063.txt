I'm in love...again :) My sweetie took me here for my birthday this memorial day weekend and we had a GREAT time. Having been to Fogo and Brazazz they all share many similarities. The ambience at Texas, I think is the best of the three. Very beautiful and comfortable atmosphere. The staff was very attentive and warm. Our waiter Joshua was the BOMB! He was friendly and kept our glasses full. The salad bar was good, but that wasn't what we came for. They did have a sushi bar which is different from the other two and we tried it, nothing to brag about but it was decent. The meats were deliciously seasoned! The Filet, rack of lamb and bacon wrapped chicken were AWESOME (my favorites)! The other cuts were very delicious as well. We prefer our meat medium-medium well, and the servers made sure they had just the right pieces for us. Only thing i missed was the grilled pineapple and shrimp that Brazazz serves. Other than that, it was a FAB experience and we will definitely go back.
