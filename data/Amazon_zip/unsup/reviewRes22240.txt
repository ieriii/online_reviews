We have been in the process of moving to Chicago, and on a visit to find an apartment, we had a terrible experience with delivery where it took about 2 hours longer than it should have even when busy. It seems there was a miss communication between the delivery guy and the restaurant about our address and they lost our phone number. I discussed with the manager over text that we were eating cold food and were very frustrated. He said to talk to him next time and he would make it right. We have moved permanently now, and called back, and the manager did make things right. I am now a huge fan of Irazu. The food is so fantastic when it is hot... and I really appreciate the effort to make up for the terrible first experience. I look forward to a long relationship with Irazu. I love the food and I appreciate an establishment that cares enough about customers to fix problems the way they did.
