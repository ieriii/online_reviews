Always reliable...but how do I get to this statement? First, let me state that I am not a big fan of Spanish Tapas because in general tend to not be vegetarian friendly (very meat reliant dishes) nor tasty (spices are not incorporated into dishes well). Also, I am bias in favor for this place because a good friend (Patty, bartender) works there and hooked me to this spot. But I have taken my mother there for her birthday, first dates, business associates, and even had a small gathering of friends for an early birthday dining outing. But the service is also knowledgeable, attentive, cooperative (if you are a vegetarian just tell them an idea for an alternative to a menu selection), and prompt. But it is what they serve that always is dependable...well seasoned food, that is full of flavor. Who knew spanish tapas could be so full of life and color?! The Spanish omelette is a must as are the jalapeno peppers! The cheese selections are always incredible with their separate dipping sauce. The chocolate croquettes with marshmallows is unbelievable.  My guest typically are drawn to the large prawns, octopus, or the chef selection of meats. The sangria is something special as well. Although the restaurant is large it tends to not get too loud in there unless you go downstairs to the lounge on a Friday night. Highly recommended! One
