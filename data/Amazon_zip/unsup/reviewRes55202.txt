We arrived early, about 6:30, and good thing we did! The place quickly filled up with hungry carnivores. We had been forewarned to skip the salad bar in order to take full advantage of the meat offerings, but the salad bar was so large and so beautiful that we had to nibble on SOMETHING! So I chose a few beets (a personal fave), some giant asparagus spears and a couple wedges of cheese to tide me over until the Meat Parade. (I even spied a huge bowl of crispy bacon on the salad bar -- wow! -- there's something you don't see every day!) We noticed that the four-top of guys next to us had heaping plates of salad -- we shook our heads in sadness at their folly! We nibbled our salad, drank some wine, and a server soon brought out side dishes of tasty polenta, fried plantains and garlic mashed potatoes. So far, so great!Then came the meat - Filet, Ribeye, Parmesan Pork, Lamb Chops, Ribs, Top Sirloin -- it was a sizzying, whirling dervish of flesh. All the servers knew exactly where the rare bits were, and cut precise chunks of juicy, meaty goodness just for me. It was almost too much -- I wish I had trained for months ahead of time so that I could have had seconds of everything. The ribeye was truly spectacular, and I'm drooling now just thinking of it!  Even better than the meat was the team service -- warm, personable and prompt. When I returned to the table after a quick trip to the loo, a server rushed over to push my chair in. Paul, a management type, stopped by to chat with us and make sure everything was wonderful. And it was. Wanna impress your favorite sharp-toothed meat-eater? Take them to Fogo de Chao!
