This place it a lot like Tru (but not quite as good). Still a very upscale restaurant and very much worth trying. They have very unique ways of serving your dishes here. We went two times and both times we were very impressed. The chef here and at Tru both started out in Evanston at Trio (which is now closed). My first date with my fiance was at Trio 9 years ago and it was an experience that I never had until that day. Definitely would recommend trying Alinea for a unique experience.
