Small family owned business (although the waitresses are not family? ...I think). The guy who owns this restaurant is SOOO NICE and FRIENDLY! I was probably one of their first customers when it opened and I didnt go back for almost a month and he still remembered me! Such a nice guy and very welcoming. He always seems grateful that people enjoy his restaurant and come back. The food is delicious and the lunch special deals are awesome. You get soup, salad, your lunch dish, and a drink! The atmosphere is casual and relaxing and great for groups.
