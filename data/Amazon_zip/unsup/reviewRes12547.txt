Amazing pork chops... Do yourself a favor and try them. Seriously. I always ask for the jalapeno mashed instead of the sweet - it goes much better with the meat and frankly, I'm surprised they haven't changed it permanently. Their ceviche, when available, is also incredible. If you see this restaurant crowded and you do not have a reservation, turn around and find somewhere else. We had a run-in with the hostess once who gave us the run around about the estimated times we were going to be seated. Group after group, walk-ins coming in after us were seated and upon asking why, we were just told, "a few more minutes..." We ended up leaving that night without eating but learned the lesson.
