I loved this place. I was in Chicago this past Monday night for a work conference and my friend Ava, who is from there, made this one recommendation. I don't remember which red wine I got but I liked it and the bread and olive oil were pretty good. The grilled octopus appetizer was dynamite; savory, tender and substantial. I got some pretty good horta greens but the lamb special for the night was sold out. I asked for another lamb recommendation and the waiter guided me to something quite phenomenal: a lamb shank braised in a light stock or white wine (rather than red) so that it looked almost like veal, topped with a creamy lemon sauce and served with artichoke bottoms. It was awesome. The place looks like a factory restaurant but the food is terrific and the staff are happy and chummy like your favorite aunts and uncles. This was the best meal I'd had in the three weeks since I'd been to Alexandria, Egypt.
