I have been here a few times lately and have had some good meals. The food can be very good. My one huge question remains: Why is Glenn so unfriendly to his customers? I have no clue how someone can expect to have a successful business while being so unfriendly to his customers! Glenn, we are the reason your restaurant exists!!! No matter what the food is like, this always impacts my feelings about the place.
