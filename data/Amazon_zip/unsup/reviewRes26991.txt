My wife and I had the 5 course tasting menu and were very disappointed with the food and service. We had heard a lot about the restaurant and just don't understand what the hype was about. The dishes were an amalgamation of ingredients, gels and over done concoctions that didn't taste particularly good by themselves and didn't get better in combination. The service was overbearing, every time I had a sip of water my glass was immediately refilled. There's a point where that is attentive but it just became intrusive (I didn't want to drink water anymore). About halfway through the meal, we just wanted it to end so we could get out of there.
