Wow. Amazing food. I think I was deprived of amazing food all of my life. That's why when I go to these vegan places, I'm just amazed. The only issues I had was the long line. At least they had a heated patio where we could wait. We went with a group around 14......OMG, the line was two hours long. But it was well worth it. I had the enchildas. I know it's odd eating mexican food at a vegan restaurant. However, that looked appealing. I wanted to eat dessert, but I was stuffed. I couldn't move out of my seat for 20-30 minutes. I had trouble walking back to the red line addison stop. lol. That's how full I was. Would I go here again? HELL YEA.
