pizza is great but if the owner isn't there you may be in trouble. the last time i picked up, i arrived when they told me... and they hadn't even started the pizza. the worker didn't apologize, he actually gave me an evil glare when I said something. Another time they lost the order and when they started making it they had to look at the menu to figure out what to put on it. The food makes up for it and the owner is a nice guy.
