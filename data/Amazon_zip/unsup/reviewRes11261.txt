This is absolutely the best way to start your day if you happen to be off of work at 9am on a weekday. They're juice and coffee are great and they do pancakes RIGHT! I seriously called in sick one day just to eat breakfast here with a friend who was in town (of course it was another job, years ago, I'm lying, no I'm not, yes I am, why would you lie?, i'm a gorilla and this is my banana, no you're not, yes I am, shut up brain, not you shut up, no YOU shut up... OUCH that hurt, good job now I can't remember my flapjack story...)
