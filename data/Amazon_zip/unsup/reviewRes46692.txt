Well, after being abused at Kuma's, with poor service and cold hamburgers, i boycotted any burger place in the city..However, a friend likes RJ Grunts, and we decided to go for lunch. I had the cheeseburger, which was delicious and my friend had the hickory bacon cheddar cheese burger with bbq sauce. She enjoyed hers as much as I did mine. We went early, got seated right away and the babies did not bother us...I love the stroller parking in front of the restaurant. I remember when Grunts first opened, the salad bar concept was new to the restaurant industry, now the salad bar seems small, but still has alot of goodies on it and the food is just as good.as it was back then.The wait staff was friendly and helpful...just opposite of Kumas and the food was warm..and delicious.
