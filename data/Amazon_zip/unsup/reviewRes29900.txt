I'm not sure how you could give this place less than 5 stars. As a veggie, I knew about this place all the way in LA, but I hadn't gotten the chance to try it until this trip. I ate an abbreviated menu at Pitchfork festival and as a sidebar, let's just talk about how freaking awesome it is that they have vegan food at a music festival and it was SO DAMN GOOD. Back to the restaurant review, I had both the burger and the gyro at the festival and I practically creamed my pants when the awesome cooks in the tent showed me the full menu. Their food tastes so good! It's piping hot, it's homemade, it's flavored to perfection, and it almost feels sinful to eat (I have to remind myself that it's vegan). I tried their mac n' cheeze on the side and it was phenomenal. I was in a rush, trying to squeeze in dinner before my flight, and the server was so accomodating and attentive. He didn't mind at all, and he was great in understanding out plight. Food came out fast, the diner itself was quaint but bright and sunny and I cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot cannot waitttttt to come back and eat here again.
