3.5 for now. The first couple of bites are tasty, but after a while, everything starts to taste the same. Here are some dishes (can't remember the exact names) we recently ordered: 1) fish and vegetables in spicy broth -- simply hot, not well seasoned 2) deep fried beef in chilli oil sauce -- super spicy, oily and salty 3) stir fried string beans -- the best among the three The food is generally very spicy (not to mention greasy), but the depth and layers of flavor aren't as impressive. Plus, you may get digestive problems the next morning... NOT FUN. Price wise, it's average...or arguably a bit on the higher end for a Chinese joint in Chinatown.
