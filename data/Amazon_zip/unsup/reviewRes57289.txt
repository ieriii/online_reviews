It was a thursday night and i was on my way home and a friend from work said lets try this nice little place on lincoln called the bad apple so knowing me i said yes and took him up on his offer and went .They had a nice selection of beer to choice from.But as far as food i think it could have been a little better.So if you choose to go there be more pepared to drink more than eat.
