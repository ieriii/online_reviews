I loved it!! We went here for our anniversary. I was looking forward to going because I had heard such good things about it. It delivered to the max. The food was awesome and the wine was divine. The sushi selections were unique and we loved the Lemon Grass Beef Lollipops. I love Chilean Sea Bass and this was some of the best I have tasted. The only negative and I have seen it on several reviews is that it is quite loud in the restaurant. Definitely not a setting for romance. If you don't mind this, it is a great place to go. Enjoy!!
