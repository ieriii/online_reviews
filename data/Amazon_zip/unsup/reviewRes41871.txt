I think I drank way too much wine the first time I went because my repeat visit was pretty bad, service was good, steak was good everything else was BAD. The asparagus was boiled, not steamed and was gross, the chocolate cake I had tasted like it came from Applebees, it's truly a chain restaurant experience, and a very expensive one at that. If you are in Chicago PLEASE go eat somewhere else.
