For great tapas, this place really can't be beat! Everything about our experience was wonderful - the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The food was divine! The only thing that could have been improved was that our tasting of cheese was probably around one ounce. That's a bit steep if you ask me - several dollars for three little thin points of some cheese! But the accompaniments were delicious. The creme Catalan was too good to be true.
