Eh- I've been disappointed by this place twice and don't think I'll be giving it another shot. I grew up near an amazing fondue restaurant (not a chain), and maybe got a little spoiled, but whether that's the case or not, Geja's did not live up to my expectations. Sure, the ambiance makes a cute date night, but I don't think the food and service come even close to justifying the price. First of all, there is only one cheese option- if they're telling me what cheese I've got to eat, it better be really good, but to my husband and I, it was pretty bland. Then I got the chicken and steak, and my husband got the shrimp and steak. The waiter told us the time it would take to cook everything, and all those times were WAY off. We put our beef in for the amount of time he said, and it was still moo-ing at the end. The whole experience is kind of annoying when you have to keep cutting into your meat, only to find it still raw and having to put it back into the pot. Finally, chocolate- what's supposed to be the best part of the meal. Here's the recipe for the "delicious" chocolate fondue, so that you can make it at home: Buy hershey's chocolate syrup, put it in a pot on the stove, turn the stove on. There you've got it. Now just get some stale pound cake and you've re-created Gejas' dessert. Even with the discounts that I get emailed to me all the time, it's just not worth it- I've left unsatisfied both times and am still waiting to figure out what all the hype is about.
