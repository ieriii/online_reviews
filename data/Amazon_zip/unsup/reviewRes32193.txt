With a Rockit Ranch venue, you expect a cool scene. At Sunda you definitely get the scene, but the substance is on par with the style. The space is extremely unique and it runs the gamut from communal dining to a gorgeous private dining room in back. Service is top-notch and it seems you're never waiting for anything while not feeling rushed. Then there's the food. I've been here several times and I'm always finding new surprises on the menu. The Ramen Lover is amazing and the portion is so large you could probably jump into the bowl. EVERYTHING on the sushi menu is delicious. The Chicken Curry has just the right about of seasoning and could easily feed two people. If you haven't been to Sunda, GO. If you have been to Sunda, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
