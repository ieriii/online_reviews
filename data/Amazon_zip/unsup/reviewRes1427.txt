Encased Meats......yummmmm. How have I not reviewed this place yet?! I know I have said this a couple of times before but this place deserves my review!  You know those places you used to see on sitcoms? The ones where it is packed and and everyone gets excited about going to it? The ones that are such an iconic institution of the city that it would be a shame not to experience the food? Well, Hot Doug's is definitely that place! If you like meat, and I know you do, then go here for some tasty exotic dishes. Alligator was my last choice of sausage. If you aren't that adventurous, then try one of the many different styles of regular dogs.  Whatever your desire, get there and enjoy!
