After 600+ reviews, what else is there to say about Crisp that hasn't already been said? How about: Dunk everything in the Atomic sauce!!!* I would like a bottle of that to drink, please. Basically, the sauces make this place. If you're a first-timer, you must try both the BBQ and the Seoul Sassy, preferably on their chicken strips. (Bonus! I ordered 3, but got 4 because I ordered both sauces!) Or you could just ask for them in a cup and drink it straight. Either one works. Oh, and get the fries. Or get the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl. It's so big that you'll end up eating your leftovers for (an extremely delicious) lunch the next day. *Disclaimer: This may have already been said, but I don't want to read over 600 reviews to find out, so I'm going to pretend it's a completely original thought.
