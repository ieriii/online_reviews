I've been vegetarian since '88 and vegan since '99 so Chicago Diner is one of my staple eateries in Chicago. Always super nice staff and amazing desserts. Their vegan mac'n'cheese is so good I get cravings for it. Even my omnivorous friends love the food here (and I dare say it's been instrumental in changing the diets for a few of them towards animal-free!) The brunch menu is probably my favourite though it does get crazy-crowded during those hours. My only wish is that there was space for about 10 more tables and I hope the prices don't increase (again.) Highly recommended!
