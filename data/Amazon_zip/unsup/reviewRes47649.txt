Hello, I have gone here a few times now for both brunch and dinner. This restaurant has not even tempted the thought of boring or "done." with a great selection of food, good wine, and of course you add the company, Zed is a sure fire hit... The staff has been and is extremely helpful, and when I sat in front of the Chef's action for brunch one day, their arguing/debating (they were always smiling) was incredibly entertaining to watch (it was like watching a French comedy)... This place has it going on. I believe their frittata was one of the best I've tasted; easily one of my favorites.
