I came here with a group of friend after seeing a show. When we got there the place was packed and we put our name in for a table and told about 30 minute wait; which wasn't bad for such a large group. We hit the bar and got a couple a pitchers to lubricate ourselves. We got their Golden Arm, it was nice balance and on the lighter side and a worrying ale nice Carmel creamy flavor very nice beer. By the time we finished our pitchers our table was ready.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful, I asked her recommendations and we got 2 larges one white and one red. The red had 1/2 sausage 1/2 cheese and the white as 1/2 tomato and 1/2 spinach and chicken. The pizzas were solid the red didn't blow me away the sausage was good but I would have liked a little more spice and fennel in it. The Tomato was alright but the chicken and spinach was by far my favorite, very tasty. We got a couple more pitchers adding the dysfunctionale which was another solid pitcher.  Overall I liked the place a lot big area with huge tables great for groups, nice bar with good tvs if you want to catch a game and solid beer eating pizza. I would gladly return here for some good brews and za anytime.
