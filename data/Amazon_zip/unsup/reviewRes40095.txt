Recently transplanted to Chicago, I'm STILL looking for a really good Korean restaurant. This one is ok - they have lots of ban chan (side dishes), which is a plus. The only drawback is that most of them are flavorless and seem to be after thoughts! The kimchi needs MUCH improvement. Their entrees are also hit or miss. Their jungols are really good, especially the boo dae jjigae. However, their spicy pork was TERRIBLE - really fatty and miserable. Service is bad, but that's to be expected at a Korean restaurant. As a Korean, I'm used to this, but I can understand how others would be turned off. One time, I actually had to get up and go get the water pitcher off the counter because the servers refused to refill our glasses for so long.
