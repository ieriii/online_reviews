Egg bread! Egg bread! Done. I don't know why I always insist on being painfully full every time I come here. Falafel sandwich, extra spicy, add rice and lentils. Then one piece of egg bread. The sandwich is dense enough that it could very well be used to knock a man off of a moving bicycle. Yet I still try and force more food in my belly after finishing it. Considering that they're BYOB, you can then get drunk and painfully full here for less than $5. That's kind of amazing. Yet all my idiot friends back in Ohio have the audacity to call Chicago an "expensive" city. Last time I was in Akron, I paid $8 for a highly disappointing falafel sandwich. Bunch a wiener butts.
