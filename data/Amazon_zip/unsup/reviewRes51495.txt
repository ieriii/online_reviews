Good Mexican Place. It looks better now that it's been renovated. I like it much better...it's much open and cleaner than it was a few years ago. The food is good. They give you big portions. Fast service. The only thing for me is that the tables are so close together...I don't think I'll be there around dinner time on the weekends. Too crowded for my liking.
