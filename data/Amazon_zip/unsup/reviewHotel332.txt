Guys, this is totally a four star hotel for being a Travelodge. I'm a total fan. I stayed here three nights while scouting out Chicago for the first time for a potential future conference. The rates are reasonable (you don't need to pay for parking at $35/night; just take the ridiculously easy and affordable public transit everywhere), the staff is friendly (enough) and the neighborhood is super convenient to anywhere and everywhere you want to go. I didn't see, or miss, a continental breakfast, a gym, a sauna, a doorman or fancy flat screen tv's. Three of us shared a double room and did get: 2 beds, 1 refrigerator, 1 microwave, 2 closets, 1 tv, 1 clean bathroom, a great view of the city and plenty of space. Like I mentioned, it's close to public transit--the red line is wicked close, and the blue, purple, brown, pink and green lines are all within 4 blocks. If you want to bus anywhere, there's tons of buses that come ALL THE TIME, and if you want to walk, well, bundle up if it's January. Doable, though. More often than not, a hotel room is just a place where you crash when visiting a city. For that purpose, the Travelodge gets a super firm thumbs up from me.
