This place is definitely worth the trek down south. Really cute, with lots of seating, and most importantly, a great menu and great food! We went for brunch and had the lemon-berry pound cake, the chiliquilas, and the biscuits and duck gravy. Everything was really good. My favorite was the bf's biscuits and gravy. My chiliquilas were really good, but a totally unique take on the dish, so I was a little thrown. The pound cake was also delicious, with tart berries baked into it and a creamy cheese scattered on the plate. Yum, I'll be back for sure. The fried chicken is rumored to be awesome, so I may be heading there for dinner in the near future.
