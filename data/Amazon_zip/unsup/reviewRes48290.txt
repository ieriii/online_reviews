My wife and I were torn about whether to have our first experience here be with dinner or brunch, and brunch won out. Upon entering we were quickly seated at a two person table, although the entire center of the restaurant is bedecked with long tables made for multiple parties. We thought it would be fun next time to be seated next to others, as you are close enough to converse but still have personal space and can have a private conversation. Also, the wooden beams and framed canvases of painted pigs make for a really great look. Our server was very friendly and casual, but knowledgeable about the whole menu, beer and food both. We wound up ordering cashew sticky buns to start, and I helped myself to an Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout. Fantastic with the sticky buns, which were perfectly cooked with a soft chewiness and caramel-like coating. For our main course I got the fried oyster omelette with tabasco croutons and my wife got the Fried French Toast with Maple Sausage. We split a side of bacon, which was a thick cut hunk of the cured pork belly braised in maple syrup. Best. Bacon. EVER. The omelette was fantastic as well, nice fresh oysters with a light crisp breading, and paired really well with the Hefeweizen I ordered (I knew the style is great with brunch, and it didn't let me down). My wife's French Toast had a delicious caramelized crust surrounding the custardy inside, and the maple sausage had the perfect balance of maple flavor and wasn't too greasy. Publican's strength is in the fact that all of their dishes are made in house from start to finish, even their bacon and sausage. This shows in every bite you take, which unmercifully has to come to an end at some point. Without a doubt we will be coming back soon to try out dinner.
