Just a very nice gesture. My wife and mentioned we were in Chicago for our 39th wedding anniversary, and when we got back to the room after going out for dinner, there was a bottle of champagne chilling in an ice bucket, plus two very nice champagne glasses and a congratulations note! Now that's class!
