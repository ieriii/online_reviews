I haven't reviewed Tank?? Wow. Well, the service is USUALLY bad! But the food and atmosphere is great. I say the service is bad simply because they are always SO busy that the workers are running all over the place. You usually have to flag them down to get something , if you can get their attention, and then it takes a while. But if you go in here, not expecting to be really catered too, then you won't have a problem. The atmosphere is really different and has a lot of energy. The food is really really good. I love the chicken hot and sour soup. It's a big bowl, make sure you order the small , even if you plan on splitting it. The sweeties and smoothies are top notch too :) You really need to go here if you like Vietnamese food. It's not something you want to miss out on!
