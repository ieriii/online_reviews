Seems like there is a trend in these reviews. For the most part, the food is good to great, and occasionally the service is horrendous, however... I had a reservation for my fianc's birthday a few weeks ago. We showed up 15 minutes late, and were taken upstairs to the best table in the house overlooking the entire restaurant. Very nice private dining area by candlelight. That really set a great tone for the night, so thank you Mercat, we will come back again. I would give you a 4.5 overall. The food was all great, no complaints except for dessert -- but most places are terrible at dessert unless they have a real pastry kitchen and staff. I'd say this is a great place to go if you're from out of town, and want to have a nice meal without breaking the wallet. Well, two people, six tapas, dessert, and two drinks comes out to about $100. And had we been on the main floor with everyone else, I wonder if I would have enjoyed it as much? -Dunno but the ambiance is nice. The service isn't stellar but nothing particularly bad either - just skip dessert and order another drink is my only recommendation.
