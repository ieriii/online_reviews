Simply It was truly a great dining experience. They're a BYOB, so the eating there is always fun. The staff is amazingly friendly and the owner is very passionate about the restaurant and it shows. The food is always fresh and delicious and I've never been disappointed with my meal. The takeout is an equally pleasant experience. I got there a couple of minutes early to get my food and they gave me a glass of water and a free watermelon smoothie (which was amazing) to help me pass the time. I am a loyal customer and will continue to be.
