My wife and I happened to be at Zed451 the night of 8/5, the same time as 4 other reviewers who were part of a party of 30+, so I wanted to chime in. We had made reservations a week before our trip, and when we got there, they didn't have our table ready. After about a 10 minute wait, they noticed my impatience, and bought us a round of drinks at the bar for our trouble. Within about 5 more minutes we were sat, at which point they explained that they had been slammed by several large parties, including the aforementioned 30 top (as it turns out were right behind us once we got our table) and another that was 100 plus, and the parties were dragging on longer than expected.At any rate, the manager was very apologetic, and once we sat, we were given great and almost non-stop attention, and despite it being in the last hour of business, and with the prior overwhelming demand of the evening, they had all the meat dishes still available (it's a buffet of sorts as one can tell by prior reviews). Both the harvest bar (calling it a salad doesn't really do it justice) and the rounds of meat were incredible, the only weaknesses being the slightly overcooked chicken and somewhat bland salmon. The tuna was great, as was the prime rib, rump roast and all the other red meats.I can't judge the poor experience of the 30 person party, as we arrived towards the end of their dinner, but I would highly recommend this restaurant for both the food and service.
