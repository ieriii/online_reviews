You know how you're riding the el home with your friend . . . . or driving along, sharing a ride home, . . . and you're both like "this sucks, . . . work sucks, . . . . i'm poor, . . . i'm always single and why are all the dumb girls having babies . . . . i'm gay and i don't like gay men . . . tori amos, . . . i wish i wasn't from indiana as i think that might be the root cause of my difficulties in life . . .?" Well, Garcia's Margaritas will cure you and your carpool friend of this shared unpleasantness. I don't know why, but they are happy-ritas. I have one and everything is much better. I definitely recommend you try it!
