The perfect midrange steakhouse. So you have Outback on one end.. and Gibsons (or Mortons you get my drift) on the other end.. sometimes you just want a good steak in an atmosphere that isn't incredibly pretentious at a price that won't break your wallet. I think for the price, this place is actually a really good value. My faves.. the chopped salad.. wow, swoon. This is the most amazing, interesting chopped salad I've ever had. My one beef is the portion size on this.. it's $11.95 and honestly huge. Two people cannot eat this salad and a meal.. so a mini portion would be nice. Moving on to the filet trio with the crusts.. these are so unique and yummy! I love the flavors and variety of tastes. It also comes with a side for $29.95 which is nice. I love love love the progressive wine flight here.. $11.50 and it comes with 2 whites and 2 reds. For someone that loves a cold white to start the evening and wants a nice red with their steak this flight is perfect! Lastly the pumpkin pie during the fall/winter.. OMG amazing stuff! It's highly whipped and light and quite delicious.
