Coast is great if atmosphere is more important to you than food. I order from here because it's the closest sushi restaurant to me. Though I'm usually satisfied with the food, the portions (especially if you do takeout or delivery) are really small. Over the years, the namasake don has gone from like 10 pieces of salmon to five. At $24 a pop, that's almost $5 for each piece of fish. It's like they told the sushi chefs to cut back on the amount of fish they use, but it's a really noticeable difference. You can get a better bang for your buck elsewhere.
