I recently refreshed my memory of breakfast at Glenn's and I am now refreshing my review. Cutting to the chase: The blueberry pancakes were really three items in one: pancakes, blueberries, and blueberry cream cheese frosting. The pancakes themselves were among the best around (cue the fight scene from "The Karate Kid"). Seriously, they were dense and perfectly browned. The berries were real, fresh, plump and left me wanting a few more, truth be told. The blueberry cream cheese, you ask? I could take it or leave it. Interesting concept, but I dabbed my fork o' pancake in the butter more often than the frosting.  I ordered an iced tea, and neither the menu nor our server mentioned it was flavored. Typically, I am a drinker of unsweetened, black tea-stuffs and like to keep it simple. But wait! This tea was flavored with a berry essence and it was good. Very, very good. Have I turned over a new tea leaf? Perhaps. Have I exposed myself as a dork by making a pun? Indeed.  One final note for those of you who need one more push before clicking "Useful": Glenn's serves a variety of alcohol, including mimosas, bloody Marys and spiked coffee at breakfast. What they do not serve before 11 AM is beer. Hmmm. I stroke my chin thoughtfully and leave you to consider this double-standard.
