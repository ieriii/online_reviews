Love, love, love this restaurant. I always get their pizza with egg, prosciutto and olives and they're always willing to let me customize it the way I want. I've tried their other dishes that other people I was with ordered and everything is delicious. The only thing that I ever find fault with is, occasionally, they use a bit too much sodium but that can be easily remedied by asking them to go lightly on the salt. Their appetizers I usually skip because their entrees and desserts are so good, I want to devour those and only those but if you have a big appetite, they're all really tasty too, especially their lentils and bruschetta. Their desserts are to die for. Their Tiramisu is almost as good as the one I had in Italy and definitely the best and most authentic I've tasted here in Chicago. But all their desserts are really awesome too. I recently had some kind of cake with pumpkin pie baked into it (I think it's a seasonal thing though) and OMG let me tell you, hands down, best birthday cake I've ever had the privilege to try. I've tried a few other desserts here and have yet to be let down. Service is always prompt and efficient without hovering. Atmosphere is loud and usually busy with the kitchen close by but it works for this kind of place. One thing I can say, is the quality of food here is outstanding. I never leave feeling sick like you can from too much rich Italian food, but always leave satisfied. You can tell they really put care into the ingredients they use and how they prepare the food.
