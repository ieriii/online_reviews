I went here after work and there was no wait but try to get a sit in the back since the kitchen is in the middle and you don't want to end up smelling like your dinner after you leave. My friend really wanted to try the pizza so we had the mushroom with leeks and it was good but I feel like I can get this anywhere. I prefer a chewy dry crust and this was on the oily and dry side. I really like the burger with the bacon jam and the bun was light. The raviolo was yummy and the rigatoni was made perfect. The desert was another story, the cannoli sundae was so lumpy, we were not sure if the lumps were fat but it taste like it. It was so hard to enjoy it that we left with a horrible after taste of bitter orange. Bummer
