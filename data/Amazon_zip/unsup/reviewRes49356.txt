Alliance stepped in at the last minute to create two birthday cakes for our son's 1st birthday and my 93 Grandmother. My son's cake was JUST what I ordered down to the color of the frosting. They customized a small car to match the drawing I had created for his invitation. It truly made the birthday party special. And above all both cakes were simply AMAZING in taste. I staggered at the cost and the casual attitudes of the staff at first, but when I say the results I truly understood the artistry that goes into their craft!
