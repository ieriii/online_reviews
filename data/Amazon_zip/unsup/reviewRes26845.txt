As a New Yorker, I am obviously biased (or just a better judge?) but for what I consider more "pie" than "pizza", the carmelized crust does taste pretty damn good. The sauce is also better than at other places. The rest if par for Chicago's overcompensation of cheese (use what you got, right?) and day-old-tasting crust. Let the NY-bashing begin! Seriously, though, PM me if you're ever on your way to Brookly, and I'll give you 4 places that DEFINE pizza!
