This place had really great hours, opening later than anything around it. While traveling, one never knows when dinner would be so that was very convenient and why we ate here twice. The first night I ordered a lamb pizza. It wasn't Chicago style, either New Yorker style, just typical dough but the lamb, eggplant and other Greek style fixings and seasonings tasted pretty good. The next night, I had a ceasar salad, which was decent but didn't really stand out. Service was good and our servers were always friendly.
