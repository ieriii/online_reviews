My initial comment was it's a little pricey, but its on Michigan Ave. Despite the price, The Gage delivered. The burger was absolutely fantastic, the Camembert on top truly made it something special! It was so great we had to ask the waitress where they get the cheese from, apparently some dairy farmer in Indiana! The potato soup is wonderful! (It better be, this place is supposed to be Irish!) And for all you vegetarians out there, the wild mushroom sandwich is sinfully good!
