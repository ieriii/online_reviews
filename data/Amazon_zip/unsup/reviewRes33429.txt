I've been going to Sultan's Market since '00 or so. It's good, but has gone downhill a lot as they expanded. Their falafel is OK here, but I think some of their other items are even better. The falafel is blander than I've had in other places. The lentils and rice=good stuff. The soups can be good.  The fact that its been in Wicker Park for so long, where restaurants change out every 4 months it seems, says a lot for this place. Prices haven't gone up much, either (though the drinks always seem overpriced...I guess they gotta get you somewhere). Where else can you eat a *good* lunch for $3.26 after tax (the price of a falafel sandwich)? This place is a little busier and busier every time I go. Sometimes to the point of annoyance. Actually lately it's really been annoying. For the longest time, I avoided anything entree-wise other than falafel. Then I started on the lamb shawarma sandwich. And boy oh boy. I have fond memories of it being -10 degrees, walking down Damen while waiting for a bus... debating if I should stop to eat and satisfy my hunger, or continue on and not risk frostbite. I chose to stop at a bus shelter temporarily, just long enough to unpackage the sandwich...  I soon had eaten half, then I continued on since I was starting to not feel my hands (this was one of the worst cold days in memory. Still no bus, I trotted down the sidewalk sandwich hanging out of my mouth... Lamb and sauce dripping down my hand, freezing to my hand. I had soon eaten the whole thing and there was still no bus. But I didn't care, I was fulfilled. Oh memories.  What a fantastic sandwich that is.  They occasionally run out of it later in the day I guess, I've been upset of them running out more than once. I know one day when I've left Chicago, the Sultan's lamb shawarma sandwich is something I'll dream about. :( :( Unfortunately going here has gotten to be such a disappointment at times that I'll no longer go out of my way to go here.
