yes it's a chain and yes i love it! the menu choices [should] appeal to everyone's tastes and moods and it's consistently good food and service. no, it's nothing unique or remarkable but sometimes, you just need something straight up and comforting. the HUGE manhattan salad can't be beat for taste, nutrients and variety - finely chopped asparagus, lentils, cukes, tomatoes, beets and romaine. they also have a great variety of starters and desserts. my only beef is when i had dinner there last, they tried to pull a fast one on me - substituting green peas for the lentils in the salad! no, i did not mention to the server since i was too engrossed in catching up with a friend so i can't say i gave them a chance to make it up. the wait and tourists will drive you crazy but once you are seated, everything else will go over smoothly.
