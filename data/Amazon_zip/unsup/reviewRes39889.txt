Was it coincidence that I saw the Check Please! highlighting Asian restaurants a mere 4 days before coming here? That while watching said episode, my Honey and I commented on what a racket it was to pay good money to have to cook your own food? I think it was Divine intervention, preparing me for the debacle of a dining experience at San Soo Kab San. So this is a very hands on dining experience. You select your meats, we ordered "mini" rib-eye, short ribs, pork belly, and regular rib-eye (under no circumstances whatsoever should you get the pork belly, EVER).  Most are sliced thin for quick grilling. I said quick, not easy, you really have to pay attention to the meat, or else you end up with shoe leather. There's a little bit of a learning curve here, and I think they should give you a couple of pieces of meat to practice on. Like making pancakes, the first one ain't perfect. The waitress brings a plethora of sides and condiments. There is no explanation of said sides and condiments however, which is really a pain in the ass. There isn't quite enough to go around, so you have to commit, and if you don't know what you're eating.... It can really be a pain in the ass.  I would only recommend going here if you have someone holding your hand.
