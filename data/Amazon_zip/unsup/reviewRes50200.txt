Went to The Fifty/50 for breakfast today. If your experience is like ours, expect blaring football on the many flat screens that surround the dining area. You won't miss a call as there seem to be speakers booming everywhere. The food, eggs, canadian bacon, etc. was competent. We actually went for the Bloody Mary's. Heard them being discussed on a talk radio show, but were sorely disappointed. They were quite chunky, and not in a good way. Sort of like drinking the seeds and juice from a tomato. They featured slices of bacon floating in the drink. Sounded appealing at first--as I'm quite the meat lover--but didn't prove to add any appreciable benefit to the flavor. And unlike finishing up the olives in an ordinary Bloody (which I love), fatty, soaked bacon doesn't really tempt the taste buds at the end of a meal. Our search for the best Bloody Mary around continues...
