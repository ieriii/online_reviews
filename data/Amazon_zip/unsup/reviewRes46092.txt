Every time I have been here, it has been either with a close friend or a group of more than 6 people. Grand Lux Cafe is HUUUUGE, and a lot of tourists go in an out of this place. The menu is like that of the Cheesecake Factories (because Grand Lux is like the big cousin of CF), but bigger and sort of fancier. I've gotten the asian chicken salad here, along with the shrimp scampi. The portion sizes are huge, and the shrimp scampi is seriously some of the best pasta I've ever had. And of course, the cheesecakes are delicious! The service here is great. Perfect for a date, family, and friends to enjoy.
