As a Chicagoan, I grew up on Lou Malnatis, Due's, Gino's East, and even Edwardo's when it was still around. I had only heard about Peaquod's from a friend. On my last trip back home, I went to dinner here. We got a large half sausage half pepperoni deep dish. Couldn't believe how good it was. I've always liked my pizza on the crispier side, so this place seems tailor-made for me. They don't use as much tomato sauce compared to Lou's or Due's, and the meat isn't served as it's own layer either. It was well-balanced and the crust seemed like dessert afterward. Whenever I'm home, I'll be getting my deep dish from Peaquod's. Bonus city points if you remember going to Batter Up on Lincoln just a block over back in the day. The projection screen of the pitcher do his wind-up before the ball came out was a class above all other batting cages. They also had a bizarre basketball court with different shaped backboards, an arcade, and laser tag too.
