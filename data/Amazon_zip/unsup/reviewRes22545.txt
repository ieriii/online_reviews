This place really disappoints me when you get delivery. Very greasy, not at all traditional, too sweet. Something happened in the last year here, and it really is lagging in quality! The ingredients are lacking--no longer very fresh. Before I was raving about a ton of items on the menu. Now, I've been back a couple times and something tells me this owner/chef combo has hit growing pains. They have opened a few new chains and it's just rough--the original equation no longer has magic.
