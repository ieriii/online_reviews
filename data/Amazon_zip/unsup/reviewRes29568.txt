the decor is definitely much nicer than the typical thai restaurant even tho their sign outside is pretty tacky. As first glance, all the prices are pretty cheap and comparable to other thai restaurants. We got the fried shrimp rolls as an app. if you've never tried them before, they're pretty good except here at opart. There wasn't much shrimp and it looked messy. I've had these at other places and it's always been good since they use big, full shrimp. That was a waste of $6. Now on to the entrees...the bf and I got the beef pad see iew and red curry chicken. I was hoping this place would fulfill my long time goal of finding awesome pad see iew but sadly it did not. The pad see iew was a bit too sweet and the portion was surprisingly a lot smaller than i expected. As for the red curry, OMG...I LOVED IT! has got to be my favorite red curry place thus far. Weird thing is tho when we ordered it the waiter asked if we wanted rice with the curry... here's our convo.. H: beef pad see iew and red curry with chicken please W: do you want rice with the curry? H: ummm...doesn't it come with rice (shoots a look to her bf..both are confused) W: no it doesn't, you have to order it H: umm..ok. we'll take a bowl of rice then (waiter leaves) H's bf: WTF do they expect us to eat the curry with if there's no rice? do they expect us to drink it?!?!? anywho rice is $1 more. not a big deal i guess but it feels weird having to pay for rice when you order curry... hmmm... I definitely want to try different dishes at this place in the future. Red curry lovers, please try this place out!
