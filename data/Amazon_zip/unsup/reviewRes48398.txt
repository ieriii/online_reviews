I ate dinner at Publican and it was alright. It's fantastic if you're a PORK fan. The concept is pretty neat. It's mimicked after a Belgian Ale House, so most likely you're going to be eating at the hugely long wooden table with a big wooden high-back chair shared with others. If you don't like sharing your table, don't go here. The china is all mismatched and something you would find at your Grandma's house-which I thought was cute. FOOD There was a big group of us, so we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. The food is just really simple and kind of strange. DONT EAT HERE IF YOURE ON A DIET. We ordered the radish with sea salt and butter, which most people would think of radish sauteed in butter and sprinkled with salt? NOPE not here. You get raw, sliced radish, a slab of butter and a cup of salt. Uhmm okay?? I hate ribs and their ribs were pretty sweet. They didn't have the typical BBQ smokey taste. The chicken was pretty decent but nothing to write home about. I'm allergic to fish, but we ordered a ton of it and no one seemed that thrilled with it. The fish soup comes out in a big cauldron and it's a modge podge of random fish stuff. Overall this place is over priced, comfort food with an extensive beer list that might impress some people. Well I go out to nice places all the time and know better. I'm not impressed.
