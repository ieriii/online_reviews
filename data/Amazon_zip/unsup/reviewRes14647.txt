The whole staff was great about giving us there favorite things to order. We got 2 sandwiches and empanadas. They honestly asked us 3 times how we liked each thing. This was in the middle of lunch rush mind you. Its very hard to find people who still care about customers. The pulled pork sandwich and goat cheese empanada were awesome. The regular cuban sandwich was good, but I'd rather get the steak sandwich next time. I would have given a 5 star if my other sandwich was perfect
