what can i say about doug's that hasn't been said? it is really event eating in my opinion. if i went here regularly my cholesterol would be off the charts. this is not get-in-get-out service, it's more like a field trip. doug takes his encased meats seriously and makes sure everyone gets top notch quality and service. i recently took some out of town friends to doug's and i was nervous they would think i'd lost my mind, making them wait in line for an hour for a hot dog, but they were downright giddy once the food arrived. friends, i leave you with these three important words: duck. fat. fries.
