Classy, elegant, romantic, alluring, mysterious... delicious with a touch of the old fashioned! This "hidden" gem of a speakeasy is not for the `bomb drinking, bud' swigging, foul mouthed types looking to pick up chicks. In fact you are not even allowed to approach other tables unless invited after you've requested your server to ask for you! Perfect for privacy. Dim candle light aids in the relaxing effect of the hypnotic drinks. Cocktails made with such skill, by true artisans, with homemade bitters and syrups and only the finest hard liquors, will have you relishing in taste and aromatic pleasure! As soon I entered, I immediately noticed how clean the whole place smelled. A wonderful sign of quality. Be sure to sit at the bar if you are fascinated by the art of drink making, as the bartenders are masters of skill and knowledge, who can be persuaded to come up with something not on the menu for those who are interested! Impress your dates, friends from out-of-town, and yourself with this ultra hip place to trip back in time! Go early for the best seats and to avoid waiting in line. Space is limited but worth the wait!
