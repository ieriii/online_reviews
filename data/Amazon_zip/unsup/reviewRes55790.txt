This is a great place. It has a special place in our hearts (and stomachs). My hubby has been going forever, and proposed to me here. The food is wonderful, wait staff personable and fun, and the amount of food you get is delightful... you always have enough for lunch the next day. I love the pizza bread that comes to the table with the water - so tasty. I've tried several different menu items, and love them all. Oh, to top off the food, there is a wonderful piano man there on Friday and Saturday! I'd go just to listen to him!!! When was the last time you heard a lounge guy able to do Frank Sinatra AND Lady GaGa? He does Billy Joel and Elton, Dean Martin and Sting... I know there are more, but you will just have to go see him.Yup food - fun - and entertainment... definitely a great place to visit - soon, you'll call it home.
