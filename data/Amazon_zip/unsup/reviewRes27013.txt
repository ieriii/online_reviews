So I went here with a friend who had moved out of Chicago...I think I walked about 10 miles to get here...no joke. So after my crazy hike across freakin' Chicago, we arrived at Pequod's. Service was so nice! and the famous crust was worthy of fame. So freakin' good! One of those eating experiences when you wish you weren't with a boy you liked so you could just go pig-crazy and chow down with abandon...stupid cute boys *angry face* ruining my meal!
