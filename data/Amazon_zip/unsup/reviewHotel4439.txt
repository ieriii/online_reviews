The Palmer House Hilton is an incredibly gorgeous hotel in the Loop. Its architecture is classy, refined, and very old-school Chicago. (As a history major, I like old-fashioned things. Thus, the Palmer House Hilton gets an A in my book.) I was there recently for a sorority formal. The event space (Empire Room) did not seem to be outdated/falling apart at all, and the room was very charming. The lighting was soft and the gold/black ornamentation was beautiful. If you have severe allergies, I'm not sure this is a place that will listen 100%, and this is an important caveat. One of my good friends is severely allergic to dairy. She called weeks in advance and was assured that there were no problems with her request. But what happened? She had a severe allergic reaction and had to be carried out by paramedics, spending time in the hospital. The hotel could've done a better job not only apologizing, but also honoring her request. Another small error was made in that a few random people wandered into the Empire Room. This isn't a huge deal, but from a security standpoint, it should be treated as one. A Keith Urban lookalike, who was obviously not a guest at a sorority formal (I can understand older dates, but he looked at least 35...), entered the room when I was outside with my friend. He walked in a bit more, and then finally left. The manager said "Oh, I would've escorted him out anyway" or something, but I think they could've been a bit more proactive. There are serious concerns for allergies and security, but overall, the Palmer House space is lovely. They should work out a few kinks, though!
