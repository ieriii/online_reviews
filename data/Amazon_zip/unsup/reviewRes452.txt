Wooowww. I'm not even sure where to begin with this culinary adventure but if you are a foodie this is just something I'd recommend doing at least once. It was cool how each course had some sort of interactive component of consuming that to the point we joked that Alinea bought their utensils and silverware at a Staples or Office Depot. Each course was imaginative though not all were home runs in my book. Service was great. Our wait staff bantered back and forth, and joked with our table which was nice - nothing snobby about this high end restaurant. I do have to say though if you're going to take pictures there is a no flash policy which was kind of a bummer given how dark it got for how long we sat down for. Certainly a memorable experience!
