I'm sorry I have to give this restaurant 3 stars and even considering bumping down to 2.5. My reasons: - Last Saturday I walked at least 2 miles to this place utterly starving to find it CLOSED at 8PM. According to an earlier review, I guess they ran out of food. Seriously? The following Saturday I decided to give it another go because of all the rave reviews I've heard. - I've had my fair share of Korean food and chicken wings of all sorts in my life time, but I'm sorry these wings weren't impressive. I had the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy sauces. The Crisp BBQ sauce is basically the red chili paste sauce from bibimbop with some added smoky flavors. The Seoul Sassy sauce was alright - nothing crazy. I didn't appreciate the pool of frying OIL the wings were sitting in -- not appetizing. The meat on the wings was half tender and half dry/hard. Probably could be prevented if the wingette and drumette were separated before fried. - I will admit the size of these wings are fairly bigger than your typical buffalo style wings. I have left overs that I don't want to eat. - I will pass on this restaurant and stick to the authentic Korean restaurants, Thai angel wings, and Great Sea's wings (on Lawrence and my fave). btw, dol sot bibimbap is 100% better than your plain bibimbap. TRY IT + On a positive note, the service was great here. The guys working the front of the restaurant were extremely friendly and checked on all their guests at the tables frequently. + I appreciate the efforts of this restaurant, but will not be returning.
