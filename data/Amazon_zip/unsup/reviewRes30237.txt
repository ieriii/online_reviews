Thank goodness for discount deal coupons. If it wasn't for them, I would never get the chance to visit places like Sunda. Purchased a Gilt City voucher a few months ago for Sunda for a five course meal; decided to cash it in for lunch recently. When you walk in, you are immediately transfixed on the gorgeous decor of the space: a large dining room that had different spots for sofa areas and long tables in the middle of the room. Sushi bar was on one side and a private dining area in the back. Everything about this place screamed high class. Now for the menu. As mentioned before, dined on five courses: warm spinach and mushroom salad (the olive oil topping on the salad gave it a lot of flavor); chicken and mushroom shu mai (dumplings...yum), Summer of Sunda roll (liked the avocado in it); Pancit Canton (nice mixture of the egg noodles and roasted chicken), and finally a plate of mochi for dessert. I believe that the Pancit was the best dish of the afternoon...their interpretation of a classic Filipino dish and probably as good as what my Mom usually makes (and that's a high bar to jump over). Another bonus is how the service treated us. I've had many experiences where restaurants would give you less than stellar service if you flash a discount voucher in front of them, but not here. Angie, one of the managers came by early in the meal and welcomed us and assured us that we would not leave the place hungry (which, judging by the boxes of leftovers we had to bring home, was definitely true). Our waitress was polite as well, and when I came to her to ask about an overcharge on the check, she apologized and gave us the correct one. Genuine and no attitude. This place has immediately shot into my top five fave restaurants in the city...and i can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu.
