I was torn on giving this place 3 or 4 stars. Part of it is because I am not sure that Ethiopian food is for me. I want to point out a few things though on what made me choose 4. First of all, when we sat down, the host made some wine selections right away. It really stuck out to me because between him and our server, they were very nice and very helpful with selecting what we were going to get. We ended up going with the messob sampler. It included some of the sambussa which was an appetizer. We ended up going with the chicken and the beef, both were awesome. Next came the entree which 3 of us split. I really enjoyed some of the items but disliked some things too. My favorites were the beef and carrots, and both of the beef stew like samplers. We also got dessert with the sampler. Now that I know a little more of what I like, the next time I go I will know what to get. Just some of the things weren't for me. Definitely try this though, I thought over-all it was a great experience.
