Very busy place so that was a good sign. my friend and I went on the waiting list that was supposed to be about 2-hour long. They had empty tables outside but apparently a private party had booked all of the patio and they couldn't sit others. but much to our delight, after just about 10 minutes we were given one of those empty tables as the party had ended. So far, so good.We both started with a cocktail. I did not like the taste of my cocktail and asked the waiter if he could change it and he quickly did that, no questions asked. We tried a few small plates: Greek salad was outstanding. Fresh with heriloom tomatoes and the dressing has lots of feta cheese in it. The fried eggplant parmesan balls were also outstanding. Tasted just like eggplant parmesans in the shape of a meatball. Tried the bone marrow spread that was served with some grilled brioche bread. The bread was very oily and felt heavy but the bone marrow was great. Also tried the Jamon Serrano and a spanish cheese served alongside some preserve (probably grape or raisin preserve) with toasted french bread and loved every bit of it. We also ordered their salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese topped with pistachios. It was delicious but I felt it was a bit heavy on goat cheese. For dessert, we shared a lemon pannacotta with candied pistachio and it was a lovely end to a great tapas style meal. Overall a great experience. We may go back tomorrow night.
