We waited for 1:30 for our table. OUr hostess said they would send some complimentary apps for our long wait (we never got). ONce we were seated there was another 15 mintue wait to get some wine ordered. The waiter was making it seem like he was doing us a favor by serving us. He had the whole gay, hipster pretentious thing going on. Pretty much service was a zero but the food and wine was the saving grace.
