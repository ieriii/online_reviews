So what that you have to wait in line for a while. This isn't McDonald's, people! And really, if you are sitting in a restaurant you have to wait for your food anyway, and standing in line at this place is part of the fun. Grab a beer or a pop and check out the menu board...and prepare to change your mind a million times, as there are too many great choices. On this most recent visit, BF and I split the shortrib torta and the XOCO salad with carnitas. BF got the watermelon agua fresca....wow, was that a nice drink with the fresh lime and mint. Um, this shortrib thing was so flipping good that I did not want it to end. Rather than wolfing it down as I am known to do, I took teeny tiny bites because it made me sad to think of it being gone. The salad was perfectly coated with the tastiest vinaigrette, and of course topped with the excellent carnitas and other stuff I don't remember, but it was damn good. On a previous visit I got the carnita torta in the tomato broth...I seriously craved that thing for weeks afterwards. Churros, ice cream, and hot chocolate were also ordered that time, and again, yum! This time we got two soft serves...one with chocolate-chili brownie chunks, and the other with caramel and some kind of streusel with bacon. Oh my freaking gawd, was that good! Best fast-ish food in the city.
