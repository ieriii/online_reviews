I recommend going to The Bongo Room on a weekday morning if you are going to go to it. The breakfast is decent, but I would not go a long distance to buy it. The staff was average as well. Overall, it's another mediocre restaurant in Chicago which many people make a big deal about, and is definitely not a restaurant worth sitting in for a long time to get served.
