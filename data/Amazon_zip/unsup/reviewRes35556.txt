Love the location and new look of SunWah. This was my first experience with this place, even though all of my friends go here and rave about the food and low prices. Yes, the prices are low. Yes, the roast park is one of the best I've eaten, really soft. I love the addition of the salted egg. But, the rice is super soggy and wet. Whoever made the day's rice batch over watered it!! Random note - the first dish I ordered was Hong Kong noodles with bbq pork. When it came out, i took a bite and it overwhelmingly smelled and tasted like shrimp. I asked the waitress who kept telling me it was just bbq pork in the broth. She didn't understand what I was saying!! (I'm allergic to seafood, so I need to know if my foods are contaminated with shrimp) She spoke to her boss who told me it did have shrimp (think they need to better label their dishes to avoid this in the future). I'm better off going to Chinatown or getting Viet food elsewhere in Argyle.
