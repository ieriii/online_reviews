Definitely NOT worth paying full price; I Hotwired this hotel for $175/night (about half off) and it wasn't even worth that. Hotwire had it listed as 4-4.5 stars and while it looks fancy in the lobby and from the outside, the rooms are anything but. The beds are full-size AT BEST, lighting is terrible, and the fridge/mini bar situation is a nightmare. I was afraid to touch anything because I thought I'd be charged. Everything is on a sensor and you are charged immediately if something is moved. I've been in hotels that charge by weight or after 30 seconds or so, but never immediately. We were in a non-smoking room yet our room somehow still smelled like smoke and it was disgusting. And there is only ice on the 7th floor, with no ice buckets provided. Also, I went to use the fitness center and there is a CHARGE?! Never in my life have I ever experience that. Instead I ran down and around Navy Pier which was only 4 blocks away for free. I will NOT stay here again nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone.
