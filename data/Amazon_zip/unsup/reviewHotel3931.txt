The second star is for the location and history. I have such mixed feelings because despite the reviews I had high expectations.  We had booked for the Marathon with a package that included the entry fee to the race. It just happened to be here which thrilled me to no end thinking that I was going to have a wonderful experience.  First things first, this is considered the MOST haunted hotel in Chicago which is a hugely haunted city if you are into that. (No I didn't get haunted myself) The Hotel has some beautiful areas, like the ballroom, but the rest of the place is run down, old and smelly. I have no problem with old or quaint even as long as its clean and cool. I need a very cold room at night to sleep in and the second we walked into the room it was extremely smelly with a moldy smell that was just embeded in the air. The air conditioner was not working but luckily we could open the windows and the fresh air at night was great. The safe was locked open. We took our wallets with us so we didn't really need it but the devil is in the details. Our view was of the back not the much advertised Buckingham fountain view.GF3y There were picketers out in front our whole stay. One of them was very obnoxious and vulgar as we passed with our 15 year old. Most of the time they were just in the way not letting people pass.  Front desk service? Just 'meh' at best.  We were in the room when housekeeping came and she asked if I preferred if she came back later or not at all (with hope in her voice) and when I told her later it was very obvious that is not the answer she wanted. I would have to say that it was in an amazing location, but aside from that I have stayed in much nicer hotels right next to Disney World in Florida for $50 a night. I was very disappointed.
