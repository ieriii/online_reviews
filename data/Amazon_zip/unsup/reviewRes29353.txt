With an abundance of Thai restaurants in the Lincoln Square/Ravenswood area, Opart reigns king with great food and a great atmosphere.  Lots of very flavorful dishes: excellent chicken satay, delicious curries, and interestingly they have a marvelous chicken fried rice that is bursting with flavor but not salty or greasy in the slightest! A couple of the noodle dishes aren't that great, but 9 times out of 10 I'm very impressed with the food. Service is plenty adequate and its a clean, quiet, comfortable restaurant. Opart Thai House is BYOB, but a small liquor store is conveniently located just two doors down.
