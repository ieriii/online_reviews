The atmosphere here is as warm and cozy as it gets. I had a very attentive waitress last night and she was knowledgeable and made great recommendations. The artichoke dip was delicious. I had the whiskey burger and my friend had the curry--we'd recommend both. I've also had brunch there in the past and it was also delicious.
