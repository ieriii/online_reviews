LOVE Pequods! Its not an everyday sort of pizza though, its 2 times a day kind of pizza! The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars: I have this thing about perfect ratios in my pizza - sauce to ingredients to cheese to crust. (its the same thing with hot dogs) Pequods is perfect on everything, except for crust. I am not talking about the caramelized goodness on the outside of the pie, I am talking about the bottom of the pie. Especially when eaten the 2nd day, the crust is thicker and I have to eat only the top layer of it.  Still, get the largest size, because it is fantastic for leftovers (if you aint thick crust phobic like me) and don't bother with any starters to save room for the real deal.
