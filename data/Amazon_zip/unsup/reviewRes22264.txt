I'm going to start right off and say there was a dead cockroach in the bathroom. Still reading? The sink was also plugged. Still reading? Food was delicious but they couldn't tell us what any of it was and it was a large group who ordered meat and vegetarian options...as I'm a vegetarian, it kind of mattered to me to know which dishes were vegetarian. Still reading? Ok, well, my stomach has hurt since I got home. I don't think it's food poisoning...it more reminds me of when I accidentally have had meat. I'm not violently ill or anything but I think it's clear that they are very insensitive to vegetarians and may not actually understand the term. Also, a friend of mine found a piece of "mystery meat" in her dish. It could have been because it was adjacent to other meat dishes and maybe someone just wasn't careful but with everything else (especially the roach), I don't think I will ever go back there again. Also, the seats were plastic...tacky? Yes. Very very tacky.
