a recent, frustrating evening wandering around chicago in the rain led a friend of mine and i to stumble across bin 36. we were wet and cranky and just decided out of desperation to stop here. what a fantastic choice! wine lovers, this is a must. the atmosphere is reserved, but friendly; classy, but not pretentious. it was around 11pm and the place was full of cheery people chatting over wine. this is a great place to take your date!  we munched on some thin breadsticks that had quite the interesting flavor (anise!) the prices on the menu are a bit high, but what do you expect for a place that deals mainly in the art of fine wine? not particularly being connoisseurs, but enjoying a nice glass of wine, my friend and i were drawn to the "flights" on their menu. these consist of small samplings of wine or cheese, rather than full servings that you may or may not end up enjoying. my friend ordered the robust "Argentenia with a Little Chile Thrown in" flight, while I ordered the "Pinot Noir - More Ways Than One" flight. PINOT NOIR is glorious! four glasses of 2.5 oz samplings are brought to you and set on a placemat that describes each one. I was surprised to see that I was to drink a WHITE pinot noir! wonderful! We also split a cheese flight (Il Giro Italia - Italian Inspiration). the service was quick, though our waitress was a little flighty (possibly drinking in the back? haha). the major downfall of this place is the price. that will turn away most customers. for two people, our bill came out to over $50, and that was just for a light snack of cheese and 20 oz of wine. though, value should not always be looked at in a monetary sense. the experience was wonderful, so i believe it was a good spend. after this experience, we felt we had really developed our palettes and noticed our talk of wines had developed into complex discussions! great time to be had if you're a lover of vino! i'll definitely be going back again on my next trip to chi-town!
