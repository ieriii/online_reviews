Liars! This is not an authentic Thai restaurant! It is NOT good either!!! Where did these review come from?!!! We went to eat in. The deafening roar of the place was too much to handle. I couldn't hear my boyfriend sitting directly across from me at a 2 person table. I kept saying, "What? I'm sorry? I can't hear you!" I have been to quieter bars. The food was Americanized. Conservative menu, nothing extraordinary. We ordered 2 appetizers, one was good and the other was barely edible. We talked about leaving. I was so cold from the over active air conditioner (with a dress to my elbows and knees on an 85 degree day in June) I had goosebumps from head to toe. Every time the door would open my napkin would blow off of my lap. We decided to stay because we were starving. Bad, bad decision. Should have gone with our gut and left for Sticky Rice. My sauteed fish dish came out fried. I asked for a menu, maybe I made a mistake. No... Our waiter (as usual) was nowhere to be found, so my boyfriend got up to get him. I was told that ALL of the fish is fried. Seriously? Even when it says sauteed... Um...? I stuck to the basics and ordered basil chicken. It came out when my boyfriend was done with his dinner. They didn't replace my rice, so that was cold. Nice. Thanks. Between the terrible atmosphere, the awful (lack of) service and the mediocre Americanized food, you couldn't pay me to go back.
