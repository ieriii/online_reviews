I like Sultan's Market for being cheap with decent food. But unfortunately, I love Cedar's in Hyde Park a lot lot more. I know people that adore this place, so the low star rating *could* be attributed to high expectations, or it could just be that it's not the best med food I've had by a long shot. I'll still definitely go back, especially when the wait at Handlebar seems too long and the waiter there sees fit to let 3 parties of 2 wait, with 5 empty tables, but immediately seats the party of four that walks in after them. True story.
