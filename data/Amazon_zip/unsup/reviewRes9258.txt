I think my coworker described this place best: "It's like the restaurant from Casablanca, only without the Nazi's and with much better food." Seriously, this is the kind of place that gives Chicago it's culinary chops. The food here is simply wonderful. A great date spot. Will someone please date me and take me here? Please?
