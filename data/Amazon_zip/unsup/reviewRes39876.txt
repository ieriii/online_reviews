I came here for dinner on a Wed night around 8 pm. The place was crowded, but I was seated in less than 5 minutes. There is a sidewalk patio available, but I chose to sit inside in the front room. The seating was a bench against the wall and chairs on the other side. Despite the semi-close quarters, I was pleased that it was not too loud to hear our conversation.  I started with the Negroni and my friend had the Logan Palmer (alcoholic Arnold Palmer) - both were excellent. For app, we had the Slagel Family Farm Meatballs w/ creamy polenta, parsley pesto, fonduta. Oh my god - get this..the polenta is ridiculously good. For dinner, we both got the Slagel Family Farm burger. The aged widmer's cheese on this makes the burger. It is probably one of the tastiest burgers I've had...up there with Kuma's. Love this Slagel Family Farm. Love this place. I'm definitely coming back on a weekend so I can have more drinks.
