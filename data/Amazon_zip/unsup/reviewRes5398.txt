Who can exist a place named after a purple pig come on especially for a person who loves anything purple!! Found this place through a friend what a cute little cozy place that serves up a fine fare. This is where I had my first experience with bone marrow dip. Not that big of a fan of the marrow but love the rustic presentation. I would recommend getting the squid appetizer, pork rilette, grilled chicken skewers. Of course don't forget the wine. This place is perfect to bring a girlfriend to whine and dine and share small tapas style bites. Would love to find something similar back home. The pork rilette is like a pate style spread served with warm brioche and a sweet pepper jam. The perfect marriage of salty and a touch of sweet from the red pepper. The squid was grilled to perfection just the right amount of bite and the herb sauce went perfect with the roasted potatoes that came with it. Tip:not good for groups at most 4 is perfect to share and try everything. The food can be a little bit on the heavy side since they serve mainly anything pork. So come with an empty stomach.
