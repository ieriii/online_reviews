Big Jones is a nice restaurant that offers an unexpected take on Southern food. I enjoyed their appetizer platter of pickles, pate, and sausages as well as the shrimp and grits entree. I also enjoyed the warm cornbread muffins with honeybutter which were served to our table. Honestly though, while I enjoyed those dishes I kept feeling like I was looking for something more. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled with sausage and pate platters from the likes of the Purple Pig, but I just felt there was something missing here. While the menu was interesting, it didn't seem complete. Also, throughout the meal portions were smaller than I expected. That said, I did really enjoy their homemade pickles and the shrimp and grits. I believe their menu rotates seasonally, so I will be interested to see what they will be offering this spring.
