Cheese, swine, and wine. The fact that "swine" was in the tagline made me nervous. As a vegetarian, I was not thrilled to check this place out, honestly. Reviews and press have stated how "good" the restaurant was based on eating bone marrow, ears, tails, and everything else an animal has to offer. Working upstairs, I was also distracted by the smell everyday. With all that said, I have to say I was impressed. I loved the decor as it was a nice change of pace from all the chain restaurants of Michigan Ave. The service was also informative and on point. I'm honestly not a big cheese guy, but I have to say that all their salads were wonderful. They seemed to incorporate asparagus into all their salads. I went with a group from work so we ended up sharing most of our dishes, which worked out well and allowed us to try everything on the menu. After the salads I tried the toast with goat cheese topped with eggplant and garbanzo beans. Tasty! Finally, I closed out with their grilled cheese of the day, which I think was a bleu cheese and cheddar? I'm not sure, but it was good. However, my main concern is that I am a vegetarian leaning vegan and most, if not all dishes, seemed to depend on using cheese as a base for flavor. I don't really know what a vegan would get here on a night out without really customizing the order. Whether it makes sense for a vegan to go to a restaurant called The Purple Pig, is up to you to decide, but I do think that alternative should always be available.
