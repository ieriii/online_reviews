Had moderate to high expectations and was really disappointed with the service. The management here don't know how to make things right with customers, after making us wait over 3 hours for our food. The food itself--some of it was pretty good. Some of it was bland and bad. Wish I could say better things about the place. Service needs to get better, Gilt Bar!
