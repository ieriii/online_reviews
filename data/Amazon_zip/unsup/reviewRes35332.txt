Shaw's used to be located in Northbrook, where I grew up. Now I know why they left, and why my parents never took us kids there.... Too pricey to be in the burbs, and ultimately, I don't feel you get what you pay for here. For me, when you go to an expensive restaurant, you expect EVERYTHING to taste good, not just the things they are known for. I mean, how hard is it to make fresh seafood taste bad? Pretty hard. Oysters were really good, but very pricey. They also have a great wine selection, but that should be expected of a high end seafood place in the loop. I went with the Voss Sauv Blanc. I've had it before in Napa and it's terrific. The lobster bisque soup was the best thing I ate all night. But, I love lobster bisque soup, and have had better lobster bisque soup at Pete Miller's Steakhouse. My problem was the lobster dinner. The lobster itself was fine. But, it was accompanied by 2 tasteless steamed potatoes, a bland/discolored half piece of corn on the cob, and shredded Styrofoam they played off as coleslaw. I have had coleslaw a million times better at a bar when it's served with a burger and fries. Why the hell can't they do a decent job at a high end restaurant?!? For me, when dining at an upscaled restaurant, I expect a complete meal. For the money spent, I expect there to be line cooks in the back who are innovators, not robots. For half the price, I can buy my own lobsters, crappy coleslaw in a bag, and mediocre produce at Jewel and make exactly what was presented to me at Shaw's.
