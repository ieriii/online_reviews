Visited here for a birthday party. Food was ok. The menu was very limited and the fact that it had rabbit and foie gras completely disgusted me. Waitress was trendy... but very nice and efficient. I ordered roast chicken with mashed potatoes and burrata and tomato salad. Tomatoes were really fresh tasting. Chicken was like Boston Market upgraded. Unfortunately we were sitting not at a dining table so I had to basically eat on my lap. Pretty cool decor. Not sure if it is worth a second trip.
