It's usually crowded. There will almost certainly be a line, and there's not always room to sit down inside once you get your food. The ahogada sandwich is a pork-based creation literally served with tomato soup, it's fantastic. The Cubana torta is an amazing combination of pork, beans and cheese, and it's probably the best thing here. The chocolate churros are of the spicy variety, and go great with the chocolate espresso as well.
