Finally I have made it here....this has been on the list for awhile. I have to say this place was super accommodating for us. We had reservations for 9PM but our play ran way over what we expected. We ended up not getting there until about 10PM on a random Wednesday. They couldnt have been nicer about it. It was no problem, which is a rare find in Chicago on a Wed night. So like I said, we were a little rushed, etc. just because of our situation. So I think I would have enjoyed it more if we didnt feel rushed to get there, starving, etc. The service was great. He explained the menu perfectly, specials, etc.  The food-YUM! We started with the grilled calamari. It was perfectly seasoned and grilled. Also, we did the appetizer portion of the gnocchi because we wanted to try it but didnt want it as a meal. It was FANTASTIC. I loved every bite. There was nothing left on the plate when they cleared the dish! HA. Then we did the pork shank and the seafood stew. Again, both were really good. By the end, we were both in carb overload, but it was worth it! Overall a great little restaurant. Pretty darn cheap in comparison to some of the places we have been too lately and the quality was definitely there.
