How did I not discover this places sooner??? Maybe because I'm not too familiar with Andersonville, but that's beside the point. Anyways best Gastropub on the north side. Expansive selection of domestic craft beers, but what makes this place stand out are the Belgian beers. Over 20 on tap and countless bottles of trappist ales.  For the food- the menu notes the specialty of the house are the mussels and I can corroborate that! The two person order was enough to feed 4 people (at least as an appetizer). The mussels are also served with pommes frites, which were a bit soggy, but were saved by the aoli. I'll save the narrative, but another must have item is the venison meatballs.  Bottom line, if you like belgian beer and good food, make the trip to this andersonville institution.
