Nothing is better than Hot Doug's. NOTHING. When my husband and I first discovered this place, we started coming every week, no matter how cold it was outside and how long we had to wait in line. Then life got busy and we got distracted. We went back today after a year absence and it was incredible. By far the best hot dogs/sausages in Chicago. Yes, you'll wait in line, and it's cash only, but Doug is the nicest guy in town and makes the best hot dogs you'll ever have. Run, don't walk, to Hot Doug's.
