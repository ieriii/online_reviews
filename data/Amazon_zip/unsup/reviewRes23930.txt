This is one of the best places to eat in Andersonville, and yeah I know that's an audacious claim in this neighborhood packed with many gems. But when you can get a flavor profile that's so new and different for only ten bucks you know its something special to be celebrated. I guess that's why it got on Check, Please, and is usually very busy. The savory entree crepes have such fascinating flavors- feta and mint and olive tapenade are just a few standout ingredients that should get you engaged. They have interesting teas served in strange exotic pots, and great dessert crepes as well. I wouldn't say the service is that fantastic, sometimes you walk in and the restaurant has like several tables needing to be bussed, and only a few giggley young women serving who don't really have the cheap American sincereity down but eh, who cares? It's very laidback, and you feel totally welcome to sit and enjoy a long meal with frirends which is frequently what you see happening there It's decorated neat, with a chequered black and whtie floor from the old hamburger place it used to be, with lots of wall hangings and mirrors and gold and red accents from Morroccan and Algerian decorations. Cheap, delicious food that's really novel, excellent location right at Clark and Foster.  For what it is- a neighborhood restaurant with a distinctly different cuisine- its perfect.
