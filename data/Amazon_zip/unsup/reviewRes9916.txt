Piccolo Sogno was A-OK. I loved the service, and the atmosphere- oh my goodness! The patio was just beautiful. The food, however, was not very memorable. With so many delicious Italian restaurants in the city, Piccolo should really step up its game. I would say everyone should try it once, though, in the summertime when the patio is open. It's absolutely dreamy.
