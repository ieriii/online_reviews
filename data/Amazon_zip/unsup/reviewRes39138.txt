Usually the food here is delicious but when i just went there recently the quality of the food has gone down. Not only the quality of the food has worsen but the service is HORRIBLE (not like it was that great before). There are many reasons why the service was horrible. 1. They practically threw the food at us, they slammed it on the table 2. When they poured water for us, they SPILLED it on the grill and onto the food. 3. Every time you ask for something extra, they have this look their face as if we are wasting their precious time. 4. When we paid for our bill in the EXACT amount, as we were leaving a waitress pointed to me to come over, i asked whats wrong and they showed me how much i paid and i was confused for one moment. and the lady waitress finally asked " NO TIP?" and i said " i left it on the table". All they said WAS "OK", no thank you, no nothing. ABSOLUTELY RUDE . i will only be returning because the food is okay and its convenient to my house. do i recommend this place? only if you want to come to a place when they food is average with HORRIBLE RUDE SERVICE.
