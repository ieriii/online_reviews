Why I Love Garcia's... I've bee a fan of Garcia's for about 10 years. 1. They are pretty consistent. You know what you like and you know its going to come out as expected. That means a lot to me. I tend to go for traditional favorites, taco dinner plate (mix and match... carne asada, cebolla, cilantro, picadillo with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, chicken & cheese, whats your favorite? oooh lala). 2. Burritos as big as your head! For REAL! When I first moved here from Miami, I was super spoiled by cuban food. Like, taco bell was mexican to me back then! But now, being a 7 year Chicago resident, Mexican Burritos are a must! These burritos are so big, you will have leftovers for sure. Portion control, people! Just thinking about it makes me want one right now! 3. Pitchers of margaritas. enough said! I personally think the frozen fruity ones are better tasting. Salt on the rim, please... Pitcher+burrito+good friends and convo = Great Time at an affordable cost. Ambiance: I am a sucker for a swanky environment, which is why this place gets 4 out of 5, for me. That being said, they have Mega upgraded their establishment over the last few years (especially the bathrooms!).. yay for them! Also, their waitresses wear cute black pants usually. :-)
