after all of the hype (and finally eating here after waiting over a year), i would have to say that the pizza was just okay. i guess i was expecting the pizza-to-end-all pizzas considering how crowded this place always is. i thought it was good but not great. although, now that i found out they deliver to my apartment, i may just have to try a different type of pizza (considering there are 3 to chose from)...
