My first time to Crisp I ordered a regular buddha bowl and 10 chicken wings (Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy) to split with the BF. We had planned on bringing home leftovers but my goodness was it a lot of food and delicious! The Seoul Sassy wings were sooooo good! The BBQ wasn't that special but if you like BBQ, you'll like the flavor. And we had to force ourselves to finish the regular buddha bowl (prob wasn't the best idea)..  Went the 2nd time with the BF and this time we opted for just 5 wings (seoul sassy) and the mini buddha bowl. And note that they let you customize the bowl if you do not like the veggies provided. Again it didn't disappoint! Went the 3rd time recently with the BF and of course got the sassy wings and this time switched to the steak bowl (requested an egg on top). They didn't have jasmine rice ready so I got brown rice, for no extra charge. This was my first time with the steak bowl so i'm not sure if this is always the case but there was A LOT of sauce over everything. It was a little too much (and maybe the brown rice texture had to do with it as well). The seasoning on the wings were also a bit too strong so maybe it was just an off day overall. It won't keep me from returning though. I love the concept of this place. It's a great place to grab a quick bite with friends. Pricing for the food is good and the workers/owner is very friendly!
