Damn, what a place. So far I've had to wait in line longer here than any other place I have been to in Chicago. Is it worth it? YES. Well, at least once in your life. Coming from texas, I never got to experience hot dogs outside of bbq style dogs. I was pretty happy trying a chicago style hot dog when I first moved here. Up until this point I was content with my hot dog experience.... until I went to hot doug's. They have all sorts of specialty dogs. Alligator, rattlesnake, etc etc.... it's mind blowing. They also had fries fried in duck fat!!!! I don't think any place in chicago offers what this place offers. People need to come here at least once in their chicago lives.
