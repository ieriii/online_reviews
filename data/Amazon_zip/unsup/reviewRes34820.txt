Ok, I know they increased their prices, but that doesn't stop my husband and I from eating there once a week. The falafel sandwich is the best and you must get it spicy! The lentil soup is amazing! Our 1 year old even loves it! We never order anything different. It is definitely worth a trip! Best falafel in town!!!
