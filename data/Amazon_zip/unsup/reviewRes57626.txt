I recently went to Geja's for an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic and the service was friendly. We each got the Prince Geja's Combination which was the perfect choice, because it came with a salad, cheese fondue, chocolate dessert fondue and the assortment of meats to cook. Geja's really felt like a complete dining experience and everything was extremely delicious. I highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner!
