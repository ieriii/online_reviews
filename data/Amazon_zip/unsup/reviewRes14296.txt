My wife and I went there a few weeks ago for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. The seafood was fresh and delicious, the staff were welcoming and attentive, and the atmosphere was unique and comfortable. One tip, if you're going for the all-you-can-eat shrimp on Thursdays, go early. They ran out after 8 or so. The bloody marys look delicious and apparently they are since weekend brunches there are packed. Be sure to get in now. They're going to be on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives this November. When that happened to Smoque, the lines started wrapping around the building.
