In town for a meeting, and decided to check this place out for breakfast. I went on two separate occasions, and my friend went a three times.  The first time we were completely wowwed with the cinnamon roll french toast, which was really out of sight. I had the California omlette which had way too much stuff for the amount of egg. It wasn't really an omlette either. It was more like a giant scrambled egg. At that time we decided that it was a solid 4 because of how tasty the cinnamon roll french toast was. On my second trip, burned by the namesake eggs, I decided to try the pecan roll french toast, which was excellent, but not as outstanding as the cinnamon roll variety. Unfortunately, my friend ordered the peach crepes which were made with low-quality canned peaches and had a hair inside the crepe. I still think that the cinnamon french toast pulls this place up from 2 to a 3 star rating. It's too bad too because the decor and the service were both at least a four and probably 5 star.
