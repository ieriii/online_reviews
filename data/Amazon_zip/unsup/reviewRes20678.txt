Went here after the St. Pat's day parade and it was great! House burger was HUGE and delicious! Beer and drinks were high priced, and they didn't have any specials on a holiday weekend which I thought was odd. They have a ton of space and seems like a great spot for groups! Atmosphere is nice, really an anything goes kind of feel.
