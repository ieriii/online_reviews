Southern food finally done proper!! Being from the south I've found that nobody in the midwest can quite do southern food proper (no offense, the south did create the food). The key, your meat must be cooked perfectly without any sauce, then the sauce will spruce it up that much more. The sauce is a staple, but should be a bonus to the meat. Lets be honest, badly cooked meat is just that, badly cooked meat. I shared the bbq flight - pulled chicken and pork and kobe brisket accompanied by cornbread. The flight was perfectly executed and it was a close race for the best, but I'd say I liked the brisket best followed by the chicken, then pork. With this you got 4 types of sauce - original mild, spicy, carolina vinegar and a mustard style. My favorites were the spicy and mustard - literally finger slurpin' good. We also had the fried green tomatoes which were served with an herbed greek style type of yogurt sauce that was tasty, but didn't over power the goodness of the tomatoes. For dinner we split the baby back ribs that slid off the bone - meat cooked to perfection!! I also enjoyed the Orange Blossom Martini - Templeton Rye Whiskey, Lemon Juice, Cinnamon-Infused Simple Syrup, Splash of OJ - Why yes please to another now! Thank you Chicago Q - I'll be back for some more southern done proper.
