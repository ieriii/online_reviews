If loving a resturant was a good enough reason to move to a new city, I would sooo be moving to Chicago! The Chicago Diner is my new favorite place...in the world. I am vegan but I had the best "milk" shake I have had in years, vegan or otherwise!!This review should just be a bunch of exclamation marks because nothing else I could say would come close to describing my enthusiasm for this place. I love it! But aside from the milk shake and awesome bacon and cheezeburger( the best thing ever!) the staff is great! They are funny, and quite personable. Plus it doesnt hurt that they have the cutest guy working there( he has a mohawk, and I think i love him [ JUST KIDDING]]! i would come back just to see him lol! No but seriously, this an awesome place in general. Great food, great service, great people!
