Eight of us went to brunch at the Publican on Mother's Day. Everyone raved about how great their food was...definitely the best brunch I've had in Chicago. I ordered the maple-glazed pork shoulder served over grits with a sunny side up egg on top. The flavors were incredible! The pork was tender, juicy and pulled apart easily with my fork. The grits were creamy, flavorful and the egg yolk oozing over everything was just spectacular. My hubby and I split an order of hash browns and they were perfectly seasoned and really crispy...just the way I like them. I ordered the Publican Mimosa and it quite possibly was the best mimosa I have ever had. I don't like sweet champagne and this was served with some sort of a Belgian Ale (almost like a Blue Moon, but way better). My mom ordered the red wine poached eggs served with proscuitto and bernaise sauce. The eggs are actually purple...it was pretty trippy. I tasted a few bites of her food and the eggs were amazing. The wine flavor was not overwhelming at all...I would probably order this dish if it was still on the menu the next time I returned. Two people ordered the omelette and said it was the lightest, fluffiest, freshest omelette they had ever had. Two other people ordered the waffles and both of them devoured their dishes in just a few minutes so they must have been good. The last 2 people ordered the salmon lox served over a bagel with meyer lemon vinegairette. I had a bite of this and it was also incredible.  If you like sweets, you must order the sticky bun...oh, and the maple bacon is to die for. This place is the BEST!
