Cafe 28 is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood! I particularly like dining al fresco over brunch. Some of the highlights include the frozen mojitos (and the mojitos in general) as well as the breakfast burrito and chiliquiles. There's never a wait, parking is easy, and the food, brunch, lunch, or dinner, tasty!
