I still don't get how a chef can combine seemingly incompatible foods into such amazing dishes! That's my favorite thing about Graham Elliot...and of course the incredible cocktails. My only complaint is that sometimes the noise level is a bit loud for my taste, but that's a small price to pay for the extraordinary culinary experience.
