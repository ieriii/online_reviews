We've been meaning to try this restaurant for some time. I even signed up for their "Underground" menu but hadn't found a menu that was appealing enough. We decided to try their Tuesday 3 course special but ended up doing the 5 course tasting menu since we were celebrating an early Valentine's Day. It was a cold and snowy night, and the space is not well heated. We also had the misfortune of being seated next to a couple who downed two bottles of wine and then went out for a 12 pack of beer. Needless to say, they were loud and fairly obnoxious. I can't fault the restaurant for our bad luck, but sadly they came darn close to ruining our dinner (he did really awful impersonations!). Rotten luck aside, the food was excellent. Each course was perfectly prepared. The fish is sushi grade and fresh from Fulton Market. The duck fell off the bone it was so tender. I had never had cobia before, but I think we both found our new favorite fish.  The only weakness of the meal was the dessert. It was a sampler platter with some sort of bread pudding and custard. The dishes didn't really complement one another and were not very flavorful. The chef was very friendly and gave my girlfriend tips on preparing some of the dishes we had. He even suggested which fish markets were the best for novices. The waiter could have spent a little more time explaining the dishes. He usually went through everything so quickly I had barely realized the food was in front of me before he whisked away. I will definitely return for another round when their spring menu is released in a month or so.
