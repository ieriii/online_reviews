Ugh. In the course of writing this review I've switched from 4 to 3 and back to 4 and down again to 3 stars. I'm clearly torn. It's a pro and con situation, so: Pro: Impeccable attention to detail. I love restaurants that get the details right - top-notch service, lots of discussion of the menu, great decor, nice stemware, etc. Also, the owner spends time at your table, which is wonderful.  Pro: Creative and unique food. You won't find the food you're served at Bonsoiree anywhere else - and that goes a long way with me. Con: I really, really, really wanted to like the food more than I did. It was all good, and much of it was kind of exciting or novel in some way, but out of 7 courses, only 2 made me go "wow." Even though it's BYO, it's still "wow" prices, so that was a little disappointing.  That said, I'm considering going back when the menu changes, and I'd encourage any one who's intrigued to try it for themselves. It's the kind of business you want to support.
