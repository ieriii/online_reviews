To give you an idea how good the duck is here, I'm going to tell this story. We were told over the phone that we had a reservation for 8pm because they only seat people on the hour. We showed up at 8pm and ordered at about 8:10. We asked our waitress for a recommendation for something other than duck (to have in addition) and she suggested something.  After that, the waitress blatantly ignored us and even rolled her eyes as we tried to get her attention around 9pm to see what the hold up was. She refused to get us a working corkscrew for our wine, despite that the restaurant is BYOB. We did not get our first course of duck until about 9:15ish, and that was after other tables that had ordered after us got their first courses. Needless to say, we were starving. Overall, this was without a doubt the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant.  However, we will go back for one very important reason--the duck was fabulous. The crispy duck with the pancakes was mindblowing, the soup was delicious, and the duck fried rice was addictive. My advice for those who want to go here is to not start so late because you run the risk of waiting forever for the best duck I've had west of the Mississippi River.
