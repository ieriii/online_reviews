This was was my first time dining at Sunda and it went past my expectations. We started with the Rock Shrimp Tempura, which was amazing, and every course thereafter was better than the last. I highly recommend the Noodle entress that has pork and shrimp in it. Also, we got the steak entree. The steak was seasoned perfectly and so tender. Lastly, we finished off the dinner with the Ridiculist for dessert which is carrot cake with ice cream in the center.I will def be back!!!
