Accommodated our party of 17 wonderfully. Our server, Diego, was delightful. I actually went for some of the non-beef options this time, and was pleasantly surprised by the parmesan chicken and the lamb chops (omg sooo good!!!) The desserts were also fantastic, especially the creme brulee (I think it was citrus/vanilla flavored.. yum yum yum!)
