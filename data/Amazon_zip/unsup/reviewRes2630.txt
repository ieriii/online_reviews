Run, don't walk, to this place. Take some cash as well as no credit cards accepted here. One duck sausage with foie gras, one spicy andouille with caramelized onions and some fries washed down with ginger beer. Extra tip got my food in less than 5'. Read my NY Times in one quite corner for my slice of heaven.
