Some of the best Italian food I've had! My first experience here the wait staff accidentally sat another couple at our table. The second we brought it to their attention, they immediately took us to the bar for a drink on the house, and we were the next people sat. We were greeted with excellent wait staff and a fresh homemade loaf of bread for dipping. I ordered the lasagna and even though I've been back 4-5 times, I've never ordered anything else. The lasagna is just too good to pass up. The owner made up for the accident during our first visit (which proved to us that they care) and therefore we will go back again and again. Oh, and if you register your name and address with the restaurant, the owner will send you a thank you note for visiting with a coupon for your next visit!
