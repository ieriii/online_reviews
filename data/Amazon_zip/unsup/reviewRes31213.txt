I grew up on the south side, where jokes are still made about Ethiopian restaurants and your best chances of finding Pad Thai are in the ethnic food aisle. So taking my sis and ma to this place to comfort them in the fact that veganism doesn't starve people worked wonders. They dug the mousse cake, the Reuben, and the Teese sticks (Chicago Soy Dairy, keep up the good work). I'm a little less forgiving, and I gotta say they still keep their head on straight (avoid the specials, they are consistently hit-or-miss). There is room for improvement (occasionally fixed with a quick S+P punch), but it's the best joint of its ilk around. The staff is a bunch of sweethearts. I have not had a bad server and I doubt I will.
