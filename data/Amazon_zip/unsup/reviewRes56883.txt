There were a number of issues:1) The matre d showed herself to be unqualified for the job.We had a reservation for 24 (2 tables of 12). Upon arriving and finding that the tables weren't ready, we were told we'd only have to wait 10 more minutes. We had to wait an additional 30-45 minutes past our reservation time to get one table for 12. The second table for 12 ended up not being free until several hours later. It appeared that the groups who were 'just above to leave' from the second table had in fact just been seated when we arrived. The other 12 people in our party split up and sat themselves around the restaurant in a fit of frustration and confusion.The matre d was less than helpful throughout and in conversation refused to accept responsibility for the errors in seating -- instead pinning the blame on our late reservation. To her benefit, we did end up getting some free spring rolls once we were seated. I don't know if these are typically free or not.2) My food had to be sent back.There was what looked like a hardened block of ramen in my main course. I understand that the noodles are pan fried, but that just wasn't right.I brought this to the attention of the waiter and my meal was promptly whisked away for a new plate. He even removed my meal from the bill. The waiter did a great job. The kitchen? Not so good.3) The food was pricey and just wasn't that good.I was there with French people and they didn't like the food that much. I've eaten a lot of good Vietnamese food and I didn't like the food that much. Fail on the fusion. Check on mediocrity.In the end the shortcomings were insurmountable as the management was questionable and the food was passable on the second try. Not what I want in a restaurant. I will not be back.
