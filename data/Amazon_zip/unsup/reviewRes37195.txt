This place is freaking amazing. This is a place you go to if you really appreciate beer. They have an amazing (belgian style focused) tap collection and an equally awesome collection of bottles. The staff is very knowledgeable about the beers they have and can expertly make suggests based on flavors or other beers you enjoy. They can get pretty busy here on weekends, especially around dinner time but thankfully they have an upstairs bar as well. I've only ate here a couple times but the food has been excellent both times. If you go off hours it is significantly less busy and makes for a more relaxed experience. Yay for great places in Chicago!
