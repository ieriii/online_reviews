LMAO....Ok, so here's the deal. I've read some of the reviews about Spacca Napoli, and they make me fall out of my chair.What people complain about is exactly what is authentic and special about this place. I grew up in Naples, Italy (authentic pizza capital of the world) and this place offers the closest thing I have ever tasted in the States. That, along with offering very high quality products and the use of very high end ingredients, ranks this place among my absolute favorites. I cannot compare this to other Chicago pizzerias, simply because you walk out of here spending way more then you would if you were to go to regular place. Think of it as a place where you would go for a special occasion, not your weekly trip to satisfy your pizza craving.Spacca Napoli offers a pizza novelty, and the owner (gentleman with curly black hair) is so passionate and so involved in his operation that I do not mind paying what I do for their pizza. He earns every penny, you can see him in the thick of things on a Saturday night, when there's a line out the door and thirty people cramped in there little waiting area. Having said all of that, it is people that have been to Italy that will appreciate and love this place. If you grew up on Chicago style, or any other American style pizza, it might not be for you. Pizza was created to be a simple and fresh treat, not a meal, and that is exactly what they provide. And everything, from their wine glasses to the atmosphere truly resembles an authentic neopalitan pizzeria. I'm truly happy that we now have this place in Chicago, and that it is doing so well. And to everyone who loves the place but hates waiting (no reservation policy) or hates waiting while you stand shoulder to shoulder with 30 stranger, I hear they are expanding the restaurant.BRAVO!
