What do you do when you can't afford eating dinner at Sprout because you've spent it all at Girl and the Goat? Eat brunch. And what a delicious brunch it was because two words: BACON BUNS. Sweet, soft, Lithuanian buns filled with savory bacon. It is very fun and reminded me of an Asian BBQ Bun.  For entrees, we also got the Rabbit Hash with apples and Goat Benedict. My dining companion was a bit disappointed as she found an egg shell in her hash, but she proceeded to finish off her plate as the food brought very interesting textures and flavors together. I enjoyed the Lamb Benedict because it used peas in a new way I've never experienced -- instead of the usual English Muffin, they made a crunchy crispy pea croquette.   My dining experience here was nothing but spectacular -- our server was attentive (he even chased me down when I forgot some papers) and the staff here have a great sense of humor.
