Wow, thank you Yelp for all the great reviews and suggestions for this place! We went for our last dinner in Chicago and it was a FANTASTIC meal!!!! The service is OUTSTANDING and the prices are what you'd expect in a nicer Italian restaurant ($18-25 for pasta dishes). The pasta is also made in-house (according to our waiter) and you could tell it was fresh. I wanted to order the linguine vongole (linguine with clams) because the white wine garlic sauce sounded appetizing, but i told our waiter that i wasn't sure because I don't really like clams.. most of the time they're chewy and tough, ick. I told our waiter i really loved mussels so he offered to sub the clams for mussels. I was hoping he would catch on to what I was hinting at and was really happy when he did :) When my dish came out I was a little blown away... it was COVERED in mussels!!! As in.. a ridiculous amount of mussels! Haha it was AWESOME. I was so pleasantly surprised and by the end when I was stuffed, I was sad to see I had left about 1/3 of the mussels uneaten. I rallied my friends and asked them to help me eat them because they were SOOOO GOOD and plentiful, so of course they helped me lol. Everyone agreed the mussels were really good. My friends all enjoyed the dishes they ordered too--the portions were large and the pasta was soooo good! I love fresh pasta! The service here was EXCELLENT. I don't think my water glass ever got below half full.. there was always someone there refilling my glass without me asking, which i LOVE. Nice staff + warm bread + amazing seafood pasta = HAPPY HAPPY CUSTOMER!! The damage for my portion was not exactly pocket change.. shared bottle of wine, linguine with mussels ($22), tax + tip.. total came out to $46. A little steep for Italian but I was so happy with everything (taste, quality, service) I didn't mind. And I definitely wouldn't mind going back to this place if I'm ever in Chicago again :)
