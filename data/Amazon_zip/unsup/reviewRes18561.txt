Ok, so I've gone to XOCO a handful of times since I've moved to Chicago and I absolutely love this place. If you're planning on going to XOCO for lunch, make sure you bring your patience with you because there will definitely be a long line. The good thing is that it moves fast, but sometimes not fast enough (come on...they're cooking the food right in front of you!).  So once you've moved up towards the front and it's your turn to order, I highly recommend one of their fountain drinks - tons of flavour and extremely fresh tasting. I've tried several dishes and my favorite thus far is the Cubana torta. Holy sh*t, just thinking about it right now makes me want one in my mouth. The crunchy bread, tender meat, and chipotle salsa make it sooo good. Oh, and the goat barbacoa (Saturday special) is amazing too. After your meal, give the chocolate espresso a try. It's a little rich but the two flavours really compliment each other. Their desert is top notch too - everything from their cookies to churros rock my world. Ok, time to get your butts off Yelp and head over to XOCO for some awesome food. See ya there!
