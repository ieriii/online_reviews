Hell yeah Whoopski dawg! I didn't even know that place was a restaurant until I was in my late teens. I think the appeal to the place does more for me than the food. I like the old fashioned...everything there. I mean you have to appreciate any place with two mammoth sized weiners on your restaurant, one wearing a loin cloth. I'll bite that dog in the face.  love the green pickled tomatoes. Food is pretty good except they really should give you some wetnaps.
