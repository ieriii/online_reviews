My favorite hotel in Chicago. Why? First and foremost, the staff is outstanding. They are so friendly and helpful. Reggie, the Bell Captain, has been there for years to welcome you to the hotel. Second, is location. You can take take the blue line to/from O'hare and the hotel is a mere 2 blocks away from the station. They are also close to 2 "L" line stations, and the red line. Third is the complimentary nightly wine reception. This is a great way to start your evening and I always meet interesting people. Fourth is the decor and history behind this hotel. Ask to stay on one of the historic floors (7 and above) for a truly unique experience. But again, it is the staff at this hotel which make it exceptional!
