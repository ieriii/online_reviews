I'm a huge fan of their deep dish pizza, especially the crust. I love their Italian sausage and pepperoni pizza, and they are generous with their toppings. I usually order extra sauce because it can be a bit dry for me. I've had an instance in the past where we received a totally different pizza than we ordered. After calling them up, they extended us a refund for $15 on the next pizza order- without having to return the pizza. Good service and delivery can be quick! Reason for 4 stars? Their pizza isn't always very consistent (I swear the crust changes every time) and their prices are quite high.  Hey, it can't be that bad...I keep coming back for more!
