I love this place, im not fond of the wait but it is a popular vegan hangout. the food is awsome I only wish there where more options for sandwiches. Like a vegan gordon blue or vegan parmesan chicken sandwich. maybe a vegan gumbo to for those cold night you want something hearty. but I love the food I have eaten when i was there. the seitan geyro and sweet potato fries hit the spot and there disserts are to die for.
