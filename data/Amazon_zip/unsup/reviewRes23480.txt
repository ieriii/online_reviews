Yummy! I second, third, and fourth the comments about there being a way long wait, though. The good news? The food was well worth the wait! The bad news? I had almost filled up on chips and was half in the bag from finishing half a bottle of wine (YAY, BYOB!!) before my food ever got there... This place is always packed, so you know it's good when you roll up on a Tuesday night and can't get a seat for 30 minutes! Chorizo burrito - delicious. (Ok, who am I kidding, chorizo with anything is delicious.) The absolute best thing about eating here? Lizano sauce!! I fell in love with this in Costa Rica, and was able to get a bottle of it home, but haven't seen it anywhere again until here. PUT IT ON EVERYTHING! :)
