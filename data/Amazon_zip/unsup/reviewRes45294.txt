The atmosphere alone does it for me with this place. I've have never been to a restaurant as comfortable and inviting as Wilde. I love everything about the decor, the dim lighting, the dark wood, the books everywhere (and I don't even read novels). The service I've had both times was good, I didn't experience what others did. We got enough attention and were pleased with the wait staff. The drink menu is great and the back bar is a great addition. Both times I've been here, I was the first one to arrive and gladly went to the back bar and had a drink while the rest of the party showed. The food is awesome too! I usually don't go for overly rich foods at restaurants because I want to try a bunch of different things, but we couldn't resist the chicken pot pie, the roast half chicken, and also the shepard's pie! All were done really well and we had leftovers of the chicken! I believe we also have tried the apple crumble with vanilla ice cream (delicious!!) and the chocolate brownie or chocolate cake. We were all very happy with the experience and can't wait to go back. I can't say enough positive things about this place. :)
