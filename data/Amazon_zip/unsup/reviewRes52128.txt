Wow, is this place good!! It was my first time coming to Chicago and having real deep-dish style pizza, but I was really impressed and surprised by the pie we had. My group got a large pie, half cheese and tomato sauce, half sausage and pepperoni. I didn't try the meat side, but the cheese/tomato side was amazing! I'm more used to eating thin crust pizza since I live in New York, but this was a total 180 from thin crust -- you can't even pick this up and eat it; you need a fork and knife! The surprising part about the pizza is that the tomato sauce is actually on top of the cheese, which makes the top part look very thick and saucy. The cheese itself looked and tasted like fresh mozzarella -- everything complemented each other beautifully. The crust had a cornmeal bottom and was also pretty darn satisfying. The pizza's a little on the pricey side, but I think that's worth it. The next time I come back to Chicago, I'm definitely stopping by here again.
