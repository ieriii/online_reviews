First, I must say that we've had many nice dinner here. I don't normally write reviews, but I was so appalled at my experience tonight that I feel the need to provide some constructive criticism. No disrespect to the chefs, or the other clientele, but the snotty service leaves so much to be desired.  Our waitress, Cris, needs some serious coaching. While she did an average job through our diner service, she made a whopping faux paux that has convinced us to seek out more service oriented establishments. We were on a double date, and my wife and I were leaving the tip -- you know how these things go. We rounded to the nearest quarter leaving an average tip (for our average service). What happened next ruined the experience for the whole evening. Our waitress inquired about problems with the service to which we replied that there were no "problems." When she then commented that our tip was less than 15% and that was why she was asking.  Turns out, by my quick mental math, I left 14.9%. Shame on me, but the difference between that and 15% was less than $0.20. Was it really worth embarrassing me in front of my wife and friend over $0.20? To potentially loosing a somewhat regular customer? There are many more tactful ways to seek out feedback. Suggesting that someone is cheap in front of their friends (esp. over a rounding error) is not the path to providing better customer service. Cris, my guess is that you had an off night, but don't expect another opportunity from us to redeem yourself.
