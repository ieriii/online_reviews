I just thought it was okay. A friend and I went on a Friday Night and its was crowded with no real waiting area so we sorta hovered over diners until we were seated after a few minutes of waiting. Narrow seating is typical in many chicago restaurants but the bar in the main room made it feel smaller. While the prices seemed slightly higher than the location or the food dictated. Basil Chicken and it was just okay. Drinks from the bar get a thimbs up. But considering all the Thai choices in the area., I confess, I was a little disappointed. Won't be going back any time soon.
