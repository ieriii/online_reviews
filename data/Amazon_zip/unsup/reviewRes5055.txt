Have a plan to kill some time, because a two hour wait is not uncommon. They will call and give you 10 min, if you want a drink somewhere else. Pigs ears, pig tails both very good. The neck bone gravy was just okay, tasted like meaty pasta sauce. Charcuterie plate was very good and deserts were surprisingly tasty. Worth the wait.
