We stopped in here last nite for dinner, and there's not much that I didn't like. The restaurant was full, but we were able to sit immediately (granted it was a Monday evening). We shared the pear salad to start which was a simple light way to start our meal. I then had the scallops & oxtail (I agree with other reviews that the amount of oxtail was lacking) and the hubby ate the boar sloppy joe (Yum!).  So, yes...I agree that the portions for some of the dishes seemed scanty...but it also left room for dessert (creme brulee and chocolate lava cake) so I can't complain about that! Our service was attentive, and the thing I disliked the most was probably the couple sitting next to us that were talking way too loud for being so close. We'll be back!
