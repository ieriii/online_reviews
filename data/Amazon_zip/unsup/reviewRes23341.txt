This is probably one of the best Szechuan restaurants in the states as far as I can tell. Really - they will (and do) make actual Chinese food here.  The menu is pretty large and the (of course) do Chinese Hot Pot which will help you survive the most brutal of Chicago winters. But here's the deal. Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) is good here, but there are four things which are phenominal.  1) Dry Chili Chicken 2) Salt and Pepper Lamb 3) Ma Po Do Fu 4) Stir fried Sting Beans The food is just packed with layers of flavor and texture and plenty of Szechuan heat. It's really the only place to get Chinese in Chitown. Oh, and they will take a reservation for 6 or more. Or (and I've never participated in this evil action) you can just go upstairs (from the outside of the strip mall) and say they sent you up to expedite your seating. But, like I said, (ahem) I've only heard of that being done.
