I'm teetering between two and three stars because my last experience there was horrible. The first time I went, the food was delicious and almost too spicy. (I'm one of those people for whom very few things are too spicy to eat.) We were seated in a timely manner for a Friday night. The bill was reasonable. My only beef was that my red wine came chilled. I went back after raving about it to some friends. The menu was, as always, overwhelming. I ordered a glass of red wine and was served instead plum wine. I shrugged it off. We were waiting for a fourth to join us, but she was going to be very late, so I was authorized to order for her. I told the guy who seated us this. We still had to flag down someone to take our food order. Then, whenever we needed anything, we had to flag someone down. No one checked on, despite walking past us many, many times. I'll give it another go, simply because the food is that good. The Vegetarian Chicken Shanghai Style is delicious and I love the Ma Po Tofu.
