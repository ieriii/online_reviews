Another place with long lines even though it's suppose to after lunch hours...why is everyone still here? Go back to work or shopping! Since we couldnt get into frontera grill, we decided to check this place out. The guacamole and chips, especially the chips are to die for!  so good... the tortes are ver tasty and you can't go wrong. we had the choriqueso, pepito and ahogada... So yummy ....it's not your everyday Mexican food. It's Mexican food with a tasty twist.
