People like to eat pho in Tank are dumb, sorry I shouldn't say that, but that actual how I feel. I was dumb too, before. 1/ Tank is small, need to wait or share table. 2/ Tank is dirty from the table, floor, servers talking load on your bowl when they serving. 3/ Food from Tank has higher price but it just ok, many other restuarant near by have better pho cost cheaper.
