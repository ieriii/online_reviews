i don't particularly like pizza, but i love piece. fantastic local brewpub who just got it right. good music, hip crowd, ALWAYS a crowd...most of the time the staff is nice, but every once in awhile you can tell they're pretty peeved with the crowds. be prepared to deal with all kinds of people when you walk in here! salads are great, surprisingly. pizzas are not small. if you can't deal with the pressure of making your own, i always let the waiters choose for me. be adventurous a bit! beer is solid, i'm a fan of the cap'n kick ass ipa, but the others are pretty standard ales. it's a fun sports bar on a weeknight, but stay away on weekends. my trick: $25 lg pizza and a growler sundays. we hop in, order our pizza and belly up to the bar for a pint or two. then we leave the craze and enjoy our pizza in peace.
