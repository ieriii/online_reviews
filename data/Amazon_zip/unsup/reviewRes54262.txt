I came here about 3 times and it was always a failure. One time I came here on a Saturday night with a couple of my girl friends. In total we were three people who waited 3 effin hours to get a table! The host let 5 other couples in front of us and then ended up sitting us at a table meant for 2 people and put an extra chair there. I mean he should have done that in the first place. I do not understand what the fuss is all about the only good thing here is the horchata. If you want real central american/Caribbean food I suggest you go somewhere else.
