I will start off by saying that I am not a vegetarian by any means. I love my hamburgers, ribs, seafood and more! However, the Chicago Diner is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. The service is fantastic, the food is always so fresh and so tasty, the atmosphere is great and if you like hazelnut coffee you MUST try theirs. I usually hate flavored coffees cuz I never taste the flavor they say they are, but whatever they're doing here, it's working. I hope that if you are not a vegetarian like myself will you at least try this place out because it is well worth your money. My only complaint would be that I wish it was slightly bigger in order to accommodate the amount of people that show up. PS I totally tried the thanksgiving meal here this past year- better than what I would have made and I consider myself a great cook!
