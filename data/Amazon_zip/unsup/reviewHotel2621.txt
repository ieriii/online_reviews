I stayed at The James Hotel during a recent weekend trip to Chicago and loved everything about the hotel. First, the location was perfect -- walking distance to almost everything or a short cab ride. Second, service was excellent -- everyone from the bell hop at the door to the associate at the check in counter to the concierge was really friendly and helpful. Third, I really liked the overall feel and decor of the hotel. The room itself was small but clean, cozy and comfy. The furniture is modern and the bed was perfect. The hotel also provides its own bottled filtered water in each of the rooms and free wifi throughout its premises. Note that they no longer provide Kheil's bathroom products.  I highly recommend The James Hotel and would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Chicago.
