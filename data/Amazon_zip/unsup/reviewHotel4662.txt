Refreshingly modern, eco-friendly, very clean, phenomenal service! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights, and we agree with the previous reviews of how great it is. On top of those points, we actually only paid $89/night - a deal we got on Priceline. For that price, the stay in this boutique hotel was a steal :) (+) modern and fresh decor (+) wonderful service from the doorman to the cleaning staff (+) comfortable beds (+) nice flatscreen t.v. (+) bathroom was as expected, compact/fast/powerful hair dryer (+) great location (-) small square footage space but not uncomfortable - we figured its tight just because its a high rise in downtown chicago We would surely come back again!
