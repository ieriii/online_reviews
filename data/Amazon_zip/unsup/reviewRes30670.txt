Finally! A breakfast place in Chicago I'm proud of!! I came here after a heavy night of drinking. I was in need of some food and fast! There was ample street parking close to the door.  My first impression was bright, clean and very "magnolia bakery" like complete with white wainscoting and all. We were greeted promptly and politely. The waiter was thorough in explaining the menu and quite proud to point out Diners, Drive in's and Dives had recently featured them in an episode, which they later played for us at the end of our visit. So cute :) I ordered the huevos rancheros and was so glad I did. It came with a crispy tortilla smothered with cheese, black beans, onions and avocado's that absolutely hit the spot. Did I mention it was smothered with the most amazing poblano cream I have ever tasted? Wow. I was absolutely blown away and everything is made with organic ingredients.  Thank you Nana's for actually taking the time to make a difference in the breakfast community of Chicago's choices of restaurants. Thank you! You are number one in my book!!!
