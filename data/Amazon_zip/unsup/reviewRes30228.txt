Food is good here, but not over the top good, so I would suggest coming here for the atmosphere and to people watch. As one reviewer put it, it's sort of a "hipster" hangout. Dinner came out to $300 for 4 people. Lots of beautiful people and well-dressed people here, so definitely dress to impress before you step foot in here. They have a few communal tables, a large sushi bar, a small lounge area, and sit down tables. We sat at the communal tables and the experience was not as bad as I was expecting. The place was pretty loud anyway, so your neighbors don't really distract your dining experience. We ordered a variety of apps, rolls, buns, and entrees to share between the four of us. Food is certainly tastey, but the fundamental recipe are mostly based on food you can get from Chinatown or Thai restaurants for a small fraction of the high price they charge here. Don't get me wrong, I think they certainly use good ingredients and the presentation is above average (note - not great as I would expect for this price), but as anyone who really know AUTHENTIC Chinese & Thai food can instantly recognize, it's a $10 plate dressed up as a $25 plate because you're in a hip place. That's to be expected of course...food is not disappointing, but that's not why you would come here.
