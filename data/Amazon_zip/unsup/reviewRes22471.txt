Oh good golly, my heart truly skipped a beat after tasting that chifrijo and patacones. Imagine this, lechon (little bites of roasted pig) mixed with beans, tomatoes, and avocadoes served over rice. Each savory bite shoveled into an un-deserving yet eager mouth with delicious patacones. We were certainly head over heels and we had only just begun! Irazu is very popular so they can be packed. Our server had tons of personality and helped bide the time it took for our meal to come out. Unfortunately, we had maxed on appetizers and chips that we had to take our entrees to go. They were still excellent as leftovers, but I am not a fan of reviewing leftovers - I think it's a dis-service to the restaurant. We've ordered for pick up since and have yet to be disappointed. I can't wait for the next excuse to stop in.
