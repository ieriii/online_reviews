hands down, best specialty dogs in the chi.. everyday that theyre open, hot doug (the actual owner) takes your order and makes you feel extremely welcome. every dog is prepared with the utmost love and care that you can taste with every single bite. (celebrity sausage and game of the week are usually the way to go) weekends have duck fat fries, which i havent noticed a difference between regular fries, but theyre also prepared with deep fried goodness :) the only negative would be the line...you can never tell when the line is going to be around the block or jus a few ppl in the front door, but theres always a line..cash only too. this is a must stop when coming to the chi!
