I liked almost everything about this place. The brick-colored Chicago feel, the awesome beer selection, the young, vibrant crowd, the flat screen TVs. Yes, I liked everything about this place except for the pizza. The tomatoes were flavorless, the crust was more like a pie crust than a pizza crust, the cheese was along the same lines. The only thing that I could taste was the sausage, and even that was a little weak. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time here. But I had to continue my search for good Chicago pizza. I kind of want my 2500 calories back.
