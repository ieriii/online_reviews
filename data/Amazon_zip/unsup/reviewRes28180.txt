My brother came into town and wanted to experience some great pizza places he heard about online. So we picked up a deep dish pie from here on new years. I would compare the pizza we got to a Stouffer's frozen french bread pizza. Lots of crispy bread and not much else. They do caramelize cheese around the crust which is nice but I won't be back. Maybe the thin is better?
