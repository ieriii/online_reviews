Went here for a belated birthday lunch with my brother and his wife. Not bad! I got the chicken and steak combination for $12. The food came quick! A LOTTTT of food so I had to take them to go. The taste? It seemed a little bland but nothing that salt and pepper can't fix! Service was great except for the fact that they didn't seem happy. Overall OK experience.
