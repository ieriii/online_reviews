Beers were just alright. Bacon fat popcorn was good. Burger was very good if not great. Overall only problem that I have is that it took about 30 minutes to get our food out on a Monday at about 2 pm. Also be prepared for about a half dozen guys sitting around the bar with thick black rimmed glasses, scruffy beards, and stocking hats on. It must be something they put in the beer to attract them all!
