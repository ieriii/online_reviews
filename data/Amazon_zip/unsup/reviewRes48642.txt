The trite version: Fantastic beer list. Excellent food. Outstanding service. *Difficult for parties over 4 people.* Beer List + Good Food seem to be mutually exclusive in Chicago. This place has both in a trendy environment. The main room is very live, though, and you'll find it hard to converse without speaking up considerably. My only gripe is that we stood and stood and stood waiting for a table and finally gave up after 2 and a half hours. This wasn't really anyone's fault, as Publican is a popular place, we were there on an early Friday night, and our party had 8 people in it. The manager was very polite and apologetic, comped us a few appetizers, and gave me her card for next time. I'll definitely try this place again, but I'll make sure there are four or fewer of us next time. The booths along the wall look perfect for two couples, and that's where I think the best experience might be had. While it won't necessarily replace anything in your beer joint repertoire, Publican is worth adding to your rotation just for it's atmosphere and feel. It's truly different.
