Before I moved away, my friends and I had a running gag to try to get the craziest cakes made here (See Jill L.'s post for more examples). Yes, they were mad expensive. And sometimes they didn't even taste *that* good. But, man, did they look bitchin'. I was particularly moved by the "You're Adopted!" birthday cake that was made for my dude's birthday (see pics). Nice work, Alliance.
