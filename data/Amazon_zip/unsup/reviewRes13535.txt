So glad to have this place within walking distance of my humble abode. This has become the go-to brunch spot for me, although I have also been for dinner a couple of times. Burgers are definitely a highlight, and the pizzas and salads are tasty. I tried the bacon popcorn and it was yummy, but not really any greater than the sum of it's parts. I have an air popcorn popper at home, I could duplicate that and it would be just as good and a fraction of the cost. But I'm sure it makes a pretty good bar nosh when paired with one of their house brews. On to brunch. Hardly ever a wait because there are so many tables in there. Service is prompt and friendly, coffee is better than average and refills are plentiful. Brunch menu is small but solid. Items of note are the biscuits and pancetta gravy, and the porkbelly sandwich. Biscuits are housemade, and topped with peppery, salty, perfectly creamy gravy, an egg, and they even throw in some pieces of bacon for you! Hard to go wrong with pork belly, but the sandwich has fresh greens, tomatoes, egg over easy, and the bun is fresh and soft. Breakfast potatoes aren't really that exciting, so ask to sub for fries and you won't be disappointed. Other notable items include the breakfast pizza which is tasty and can large enough for two meals if you're not starving, and the eggs in a hole with the beer cheese soup. Yum.
