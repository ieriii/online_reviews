Maybe Im just not a W person. I arrived at about 11pm since my flight was delayed, and when I entered the hotel, I thought I must have come through the wrong door, seeing only couches and people sipping trendy martinis. I walked back outside and asked the bellman where the main entrance was, and he informed me that the "lounge" in front of me was actually the main lobby, and that the front desk is back in the corner (FACT: if a front desk is back in a corner....its not a front desk!) Anyways, we navigated out way (with our suitcases) through a maze of couches and cosmo-sippers to the "corner desk" and finally made it to our room. I guess I'm just an old fart, but I thought it was a little too trendy. Like, why do I need lights eminating from under the bed? And why do I need inspirational phrases on the pillows & walls? Just give me a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. Bathroom was TINY, and the toilet was wedged between the sink and the wall with very little room to sit comfortably while you do your business. Also, can someone please tell me WHY hotel TVs are so weird? Why cant you just change the channel without having to press the button 5 times? and why does it go back to the stupid hotel channel that nobody watches every time you turn it off & on again? So frustrating! Minus 1 star! I will say that the service we experienced was good, all the staff we encountered from the desk clerks, to the bellmen, etc were very nice and accomodating. Unfortunately, that wasnt enough to save the hotel. I loved Chicago and will return, but not to this hotel.
