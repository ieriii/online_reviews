Requods is the best! The food, service and experience are just great.  First and most importantly the pizza is deep, caramelized and flavorful. It's a little different from other Chicago deep dish pizzas but I'm telling you it's a great variation. Appetizer s are all good. Service is always friendly and attentive. Lots of hotties working here.  I like the atmosphere. Standard pizza joint I guess but that works great for me. Good bar and lots of TVs. Sports always on. The owner is a hockey nut. Hawks are always on. He is the kind of guy that will sit down with you and make friends and in a short time it feels like you have been coming here for years. Have you figured out what that thing is on the fish logo. Some of the wait staff might not know the whole story but we finally got it from our friend. You'll know you got the true story when you can't stop laughing. It's a thong and I'll say no more. You know it had to be something if they put it on their logo. Get the story from them.
