I'm lucky. I moved in to an apartment down the street from Chicago q. As I was setting up my furniture I looked out the window and saw the q sign. It was getting hungry and didn't know the neighborhood yet so I ended up at q. I'm happy I did. Immediately upon walking into the restaurant, I felt welcomed and at home. This is a great place for groups and families. The dining room accommodates large parties and the much of the menu is fantastic for sharing.  I absolutely love the pickles and freshly fried potato chips you get upon sitting down. So yummy. I often get full off of these before my real food arrives. I also love their drink menu, especially their whiskey flights.  I've been here enough times that I've tried a big portion of their menu. So far I have yet to be disappointed. Of course I would recommend getting some bbq- smoked chicken, pulled pork, or ribs- they are all good. And if you can't decide, you should get the bbq flight appetizer. I had that on my first visit with my boyfriend and it was delicious. Oh, and the cornbread. I love carbs. I prefer the savory poblano cheddar cornbread over the honey butter one they normally serve you. Be sure to ask for the poblano one instead, or try to ask for both!
