Cheese, Swine, and Wine, oh my! What's not to love about a place that incorporates the 3 things that are proof that God loves us? 'Cheese, Swine and Wine' actually is their tag line for real, so they won me over before we even walked in. A magnificent little spot right on the mile of magnificence, with an impressive wine list and a very creative and curious menu. We were looking for somewhere to grab a drink on a recent visit and because I can be simple- all I needed was to see purple and pig in the same sentence. We decided to come here around 5 in the afternoon to meet up with a friend- but apparently we weren't the only ones with that brilliant idea. It's not terribly big inside so there was a bit of a wait for a table, but the hostess was very nice and had us to go in and order a bottle (ok, two bottles) of wine which we then were able to sit outside and drink while we waited. Either there were holes in the bottles or we drank fast, but we were finally seated under the purple awning on the little patio type situation outside. Just a heads up, seating is family style (and more than likely this won't be your family, but go with it).  And then came more wine...and food. Delicious cheeses and the smears were delish (I forget which ones we tried, see aforementioned wine-while-we-waited). Overall a fun experience.....obviously not so much for the not so swine-inclined, but we thoroughly enjoyed it.
