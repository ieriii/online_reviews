Some things are no-brainers. Gino's East on Superior is awesome. These guys know how to run a pizza palace! The personal pan pizzas are terrific and filling. The lunch special cannot be beat. Even with Chicago's exorbitant sales taxes, the price is under $7 for a pizza, soup or salad, and refillable beverage. There are several sections to this palace:the "to go" area is where you pay at a counter and then sit at any of a good dozen tables (this is where you get the lunch special - which ends at 2pm); the bar is a big solid bar maned by smart / personable staff and offering a lot of tasty beers; upstairs area is for server-served dining in. I haven't been upstairs other than for the bathroom. But everything I've seen and experienced about this place so far in two lunch visits tells me that I likey very very much. I could definitely watch an entire hockey or football game here. A note on the atmosphere: It's true that this location is squeaky clean even though it famously lets you write on the walls and encourages such with playful signs. There is an air of Bob Costas-type inauthenticity; you feel not so much that you are in a legendary, decades-old pizzeria than that you are on the set of a movie about a pizza place. But we shouldn't penalize Gino's for this fake stab at being a dive bar. We're here to eat. A lot of dive bars I've been at have been all too authentic... but the food... well the food has to be brought in. Think of Gino's on Superior as a theme park with an affordable concession stand selling delicious food. Let's face it: it would be difficult to NOT give Gino's 5 stars. And I'm aware that it is such a highly regarded, popular establishment, that it doesn't need our glowing reviews. The truth is, it is we that need Gino's East on Superior.
