All was promising as we stood at the bar and waited for a table. The margaritas certainly aren't weak, but they aren't too cheap either. The front dining room was nice, people were having good time (us included) at an appropriate noise level. Little did we know there is a back room, which is is where we were led when a table opened up. I don't know if it was the high ceiling, the three birthday parties, or not having music to set the noise standard but the sound level had reached utter anarchy. They say when you loose one of your senses, another is heightened; I would say the exact opposite happened there in the back room. As for the food it was average mexican fare (or was my ability to taste impeded by hearing "happy birthday" shouted 4 different times-one table sang it twice...to the same person). I would go back, for half price margaritas, on the condition that I can sit in the front room and that "Gravy" and his cronies are not there celebrating.
