This was a great hotel. Service and amenities were excellent. Parking was reasonably priced. The location was fine - didn't feel at all unsafe, but we were glad we had our car because there weren't many good restaurants within walking distance. We got a really good rate on Priceline, which made our stay seem that much better. Highly recommended.
