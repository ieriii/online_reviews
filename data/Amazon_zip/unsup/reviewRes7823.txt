I was here a couple times - the first time the pizza was decently good*. The second time, the pizza was soggy and not notable in the slightest.  *(Though my friend was dismayed when her arugula pizza turned out to be IDENTICAL to her mediocre salad appetizer, except with a crust underneath. The server gave her no warning either!) I will say, however, that the zabaglione (Italian dessert custard made with marsala) is one of the best things I have ever eaten.
