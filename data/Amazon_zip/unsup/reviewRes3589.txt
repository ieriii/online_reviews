It was good! Hahaha yeah I actually enjoyed this fast-food fusion korean place. I got the chi-town chicken burrito w/ organic rice. It came out to $9. The flour tortilla was filled with corn, lettuce, chicken, cherry tomatoes and some sort of dressing. I got "spicy" thinking I could handle it being korean and all, but even I was panting after a couple of bites. My friend got the crisp bbq chicken wings which were salty but tasty. The half order gives your 4-5 large pieces of chicken. From the looks of it, it looked like cage free chickens, b/c they were absolutely huge. The original buddha boy aka bibimbop wasn't that great. When I feel like a twist on korean food and don't want to drive up north, I'll probably be back.
