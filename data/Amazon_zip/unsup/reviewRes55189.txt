$50 a plate, and I've been here several times, and the dinner just gets better and better every time.The only disappointing thing was the salad bar. People rant and rave about their salad bar, but I was not impressed at all. It's not as big as people claim it to be and not a ton of options. Don't get me wrong, they have things you've probably never put on your salad before, but not my style.The endless amount of meet that they come around with is mouth watering. Great steakhouse, and can't wait to go back!
