I am a fan of Middle eastern food thanks to Pita Inn. I wanted to try out a Persian restaurant this time and I have heard of Noon O Kabab. I found out there is a difference between Persian and Middle eastern food. The food was awesome. I ordered a skewer of chicken and kabaab. The hummus was good as well. I would definitely come back here when I am in the mood for some Persian cuisine.
