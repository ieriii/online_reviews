Most disappointing service I've ever had. And I have been eating in this city my entire life. On yelp it said they take reservations, but when we called we were told no. We tried calling ahead right before we left and were told that the wait was only 20 min. When we arrived we were told to wait in the crowded bar where there was nowhere to really even stand. Though it is BYOB they wouldn't allow us to open our bottle in the bar. After nearly 2 hours, we were seated by an attendant who was not cordial. They informed us that though they were BYOB, this applied only to wine and beer, and were not concerned with what online information said.  As for the food, I can't say anything exciting about it. BUT the service destroyed any hope.
