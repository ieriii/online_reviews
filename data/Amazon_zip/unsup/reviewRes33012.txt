Great food and fantastic service! This was my first time trying Yolk after it has been recommended to me multiple times and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Sunday morning was quite busy and we were told to expect a wait of 45 minutes for 3 people, but they got us in after about 20 minutes. Our waitress was very helpful, polite and attentive. My brother ordered the eggs Benedict which are supposedly the best in the city, he said they were good but nothing too special. I really enjoyed their Huevos Rancheros; all the ingredients tasted fresh and the portions were huge! They even let me substitute in more expensive ingredients (avocado) for free. I would definitely recommend their homemade strawberry orange juice too. Overall, it's excellent food and surprisingly good service for such a busy place.
