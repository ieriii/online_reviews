My husband wanted to take me out to breakfast for my birthday and we decided to give Meli a try. We drive by it all the time and always seem to see people waiting, so we figured it was good. On a Saturday morning at 9:30 am we probably waited around 10 minutes which was fine.  I really wanted to order one of their fresh juices but I looked at the menu and they were all so expensive, so I passed. I ended up ordering the basil omelet..and it was really good! My hubby ordered the horseradish omelet which he liked, but liked the basil omelet more.  Next time we go back I am definitely trying a sweet dish! The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the service....just saying it could have been better.
