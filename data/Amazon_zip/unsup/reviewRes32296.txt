I should preface this by saying that I AM a long-time vegan and a New Yorker (who was living in Chicago for four years), so I'm pretty spoiled with the wide selection of vegan places in NY. I have had great meals at this place (the lasagna, empanadas, and buffalo wings come to mind). And yummy vegan milkshakes. I've also had pretty mediocre meals and a few meals that were definitely overpriced. Whenever I come with non-vegetarians though, they, interestingly, LOVE it. My dad who has been kosher for years definitely enjoys the bacon cheeseburgers. The decor is cute and the service has been great (though I've almost always had to wait a while to get a table).  If you simply want old fashioned junk food though (turned vegan), I recommend going to Veggie Bite instead. Their food is healthy--never fried--and you can get things like "chicken" burgers, fries, and milkshakes for much cheaper. But as far as vegan restaurants in Chicago go, it's pretty tasty and good when you feel like dining out.
