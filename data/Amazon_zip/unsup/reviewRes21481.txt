I wasn't blown away by the veggie enchiladas I ordered... but they were very good. I wasn't drinking, but everyone at my table was slurping up their margaritas very quickly (strawberry, and then mango).   Good: The service here was excellent and friendly with a good number of vegetarian options.  Bad:  The dining room was REALLY loud -- and their outdoor seating was minimal :(
