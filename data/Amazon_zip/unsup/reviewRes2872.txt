Tru was a memorable dining experience, but I think I was expecting more. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. My husband and I ate here for our two-year anniversary. The service was impeccable and decor was beautiful. Every course was put together with painstaking effort-- I felt like every plate was a delicate work of art. My husband ordered the venison and I ordered the ribeye. The presentation and plating were more memorable than the taste of the food. The best part of the meal were the desserts. Gale Gand is absolutely brilliant. We tried the semifreddo and the chocolate bar and both were outstanding. Coupled with the candy cart and a perfectly wrapped pastry to go, it was a great way to end the meal. I took a star away because I wanted a course or two that absolutely blew me away as far as taste...a plate that completely surprises you. I didn't get that at Tru unfortunately, and when you're paying premium dollar, I expect to get it.
