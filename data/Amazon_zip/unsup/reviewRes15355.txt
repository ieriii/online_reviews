I have to admit it- I'm totally a sucker for the "secret bar" spiff! Hidden behind a strange mural (that I am told changes in design), the bar is indicated with a single light. They probably do this so those who know about feel super cool & important...and yeah it works. The whole place is about the mystique and the ambiance. The space is divided up into sections with heavy drapery & high-walled booths. It is super dark with no windows to speak of and the candlelight gives it the exact feeling i am sure the owners were intending.  The drinks are all made with strange ingredients and weird combinations but are all AMAZING (and strong!). Get the Romeo & Juliet made with Rose Water or something? Anyway- great spot for a date or the start to the night.
