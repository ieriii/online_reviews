I've been to several of these, and this one is very good. Sometimes pretty busy and hard to get into a table, but once you're sat the service is good and the food is always consistent. Portions are kind of large though, and some of the dishes are questionable. But if you order caramel chicken you kind of deserve that taste in your mouth. They will try to get you to order their baked desserts that take 30 minutes but save time and money and get the strawberry shortcake. Its made with shortbread cookies with crystalized sugar (think those blue cans of danish cookies at Christmas) and is out of this world.
