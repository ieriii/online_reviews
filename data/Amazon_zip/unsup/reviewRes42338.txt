My first experience with Pho and I'm a fan. I had the spring rolls with shrimp which were very good. Then I had #43 which was the pho with sliced beef and skirt flank. The bowl of pho was HUGE; I only finished half. To top off the meal, I had the pineapple smoothie... amazing. I also tasted the green tea smoothie, which was good. We were seated quickly and the waiter was friendly. I have a feeling I'll return again soon now that the weather is getting colder.
