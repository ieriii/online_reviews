Gonna keep this review simple. - massive amount of side dishes which you can keep asking for more - charcoal grill! - you come out smelling like bbq which is the way it's suppose to be - good value for the money This place is a gem. Aside from the fact that it's in the middle of nowhere (umm...closest is ravenswood metra, really?). Parking lot is a bitch...it's so small...needs some serious skills to park there. The food tastes awesome. It depends a bit on your grilling skills but if you know what you're doing, it's wonderful.
