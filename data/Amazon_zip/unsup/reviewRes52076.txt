This was another item on my must-have-while-in-Chicago list. I have to say, it lived up to the hype. We ordered a large deep dish supreme which normally comes with either sausage or pepperoni but we sprung for both. It was the perfect amount for four people - two slices a piece. The crust was a nice mix of flaky and chewy. I'm not sure how that is possible but Gino's managed to pull it off. The toppings, sauce and cheese were all high quality and very good. We each ordered a house salad which came out family style and was your typical Italian restaurant salad - lots of croutons, sliced black olives, onions and tomatoes with your choice of dressing. That happens to be my favorite salad (except the tomato part) so I was quite happy. For some reason we also ordered the toasted ravioli AND the mozzarella sticks. I think I ate more cheese in this one meal than I have in the past three months! The raviolis were nothing special but the mozzarella sticks were the best I've ever had. Both orders were huge and came with marinara sauce for dipping. This would have been a five star review if it wasn't for our server. He obviously didn't want to be there. We rarely saw him and when we did, he had the personality of cardboard. We had to track him down to get refills and when my friend asked where the restroom was, our waiter ignored him. I wish the guy who brought our pizza to the table had been our waiter - he was friendly and engaging while he plated up our first slice. Promote that guy.
