This is the best bar in Chicago to hear live jazz, period. When the music starts, you have to shut your yap and listen or you get asked to leave. This makes for a much better listening environment than any other bar in my experience. The Green Mill traces its roots back to the prohibition era or before which makes the atmosphere of the bar really cool. It's a beautiful place. My kind of bar in "My kind of town".
