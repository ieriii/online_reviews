I still love them and all of their awesome food, but this time their Porchetta was a little off. Something was missing in the ingredient or something.  But Vinnie Chase and the rest of the wait staff were very accommodating and took it away from us no problem and took it out of the bill. Very good service. 99% of the time, exceptional food. Awesome beer selection and recommendations. Parking still sucks though :(
