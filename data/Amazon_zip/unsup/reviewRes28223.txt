My husband and I had an incredible experinece at Frontera. Not sure what took us so darn long to try it... We were in the city one day looking around the Merchandise Mart. We then decided to walk around a bit. I popped inside to ask about reservations (yeah, I was pretty clueless). It was right after lunch and the lady was super nice explaining to me that they accept a very limited number of res's. She told me what we had to do... get there early... about a half hour before opening and get in line. The trick is to be part of the first seating....well... that is exactly what we did. We were the first one's through the door and sat. We ordered a sampling. The chicken mole, the jicama salad, and this little cazuela with the most delicious carnitas I've ever tried. We finished the meal with this duo of mexican flan. I'm a sucker for any sort of custard... panna cotta, flan, crema caramel, etc... These were amazing. One was made with Mexican vanilla and the other with lavender. There aren't words in this language that can help me explain how sublime these flan were. Overall, it was an incredible meal. We waited about 45 min prior to the doors opening and it was worth it. The bill came to under $50 but we didn't order any alcohol.
