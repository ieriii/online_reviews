One star because I had to and I'm sure the pizza is great but we never got to have any. Gave us some LAME excuse about The ticket not printing. Basically she forgot to put in our order. Pizza takes easily 30 mins and they asked if we wanted to wait, after we'd been there an hour. We walked out very dramatically! Lol we'll do Gino's East tomorrow!
