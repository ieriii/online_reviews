this place is heaven. best Vietnamese food I've had in Chicago. pho with brisk is delightful with a rich broth served with.fresh fixings. pork bun is to die for with a savory and tender grilled pork over cool vermicilli. chao gao is classic and other salads and drinks are great. place is always full of Vietnamese families and chicagoans alike. always packed. closed on Wednesday. worth a trip to argyle if you don't live around the corner like me. the delicious smell from a block away guide you.
