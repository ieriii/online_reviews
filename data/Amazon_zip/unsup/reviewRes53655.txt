My first review YAY!!!! I'm finally breaking down and writing reviews instead of just using review hehe.This place is right down the street from my apt so my roomie and I went there last night. She had this crazy bowl with an egg on top, I forget the name, and I had a sandwich that was pretty decent. The flavors were different than what I'm used to, but I'm not that adventurous. Hoping to change that now that I'm in Chicago!The employees there were really nice and the communal seating at the long benches was pretty cool. We'll definitely be comng back here.
