I LOVE Glenn's Diner! Every time I've been the food has been consistent and delicious...ok, spectacular. I always think I'm going to try something different when I go but I'm so addicted to the scallops with the bacon-mushroom sherry cream sauce that nothing could compare. One of these days I hope to venture and try something else on the menu. I'm dying to go for the all-u-can eat crab legs on Tuesday nights, maybe that will be my next adventure. I'm so happy this little gem is in my neighborhood. It is definitely a culinary blessing!
