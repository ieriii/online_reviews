I loved this unpretentious, semi-hipster pizza place! The prices are great and it's nice to only have to wait 30 minutes for deep dish; I feel that it's rare to have it cooked up so quickly. As mentioned in other reviews, the crust definitely sets it apart but it's hard to single out one flavor in pizza that's just pure deliciousness.
