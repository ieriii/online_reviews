I am often disappointed with prix fixe menus....seems like they are trying more to be fancy and surprising than good. This was both, and we totally LOVED it. Excellent food and reasonable price, love the BYOB and the service was excellent. They served a yellowfin sashimi, then a spaetzl and braised oxtail..... a great cauliflower ale soup.... everything was wonderful and we especially loved the warm banana bread pudding desert. I usally dont like banana anything but this was amazing. We can't wait to go back. And it really gets 5 stars for being good AND reasonably priced. *update* Im so sad that the prices have gone up while losing a course. I thought I had found a place that was committed to great food at a reasonable price. Boooooooooo
