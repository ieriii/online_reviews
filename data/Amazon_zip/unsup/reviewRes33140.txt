Find your way to this place quick. Awesome middle eastern joint with great food at reasonable prices. Falafel sandwich especially but also the Chicken shawarma (chk has a little bit of a kick). Also help yourself to the food bar that features classics and delictible deserts. Exceptionally quality and selection and a must try. P.S. They only take cash.
