Best wings ever said the person who hates chicken wings. I hate getting my fingers dirty when I eat, fine judge me, unless it is ribs. Everything else is all knifes and forks for this girl but after hearing from numerous of Chicago friends that I must head to Crisp because it is the best Korean food place in Lakeview, I obliged. Boy, were they right! I went with my friend who was in town from Kansas City last Saturday afternoon and we ventured down on the brown line to this glorified hot spot. I ordered their Seoul Sassy wings and my first thought was, "Dangggg, these wings are HUGE!" and boy, they tasted mighty fine too. I almost had to stop myself from embarrassing myself licking my fingers off from the sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and other select spices on the wings. I could only finish 2 of the wings and had to take the rest home which I was secretly excited for since that meant I could lick the sauce off my fingers in the presence of my own home haha. My friend ordered their baby buddha bowl which is a bibimbap that us Koreans love to eat. I had a bite of my friend's bowl and it tasted just like the way my mom and grandma makes them so I was pretty impressed. I am coming back Crisp! Your wings were da bombbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.
