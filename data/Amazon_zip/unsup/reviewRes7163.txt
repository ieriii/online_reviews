I LOVE this place! It's like BBQ GONE CLASSY. The staff is friendly and professional. The interior design and decor makes you feel like you could be in a totally different city, more like on the East Coast. Everything I've tried is amazing! Pulled pork sandwich is a must- I mix the vinegar and sweet bbq sauces for the perfect, rare combination. I took over half of the meat off of my sandwich and used it to make 2 more large sandwiches at home the next day! SO GOOD. The brisket is fab, just as the sides are. The mac & cheese, beans, cole slaw, corn bread....MMMMmmmm. The pickles and chips they serve when you are seated are so delish too! This is a place is a true gem.
