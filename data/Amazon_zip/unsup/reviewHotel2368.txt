Got our room here from HotWire as one of those "surprise" choices where you don't know what you're getting - and it paid off. Stayed here for our first visit to Chicago. Room was great (16th floor). Staff was friendly. The level of decadence doesn't quite equal something like the Paris hotel in Vegas, but it was solidly elegant and comfortable. Great location for what we wanted to do (to tour the loop and museums basically). Easy train access about two blocks away. We walked most places. Major plus being right across the street from Millenium Park. The only negative I can think of was parking. The night we got there the self-parking lot filled up so we had to valet park (which was expensive imo, $57/night). I know parking is just plain expensive in the loop, but $57 seemed extreme to me. The skinny? I'd stay here again provided I got a good rate again.
