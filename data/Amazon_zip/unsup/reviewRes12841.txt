Ok. We have TDB, Fogo Zed and Braz. All within a few blocks. We really like the style of food and restaurant so we have tried them all. Several times. This is Chicago so I can expect a lot from a restaurant. When I have this many choices I'm going to the place that has the best decor, service, drinks, food and dessert. The place needs to cater to me when I come for work, with colleagues and with my family. We tried TDB again. A friend treated. Can't complain about a free meal and it's greatly appreciated but it's not as good as Braz. If TDB was the only game in town I'd be writing a different review. But it's not. Sorry TDB.
