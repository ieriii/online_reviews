Its a miracle--I have actually found a place where I am transported to what seems like a different country. What an incredible vibe/atmosphere. And the food??? To die for.....my friend knows some of the peeps there, so our sevice was impeccable. I could have sat on the veranda for hours sipping my vino and stuffing my face with tofu, salmon, curry vegetables....I can go on and on. I also have heard about their incredible Thursday nights which I still need to attend with dance music and great drinks. What more could you ask for? Savor the flavor of Le Colonial!
