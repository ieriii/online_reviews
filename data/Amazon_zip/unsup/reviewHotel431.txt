I have to agree with the other reviewers. I would have loved staying at this hotel if I were on a high school or college road trip (its the cheapest hotel you can find this close to downtown), but as a professional adult there is no way in the world I would stay here again. Unlike what one reviewer said - there is a day spa, but its hard to find. It's the Kimberly Coleman Salon, which is located in the hotel (great salon by the way! see my review about that). The "gourmet coffee" snack people are horrible. The food isn't bad, but the coffee sucks and is way overpriced. The hotel lobby is nice. Its obviously new. But the rooms.... the rooms... the rooms....................are completely bare-boned, nothing extra. It looks like the furniture came from the 1980's, the TV channel selections suck, and worst of all.... the bed was hard as a rock. I'm not kidding!! I couldn't sleep on it. I pulled my air mattress out of the car and slept on that!!!! If you are planning to stay here for a convention, family reunion, church revival whatever - make sure to book using http://Hotels.com or something. As everyone has already said - this place is not worth the price if you pay the full value. http://Hotels.com had it for $79 per night when I booked - the hotel wanted $139. NO WAY!
