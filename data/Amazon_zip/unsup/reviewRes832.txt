I had already mentally braced myself for the line, so waiting in line with good company wasn't too bad. However, we may have underbudgeted our time here (took us approx 1hr, 15 minutes to order) so it pushed back our itinerary. Because of this, it made me question whether the line was worth it. Food: Foie Gras Hotdog -- Very interesting concept to put on hotdog. Extremely savory as I wolfed it down. Elvis -- I love polish hotdogs (Kielbasas) and they put relish, a pickle, and grilled onions on it. For $3, it was worth it. Overall rating: The food was a 5/5. However, the line made the experience less pleasurable (obviously out of anybody's control, but I feel necessary to factor it into my review). It reminds me of the Boiling Crab scenario. Is it worth it to wait this long for a similar experience you can get somewhere else? I think I'll agree with our cab driver in that there are comparable places out there without the wait. See attached picture for foie gras and elvis side by side.
