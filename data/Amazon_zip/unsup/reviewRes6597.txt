I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT!!! I have been frequenting Davanti Enoteca since they opened earlier this year. Although they do not take reservations, I called in advance to see if they could accommodate a party of nine since I wanted to celebrate my birthday with my girlfriends there on a Friday night. Not only did they reserve a table for me, they also had glasses of champagne awaiting our arrival, seated us on the beautiful roof deck and brought out free desserts after singing happy birthday. Davanti Enoteca has consistently delicious food and the best customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. I will definitely be back soon and I recommend that everyone else join me!
