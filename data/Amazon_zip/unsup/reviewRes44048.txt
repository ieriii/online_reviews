Last night's sushi - Happy New Year to me! - was without a doubt the best I've ever eaten. I've been to Wakamono before once or twice, and last night decided to see if their delivery is as good as their dine-in service. Thankfully, everything was spot-on. I put it an order at 5:45 for a 7:00 delivery, and they were right on time. I tried the Snow White, Peter Parker, and spicy salmon rolls, and they didn't disappoint. Most places serve a spicy salmon roll with a huge dollop of mayo, a thick layer of rice, and an inadequate slice of fish; not so at Wakamono. I've never had such a large, delicious portion of salmon. The flavors of the Peter Parker roll were lost in translation just a bit, and perhaps isn't the best roll to have delivered, but I've had it before and know how good it can be. And the Snow White roll is just divine - the super white tuna is my new favorite. It's a touch pricey to be sure, especially on a grad student's budget; however, the quality of the fish, the creative combinations, and delightful flavors are worth every penny. Wakamono never fails to disappoint, even on the delivery front.
