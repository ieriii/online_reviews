I. Love. Gilt Bar. I got there relatively early, so they only had the toast options.. I had the toast with balsamic reduction, olive oil and garlic.. AMAZING.. I also ordered the foie gras mousse and I nearly died. I washed it all down with vodka tonics and just enjoyed the ambiance. The place is sleek, the crowd is chic, the music is good, dim lit, yet all very relaxed. I love visiting Chicago always --and now I have even more reasons to go back soon. Gilt Bar, thank you!
