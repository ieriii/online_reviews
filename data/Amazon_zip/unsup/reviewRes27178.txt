It's a Mexican restaurant among throngs of Mexican restaurants. And while I could try the surrounding places, I never will, because Nuevo Leon is great. Often times before you even get a menu, they've thrown down not only your regular chips and salsa (and on most nights salsaS), but you also get a bowl of spicy pickled veggies and some kind of appetizer - either soup or some kind of chili-like dish served with tortillas. On top of that, none of the basic meals will run you over $7 - all are well-prepared (a little on the greasy-side, but hell, that's why you're here, right?). You won't leave hungry or broke. It's just not possible.
