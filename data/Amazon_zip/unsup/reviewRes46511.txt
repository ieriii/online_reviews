Went here for dinner last night. A Chicago classic! They have a special burger of the day which you simply must try. I had a burger with caramelized pear and sweet potatoe fries! Friendly fast service with a casual atmosphere i was totally in a food coma afterwards. Thursday is half priced wine night!
