This was the first place we ate at upon arriving in Chicago.  Our meal consisted of: - suckling pig with beets, hazelnuts & polenta - lamb neck with eggplant, peppers & tzatziki - frites with eggs - milk chocolate semi freddo I washed all this down with: - Charles Wells Bombardier, Charles Wells Brewery - Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, Great Lakes Brewing Company All in all this was a great dining experience. The highlights were the pig and sheep, both of which were excellently cooked and delicious. I was a little let down by the frites with fried egg, only because the egg was a little over cooked and we didn't get the full effect of the runny yolk to dip in. The beer menu is impressive and organized into various categories by type and origin.  Above all else, I really thought the wait staff and bus staff were awesome. We had arrived for our reserved time about 30 minutes early and we were quickly checked in and then led to the bar area and given our own bar table to stand at and survey the beer menu. The servers that came by were very knowledgeable when it came to the different brews and were good at making recommendations based upon any likes/dislikes you had as well as bringing you samples if you were torn between several of their offerings. The reviews that are really negative to me only prove that maybe this place isn't for everybody. Yes - it's loud and maybe a little pricey - so maybe don't bring a first date here, don't bring a business associate and expect to conduct a meeting, and don't bring your children. There's a good chance you'll end up sitting at a communal table which I never mind, but tends to bother others. If you are really anti-social and can snag one of the booths, you're in luck, as they have these mini doors which close you in for an added level of privacy. All in all I liked this place and would go back - the only reason it's not 5 stars for me is because we were blown away by some of Chicago's other gems; those reviews are in the works.
