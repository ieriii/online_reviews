I would love to stop over here again. I came there after an early meeting. The place was clean and brunch chic. The food was great and so was the service. The food came out hot and in a decent time and it was exactly what I ordered. The crowd there was also a plus. Go during the week if you don't want children. I think there was only one table that had children that were WELL behaved.
