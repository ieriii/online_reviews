Alliance had my heart before I walked in the door. It was the kind of place that persuaded me to move to the area last year just by it's charming sign and inviting "we've been here and haven't changed since 1951" persona. When I heard from a friend that they're infamous for their ridiculously awesome cupcakes, I knew it would be a dangerous neighbor. Almost a year later, I finally made it inside with orgasmic-like anticipation. CUPCAKES! COFFEE!! ...and CUTENESS!!! Ok, that's pretty generic but I was taken immediately. I ordered the 2.50 or so carrot cake cupcake and handed the friendly girl my debit card. She said, continuing the thematic cuteness, that there's a five dollar minimum and that she's really really sorry. Sorry?! No, no. I have cash you little sweetheart, it's ok! And even if I didn't, I would have gotten another! She was just so sweet about something no-big-deal. I was handed my cupcake in a cute little to-go box. And walked away with a cute little smile. It turns out that cuteness is both edible and delicious. The carrot cake cupcake was all of that cuteness in a crumbly beautifully presentable sweet tooth satisfier. Even the cupcake wrapper was cute and all 1951. Again. Cupcakes. Coffee. And cuteness. Alliance is perfect. And not at all generic.
