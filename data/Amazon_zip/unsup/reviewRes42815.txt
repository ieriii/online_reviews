I've only been here twice, but it's quickly becoming one of my favorite pizza joints. Very comfortable atmosphere if you're looking to just eat and go. Absolutely love the thin crust! Deep dish is great, too. I haven't tried anything else on the menu because it's a pizza place so I'm going to only order their pizza! Chicago has a ton of great pizza places. Art of Pizza should be on your list.
