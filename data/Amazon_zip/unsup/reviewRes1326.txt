We all know the one thing Hot Doug's is missing is Yelp reviews....oh they already have almost 1500....Well I'm here anyways. So I had been planning a hot doug's adventure for months and finally made it up with a group of ~10 friends. We waited in the cold for ~45 minutes only to be soothed by the smell of encased meats and the friendly smile of none other then Doug himself. Doug is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and doesn't have a problem with you ordering his dogs any way you want (I changed up his special just a bit). Our dogs came out fast...and we had a lot! I would reccomend getting at least 2 so you can try a variety. If possible split them with friends and try as many as possible. My three were: -Smoked Alligator with shrimp roumalade - Wow, this thing is awesome. Great flavor. and very different from your standard sausage - The Atomic Bomb - Spicy pork sausage with spicy mango mayonaise. this had a great kick to it and also amazing flavor. If its on the menu, get it. - I also had the Duck Sausage with foie gras moose and fluer del sel. This one was interesting. It was a little too rich and I don't think I really had the palette to enjoy it. Yes I just said my palette wasn't refined enough for encased meat. This is still and excellent sausage though and I think Doug was trying to make a statement of what a sausage can be. Overall, it was a great experience and I will be back for the duck fat fries. and to try another round of special dogs.
