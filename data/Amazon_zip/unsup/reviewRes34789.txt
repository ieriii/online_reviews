I took my mom here last week because she loves middle eastern food. We ordered chicken shwarma sandwiches and falafel. Both were extremely tasty (the falafel was seriously decadent) and there were generous portions at a very reasonable price. Also, we tried the baklava. I would just like to say it was honestly the BEST baklava I've tasted in a long, long time.
