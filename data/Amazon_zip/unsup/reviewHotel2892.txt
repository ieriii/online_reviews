It was quite some time ago that I stayed here, but for some reason I just thought of my need to review it.... As a young suburban girl, with a Christmas Eve b-day, turning 21, there's not much you can do to save yourself from shittiness. I certainly tried. I got this hotel room for me and a bunch of my girlfriends after a dinner at Harry Carey's and it was really quite lovely. At one point we ended up wandering down Michigan Ave with grocery bags full of booze and ice cream, but that could happen to any PMS'ing Chicagoan lady. For serious.... It happens to me all the time.. anyway, this hotel is not the Four Seasons, but it's not the Motel 8 either. It gets the job done with decent quality rooms and service and that's all a drunk bratty child can really ask.
