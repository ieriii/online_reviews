First time I went here it seemed to be decent. Decided to take a friend back. Had horrible food and service. The manager did send me 2 gift certificates for $25. But you could only use it all at once. So we used one of them when we went back and the food was still bad and the service was just ok. The salad bar is so small, it sucks. The burger was so so. Not worth the money or time. I would recommend about 100places before this one. I dont know why people rave about it so.
