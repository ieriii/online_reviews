This is our "go-to" neighborhood restaurant and, judging by how busy they are on any night of the week, we aren't alone in this. This is set-your-watch reliable, good Italian food.  The wife loves the gnocchi and compares every other restaurant's gnocchi to Calo's. The grilled calamari is always delicious. Their ribs are a complete surprise, better than at most rib joints.  I usually stick to one of the pasta specials and have rarely been disappointed. Even the plain old house salad is pretty good.  Some servers are friendlier than others (we've gotten to know them), but mostly the service is unobtrusive, in that food & waiters seem to pop-up right when they should. I think this is really hard to pull off in such a busy place. In my experience very few restaurants do this consistently. I want to give them five stars but honestly Calo's food is merely good, not mind-blowing or the "best" Italian in the city. It's not even the best Italian in the neighborhood (the place across the street gets that honor). But it is always a reliable, pleasant and enjoyable (if busy) place to go out for dinner, either with a date or with a crowd.
