This is my favorite place to eat in the city. I've tried everything and EVERYTHING is good. The mash and biscuits are the best. The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked. Even the salad bar is a thing of wonder. Service is instant and constant. I can't think of any way in which this restaurant could be better.
