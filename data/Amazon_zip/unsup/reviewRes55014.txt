This is a fantastic restaurant, I wish it was closer so I could go all the time! Went on a weeknight and were luckily able to get seats at the bar after waiting only a few minutes.My favorite dish was the scallop/oxtail/truffle gnocchi. It seems like a lot of ingredients but it worked perfectly and tasted wonderful. So good I wanted another order! Also tried the veal heart dish which I would highly recommend. The chicken entree was good, but sort of a thanksgiving themed dish, it was not as unique as the others and I will probably try something different for an entree next time I can get back there.
