You gotta know this would be one of my all-time favorite bars in the U.S. I loved everything about it! The unfriendly stickler of a door guy, the quiet, appreciative and admiring patrons and the overall decor and vibe of this establishment. I was sad to have missed it the last time I was in Chi-town. Never again.
