Recently, I've been coming here pretty often. I think the food is great and is comparable to what I've eaten in Vietnam. I always get the beef pho (#47), which is excellent.  The service; however, is inconsistent. During the weekends, when all the tables are taken and there are customers waiting to be seated, the service is amazingly quick. I can picture a huge pot of pho in the back that's ready to be served because that's what people go there for. So, usually, within a couple of minutes, you recieve your hot and delicious bowl of pho. But.....at times when it's not busy at all and the waitstaff outnumber the customers, service can get slow. My friend and I ordered a shrimp crepe, and that came in a few minutes. That was delicious!!! It was basically fresh bean sprouts covered by a thin blanket of egg omelet with shrimp...it was soooo good with the sauce. After that, we were ready for the pho, but waited over 15 minutes for it. We had to call the attention of a waiter because we still weren't getting our meal. The people behind us who arrived much later were served first. Also, it was difficult getting water. However, when it was time to collect payment, they returned within a minute after handing us the bill. So, service that day wasn't great, but it doesn't change my mind about the place. I love the food and I'll still be coming in frequently.
