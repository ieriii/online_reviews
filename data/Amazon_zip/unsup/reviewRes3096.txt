Been here twice, loved it both times. It is a very laid back restaurant (I don't know why, but the two times I came here I feel like I see hipsters all the time).  Normally when you think of Korean you think of BBQ. Not here ! They have the traditional bibimbap known as the bowls here. Beware, the portions are huge so if you plan to come alone, I say to just stick with the Baby Buddha. Chicken Wings are fantastic! Not only in size, but in taste of course. I promise this place will leave you BLOATED ! I like the simplicity of the restaurant. Nothing too fancy.
