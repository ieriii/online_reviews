I am giving this four stars because Twuan, the owner, deserves it. I have never met anyone so willing to work his butt off to make his restaurants work. I have followed him from his early days at Pasteur on Lawrence and Sheridan to the other Pasteur on Broadway to this quaint little spot.  I do love the spring rolls, the seafood salad, the garlic fish, chicken in clay pot and the very best sweet potatoe/shrimp wraps. BYOB! Love the fact that you can bring your own great wine!  Sometimes the waiters don't explain everything well- so ask for Twuan and he will steer you in the right direction. Fresh, fresh, fresh.
