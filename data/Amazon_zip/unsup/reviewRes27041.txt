Pequod's is on our list of delivery restaurants that get a "special place" on the fridge. They deliver a particularly satisfying brand of pizza that is not in competition with Lou M. or Gino's -- Pequod's is in a league of their own.  The one drawback is the price. A large deep dish pie with pepperoni (easily feeds 3 people) will run you $23 (not including the tip for delivery).
