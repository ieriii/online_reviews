Came to Zed451 with a large group for a business dinner. I had chosen the restaurant in the hopes of there being something for everyone in the group. I was not disappointed. Despite it being a steakhouse, even the vegetarians in our group were happy. The harvest table is AMAZING - you could easily eat your fill there and be satisfied. Our harvest table was loaded with a plethora of meats, cheeses, salads, olives, noodles and soups - each one uniquely prepared and presented. The parade of meats were a feast for the eyes and the belly! The service was fantastic and the restaurant itself is contemporary and beautifully designed. Definitely a treat if you're in the Windy City!
