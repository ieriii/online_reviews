These guys are so good at chicken dishes that they should be shut down for putting addictive substances in their food! Because there's no other reason why I'd want to eat anywhere so often. The chicken, wings and strips options alone are so delicious that it really opens the door to trying anything else on the menu and I highly suggest that you do because I have yet to find anything I don't absolutely love! My current favorite is the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl. Looking at a photo of it, you might not even think it's that special. But once you plop some of Alison's Atomic Sauce on that bad boy and have a bite, you're never going back!  And I find that simple dishes are always a great way to judge the chef's prowess at any restaurant. After all, if an Italian chef can't get a simple fettuccine alfredo right, how good do you think his/her eggplant parmigiana is?  Such is the case with Crisp: superb simples, spectacular specials and a fun, shared-table atmosphere in which everyone is stoked because their tummies are singing! Cannot recommend these guys highly enough :^)
