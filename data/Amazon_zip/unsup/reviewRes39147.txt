Despite living stumbling distance from Longman & Eagle, I finally just made my inaugural visit today. I hate to say it - but I've been scared away by the crowds. Given that I arrived at 2:40 for a lunch service that ends at 3 and the place was packed - well, maybe staying away this long wasn't so irrational. Anyway, I happily secured one of the spots at the bar - just in front of the whiskey/rye/bourbon display (and oh what a display it was!). Even though it was mid-afternoon (ok, on a Friday, but still) the bartender was working her ass off, but nonetheless friendly and attentive. The place definitely has a hipster vibe, so in my opinion service can go either way (Big Star, aka Hipster Heaven has some of the worst service it has ever been my displeasure to experience). So yay for the bartender. I ordered myself up a burger (cheddar, bacon, and fried egg, thankyouverymuch) accompanied by beef fat fries. I don't know what's with the trend of animal fat fries, but I am certainly glad I'm not a vegetarian! So - it was solid. The burger was tasty and cooked how I ordered it - great flavors, good bun that could hold up to it. If I had a complaint it would be that this thing is TALL. As in, I could barely open my mouth wide enough to bite it. In theory, bigger is better, but if I have to smash everything down to take a bite... maybe a little less big is better? The beef fat fries were also tasty - some of them were a little soggy, but that's actually a compliment - I happen to like them that way. I would love to come on a day when I can hang out and try more of their beers and I am dying to try the dinner menu. Could y'all maybe take a break from Longman & Eagle so it's easier for me to get in?
