Hands down my fave Sushi spot in Chicago (and Evanston). I do cheat and try other places...but as I'm eating my mediocre sushi elsewhere, I feel guilty and stupid for cheating on Sushi X...i'm a bad girlfriend. But no more...my loyalty is here. Here's why: *Sushi is always fresh and the rolls are creative and HUGE *I could go on and on about the Godzilla, the Mango, the Honey, the spicy tuna...oh lord...so good.  *BYOB!!! *The non-sushi items on the menu are super yum...I take my kids here and they love the rice bowls. And these are no "kiddie bowls" -they are filled with culinary delights like short rib, shrimp, an over easy egg and other goodness. *They project anime films on the back wall and the it seems very "Lost in Translation," yet they don't give off a snooty, too cool for you vibe. The owner is often here and is very friendly - always recommending great rolls to try. *In West Town and always easy to park! *I could eat here every night. Seriously.
