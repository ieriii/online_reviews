After buying Frontera salsa a couple of times before and loving it, I convinced a few of my co-workers to join me here for drinks and dinner. I would say, in general, Frontera has good food, but overall, this place is a bit too pretentious for my liking.  We arrived around 5:30 and there was already an hour and a half wait, so that kinda sucked considering there was nowhere to sit in the bar area. Luckily, about 20 minutes later, some people left the bar and we were able to sit down and order some drinks and guacamole.  When we were seated for dinner (the hostess said absolutely nothing to us as she took our pager and brought us to the table), I came to realize that there were only 2 vegetarian entrees on the menu. Furthermore, neither of the 2 types of beans they serve are vegetarian-friendly (one being made with ham, the other with lard). Really, Rick Bayless? You can't whip up one version of beans that can be consumed by vegetarians? I mean, they are just beans...What also bothered me about this place is that the cheapest dinner entree is $16.50. Combined, these factors are what made me feel like this place is nothing more than pretentious and overly-fancy Mexican food. Sure, the decor was cool, but, "Meh. I've experienced better."
