Wow. Super fancy, super location, super friendly and helpful staff, super big rooms....do you see the trend here? I live in the city but had a the pleasure of visiting the Talbott when members of a bachelorette party I was attending stayed here. All I can say is, if you can afford it, the Talbott is the place to stay!  (Ps...each room has a doorbell, how awesome is that?!)
