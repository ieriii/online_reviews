This location is a hidden gem in the windy city. We were walking around the city and decided to have pizza. We called ahead to the other location near the Sears Tower and they said they didn't take reservations so we called this one up and they took our pizza order and by the time we walked over, the pizza was ready and we were served. It was sooo good. One slice goes a long way!
