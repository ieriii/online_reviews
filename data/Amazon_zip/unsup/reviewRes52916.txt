Oh my goodness. Yum. Our dinner at 90 Miles was some of the most flavorful food we've ever had! Three of us stuffed ourselves with delicious crispy-on-the-outside tender-on-the-inside pork (mascas de puerco), bistec with chimichurri (awesome), and shrimp, along with two appetizers for $50! And we brought home a big box of leftovers. The atmosphere was fun and funky - we sat in the back patio which is enclosed and heated very comfortably in the winter. Polite, professional service, and the owner, Alberto, greeted us after dinner. Absolutely recommended, especially if you've never had Cuban food before. Next time we're bringing our own rum and having their mojitos :)
