This is the only Pho in Chicago if you're a foodie like me. Pho HAS to have amazing broth, and this place knows how to do it right. Their menu is huge, but I can't veer away from the Spring Rolls + #47 Beef Pho because it's just that amazing. The staff is super friendly and the manager always comes by and sees how everything is going. I took half of my HUGE pho bowl to go and they even let me have one of their little spoons so I could eat it at home restaurant-style! Super cheap too, for my spring rolls and pho it was only $13. You MUST come here. Oh, and their bubble tea is faaaaaaantastic.
