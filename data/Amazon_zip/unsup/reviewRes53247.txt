We had lunch here today and discovered 1 of the best kept food secrets in Chicago! This place is amazing! The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Phillipe was our server and he gave us great service with a charming attitude! He took the bottle of red merlot that I had brought and transformed it in to a homemade sangria for $10! It was delicious! The atmosphere is so authentic that I thought I was on Duval St. or on the town square in Tamarindo, CR! The covered patio is also a great draw! I can't wait to go back again!
