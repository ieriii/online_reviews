It's a sandwich shop that is not a sandwich shop. Long wait time but the hostess is efficient and quick at making the best of the situation. One of Bayless' restaurants...the food was delicious. I was really impressed, and would definitely come back again. I honestly didn't think sandwiches could be "elevated" to another level without looking bougie but damn some of the plates coming by smelled so damn GOOD. The homemade churro with vanilla soft serve was deathly. I could die happy eating that. Definitely impressed here, and wish I had more time to try the different options.
