Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! The food, service and value never cease to amaze me. If you haven't tried this place, you must! The lunch special is the best deal in town. The beef Banh Mi is out of this world. There's always something extra special added -- for instance, I just went in to pick up a simple (but delicious!!) chicken salad for my lunch and got back to work to find a generous container of complimentary fresh fruit in my bag. Awesome.
