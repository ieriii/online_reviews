Does the world need more Carnivale reviews? Obviously not, so I'll keep it short and hit the highlights. Guac = must do. I don't care if you are allergic to avocados--get over it. This guac ROCKS. Ceviche = Um, yes please. Highly recommend the halibut and the salmon. Mojitos = always too sweet for me, until I realized the beauty of asking for half-sweet (half the amount of simple syrup). Perfecto. If mojitos aren't your thing, try the Juniper Blossom. And this comes from a girl who hates gin. Come later in the evening on a summer night and sit out in the bar area when they have the windows open overlooking the highway (sounds weird, I know, but it's awesome). Eat some chips & guac, scoop some ceviche, suck down some mojitos, and be glad you live in Chicago.
