Holy schmoly this place knows how to tickle your taste buds with poultry! I've had fried chicken in my past and besides getting it from Stanley's every once in awhile, I really don't take an easy liking to it all that much. From a recommendation, I tried the Seoul Sassy which was like an exciting firecracker in the mouth. The half chicken pieces were delicately fried to a perfect *crisp* (how ironic, right?) sealing plenty of moisture inside. The soy ginger based sauce that was spread over the breading provided excellent lube for my throat as I inhaled the whole thing in a few minutes flat. Want to go back and try the buddha bowls... those look GOOD!
