A solid three stars. Five stars for the Seoul Sassy chicken which is VERY addicting and delicious. I'd have given Crisp more, but the Seoul Sassy is what really gets me to go out of my way to come here. Everything else is just OK, just nothing special flavor-wise. But I do appreciate the brown rice option AND the nice employees.
