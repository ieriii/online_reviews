nobody can deny how delicious the falafel at sultan's is. and the baba ghanooj. and the tabboule. however, i have NEVER had a pleasant experience with any of the people working at sultan's and have TWICE gotten the wrong change (less than what i was owed). also, i'm just not down with cafeteria style. i like to really assess my options and at sultan's i want to gesture wildly for the people behind me to "go around!" "i'm looking...." please sultan's, just let me look.  and give me my money when money's due.
