Gejas is by far my second favorite resteraunt in chicago, its a fantastic intimate ambiance that is great for dates, celebrating anniversaries or other intimate affairs. The decore is dimly lit by candles and low lighting creating a romantic mood and the decor is nice with shelves of wine bottles and paintings. i would definatly recommend this to anyone who looking to take someone on a special date. The staff is extremly friendly and the food is wonderful especially the cheese coarse. You will leave this place full as full can be. i would highly recommend you make a reservation for this place and ask for a booth.
