Doug's food is great. The regular dogs, veggie dogs, sausages, corn dogs, etc are some of the best in the city. But don't go to Doug's just for those. His specialty sausages are where it's at. I myself am not a fussy-foodie, so I haven't tried many of these. But the few that I have (including the glorious "Teuben" or reuben in sausage form) are fantastic. Doug has a great sense for creating innovative flavor combinations. However...the crowds. The lines are often times just ridiculous...stop by on a Friday or Saturday if you don't believe me. And then the place is so small, which means finding a table can be a real problem. I'd say it comes down to this: if you want to try some of Doug's delicious, unique experiments in encased meats, it's definitely worth the trip...just be prepared to wait. But if you are just going for the dogs and fries, I'd go elsewhere. Who wants to wait in 30 minute lines for hot dogs. Wiener's Circle, Duk's and especially Superdawg are are a few of my faves.
