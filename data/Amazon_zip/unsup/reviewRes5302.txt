I'm really into Bin Wine Cafe in Bucktown, so I was really excited to try this place. I found that I really enjoy the atmosphere at The Purple Pig much more than Bin. It has a great feel and our waiter was amazing. He was very helpful especially since I had no idea what anything meant on the menu. (Seriously, I thought I had a pretty good knowledge of cheese, wine and swine... turns out I was wrong.) I can't wait until the patio is open--it's going to be so great! I look forward to going again.
