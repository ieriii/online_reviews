So I'd been to Brazzaz and was expecting this place to totally blow me away. Everyone always raves about Fogo and how amazing it is. 'Tis amazing, because anything wrapped in bacon will fall under that category, but can I say that I wasn't blown away? Honestly, I liked the ambiance of Brazzaz more. I feel like less people know about it so the kitsch factor isn't so harsh. I mean, I think our gaucho here was seriously an actor. Like, literally. Just serve me my meat and check your lame Groundlings improv at the door, homes. Also, I enjoyed Brazzaz's salad bar more. Don't get me wrong, Fogo was good. But it was a tad tourist-y for my taste.  MeatFest 08's at Brazzaz.
