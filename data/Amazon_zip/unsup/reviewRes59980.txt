The Colombian typical plate was awful. The chicharones (fried pork skin) were greasy and disgusting. The beans were not the good, Colombian style "Cargamanto", they were more like canned pinto beans. The skirt steaks were smelly and very tough. Las Tablas should be fined for calling this Colombian.
