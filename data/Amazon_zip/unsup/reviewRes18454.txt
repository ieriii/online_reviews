Wow - people are seriously conflicted over this restaurant. Just because a restaurant has burgers that have more on it then cheese, doesn't mean its like Kuma's. Let's just get that straight. It's pretty hard to beat Kuma's, and it would be silly for someone to take that on, anyway. I had the roasted garlic burger with kalamata olives, feta and roasted red peppers. My only complaint was that the red peppers/olives/feta were COLD. In my opinion, they should have been warmed through and gotten the feta a little melty. Also, we had the goat cheese fondue with rosemary and it was delicious. The beer menu is the reason to seek this place out - awesome list, and the servers know a lot about the beer which is helpful. ALSO, they have pinball + Ms. Pacman. Always a winner in my book.
