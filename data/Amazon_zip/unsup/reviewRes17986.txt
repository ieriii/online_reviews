What's wrong? Tomato got you down? Lettuce looking just. . . so so? Look no further than Bad Apple! The best burgers in Chicago. Sorry Kuma, I love you too, but you've been beat. The Bad apple has it all. Good prices. Lots and lots (and lots) of beer choices. Seasoned fries (pretty much every kind that you'd want). Oh, and all at awesome prices.  The burgers have everything on them. Peanut butter and bacon? Check. Brisket and sunny side up egg? check. Foie Gras? check. Seriously, Lots of exciting choices. Get them on a normal bun (good), Pretzel bun (a favorite), and even an English muffin (really good).  My fiance ( a stout vegetarian) says they have the best veggie burgers (rivaled only by Victory Banner). Also, she can get any of the burger styles with the veggie patty, so she's tried them all (but still prefers the original since "it's just awesome"). And the beer. Oh, the beer. they have tons of stuff on draft (easily 20) and about a thousand bottles. We love to go with a group and get one of the larger bottles to share. They also make wicked cocktails, many with beer and mead. My favorite was the one they had during Autumn which had a maple whiskey mixed with an incredible pumpkin pie beer (I had a lot of those). I've recently moved out Illinois but this will always be on the list for any time I visit. I highly suggest you add it to your's as well.
