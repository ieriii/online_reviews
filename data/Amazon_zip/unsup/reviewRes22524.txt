Been coming here since I was a little kid living down the street in Norwood Park. It can take a little time for the car-hops to bring out your order if it is a busy weekend night. The Whoopercheesie and the Original Superdawg is not for those with soft palettes and timid stomachs. A good Chicago institution that has been pretty consistent over the decades. The shakes are thick, think spoon before straws.
