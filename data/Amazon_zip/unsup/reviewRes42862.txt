I went with the girl. We both got "stuffed" slices which appear to be deep dish but with the ingredients laid in reverse order (topping, cheese, sauce). We both liked it. I think it's the best deep dish I've had in Chicago. Better than the tourist spots by far. It's still deep dish, though, which means it sits in your stomach for a while reminding you to drink lots of water/coffee/beer to help digest it. We also ordered some fries, which came out hot and crispy but were, you know, fries. Hopefully, your kitchen isn't fuckin' those up. The folx there were super-friendly. After we ordered there was a confused, little, old lady that spent literally fifteen minutes ordering a slice of pizza and the guy behind the counter was patient with her the whole time. I'd lose my mind. Everything was great. Why just four stars? Well, the deep dish didn't blow me away and the lighting felt really weird. Is that persnickety?
