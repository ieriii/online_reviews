While I have never dined in here, I have grabbed take out on a few occasions. I always get the Casado dish, which has been great on some nights and decent on others. The chips and salsa (which is offered as an appetizer for $2.50) is far too spicy. I enjoy spicy foods, but I couldn't take the spice level on this salsa, and thus wasted my money. Never had lunch here, but I look forward to trying out the Costa Rican Sandwich. Many of the comments mention the Oatmeal Shake, which really is as good as the hype. Well, at least to me. My wife didn't seem to care for it that much, so perhaps it is a required taste. Still, I urge you to give it a try. You just might crave it as much as me or any of a number of other reviewers on here. In fact, the Oatmeal Shake is worth the four stars alone!
