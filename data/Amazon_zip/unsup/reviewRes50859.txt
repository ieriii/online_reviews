Eat a late breakfast here. This place USED to be a Mr. Steer and I forget what in another incarnation. Grits? got 'em. Decent food, great wait staff and a breath of fresh, hip air in a revived neighborhood (we lived in this hood when we first got married and lemme tell ya, it's a lot nicer now thanks to places like this!). Had a very good salad, one buddy had some breakfast thing with grits and the waitress was upbeat and a compliment to the whole sheebang. It may not hit "southern cuisine" like a truck stop diner in Georgia, but it sure is eclectically happy stuff and they'll bend a bit for a request or two, so feel good, eat everything on your plate and do as we did: meet up with buds over decent chow that your mommy would approve of!
