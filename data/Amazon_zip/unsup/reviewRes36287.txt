This is now my FAVORITE breakfast place. It is not exactly on the beaten path, but I highly recommend making the trip. The service is always great. I get the feeling that they actually care whether or not I like the food. They are always making suggestions and enthusiastically checking on my opinion. But, the food is what really does it here. The omelettes, skillets, scramblers, and especially the Eggs Benedicts are phenomenal.
