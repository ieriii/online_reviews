Even though it's crowded on the weekends, you can still go on a weekday and get in pretty quickly. The food differs enough from typical Mexican fare that you can get a little excited about it. There's plenty of veggie dishes and the shakes are so amazing, my friend and I had one at dinner and ordered one to go!
