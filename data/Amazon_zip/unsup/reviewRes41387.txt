We ate here tonight...yummy. The only thing I didn't like was the first course salad. I really appreciate the BYO aspect because it allows you to plan ahead and pair a great bottle of wine with the menu. A few things that led to the 4/5 stars were portion sizes and the $3-10 upcharge for the more adventurous and appetizing items. While this seemed excessive, I managed to enjoy the meal because, well, my boyfriend was paying :). We added the cheese appetizer, which was just enough to leave us comfortably satiated.
