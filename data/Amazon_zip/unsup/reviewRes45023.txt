after hearing that the must have food for chicago is pizza from giordano, i left this restaurant a little disappointed. the serving size was huge and there was more than enough pizza to go around, but i can't say if i will ever specifically eat at giordano's again. the pizza was just alright... however, i guess you just have to have it for the complete Chiago experience.
