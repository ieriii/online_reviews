Yummy place to go for a quick bite before a movie, Be Kind Rewind was our movie that night. Prices were steep, but the food was definitely restaurant quality for a cafeteria style place.  One thing that bothered me was that the sandwiches come with chips, but you can't substitute sweet potato fries, so if you really want them, you have to pay the extra $6. I really wanted them, so I paid the extra $6.  I always have food envy, and the hamburger and panini that our friends ordered looked much better than our grilled vegetable sandwich and turkey-brie sandwich.  I hope to be back if we're ever in the area for anther movie!
