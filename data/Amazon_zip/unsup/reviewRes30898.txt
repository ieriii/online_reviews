This place is so overrated, its not even funny. The food is bland or gross- then they make you pay too much for it. Their vegan desserts are dry... perhaps that is to get you to buy more coffee/tea/whatever. You can do better by picking up some Amy's frozen soy macaroni or something. I miss cafe Voltaire on Clark, just past Belmont. =(
