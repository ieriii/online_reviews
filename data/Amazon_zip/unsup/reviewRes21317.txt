I went here for dessert after eating at Frontera... yeah, you heard me, TWO Rick Bayless dining experiences in ONE night. And it was amazing. It was cold and windy so we stopped in for some hot chocolate and churros. I got the chocolate cafe con leche, and I really could understand what they were saying about it being straight from the cacao bean (that they grind in house). It wasn't too sweet, very fresh... it was just right and even though it was small, it was so satisfying. The churros were outstanding! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, warm... oh baby! Not like I eat churros all the time, but these were the best I'd ever had. I will definitely be back here to try out the tortas and caldos, and to relive the amazingness that is hot chocolate and churros. Rick Bayless you evil genius!
