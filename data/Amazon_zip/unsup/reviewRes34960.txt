Sultans has absolutely fresh, inexpensive and great tasting Middle Eastern food. I am a big fan of the Chicken Swarma dinner and lentil soup. The Spinach pies are bit doughy but have just the right amount of greens and cheese (not too much).The falafil is pretty good as falafil goes. Sultan's is more of a takeout place than a sit down diner but they do have wooden booths to provide seating for about 30-40 diners. (I think they enlarged their seating area but I don't eat in at Sultans so I am not sure.) In summer months they have outdoor patio seating as well. Eat in patrons tend to be of the hipster crowd so it's very casual attire. They also offer delivery for a few bucks and it only takes about 10-15 minutes from the time I place my phone order to delivery at my door! Can't beat that. AND for about $7.00 an entree including meat, rice, hummus and tabouli, I can get enough food for 2-3 meals. (Dinner and lunch and sometimes even a second dinner.) Yay Sultan's!
