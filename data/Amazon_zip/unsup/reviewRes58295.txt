I'm pretty much done with Pequod's & it isn't even about their pizza. Although the pizza is good, the customer service is horrendous & I refuse to pay that much money for pizza only to be treated poorly. My work department placed an order yesterday for a noon delivery today. The delivery guy showed up 35 minutes early. When I asked why he was so early he said I'm here now so you can pay for the pizza or I can leave. Wow, great customer service! He only got more irritated and rude when we asked if we could call the manager to find out what happened. The manager was also extremely rude and offered no apologies whatsoever. He did offer a discount for our next order but we explained that our company was moving out of the neighborhood next weekend so there would not be a next time. He did take money off the current order. But I had to waste 20 minutes of my work day dealing with rude staff only to have to eat cold pizza in the end. It's worth noting that Pequod's pizza is good when hot and fresh but is not as good when cold where cheaper pizza's often taste as good leftover. I'm just extremely disappointed in the lack of respect that Pequod's has for it's customers. I would rather spend my money on a restaurant that values both good food as well as good customer service.
