average sushi, lotta hype. stopped in for a weekday work lunch. overall, the lunch crowd was very calm. lots of suits & low music -- from what i understand, much different than the night time scene. the sunda set combo (lunch specials with salad/miso soup & a standard roll,) looked pretty enticing, but everyone at the table ended up ordering sushi. to drink, i ordered some tea. they have about 12 varieties to choose from & it comes with the cutest little honey stick on the face of the earth. our table started off with a few appetizers. first, the rock shrimp tempura - YUM! this is a must order. so. good. we also shared the crispy brussel sprout salad (off the dinner menu.) i'm not typically a fan of brussel sprouts, but this salad was surprisingly delicious! i would definitely order it again. ...and then came the sushi. wah wah. i ordered the wa-machi & the firecracker, & also sampled the golden child & tail of two tunas from a friend's plate. everything sounded good on paper, but not every piece tasted fresh, and the flavor combinations were pretty bland & uninspiring. the firecracker was not spicy in the least bit & i couldn't taste the ginger in the wa-machi. i've also had much better mango rolls than the golden child. service was fine. if you're interested in cocktails & a scene, sunda might be the place for you. but if you're looking for some great sushi, venture elsewhere.
