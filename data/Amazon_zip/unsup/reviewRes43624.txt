Kinzie Chop House...daddy likes! Normally I don't go to fancy schmancy steakhouses, but it was a special occasion and I'd heard a lot of great things about this place, so I figured why not? I came with a group of around 10 and overall the experience was way above average. To start off we got the appetizer taster and all of the different foods it came with were great. Make sure to grab the blackened scallops before they're all gone. Of all of the apps, this was definitely my favorite. For dinner I got the NY Strip, which I thought was cooked to perfection. You also get a choice homemade sauce to go with your steak....GET THE GORGONZOLA CREAM! It was insanely good. For my side I got perfectly cooked asparagus with some outrageously good hollandaise sauce (my socks literally got knocked off). To go along with the great food, the service was excellent. I definitely will be back to this spot either on a date (relax ladies) or with a group. Very good job Kinzie. BOOOM!
