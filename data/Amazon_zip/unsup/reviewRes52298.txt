I went here with a group of friends one night. This place was hyped up to have some crazy-good deep dish pizza. The service was a little slow. The waiter finally gets to the point of taking our order and informed us the pizza takes awhile to cook, so we're like what's awhile? 1 hour!!!!! That is just insane! So we're thinking well crap, this must be damn good. We had a few 312s, and some appetizers that were good. It seemed like forever. Pizza finally arrives after an hour. So I bite in and I'm like meh... an hour for this? Totally subpar and really pricey. How did this possibly take an hour to make? What'd they have to cut down some special cheese tree and spank the sauce out of a monkey? Seriously. Will have to try some of these other options commented on (Giordano's or Lou Malnati's) next time I'm in Chicago. Can't imagine this could be a good place for kids. They'd freak waiting an hour for food. The scribbles on the wall were interesting and like someone else commented -- some were in some totally unreachable spots... could not be done by people eating here. Trying to be funny I suppose. Quality and price was funnier.
