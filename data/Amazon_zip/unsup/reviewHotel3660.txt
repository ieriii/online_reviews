I expected a tad more for the price we paid for our trip... It is a nice historic hotel but I'm a modern chick so this place was not for me. Nice hotel with a lot of history but so not my style. Next time I visit Chicago, I will stay somewhere else. One thing I do have to mention is that they had top-notch customer service.
