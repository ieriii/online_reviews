I'm not a huge fan of Italian food (I prefer Mexican), but I will definitely be back to Sapori. I had the Risotto Pescatore, which was loaded with seafood- they definitely didn't skimp! My date had the lobster ravoli with cream sauce, which was also delicious. It was a bit heavy for me, but good nonetheless. Desert was coconut sorbetto served in a coconut shell- the perfect ending to a filling meal! The only complaint I had is that when the waiter left us the desert menu, he came back sporadically to see what we would like to order. We were talking and waiting for our food to digest before ordering, and his periodic interruptions were a tad annoying, but he was doing his job.
