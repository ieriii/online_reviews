I came here in December for my birthday after painting down the street @ bottle and bottega, my night was awesome.The food was sooo good. I've been craving it thus far. the only reason why I say its somewhat pricey is because we enjoyed drinks. The mojitos were awesome! yum. a must try.we ordered a plate that was a combo of baby octopus and steak meat w/ fried platanos (bananas) on the side which were nice and sweet just like I like them. The plate was enough for a table of three. If your ready to eat good food with laid back , relaxed scene, come here.
