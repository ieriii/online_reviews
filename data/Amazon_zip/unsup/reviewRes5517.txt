One of the stops on my mother's birthday outing of eating. walking and shopping and was this place that I heard sooooo much about! We are huge fans of wine, charcuterie and outdoor seating and Purple Pig did NOT disappoint. It was a crisp day but 3 of us scored a lovely perch on the end of one of the communal outdoor tables that was just a smidge too far from the heater. It's ok b/c after that bottle of wine (that was a delight but the name escapes me) we were pleasantly warmed up! Our server was great, we loved all his suggestions and when our initial wine choice was not available, he suggested a few others and allowed us to sample before committing to a bottle - super cool. The grilled octopus was great, the pork neck bone rillettes were AMAZING, quite possibly b/c they were served with an apricot mostarda accompaniment - perfect match. We also had some manchego and fig spread, camembert, prosciutto & coppa. All went well with the wine. Even grabbed some dessert to go (consumed in the movie theater a bit later) the paninocon nutella - wow, what a rich, delicious concoction but best if eaten immediately since it is served warm. The menu had some awesome items on it and I can't wait to return and try some more goodies!
