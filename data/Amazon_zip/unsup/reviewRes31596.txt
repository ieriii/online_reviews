Having already indulged in a few mid afternoon libations at the Wit rooftop my girlfriend and I decided some food was in order before things got too crazy. What was intended as a simple refueling exercise quickly evolved into the best meal of our whole time in Chicago. The decor is what you'd expect from an Asian restaurant but classily executed and not overdone. The low lighting and subtle ambiance were soothing and suited our mood perfectly. The clientele were a mixed, well heeled crowd bar the chap next to us who looked like he'd mistakenly strayed from Viagra triangle. Realizing that we were perhaps a little tipsy and in need of some guidance our clever and charming server - Rachel - steered us to some amazing selections:  Hamachi with Jalapengo kicked things off beautifully. Artfully presented and deliciously flavorful. Next up the Buddha salad which is quite frankly knock your socks off good. The flavor of the rich crisp pork contrasting beautifully with the seared succulent ahi, crisp lettuce and sweet mango. Next sticky rice topped with with Ahi -a perfect combination of chewy crisp rice and delectable, silky ahi.  However if you ever go to Sundha and don't order the lobster roll with Waygu beef you will have missed something quite sublime. It was hands down the best thing I've eaten this year and caused my GF to proclaim that Sunda is amongst her all time top 5 dining choices. Ignore this suggestion at your peril. My final tip is to take as many of the small Red candies at the reception desk as you can possibly fit into your purse/pockets/cheeks -they are unbelievably good - but beware the scary green candies. Sunda we love you.
