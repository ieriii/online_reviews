The Bongo Room is possibly the best brunch spot in Chicago! My friend and I split the Chocolate French Toast Tower and the BLT Benedict, and both were amazing.The BLT Benedict was rich, but surprisingly not super heavy or overly salted. The Tower had a delicious milk chocolate sauce w/ a subtle flavor of banana and hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Not too much mascarpone, which the toast was supposedly stuffed with, but I didn't mind b/c I'm not a huge fan of mascarpone overload. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!
