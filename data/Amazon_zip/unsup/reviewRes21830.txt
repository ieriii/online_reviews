I love this place! I enjoy taking the family there, we usually watch a movie as we eat. We recenlty went on a cold day in December, I always have the superdawg with fries, and the super veggies which are fried veggies. My son always has the super shrimp which are jumbo fresh shrimp. He can never finish it. My husband has whatever he feels like tha day, he recently had the double burger and he can eat a lot but thought it was too much! My niece who I took there for the first time was so excited because she was able to wear her pjs and bring a blanket to watch a movie in the truck while she had her cheeseburger no cheese! That is exactly how she asked for it. The food never disappoints and on a good day you can even see a celebrity!
