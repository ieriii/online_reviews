I took my boyfriend here recently for his birthday. We'd talked about how we'd been wanting to try it so why not take him for his birthday dinner.  We were seated immediately and our waiter recommended great martini's. We were in the mood for something fun. The only thing I didn't care for about my waiter was he asked if we'd ever been there and we'd said no we'd never been to Kinzie Chophouse, but then he looked at us and said, have you ever been to a steak house? I was like really? But I moved on. We started with the Caesar salad, it was tasty. The croutons were interesting. Then I got the filet, it was delicious. We ordered the smashed potatoes, they weren't that good. I mean they were okay, but not great. I had mentioned that it was my boyfriends birthday in the reservation so we had some dessert brought out to us, I can't remember. The best part was when the waiter brought it to us and set it down he apologized because they had a new guy doing desserts and the cake said "Happy Bibday." I mean what's better then that. I'll go back just to see that again.  I can't wait to go back because the atmosphere was very cozy and warm and the food was definitely worth it.
