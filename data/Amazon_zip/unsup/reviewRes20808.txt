We were so excited to be able to try out Rick's new place. Both times we went for breakfast and the third time stopped by for the authentic Hot Chocolate and fresh made churros... delicious on a cold day! Try the Chorizo Egg Torta or the empandas for breakfast.. nice change from traditional breakfast... No wait in the mornings for breakfast as I heard the line gets long at lunch... we didnt make it back for the soups that are served after 3pm.. will put that on the list for next time. It is awesome to walk thru the line and watch the preparation as you order your food.. that kitchen is humming!
