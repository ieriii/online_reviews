Busted my superdawg cherry today. And sometimes your first time isn't so hot. It's an old-time American style drive-in, dipped in amber. I get it, I love it. All the performances and kit were spot on and naturalistic. The food was not so great. Our dawgs arrived squeezed into too-tight cardboard boxen, as if they had been readied for cross-country transport. The fries were like the packing peanuts, however I am delighted to report that they tasted at least twice as good as actual styrofoam. The softest part of the dawg meal is the bun, and these were effectively reduced in size to within a few millimeters of their maximum theoretical compression. Extraction was simplified by temporarily expanding the walls of the containment vessel with the car jack and plunging our fingers into the warm mustard and pickle brine. re the pickle. could have been crisper. Flavor would have been nice too. OK I hate myself now too so if I could just offer some constructive crit it'd be use bigger boxes, like KFC. Then you could lift your food out and use the box as a little tray. I'm still picking little green relish mites out of my sweater. Also I prefer red tomato slices. I know that's not the way they do it, no biggie. Well actually yes it is a biggie as that's the one fresh wet alive flavor you can put on a dog, everything else is salty smoky briny. Won't happen here, I know. What will happen here is a return visit. After all this, I'll actually return as a customer. I'll get a burger and shake and just bask in the reflected glory of those who have been graciously forgiving life's imperfections since 1948.
