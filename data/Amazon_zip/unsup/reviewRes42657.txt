This food is soooooooo good. I would go back by my lonesome like a super loser just to eat the cornbread by myself.  haha!  We went as a five-some, each ordering a different dish plus appetizers - definitely covering much of the menu.... meatballs, pasta, chicken, pot roast, something else.... oh! so good. All of it. The only problem was our very. stuffy. boring. non-smiling waitress. No response to a joke. Okay. The drinks were good. Pretty good wine portion. Not that I am a shot person, but FYI, this is A NO-SHOT-ZONE.... including the basement lounge were we were shoo'd when we were at our table for too long. that was also a little pretentious, asking us to leave, but hey. I guess that's what happens after they steal our hefty sum of a bill away (no it isn't really cheap). But, gosh darn it, the food was good!  Go if you have some extra cash and don't mind dry waitresses.
