Hmm, I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's good, ok, don't get me wrong, but I have yet to find anything special about this place that is of note or better than other BBQ joints I've tried. I figured this would be upscale Gold Coast BBQ...as would the prices, location, and decor suggest but that the redeeming factor would be the food. However, like many things in the Gold Coast, I feel as if it was kind of a tourist trap.  I will say the service was excellent, slow, but excellent in that we liked our server and the staff was attentive with water, sharing plates, silverware etc. The pickles and chips were a great touch at the beginning of the meal. From a sea of other appetizers we ordered (chicken wings, hush puppies, smoked salmon salad...the only highlight was the shrimp and grits...everything else was just not that good). One comment that will stick out in my mind...we asked, are the ribs fall of the bone? (For me, this is a warning question, like if you answer yes they are, I'm running out the door because I freaking hate that!) Our servers reply was, "When people ask for fall off the bone ribs, they're asking for overcooked ribs." Ok good, we are in for a good time, no fall off the bone boiled ribs for us!.  Funny thing is, I don't recall using a fork, knife, or my teeth for that matter at Chicago Q once to eat their ribs.....they were pretty much as fall off the bone as you can get.  I'm sticking with my neighborhood favorite Lillie's Q any day of the week. I miss their crispy edges and ribs I can actually use my teeth for.
