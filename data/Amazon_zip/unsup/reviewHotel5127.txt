DO NOT HAVE AN EVENT HERE! THEY SCREW UP BIG TIME!! I had a holiday work event here and Ken goofed everything up! It almost caused my job to be on the line. I don't know whether they just don't understand party planning or what but it was a bad experience! Furthermore, they blamed me like it was my fault and charged me for what they goofed. In addition, my friend recently had her wedding there (why I went through them) I will say the room was really pretty but later she told me the service was bad as well (unfortunately after my holiday party). She ordered drinks for her wedding that weren't there and the catering office and THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE gave her a hard time. She said none of her guests or friends will ever go to that hotel again because of how the awful demeanor of the hotel manager (a true unprofessional)! Stay clear, they do not know what they are doing here. Oh, and did I mention, you can tell the hotel staff things 3 times and they still won't get it?
