One word: Phenomenal. We dined at The Purple Pig on Friday night, outside, waited only a short amount of time and had about the best damn meal we could have asked for. We indulged a bottle of wine first, which was great, then off to the cheese. Our server knew just which soft cheese I would love and got us a type of goat cheese that was soo soft and delish. Next we tried the Peas and Bacon with Spearmint which was to die for. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the fried pig's ears but i sure was! I loved the combo of the peppers with the crispy ears and the fried egg on top. The Roasted Bone Marrow we'd heard over and over we HAD to try, so as the proper foodies we are, we obliged and were delighted!! I loved the salad and salt we were to top it off with. Who knew bone marrow was SOO good?? We also got the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes which was soo tender and tasty! After a second bottle of wine and 2 incredible desserts (the iris, and then the nutella/banana panini) we had to call it a night and left happy campers, only to rave to everyone through the weekend how amazing our dinner at The Purple Pig was!!
