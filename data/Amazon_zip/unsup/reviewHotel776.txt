I stayed at the Westin for three nights last week, and attended a beautiful wedding on the second floor. You get what you pay for, more or less, which is enough decadence to suit my demands. In terms of service, there is speed and professionalism. The beds are comfortable and the showers are wonderful. I like the free WSJ in the lobby.  The wedding was beautiful, and the food was much better than I could have hoped for. The view over Michigan Ave was picturesque. The only things that did not suit me were the patented Westin Scent in the lobby which was like a song stuck in my head, and there was no onsite hotel bar, which is often the best place in a hotel.
