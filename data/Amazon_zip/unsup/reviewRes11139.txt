A great place to go with a group. Delicious pizza options let you create whatever your heart (and tummy) desires! Plus, Piece has its own microbrewery and offered some great brews. Our favorites: the white pizza with italian sausage and goat cheese, and the white pizza with fresh tomatoes and basil. Yummers!
