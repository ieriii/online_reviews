My boyfriend and I went to Bonsoiree a couple nights ago to celebrate our anniversary. We were so excited to go here based on all the great reviews we had read. Unfortunately, the disappointment began right away. We were seated at a table by the bathrooms and kitchen. Needless to say, we had to yell over clanging dishes to have a conversation.But, we went with it, and ordered the four course menu. The first course was a warm salad of grilled frissee. The salad was fine. Kind of boring, but it was alrightThe next course was squash bisque with a medley of cauliflower. This soup was actually okay. It was the highlight of our gross dinner.The main course was a lamb loin chop. This was really where the meal went south. The lamb was completely disgusting. It was all fat! I was able to get 2 bites of meat out of the entire chop. I have had lamb many times before and this was horrible. Now on to the dessert- molten lava cake and apple and pear tart. The tart was fine. The molten lava cake was ordinary and had too many conflicting spices in it. Overall, I would say we were 100% disappointed. Perhaps we went on the wrong night, but we will definitely never go back there again. If you are looking for a great, classy BYOB restaurant, try May Street Market. It blew this place out of the water!
