Brought a bunch of my friends from Colorado here Friday night as they always enjoy a good beer. First off, the Bacon Fat Popcorn is a must for an app. I had my doubts when I first saw it on the menu---I'll admit I thought to myself why would I pad my bill with ordering popcorn (I can make that a home). I can admit when I'm wrong though, it waaas gooood. We all had burgers and thoroughly enjoyed them. The place has a wide selection of beers, but we drank Anti-Hero IPA all night. The waitress was nice, two of younger hostesses at the front were a little arrogant for my liking, but I was too busy talking to some random women while we were waiting to really care. I would recommend Revolution if your looking for a good beer and burger and want to out of the downtown area. I'll be back in Logan Square soon.
