Woke up from day drinking on Saturday at 9:45pm to find that we had missed the music festival that we had been pregaming for altogether and that we were intensely hung over. Fastforward 20 minutes of searching on yelp and a cab ride, and we find ourselves at lao sze chuan. Being hung over, we ordered the following: xiao long bao mapo tofu sizzling rice soup with chicken hot pot combination(for two) ...oh and two tsing tao beers. Considering the sheer number of dishes we ordered and the normal serving size of this place, the amount of food that we got was completely ridiculous. But, everything was really good. I especially loved the sizzling rice soup and the mapo tofu. I had also been craving hot pot, so it was great. the hot side of the combination is REALLY HOT. Being Asian, I had heard rumors that it would be hot before, but I underestimated other people's tolerances for spice, trusting my Asian upbringing to be above it all.....to a certain degree I guess it helped, but at one point i tried to drink a spoon of the spicy part of the soup and died. The only con would be that I would have loved to be able to order just one order of the hot pot and share it because we had gotten so many other dishes, but they insisted that we could not share...so we got two and did not finish nearly half our food
