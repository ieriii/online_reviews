I love this place. I'm glad I can get a table here without waiting for two hours anymore. The beer: excellent. The food: always excellent -- all of it, from the egg dishes to the burgers to the bacon fat popcorn. The service: also excellent--friendly without being overly chatty, and good at recommending delicious beers to pair with your food. I like to bring out-of-town guests here. It goes over well most times, but when I brought my brother and his friend, his friend, well, I'll never go out to eat with her again. She ordered steak and eggs, and she was upset that the steak wasn't tough and overcooked, because that's how she likes it. I tasted her steak and thought it tasted great; I offered to eat it for her so that I wouldn't have to hear her nonstop whining about it.
