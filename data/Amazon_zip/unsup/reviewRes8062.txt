If you were to look at me; you'd remark, to yourself hopefully, there's a man who can appreciate a good Brazilian steakhouse. Until very recently you'd have been wrong. For a pleasantly rotund fellow, I somehow managed to avoid ever setting foot in Fogo de Chao, Sal Carvao (when it was around), or Texas de Brazil: this feat is a minor miracle. That all changed on the occasion of my 31st birthday. As the birthday boy, I held the power of restaurant choice. A plethora of selections at my quite literal fork, I decided it was time to pop my churrascaria cherry. Praise BBQ Jesus, I have seen the light. With authentic Brazilian dudes in pirate pants wielding giant swords of meat, I dined like a competitive eater, except I wasn't shoving hot dogs and water soaked buns down my gullet, I was feasting on delicious meats, crispy fried polenta and mind blowingly soft cheese bread. Take that Nathan's and shove it, Joey Chestnut. One tiny complaint, the meats are a tad bit salty. Is it a Brazilian thing?
