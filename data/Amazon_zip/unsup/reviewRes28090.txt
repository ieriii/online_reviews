Easy no brainer choice. Always get the Margaritas instead of the mojitos. Put your name on the list and go to the bar just South and hustle tourists at pool while you are waiting. Always tell the tourists next to you that you have met Rick and he is awesome, then use the downstairs bathrooms, you must walk near the kitchen, through the expediters line to get there. If you see Mr. Bayless, which often time you will, run back, grab said tourist get their name, call out Rick in you best drunken Marguarita inspired voice, when he looks up say "Rick this is Elly Mae, she would love to meet you", then quickly vanish. Now, said tourist will be so glowing from her brush with celebrity, she will buy a round for your table, caution this only works once per visit. Often times Rick and his wife will be dining in Frontera towards closing time, they don't like to be bothered.
