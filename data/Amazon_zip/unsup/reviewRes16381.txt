This place is positively divine. I used to live across the street so I had the luxury of avoiding the ridiculously long Saturday night wait. In other words, I would go on a Wednesday night... Pick a new drink every time you go, and bring good company because you should plan to stay a while. Don't forget your wallet because the drinks start at $12 a pop but they are worth it. Also, sit at the bar. I haven't ever had a server I cared for much. In fact, some I've wondered if they were retarded. No offense?
