I've been here twice, both on a Friday and a Saturday and neither time it was too crowded. On Friday there was about a 45 min wait for dinner, but there was plenty of space at the upstairs bar to drink a beer or two beforehand (isn't that the thing you want to do most, anyway?) Obviously the beer is good, and it isn't overpriced. The food is also delicious, and this is perhaps the only place in chicago that does moules et frites. It generally attracts a diverse crowd, people of all ages and personality types, so it's good both for mingling and for talking amongst friends. The only complaint I could make is that they wouldn't give us any nuts or stuff like that when we asked for some (around 1:30 am, well after kitchen closed).
