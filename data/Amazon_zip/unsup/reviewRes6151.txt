This place is wow, so good!! I had a trio of filet Mignon with different crusts on top, and wow they were amazing. I chose the blue cheese, Parmesan, and mushroom. I thought that for sure the cheesy ones would be my absolute favorites, but the mushroom was really enjoyable. The filets were cooked to perfection and as tender as could be. My boyfriend had the pork chops, and they were just as fantastic and were also flavored with the mushroom crusts. Wow. I will definitely be going back here especially because they have a mac and cheese on the menu that I didn't get to try. The portions here are pretty big, but I promise you will be happy about that. They have many great salads, apps, desserts, and of course classic steak house sides. Definitely go check this place out, and soon!! Oh, and make reservations. Especially on the weekends!! There is the possibility of a loong wait.
