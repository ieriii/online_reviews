Gimme MORE! This place was not only amazing but almost overwhelmingly delicious! Now only was there a large array of meat, cooked to perfection, but the salad bar was fantastic as well! They gave choices of risotto, pasta, sushi, soup, salad, and more at the salad bar and the meat never stopped coming! You can definitely get your money's worth here and it's perfect for group dates. Your boyfriends will love it!
