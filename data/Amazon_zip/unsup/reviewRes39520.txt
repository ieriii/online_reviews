Went to Longman & Eagle after hearing my roommates talk over and over again about how badly they wanted to visit as well as right after reading an article about the restaurant in GQ. They have an amazing whiskey selection and an above average list of beers. If you come here in the evening you will get acquainted with them quickly because they don't take reservations and seemed to stay consistently busy. You'll do some waiting. It's worth it though. I had the pork chop/shrimp/hush puppies. Pork chop had a great marinade and was cooked perfectly. The shrimp was very flavorful. I was a bit disappointed in the hush puppies. I'm guessing since I fell in love with Long John Silver's hush puppies as a kid nothing else will ever compare. Either way...great service, great food, great options, and great overall vibe. I will be back.
