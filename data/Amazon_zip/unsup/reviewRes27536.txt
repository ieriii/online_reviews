High highs and mediocre lows (considering the price point). I got the Wednesday special which was a marinated pork roasted in banana leaves, served with black beans and a red chile sauce. This may have been the best mexican dish I've ever eaten in my life. It also comes with a side of habanero salsa that is literally too spicy to enjoy even if you dip only the tip of one tine of your fork in it. Two people at my table got the alaskan salmon with a peanut sauce. Reaction was mixed; one strongly in favor and one unsure of what she thought. Not being much of a peanut enthusiast myself, I was unable to comment. Also, the flank steak was pretty well received at my table. The appetizers were fairly disappointing to our group. The guacamole is fantastic, although a smallish serving for a $10 appetizer. The queso fundido is not your typical fundido, and the sharp cheddar (which i was surprised to see here) had kind of a funky effect on the dish. We also got a yellowfin tuna ceviche which I was extremely disappointed in; it felt unseasoned, with no real citrus to speak of. It also bears mention that they make the best mojito I have ever tasted. I love Rick Bayless, and I would definitely come back here on a Wednesday for the special and a mojito. However it seems that the buzz over this place has escalated it past the point of reasonability. I'm sure I wouldn't line up at 4:30pm for a 5:30pm seating again.
