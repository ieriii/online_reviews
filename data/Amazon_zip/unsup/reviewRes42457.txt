For those that like pizza.... This little place has Chicago's best pizza. It has that American Pie-Stifler and the gang eat here after school feel to it, with huge, greasy, big cheesy slices...or any other type of pizza you may like. Like several of my ex's they deliver quickly, and they're cheap. Excellent. And they just may have the best deep dish pizza humans have ever tasted.
