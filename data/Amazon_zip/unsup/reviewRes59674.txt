This is the single worst experience I've had in a restaurant. Our party started the evening by being denied the service of any alchohol. Without explanation or acknowledgement even, we forged ahead with the meal, hoping the quality of the food would make up for the less than sane decision making process of general manager, and practacing champaign Nazi, Jenny Estes. Alas! Crazy Jenny Estes pailed in comparison to the charms of head Chef, Jorge Fernandez. This child decided to garnish one of our meals with 5 large black hairs from his own head. Fernandez admitted with a grin that the hair belonged to him. 5 out of our 11 entrees arrived incorrectly prepared, one was missing entirely. We ended the evening with a visit from our friends, the Chicago Police, who had been alerted to our lack of excitement with the staff of this establishment. They supported us 100% and explained to the remarkably simple Jenny Estes and Jorge Fernandez that we wouldnt be paying them for anything. I could go on to recount the rest of the appalling details of the evening, but I find it upsetting to recall how hostile and uncomfortable we were made to feel.
