I like it like that... Being a frequent visitor to Cuban cafes in Miami & NY... this is by far the best Cuban food in Chicago. I went on a Saturday for an early dinner and as I walked up to the place they were roasting a pig right outside that smelled so good you wanted to just take a bite... Everything was so good and the service was friendly. The only down side was that it seemed like our server was a little overwhelmed with tables, but we were in no rush so it wasn't a big deal. Great for groups or a date.
