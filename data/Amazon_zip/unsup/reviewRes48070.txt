I can't believe I have taken so long to write a review of this place. I was here back in December with a friend and we had a great time. My friend and I are both foodies and were really looking forward to diving in to a few of the dishes.  I like the idea of the communal seating but I will admit, it was nice they gave us a table for two so we could talk a bit easier and we weren't butting elbows with strangers.  We started off with a variety of oysters that were delectable. Then we moved on to the charcuterie plate that features head cheese and a foie gras terrine. Blood sausage and duck hearts soon followed. The beer...well we just asked our fabulous server (I"m soooo sorry I don't remember her name) to just pour what she liked with what we were eating and she did an admirable job.  It was a great time and we will be back since there is so much more on that menu I want to try.
