I went to Coast for a friend's birthday recently and LOVED it! And it's nice to go to a more upscale restaurant that is BYOB. They get five stars for the Dragon roll alone. Not super traditional, but it is fantastic! My mouth waters just thinking about it. I also enjoyed the Sunrise roll. I wish they delivered to my neighborhood... Can't wait to go back!
