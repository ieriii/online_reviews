I got the Gnocchi Asiago, and it was phenomenal. Would recommend it to anyone. The beer was cold, not pricey at all ($4 for a Stella), and the server was polite, knowledgeable, and speedy. My friend got the thin crust pizza, which he claimed to be the best in the city, and while I may not go as far as giving it that much credit, it was pretty damn good, no question. His wife got something that I guess wasn't cooked all the way, but they took it back and brought her a new dish in a matter of minutes with no issues from what I could see. Parking wasn't bad, but we got lucky in finding a street spot, but otherwise I could see that being a pain.
