By far one of th best restaurant experiences I have ever had in the city. Yes, yes , the food is AMAZING! I had an wonderful ceviche, Tuna cocktail with mangos, and a succulent carne asada. Did I mention the mango basil mojitos? But, it so rare that you sit at your table and think "my waiter is just awesome." (Thanks Tom!) We got there at 4:30pm and waited in line for the doors to open at 5pm (we were already 45th in line by then but we were given a table at 6. Which was better than the 3.5 wait that was given to new arrivals by the time we left.)
