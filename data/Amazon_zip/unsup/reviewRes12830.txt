LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE I went here with a group of people, and it was incredible. The salad bar had things that I had never even heard of, the sushi bar was a pleasant surprise. The circular card (green on one side and red on the other) became my best friend, lover, and my soul mate in just moments! The ginger ale is refreshing and very worth it. My boss and co-workers from Toronto were in town and I suggested this go here before heading back. They went two nights in a row!! They loved it that much. I will close out with the same heart felt emotion that I felt when I started.. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
