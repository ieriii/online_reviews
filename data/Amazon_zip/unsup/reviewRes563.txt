I registered Yelp for a long time but always too lazy to write reviews. I really want to give my first one to Alinea although I went there awhile back. It's the best meal I've ever had. Taste, atmosphere, decoration, service are excellent. Creativity is amazing. Every course is like an art piece. Me and my fiancee were debating to do 12 or 27 courses when we booked and finally we chose 27 courses tour menu. It's a long tour, enough time to fly coast to coast, but it's an incredible experience. We're exciting to wait for the next course. They use different tools and effects to enhance the dinning experience. I highly recommend the 27 courses meal. I felt bad for the people sat next to us who only had 12 courses and didn't know what my other 15 courses taste like. Yes, it's pricey but it's worth every pennies.
