No reservations accepted. I love this place. I've loved it for years. I loved it when they first opened. I'll always love Grand Lux. It's Cheesecake Factory but different with more variety. It's the same owners. The food is fantastic, the portions are huge, the price is reasonable, and the desserts are PHENOMENAL! Must try: the beignets, the molten lava cake, and the box of freshly baked cookies... everything is amazing but those 3 desserts are by far my favorites. I love the look of the restaurant as well. It is warm and romantic. I love sitting in the rotunda and watching people on Michigan Avenue below me... walking, shopping... the street shows like the people painted in silver and gold doing robot moves... the horse drawn carriages, and the twinkling of the lights on the magnificent mile. It is magnificent. I love Chicago.
