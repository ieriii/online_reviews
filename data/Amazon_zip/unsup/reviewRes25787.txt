Delicious! the owner is so friendly and asks everyone to call him Uncle. He serves up delicious food - some of my faves are the seafood noodles, king crab noodles (order with wide rice noodles), the Simply IT beef (so tender and juicy), the beef salad...the homestyle vietnamese is really good too. the Banh Xeo is really tasty - i love the crunch of the crepe and the freshness of the lettuce, sprouts and shrimp, so yummy. In the heart of Lincoln Park, fresh, tasty and reasonably priced, and BYOB!
