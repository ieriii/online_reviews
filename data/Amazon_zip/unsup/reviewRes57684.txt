Yeah so this place is ridic. I've been coming here my whole life, with friends, family, dates, for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and it never disappoints. I'm not a particularly picky eater, but my family is, and when we have relatives visit from Mexico this is the first place we take them. And everyone loves it. The Carne asada is my absolute favorite, but seriously anything on the menu is legit.I kind of wish it had a better ambiance, but whatever, we're there to eat not stare at the walls, right? Good company and BYOB creates all the ambiance one needs anyways.If you have a choice I'd recommend sitting in the back room. The front room gets kind of loud and space is tight, especially when a line forms. I hate waiting in that line, feeling like I'm hovering over someone while they eat. And eating while someone is standing next to your table looking at what's on your plate is kind of annoying. For sure try to get there during off-peak hours.
