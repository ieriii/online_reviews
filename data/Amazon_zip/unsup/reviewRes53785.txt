This place is a classic and a must to go at least once in your life even if your not into Jazz. I took some visitors from out of town who wanted to experience a great Jazz joint The Green Mill is the first place I thought of. The Mill gets very crowded so if you want a seat go early. They have great drinks of all kinds and the staff is usually great. Different acts to see and just a over all great experience.
