A great lil' boutique-style place to stay in Chicago - terrific and personalized service from a genuinely nice staff (they printed out our schooner tickets for us at the front desk), and a great restaurant, the Atwood Cafe, with an amazing bartender (Ray) and a first-rate executive chef (Derek Simcik), really made this a place that we were tempted not to leave at all! In the end, we did wind up going out, though, since the hotel is within walking distance of attractions like Millennium Park, the Theater District (got 11th-hour tickets to Alison Krauss's only show at the the Chicago Theater totally by accident - we only knew she was there because we could read the marquee from our room!), and the Chicago Institute of Art (with its amazing new wing). Definitely worth checking out!
