I am a huge Bayless fan -- I used to love his show on PBS, and have cooked so many things from Authentic Mexican or based on what I learned from it. The weekend I was in town, It just made sense to brave the notoriously horrendous hordes of people and get fed by the man himself. When we showed up we were told it would be 2 hours but that we should come back in an hour and check in. So after leaving our name and milling about for a bit., we returned as instructed and they sat us in about 15 minutes (so our actual wait time was 1 hour and 15). The whole getting seated bit was as annoying as expected, so steel yourself if you want to try Frontera out. I ordered the quesadillas capitalinas, the tortas, and the platanos con crema. ALL WERE DELICIOUS. I had never heard of the tortas -- I actually asked if they were a sandwich (which they're not). Instead, they were these cheese croquettes, mixed with sweet corn, rolled in greens, breaded and then fried. They were served with a red pepper sauce and fresh greens on top. My dining companions ordered the tacos (with portobello mushrooms) and the carne asada. Happily, they make a specialty cooler (agua del dia) for those of us who don't do well with the spirits. The evening I went, it was this refreshing cucumber-lime thing, that was a perfect companion for my meal. I'd love to try and do it again when I'm in town next, although I have to confess that their reservation policy and the wait for walk-ins bumps them down from a 5-star experience for me. They ought to figure out a better way to accommodate their patrons, because that's all that keeps Frontera Grill from being a perfect Mexican lover's destination.
