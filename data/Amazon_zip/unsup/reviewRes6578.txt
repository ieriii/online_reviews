I wish I could give negative stars to this place. I'd give it negative 100. My husband and I ordered its delivery. Not only they forgot to give us coleslaw as side and the sauce that's supposed to come with the rib, the worst part is that my husband got food poisoning after that! He still couldn't eat any solid food. It's either his rib was under-cooked, or the pickle we paid $5 for (which by the way, only had less than 10 pieces in it) was spoiled. For a place with such establishment, I cannot believe this happened. Will. Never. Be. Back.
