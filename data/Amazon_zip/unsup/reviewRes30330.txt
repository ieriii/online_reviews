I am in love with fake meat Ruben sandwiches.. real ones are OK but Chicago diner's seitan Ruben has it going on! I scarfed down my sandwich so fast it was hilarious the waitress did a double take!! My brother seemed to like his veggie lasagna, my sister did not like her enchilada's but she's not really used to veggie food.... I tried them and they were just OK.... The cake is yummy and you can get it at whole foods! good for veg-heads and meat lovers alike! I should know I'm bi-foodual! :) lol
