What a great place to feel some American Nostalgia! Simple American fair... deep fried vegetables? Naturally cased pure beef hot dogs? black cows? You bet! and everything is good to boot. Park and eat in the car or at one of the few covered picnic tables..either way, you'll enjoy looking up and seeing the 50's chic restaurant and two giant hot dogs with eerily creepy eyes and arms. I have had a slightly better Chicago style dog, but the atmosphere here makes up for it 10 fold.
