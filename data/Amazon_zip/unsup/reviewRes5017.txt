50 bottles of wine for under $40...at a 4 star tapas restaurant....nuff said. This place is great and they are always making changes to their menu to keep it fresh.  If you want the deviled egg....come at around 4:30 and make sure you place your order because it's amazing and they only make a small number of them everyday!  Also, the pig ears....yes pig ears are amazing and their signature dish is really the milk braised pork shoulder. Get that and a nice glass of their Rose and you'll have a good time. For dessert they have this chocolate fried dough concoction that I can't remember the name of...but get it! It's sooo good. Try that with a glass of their dessert wine and you won't regret it.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the service isn't always great...and by service, I mean the one shorter and very thin hostess. She always seems miserable and put out by any question you ask. The servers and bartenders have always been very good and attentive, but the one hostess is just unhappy with life in general...so hopefully you wont get her when you go. Bottom line is this....miserable hostess or not this place deserves a stop or two for sure. Jimmy Bannos Jr. is the chef and he's young and inspired. Bring a bunch of friends and have a good time.
