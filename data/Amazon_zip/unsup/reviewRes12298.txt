I dined at Cafe 28 on a Sunday morning in January. The food here, I was told, was spectacular and Cuban. The temperature outside was about 9 degrees F. I was definitely ready for some soul- and body-warming Cuban grub. The restaurant itself was beautiful. Upon entering, we were greeted by a trio in the corner of the front dining area, playing lively Carribean-tinged jazz. The place was sunny and warm and it smelled great. It turns out that the breakfast menu is closer to a "traditional" American breakfast menu than a Cuban one. I did manage to get some roasted pork (in an omelet, I believe, though the meal was not that memorable) and some plantains, which were good, if not great. My companions seemd to enjoy their meal, and I'd come back again.
