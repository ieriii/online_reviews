Not horrible, but not worth what you pay. The food is a few dollars more expensive per item than other comparable places. The beer was good, but the uncomfortable seating and overpriced, tasteless food makes thus place forgettable. I have not and will not choose to eat here again. Sad. I live so close. I'd rather go around the corner to Dunlays any day of the week.
