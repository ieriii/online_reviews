The rooms are decidedly worn down, but the view is phenomenal. If they were to upgrade the rooms they would charge three times as much per night -- so bear that in mind if you decide to stay here. It comes down to what you care about more: staying in a very nice room or staying in a historic hotel with an amazing view for a very reasonable price. I would totally stay here again.
