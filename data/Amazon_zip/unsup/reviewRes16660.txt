I went here for the lunch buffet. The food was very delicious! I am a new comer to Indian food, and I hadn't tried any that really made me love it until now. My Favorites: Chicken Tikka Marsala : My favorite(good, and spicy) Nann: the garlic was just right Tanadorri Chicken: wow, this stuff is super tasty Some Mashed brown bean type stuff: my favorite after Chicken Tikki Marsala The rice pudding for dessert was very good also. Overall, a good value for $16 if you are really hungry. I will be back!! P.S. Sorry, I don't know how to spell any of the names of the food I ate, but go eat them! You will be happy you did!
