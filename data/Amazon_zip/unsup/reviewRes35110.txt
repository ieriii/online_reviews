I have been coming to Shaw's since I was a lowly college student a hundred years ago, but this place remains one of the best restaurants anywhere! I can't say enough about the service, the atmosphere--in the dining room as well as the oyster bar, the drinks and the food. Oh man, the food. So I had no hesitation in trying Shaw's brunch one fine Sunday morning. One word: WOW! Our server was courteous, professional, knowledgeable and genuine. He made my man and I so eager to try everything in the joint. For brunch Shaw's offers a wide selection of seafood delights, traditional breakfast favorites, fried shrimp and crab cakes, a make-your-own omelette and waffle station, and a carving station with filet mignon. Really?  BTW, the oysters were as good as always and disappearing as quickly as the servers could bring them out. And, I loved the cerviche, king crab legs, and sushi selections.  Shaw's also offers a make-your-own Bloody Mary and mimosa bar with blood red orange juice. That's really all I had to say right? Sure.... Don't let me forget the dessert room off to the left side of the dining room. Almost everything in there was edible and delectable. Sheer poetry. I could not have asked for more. And the price? Surprisingly reasonable given all that is offered. Shaw's is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend you checking it out! Thanks Ferris.
