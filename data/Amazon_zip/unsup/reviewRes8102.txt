They served me as though I was a queen! Imagine: You flip a card over, and servers just come floating over to you and asking if he (I didn't see any female servers) could offer you a slice of meat -- beef, lamb, chicken, pork, sausage... OMG. It was overwhelming at first. I had to quickly flip my card over so that they stop bombarding me with meat. My friend said that she'd only eat the salad here (as opposed to anywhere else, not that she'd only eat salad and not meat -- she claims she's a carnivore), but I thought the salad bar was just okay. Sure, the mozzarella cheese was good. Sure, the artichokes were good... and the prosciutto... and... Hmm, ok, the selection were good, but it was still just ok. Yeah, it's definitely better than Fresh Choice (it was a lot more fresh!), but y'know, it's not as if I'm super impressed by their salad bar.  The red and white sangrias were also "just okay." I didn't like see the sugar at the bottom of the glass. I think it was a little disturbing. Want sangrias? Go to Cafe Iberico down the street. Theirs is better. We also ordered the papaya cream dessert. That was alright. I'm lactose-intolerant and two spoonfuls gave me a stomachache later on that evening. I guess that means it was good. Come here for the meat and the awesome service. Everything else is just mediocre. Even their mashed potato, fried banana, and what's-that-other-dish was a little below mediocre. It was disappointing because I actually like mashed potato.
