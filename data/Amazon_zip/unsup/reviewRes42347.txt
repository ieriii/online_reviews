Great, but not amazing (I visited a while ago). We were pretty happy with the Pan Roasted Salmon and Pork Meatballs, but the Gunthorp Chicken was a bit undercooked at the center (for the breast or drumsticks). The Belgian/French fries were excellent, of course, and the garlic mayonnaise was never enough. Chase everything down with some great beer, and you have a pretty good overall experience.
