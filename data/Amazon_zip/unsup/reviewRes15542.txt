From the sleazy hole-in-the-wall exterior to the elegant, streamlined interior, the Violet Hour follows a theme of the insides outdoing the outside. The drinks, while modest in appearance and expensive in price ($12 a drink!!), are incredibly unique, refreshing and intriguing in flavor. The drink combinations are inexplicably tasty even when they sound like the exact opposite. The cheese is pricey and you barely get any. The home-made crackers were interesting. Go for the drinks and ambiance, skip the edibles. There are tons of places around Wicker Park that can do food. Only the Violet Hour can do the drinks they specialize in.
