My lady told me this was one of her favorite breakfast/brunch spots a few years ago....We thought it would be a good idea to stop by this morning. I could see before we entered that it was jammed packed. We were in luck because there was a table for 2 available. Our waitress was really nice as she came and made sure we placed an order for drinks. We both went with the strawberry mimosa which was really good. I was starving so I was ready to order immediately. I went with the Wishbone Omelet which included potatoes, onions, cheddar cheese and salsa. The omelet was very good as it came with cheese grits and toast...yum!!! I also ordered a side of Chicken Apple Gouda Sausage which was basically one piece for $2.95. Very juicy and very good! Wish more came with it. My girl got the Red Eggs which includes two eggs any style on corn tortillas bordered with black beans, cheese, chili ancho sauce, scallions, sour cream and salsa. The black beans took up 50% of her plate. She said it was delicious. The decor of the place is really cool as they have light fixtures in the shape of eggs and the walls are purple and yellow. I wanted to give 5 stars, but they brought us the check just because our plates were empty. We actually wanted another mimosa..we were rushed out basically. No one asked or anything, just brought the check. Will return and will have my eye on the shrimp & grits
