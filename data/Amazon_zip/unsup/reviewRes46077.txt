I can no longer count the number of times I've eaten at the Grand Lux Caf, all I know is I can't remember one bad experience. Well, maybe the first one, but that was only because I was broke and couldn't get what I really wanted. Located in the center of Chicago's Magnificent Mile, directly on Michigan Ave, this place is probably going to considered a landmark before long. It seems that no matter when I go, there's either no wait, or a very short one, which is unbelievable because the place is ALWAYS packed. The ambiance is upscale and classy, definitely good for dates or business lunches, and the view from the window seating is very scenic. Food is quite awesome and reflects the atmosphere or the restaurant, and the staff is as professional as they come. If there's any downside it's that you have to pay for parking (garage or valet), and that this isn't a place you visit on a budget.
