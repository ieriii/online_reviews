Ok, this place seems to be the place to go with the kids in the know when in Chinatown. To be honest , it probably did produce the best food I've eaten in the neighborhood. The downside, it was crowded as hell and the service was crappy. The server delivered one of our 3 entrees 15 minutes before the others were ready, and forgot to bring a side of spring rolls we ordered. The food, on the flip side was very good, I especially loved the selection. It was probably the biggest Chinese menu I've seen in my entire life. It was chock full of obscure goodness like frog dishes and clam dishes. We started with potstickers, which were perfect as far as I'm concerned. The crab rangoon was very good, but I haven't really had standout crab rangoon in years. My date ordered the Seafood combo lo mein , I thought it was a solid good. I've had way better Chinese seafood, but it did the job. The beef fried rice was very good, standard but very good. The real star of the show , as far as I'm concerned was the salt and pepper lamb. If your neighborhood Chinese places carried this dish, it might make it into my rotation of dishes I always order, it was great! So to sum up, if you aren't a service snob, the food here was pretty damn good, just make sure you keep bugging that server for what you ordered.
