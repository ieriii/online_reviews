My friend had been raving about Piccolo Sogno for a while so we finally made plans to meet there one night with another friend. I remember going there when it was Timo and I was eager to see the latest incarnation. The decor is simple and classy, the bar was packed, so was the restaurant and the atmosphere was lively. Since I was a little late, they had already gotten the party started with a tantalizing antipasti plate and a nice bordeaux, which we were allowed to bring for a nominal corkage fee. Sublimely roasted asparagus, caulfilower, tomatoes, carrots, portabella mushrooms and zucchini adorned the plate and delighted our tastebuds. I was informed that we were having the steak and pasta for an entree so I surreptitiously unbuttoned my jeans to make more room. When the server brought out our entrees I felt as if I had been teleported back to medieval times! My eyeballs had to be placed back into their sockets because I have never seen a piece of meat this huge in my entire life! I was informed it was a porterhouse and we were going to share it... thank God. This delicious piece of meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection and I don't do rare steak, but this was absolutely delectable. We also shared two sides of pasta-- savory butternut squash ravioli and a mouth-watering ribbon pasta with a red meat sauce that were just out of this world. I don't know how I found room for the sorbet , but I did. This was a great time! Service was impeccable, we had an awesome table near the window and the chef even came over to see how we were enjoying our meal. A great place for couples and large parties. They should have wheelbarrows near the doors because you have to be rolled out of here after a meal. I'm sure they'll be jam-packed with holiday parties this December.
