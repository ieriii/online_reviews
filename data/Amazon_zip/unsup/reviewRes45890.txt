I have been to the Grand Luxe twice and have been had great experiences. Last night, my fiance and I were seated in the circular room. It over looked the Magnificent Mile and had a high ceiling with hand paintings and awesome lights. I had the Grand Luxe Margarita which was tasty, definitely could taste the tequila but for 12.00? That was a little pricey for me. We had the deep fried potato spring rolls with sour cream, they were fantastic. My fiance had the BBQ chicken, which came with jalapeno cheese cornbread, fries and coleslaw. I loved the coleslaw but the cornbread had too much jalapeno. I had the Grand Cobb Salad and it was huge! It had fresh romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, bleu cheese, bacon, avocado, chopped boiled eggs covered in a tomato vinaigrette. It was so good, I couldn't finish it. Great service, huge portions, good food, & a great location!
