Stayed at the W City Centre over the marathon weekend, and had mixed feelings. The location was perfect for the marathon as it was close to the start and finish, and it is very close to the theatre district as this was convenient for when I went to "wicked". Travellers must note that this hotel is located in the Financial district. On weekends, it's a ghost town around there, not many things like restaurants, cafes or shops are open. I would stay north of the river around the Magnificent Mile, that is where al the "hubub" is. Rookie Mistake! As for the actual hotel, the room was tiny (not surprised). If you check into a W dont expect a spacious room. The washroom amenties were top notch, and of course the Bed was Heavenly. The rooms were very chic, but the walls are paper thin, nothing more pleasant than hearing the person in the next room going to the washroom. The concierge staff at the hotel was below average. I always felt like they had no clue. Either that, or they couldn't be bothered to make an effort. The front desk staff were excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. If not for them, I would have downgraded the hotel. The restaurant at the Hotel was disguisting. The food was brutal and the service was even worse. I don't ask for much, but when I say Thank-you please acknowledge me. When I ask for some water, please acknowledge me. When I am ordering from the menu please look at me. The lobby is one of the coolest places. The design and ambience is very funky. It's kind neat checking into a room and having people ordering martini's a few steps away. Whiskey Blue is a fun place to hang out, as well. Overall, I don't think I'd come back. Unless, you need to be close to the financial district.....stay at or near the Mag Mile, and maybe pop in for a cocktail at Whiskey Blue one night.
