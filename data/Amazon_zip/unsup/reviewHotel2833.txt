Plan your Chicago wedding here! I have always dreamed of being married and hosting a reception downtown, but when looking at hotels downtown packages are out of this world. For all those who have the same dream, but are a little shell shocked when looking at the prices please check out the Embassy Suites - Downtown Chicago on State street. They have very reasonable packages and I'm positive the staff is the friendliest in the world. The wedding "guru" is the sweetest lady and she will work with you to make sure your day goes smoothly. You will not regret it! They have been so good every step of the way! Please spread the word as well. I believe in Free marketing
