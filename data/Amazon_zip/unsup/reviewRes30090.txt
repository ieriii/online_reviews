This place has it's hit or miss dishes, but overall, this place rocks! My recommendations: Veggie Meatloaf Veggie Country Fried Steak Dagwood (although a bit salty) The Halfpipe (if you like fried food) Friendly service. Great food! If it's your birthday, you also get a free cake or shake. My boyfriend got the vegan PB and chocolate cake on his bday. It was actually REALLY amazing.
