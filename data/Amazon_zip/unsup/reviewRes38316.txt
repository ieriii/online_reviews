Best food. The brisket sandwich, the ham and gruyere, the mussels (belgium style)... and the best beer on tap. I highly suggest the Leffe Brune, Sprecher Black Bavarian... The bartenders and wait staff are very knowledgeable and super friendly and if you tell them what you like they will find something new for you to try. The crowd is very low key, and also usually very friendly and willing to offer you advice on what to try next. The music is always the right music at the right level. I have never been disappointed and i eat and drink there at least once  a week for the last 2 years. Did i mention the frites and aioli?
