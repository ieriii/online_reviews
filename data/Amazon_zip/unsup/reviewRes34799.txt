I have been going to Sushi X for 4 years. Actually i have been taking carry-out 99.9% of time. I got hooked on them because some time back this was the only place in the neighborhood which was open till 2am so there was never a problem of getting sushi late at night. The three times i have had dinner there were really nice as well. Some of my favorite things there include crab cakes, rainbow, caterpillar, honey, spider and godzilla rolls. I give them five stars because they have maintained the quality of seafood and because they care to update their menu from time to time with interesting innovations.
