My recent stay at this hotel was *terrible*. The hallways were dirty, the room was in terrible disrepair, with paint chipped on the tables, threads hanging loose on the lampshades, the headboard falling off the wall, and dust on the desk supplies. The room as a whole was small and cave-like. The worst experience though, was with the staff, one of whom tried to enter the room while I had the "do not disturb" sign up. (thank god for the chain!) I was really shocked at the really poor quality of such a high-priced hotel, and will never be staying there again.
