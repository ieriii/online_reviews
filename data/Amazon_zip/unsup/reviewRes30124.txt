Just got back from lunch at Frontera and boy was it tasty. I called at 10:30 and got a reservation for 1:15, walked in at 1 with no wait. We started with the tuna ceviche which tasted great but the texture of the tuna wasn't for us. I got the Cazuela de Borrego, lamb in a tomatillo sauce, which i thought was really awesome. My mom got the pork tacos which was also pretty rad.  Our total was 75 bucks with a margarita and two michelada. It seemed like there was little or no wait while we were there.
