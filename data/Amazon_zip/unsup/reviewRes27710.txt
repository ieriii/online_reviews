Note to self: if you want to make out with someone, do NOT eat the garlic marshmallows at Graham Eliot beforehand. They are INTENSE. However, if you want a sexy flavor explosion in your mouth, go right ahead and order it, knowing you're gonna be on your own for the evening. I had dinner here for the third or fourth time last night. I did the tasting menu, and Graham was in the house. Everything was beautifully executed and while a few of the flavors were a bit overpowering, overall the meal was great. I was actually surprised by how large the portions were considering that it was a "tasting menu". I would've rather paid $50 for smaller portions than the $75 for such a HUGE meal. Service was good and informative (and SUPER enthusiastic). My only complaint (and maybe it's just 'cause I was being a cheap-ass) is that I wanted to see more wines in the $50-60 price range. I know it's a tough hole to fill, but it's what I could afford last night and the selection at that price is fairly minimal. But OVERALL--the place has sweet ambience, the food is solid, and it IS a good date place, garlic marshmallow or no.
