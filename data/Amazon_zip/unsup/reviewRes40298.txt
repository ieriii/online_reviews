So simple, yet SOOO GOOD! I love a good taco, especially after a night out with friends, but La Pasadita is not just any taco joint. I've actually left a bar early with friends to get our Pasadita on, in fear that they might run out of meat. Believe me when I tell you, it happens. And all you're left with is a broken heart, an empty stomach, and lengua.  Before La Pasadita, my idea of a "great taco" was "the more, the merrier": lettuce, tomato, cheese, rice, beans, guacamole, etc. NEVERMORE. I like my tacos simple (onions and cilantro), which leaves more room for the good stuff, THE MEAT. Oh that carne asada is so good! The way they cook the meat with so much flavor, you don't need the "etc" to spice up the dish. And don't forget about the barbacoa. So tender and fatty, you'll need a chaperon to keep you in check. What the hell...EAT AWAY!
