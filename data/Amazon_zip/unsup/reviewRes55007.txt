I was stuck between a 3 and 4 star review. If you come here, do not get the meatball sandwich. With that being said, the reason for the 4 star review if the beer selection, and the service. I made the mistake of going in the middle of the afternoon, drinking 8-10 beers and walking out into the bright bright daylight. WOWOverall a good place, next I will get something else to eat
