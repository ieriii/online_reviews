I am not a steak person (not sure if that makes this a credible review), but I normally don't like steak. I had the petit filet and it was wonderfully delightful. We also had a bottle of red wine and it was a great paring. The place is pricey, but it's worth every penny, because I had a wonderful and memorable experience.
