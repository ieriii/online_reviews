Went here for a birthday brunch for two of my friends and it was so much fun! The food was delicious! I had the crab cake benedict and also tried a friend's black bean benedict and they were both delicious! The cornbread is phenomenal and the cheesy grits were really good too! It's pretty much yummy.... I just don't know if I'd go here to order pancakes... it's cajun people... c'mon!
