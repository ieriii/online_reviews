I'm not going to go into too much detail about the dishes. Part of Alinea's appeal is the element of surprise. Centerpieces come and go, each anticipating some later dish to come but temporarily remaining enigmatic and vaguely inorganic objects vaguely conceivable as food. Things like Hot Potato Cold Potato and the Black Truffle Explosion are standard on the menu, but there remain many more spots throughout the twenty-ish courses for novel permutations of flavors. The wait staff is immaculately attentative and do a good job throughout the meal of offering explanations and backstories as to the chef's inspiration and intended concept. What I really enjoyed about Chef Achatz's cuisine was that, besides being obviously avant-garde and exquisite, it's really just quite tasty. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, but at the end of the day I still tend to usually prefer food that's more on the comfort-food end of the spectrum. Despite the inventive presentation and combinations of flavors, many of the dishes I sampled here during my meal thrust forth flavors that were ultimately quite fundamental and familiar. Chef Achatz manages to retain essentially the heart and soul of many various cuisines from around the world and convey some core essence of the food despite dressing it up in his particular style. There was nothing on my menu that I thought was particularly out-there in terms of its flavor notes, but days after my meal I'm still thinking about and craving this or that dish. Beyond the hype and aesthetics Alinea also excels at the substance of food, cooking each morsel to perfection and deftly distilling its flavor notes to a pure and robust core. If such a thing as a food high exists, Alinea provides it in spades. My experience was lovely in every way, and I can't wait to come back again.
