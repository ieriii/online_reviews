The pizza was really good. We had the white pizza which was pretty simple, but delicious. The goat cheese appetizer was excellent as well. Once again, simple but good. The only thing I didn't like was the bowl of pizza sauce we ordered on the side. It was pretty bland and tasteless. I'm glad we got the white pizza and not the traditional.
