Good beer. Great service. Food was good but a bit salty. The bacon fat popcorn was actually popcorn with chunks of bacon on it. Not what I expected but delicious. I had the beef stew. The beef was good but the best part of the dish was the green beans. My husband had the fish n chips which were good but heavily battered. Service was excellent. Had to wait about an hour for a table but it wasn't a big deal bc we enjoyed the bar. The millwork on the bar is phenomenal. I'd definitely go back.
