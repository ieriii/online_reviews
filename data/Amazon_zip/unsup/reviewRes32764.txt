This is a very good Ethiopian restaurant. They offer a nice variety of dishes, and the portions are large enough to share. The food is cooked well and very flavorful. The service can be slow at times, but overall it's not bad. You will be happy with Demera. The restaurant is located just a block from one of the Red Line stops, so it's convienent to get to.
