Unquestionably delicious! I have grown up on La Villa food and 23 years later the food is nothing short of outstanding. While I am a picky eater EVERYTHING I have had at La Villa has please my palate. The pizza here is out of this world fresh. As I was interested in what made their pizza different from others I asked and was informed that everything from the dough to the sauce is homemade. My favorite pasta dish here is the bow tie with vodka sauce added with chicken. Every restaurant I go to, the vodka sauce tastes different, and this place has got it right on the dot! If fish is your thing I would try the Zuppa de Pesch. The Chicken A La Villa is also my favorite. Overall, the price is incredible for the amount of food you get, the service is quick, and the employees are always there making you feel right at home. I would definitely recommend this place (as I already have) to anyone who wants to try authentic Italian food!!!!
