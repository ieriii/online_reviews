I order delivery from Coast a good bit, but I have yet to make it into the restaurant...will have to get to that at some point. From a delivery standpoint, the sushi and chirashi are generally good, and their prices are reasonable. Every once in a while, they have an off night, but on a whole, they are always on my short list for delivery.
