This place is just right for a date. You walk into a Speakeasy, with the waiters and bartenders dressed in slick vests and all have mustaches. The drinks are pretty expensive but its well worth it since the atmosphere is amazing. The chairs are huge/madhatter-ish and the dark ambience makes it that much sexier. Definitely worth checking out.
