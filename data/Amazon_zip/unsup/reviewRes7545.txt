If you are craving Italian go here! If you are looking for a nice neighborhood spot with great atmosphere and friendly service, I recommend it 100% I am also on the mailing list and about every 3 months I get $13 gift certificates in the mail. In the summer they have outdoor seating that's the BEST, I wouldn't say a patio but more like a group of about 15 tables that line the sidewalk. Above are strings of fairy lites and cute candles on the white linen table clothes. The perfect spot for a glass of wine on a warm evening. I went last night and it was a little bit strange since we were serenaded by a bum in a 10 gallon cowboy hat as he was passing our table. I was dying laughing which probably encouraged it more. The staff was quick to remove him from the area, which I give them props for. I recommend the Gnocchi with chicken, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts and basil, or the Caprese Pasta dish. I have taken many out of town guests here and most of them say it was their favorite place I took them.
