Let me preface this by saying that we were in town to see U2 at Soldier's Field. The show was our #1 priority so the hotel was really secondary to the whole experience. This hotel was the closest we could find to Soldier and it was "alright." Our room was comfortable and clean. The fitness center is well-equipped and open 24 hours a day which is a really nice feature. The downside: For what you get, this hotel is overpriced. It's a totally average business-minded hotel. The lobby is great, but the rest is very very average. It is not close to public transit, downtown, etc. Also, the folks working at the front desk are unfriendly and borderline idiots. They managed to: - eff up our reservation - charge us for our room twice* - waste a lot of our time - almost lose our bags Needless to say next time I am in a similar situation, I'll be staying at the W or the Park Hilton and cabbing. Way better service and more bang for your buck.  *Also..... to the folks at the McCormick Hyatt: I am still waiting for those charges to come off my card. You will be hearing from me again.
