Really awesome brunch, even though some of the descriptions seemed a bit daunting. One of the best Bloody Mary's i have had in the city, excluding the excellent one from Feast. Very chill staff and clientele, cool interior (you kind of feel like you are on a farm). We showed up on Sunday and forgot to make a reservation and were seated in 15 minutes - just enough time to order a drink. Cannot wait to go back.
