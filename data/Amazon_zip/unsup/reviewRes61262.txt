OMG!!! If you love meat Brazzaz is the best place to go. The ambiance is modern & romantic. Perfect for a date or a girls night out. The price is only $50 a plate, which is cheap for down town. They have all-you-can-eat beef, pork, duck, chicken, seafood & a salad bar. The service is amazing! FYI you will have to pay for parking. You will not be disappointed if you go.
