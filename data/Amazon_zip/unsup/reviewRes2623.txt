Not a huge fan of hot dogs. Don't like any of the toppings on a Chicago dog. However, we went here when we had a friend in town, and I was really impressed. I wasn't planning to be impressed, but I was! Husband and friend said the Chicago dogs were awesome and next time that's all they'll get. I had the Greek dog - which was perfect for a non-hot dog fan. Husband had the Thai Chicken sandwich - said it was delicious. And the duck fat fries - to be honest, these were really very tasty, but I couldn't tell much of a difference from regular fat fries. Maybe my fat palate isn't distinguished enough. Either way, this non-hot dog fan, french-fry lover will be back.
