First visit, we went spur of the moment for a late dinner. Would go back in a heartbeat, and will make a special trip to catch the luncheon buffet. The tasty bits-o-garlic naan with the creamy/spicy tomato dipping sauce are like appetizer crack. They gladly refilled both the basket of naan-lets and the bowl of yummy, no charge, no questions asked. When I wondered if it were possible to get a smaller order of a veggie entree to accompany my (what proved to be) heavenly chicken makhani, the waiter was quick to suggest a half order. Which we used to get aloo gobi (a personal fave.) It was quite tasty, and the potatoes were not cooked to mush. We also had the veggie samosas (potatoes and peas) which arrived with a 4-pack of condiments. Beware the salty balls...not sure what all was in there, but olives? capers? At any rate, biting into them was like chewing on the ocean floor, and not in a good way. The busboy/server assistant was the sweetest ever: water was constantly refilled and never spilled, he was on the spot whenever we looked like we needed anything at all. Actually, better than the waiter, this charming and capable young man is what pushed the review into 5 star territory. Oh, and for some unknown reason they threw in an order of saffron rice - maybe just to make sure that we'd be addicted and would have to come back? It worked. We'll return with more time to enjoy and wearing our eating pants.
