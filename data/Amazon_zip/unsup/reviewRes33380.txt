I wish I could tell you how amazing the spinach ravioli is. My fiance took me here for my birthday around 7:30 on a Friday night. It was understandably busy. After making our way through a maze to our table -- seriously, cram any more tables in there and we'd all be sitting on each other's laps -- we ordered. I opted for the aforementioned ravioli, a cab sav (second choice as they were out of my first) and the dude got a pizza and some riesling. The pizza came. He nibbled. We waited. And waited. And waited. About 45 minutes after, the waiter came to check on us. "Is her ravioli going to be out soon?" "What ravioli?" Then we left. Yeah. Thank goodness for GrubHub.
