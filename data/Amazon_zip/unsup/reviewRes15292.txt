By far one of my favorite establishments to frequent! I've brought friends and business associates alike to Violet Hour to imbibe the quality cocktail that raises the bar for all others. Reminiscent of a speakeasy the decor reminds me of a Tom Petty video or something the Mad Hatter would have dreamt up in Alice in Wonderland. The mixologists have truly perpetuated the art and craft of preparing the quintessential beverage. Have a seat at the bar and be amazed at the finesse, which can only be likened to watching a skilled sushi chef. And, if you find yourself in Nashville you may want to pay a visit to their sister venue, The Patterson House!
