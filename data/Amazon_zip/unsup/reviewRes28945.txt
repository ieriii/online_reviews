Came here for a work related Cinco de Mayo party. Of course the pre arranged appetizer menu wasn't exactly vegan friendly, but I do believe the empanadas and the chips & guac were, or at least somewhat close. I must have devoured 2 bowls of guac by myself. I don't know what's in it ( and at this point, I don't want to know) but the guacamole here alone is worth stopping by for a drink. Anyways, I've seen a few yelpers gush about the margaritas here, and let me just say that if you haven't had a margarita here, you haven't had a good margarita. I thought the margaritas at Caesars were good, but these blow them out of the water, through the earth's atmosphere and send it hurdling through the icy winds of outer space only to collide then explode on the surface of the moon; sending tiny shards of margarita out into the universe never to be seen or heard from again except by aliens who collect the shards and use it to kill rodents on their space ship. These are damn good margaritas.
