I know this place is trying to bring diner food to non-meat eaters, but I think they could have done a better job. Everything felt really heavy, with *lots* of unnecessary fats added to make you feel full. The shakes were good though -- my boyfriend thought they were too sweet, but I thought they were just fine.
