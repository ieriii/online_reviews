I went to Coast for a friend's birthday dinner. We had a group of 14 people. We went on a busy Saturday night and had reservations. With such a large group, even though we had reservations we had to wait about 5- 10 minutes for our table to open up. They made the wait a bit more comfortable by offering to open a few of our bottles of wine and providing glasses. The service was great. Our server (I wish that I remembered his name) had excellent suggestions of what to try. As a vegetarian, I only eat "veggie sushi" like cucumber rolls, avacado rolls, miso soup, edamame, etc. The food was yummy. My friends tried a ton of the different sushi rolls and raved about each one! (Note: This is a rare occassion when everyone likes the restaurant.) I recommend going to Coast , bring a few bottles of wine, ask the waiter for suggestions and enjoy! Oh, one more thing. I believe that there is a corkage fee if you do not spend above a certain amount like $10 or $15 a person.
