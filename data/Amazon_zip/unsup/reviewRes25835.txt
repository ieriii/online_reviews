I'm Chicago born and raised, but have always preferred thin crust pizza over pan. That is, until I found Pequod's. I define their pan as "died and gone to heaven." Sober, hungover, drunk...it's always amazing.  We probably order Pequod's delivery once a week, but nothing beats going in and getting it fresh out of the oven. The sauce is perfect, with a little hint of sweet. Depending on our mood, we usually go with sausage or pepperoni. You can't go wrong either way. The sausage is fresh, with a taste of fennel, and comes in big chunks all over the pie. The pepp has a little kick, which really adds to the depth of flavor. And not enough can be said about the "carmelized" cheese crust. Man, I wish they could somehow create a crust appetizer, because I'd order that in addition to the pizza. I'm drooling just thinking about it. There are also a handful of standout appetizers. I'm not sure where they get their frying oil from, but they serve up the crunchiest jalapeno poppers with out-of-this-world creamy ranch. I haven't found a better popper...and trust me, I've tried. Onion rings with BBQ sauce or wings are other favorites. If you haven't been, go now. Other Chicago style pizza joints don't stand a chance. I heart you Pequod's.
