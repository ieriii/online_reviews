Art of Pizza exceded my expectations. I'd never realy heard of the place but saw that it had pretty good reviews on yelp so I decided to give them a shot. Ordered delivery and got a hot pizza in less than 45 minutes. And the pizza was pretty damn good too. They do a really great thin crust. Will definitely be ordering from them again. They gave us a free liter of pop too. Kind of a sweet deal considering very few pizza places do that anymore.
