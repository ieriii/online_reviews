Friend of mine caught up the other night at Cafe 28 ... had a shrimp quesadilla, couple Negra Modelos, and a couple of - wow, I can't remember :) The food was really good ... I liked the ambiance, even in the bar. It was nice and quiet and kind of dark. Service was impeccable. I really enjoyed myself and will definitely return.
