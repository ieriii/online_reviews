I am not an Indian so could not judge authenticity. In my view India House is the best Indian restaurant outside of Devon Avenue. I came a few times for lunch. Their buffett is superb! I've have tried many different dishes: meet, veggie, fish. I enjoyed everything very much. I am a big fan of Indian sweets, but event they are quite enjoyable at india House.
