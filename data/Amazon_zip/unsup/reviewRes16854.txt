I absolutely love this place!! We went on a double date here and luckily the boys got there first to put up with the wait. The place is very unassuming on the outside, but the inside is everything you could imagine.....high backed chairs, terrific ambiance, lavish settings, but not pretentious. We held a long conversation with the manager who went over the entire concept, answered all our inquiries and took a shot with us. We brings the party! And the drinks were awesome!
