Was my cake pricey, yes; but was it worth it, double yes! I worked closely with Lindsay as we collaborated on the idea for this cake. I had a metallic themed party and love disco balls and would certainly come here and buy a special occasion cake again! The cake tasted beyond yummy and all of the party goers felt the same. Almond cake with chocolate pastry cream - DELISH! Thank you Alliance - you came thru and helped make my 30th birthday memorable - not to mention the cake lended itself as a super nice decoration element.
