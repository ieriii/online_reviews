I LOVE this place and I've tried them all-- yes, it's better than Coast, "Wabi", Green Tea, Kamehachi, you name it, I've been there and Wakamono is the best.  The rolls you need to try are: the Oedipus Roll, Kani Chung Roll, Emerald Roll, and Godzilla Roll. I order these 4 (with a friend) every time I go and finish every last bite. It is that good.  I always order what I call the "major" rolls or the specials-- they are so good I can't justify getting simply a tuna or salmon roll, you know? Recently I ordered them without mayo and it was still really tasty. Wakamono is fresh and absoloutely delicious. Sitting outside is really nice too since you are in a true neighborhood and the energy is high. Excellent people watching. It's great to eat dinner while experiencing that warm nieghborhood-y feel. If you are a sushi person, you must go here- I have never had a bad roll here. It is high quality and should be awarded #1 Sushi in Chicago. Period.
