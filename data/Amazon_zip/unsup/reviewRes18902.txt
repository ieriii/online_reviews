Bad Apple gave a great first impression as soon as we walked in. The unique decor was appealing, a mix of punk and fantasy as soon as we entered.  The waitress was genuine, not over the top but very attentive and appeasing, her intriguing tattoos matching the decor of the bar.  GET THE CHEESE CURDS! Amazing, fried cheese curds with a soft and tempura like shell, extremely light and oozing with cheesy goodness. My date ordered the margherita burger, to be presented with a burger topped with jalapeos...ooops, she pressed the wrong key and quickly corrected the mistake, and gave us a beer on her to apologize. We tried the pumpkin beer, a great accompaniment to the first cooler fall day.  As a non-meat eater I found several appealing food choices on the menu, and can't wait to go back to try the veggie burger.  All in all a great experience and we will be back!
