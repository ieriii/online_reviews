I'm not that crazy to wait for weekend brunch, but weekday brunching is an easy 5 to 20 minute wait. Not bad, considering there's a ton of cute stores on the same block. RED VELVET PANCAKES. DO IT. Made exactly how a true red velvet should taste. Don't forget to ask for more of the cream cheese sauce...I could of scraped that bowl clean. Oh wait..I DID. I'm also a sucker for beet salad, here they add duck confit. The duck adds another great taste to the salad without overdoing it.   Now I know what the hype is all about!
