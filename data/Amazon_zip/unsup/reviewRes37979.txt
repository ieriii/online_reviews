Great if you like Belgian beers. Just ok if you like aggressive, hop heavy west coast beers. Given the name, I was expecting a midwest take on Portland's legendary Horse Brass. There's not a goddamn thing to drink on tap here for true hop addicts. Even the Edgewater up the street has more hoppy beers. And they only have 6 taps... I've never been amazed by the product here, but I have met some really interesting people... Still would rather be at the maproom.
