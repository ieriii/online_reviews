If there were more Chicago Diners around, it would be a lot easier to be vegetarian. (I'm not, currently. Life is tough. Sigh.) On our hot and sticky July evening, it was nice to see that the current beer specials were Goose Island Summertime and Allagash White ($4 each). How refreshing! Chicago Diner could use some help with their liquor selection, but we'll leave that aside. If you come to Chicago Diner in the summertime, you can opt to sit in their back patio, light by backyard lights, which is undoubtedly relaxing. We started with the wings as an appetizer. They in no way resembled what it's like to eat a chicken wing, but were delicious nonetheless. Chunks of seitan a just barely similar texture to chicken, drizzled with a very flavorful wing sauce, coming with standard sides of dressing and celery sticks. I then had the vegan gyros, which so closely resembled real gyros in appearance, texture, and flavor. Very well done! You definitely get that sort of nuttiness that you always get from fakemeats, but it's easy to ignore with the rest of the gyro flavor present. It's topped with the standard onion and tomato and comes with a very delicious tzatziki sauce. A perfect complement to the gyro were the diner potatoes, so pefectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The large chunks with a little ketchup, washed down with a little Goose, heaven in my stomach. It's places like Chicago Diner that make me wish I still lived in Chicago. I'd love to try more items on the menu. It's all very creatively done, and extremely well priced. Will be making an effort to eat here on my visits home.
