A grown-up bar for a grown-up time...grown-up cocktails...the result is truly grown-up fabulous. I have been dying to try this place since it popped onto the scene. Yes, I've heard it's pretentious, yes, I've heard that it's expensive, but once in awhile, this girl likes to class it up. And where better to do that than a place where the door is obscured into a wall and you have to wait to be seated. I enjoyed sitting in a comfortable, lounge-y environment, sipping carefully crafted cocktails (Moscow mule for this German girl), enjoying actual conversation...I liked the ridiculously tall chairs, and the secluded booths. I love the heavy velvet curtains...loved the dressed up bartender (vests and ties together, people, it can work).   Everything about this place just makes me want to sit back and enjoy life as it passes.  Who wouldn't love that?
