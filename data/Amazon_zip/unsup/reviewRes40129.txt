I am Asian and I am pretty accustomed to "average" service and dining environment in authentic Asian restaurants. The poor service at this restaurant is way off the radar. First, the waitress gave us the look and said "thats all?" when she felt we didn't order enough dishes for a 4 adult table. Then she brought us the same if not less amount of banchan compares to our neighboring table of 2 person. She expected us to share 2 soups and 2 bowls of rice. The seafood pancake was good. Then, she refused to change the grill surface for us stating "no no no more order" referring that we don't have much meat left to grill. Okay that is fine I will finish up my food, get the hell out of here, and never come back. The tab shows up with extra "service charge". The service charge was not posted anywhere in the restaurant or mentioned to us previously. I handled it the Asian way. I paid by cash for the food only and walked out the door. The waitress came after us down the street screaming "not enough! not enough!". We drove off.
