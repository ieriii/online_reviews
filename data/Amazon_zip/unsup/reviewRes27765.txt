Tried this place out after reading all of the excellent reviews. This was a great place...not only is the food really good and authentic, you also get a lot for your money. I ordered chicken enchilladas suizas with green sauce and the bf ordered chile relleno....both dishes were 6 dollars each. Plus, you get beans and rice, chips and salsa, peppers, and a bowl of chicken soup....perfect on any winter day! Oh yeah, the horchata was delicious, but still, Garcia's has the best. I wish there would have been more green sauce on my enchilladas....I like it when they're submerged in the sauce. My bf got all excited when he found out that the flour tortillas were handmade....they were good. I will definitely come back if I'm around Pilsen! Oh yeah, the place was packed, but service was fast.
