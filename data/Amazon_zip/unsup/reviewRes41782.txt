I went with a group of 8 friends. We each ordered a drink, a main entree and shared 3 appetizers and deserts. The price came out about 40-50 a person. This place is a bit pricey for the amount of food provided, but the food is definitely excellent. The drinks can be a bit pricey since at $12, it is about the same price as an appetizer. Overall, we enjoyed our experiences. Near the end, we even had live jazz music!
