The fact that this place is on the Mag Mile and involves the owners (chefs?) of Heaven on Seven made me a little worried. I'm happy (and also surprised) to say that the food didn't suck. Like any place that serves small plates, it's an experience more enjoyable if you go in a big group where you can try several items. I don't recommend attempting this late on a Fri night. Based on the other reviews, maybe don't try this at all, at least until they can iron out some of the issues with their service. I went with one other friend, and we were lucky to get a couple seats at the bar (which is actually preferrable to the communal style tables. That trend is a nuisance.)  We ordered just a few items and were stuffed and happy. Here are specifics: Roasted bone marrow My previous experiences with bone marrow (or as I like to call it, guda boti) have involved picking bones out of my food with my hands and sucking the marrow out. This more refined version was also wonderful. Roasted beets w/ whipped goat cheese This dish is all about the cheese. i wish i could buy this stuff in a jar and eat it by itself with a spoon. the beets tasted boiled and bland. they needed to be cooked w/ seasoning directly, then topped with that wonderful cheese and the vinegerette. Sepia My friend thought this dish was bland. The flavors in this dish were more subtle, but i thought they worked together really well. Chili flakes, mint, a little acidity, a little salt. Simple but good. I would love to see these same ingredients and flavors with something less chewy than cuttlefish. Scallops Best dish of the night! Seriously delicious. Overall: good food, a little overpriced, and no service issues while dining at the bar.
