Hands down the best pizza in chicago. I will fist fight you to defend their honor! You can eat at all the famous tourist traps all you want but Pequods has everything and more. The reputation of this pizza joint was heard about even before I moved from Michigan to Chicago. Its not a chain its just damn good plain and simple. The pan pizza, I cannot give enough justice to it in written words. You simply must try it.. The dough, sauce, cheese all comes together to form greatness! The Best part is the caramelized cheese on the sides! Go forth and try it!
