I've been dying to try this place and since my friend from the O.C. came in today, what better way to celebrate!? The hostesses ignored us a bit when we walked in. It seemed like they were just chatting, while we're standing there waiting, with no one in front of us, to get a table.  But, once they acknowledged us, they couldn't be nicer. The service was great. We were well informed about the menu and the specials. I heard fantastic things about the mussels in vindaloo sauce and it did NOT disappoint. YUM-MEE. We also enjoyed the caramelized lobster, quite tasty. For our Fourths (yes, there are firsts, seconds and thirds as well) we had the char (some kind of fish) and the beef tenderloin. Both delicious. Overall, this was a great place. I'd go back for the starters (first, seconds and thirds) but I think the fourths were just a bit much. I think the menu is trying too hard to be something more. And it's more spendy than I like to spend for a local "pub" or "grill" type atmosphere. The place was pretty noisy, so I was disappointed by that. We had to yell a bit to talk to each other. I do apologize to my fellow diners, I'm sure I wasn't talking about anything dinner table appropriate.  The interior is absolutely gorgeous and it has a done of seating! The downstairs bar area is fantastic for a party. I will totally recommend for next year's holiday party! I really enjoyed the place, overall.
