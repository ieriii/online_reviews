The garden is beautiful, I would love to sit there all day long, and, you would need to as the wait staff can't seem to find any tables. Food was not what I had hoped it to be. Crispy fried zucchini flowers were not, $29 veal milanese was in need of some flavor, but it took up the whole plate. I did like the lasagna though. We went elsewhere for desserts. Don't know if I will go back.
