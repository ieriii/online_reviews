Mussels and an amazing beer selection! The Cb&J is also mighty tasty(a lil greasy)but good. If you aren't in a beer mood they have a nice scotch selection too. I wish it wasn't so busy, but i would be prob giving it a 2 if it wasn't as busy. There is a reason why people will always go to Hopleaf. If you haven't been go now, even just for a beer. Go for the Kwak, it's my fav:)
