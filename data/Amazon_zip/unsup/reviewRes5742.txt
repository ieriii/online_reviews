We were one lazy decision away from missing out on this treat. Wildfire tops my favorite steakhouses spanning between NY & Chicago. We had to order the Martini flight, three tasty and unique martinis (Raspberry, Blood Orange, and Stormy Night). Chopped salad, quite possibly the best salad I've ever had. Ingredients were so fresh, and there's something to be said about a chopped salad over a plain tossed salad. The flavors just seem to pop out. Crusted filet special (three filet medallions, each with a different crust of our choice), we picked peppercorn, parmesan, and mushroom. We definitely enjoed the parm crust best, the other two tied. Ribeye, you just can't go wrong with. Mac & cheese is good - not too heavy on the cheese, you can tell they use real cheddar. We skipped dessert because we were SO stuffed. Service is amazing. Our waiter was on point and quite funny too.
