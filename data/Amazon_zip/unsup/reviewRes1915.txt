The one negative is the line. Got there at 11:00 and had to wait an hour and half. But once we got in there, it was all good. The sausages were amazing. I had the following: Celebrity Sausage: Irish Banger with Dark Beer Mustard and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese = yum Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel = yum x 2 Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Moody Blue Cheese = yum x outta control! At a certain point though, you go through overload. These are some very rich items, and to throw the duck fat fried french fries, on top, I gonna have to start poppin' Zocor like tic-tacs. Hot Doug's is Top Doug...
