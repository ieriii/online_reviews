Excellent! I saw Fogo De Chao as I was walking around the city and had to come in and give it a try. It's every bit as good as the Beverly Hills, CA location. Meat, meat, and more meat. That's what it's about... the lamb chops were awesome as well as the beef ribs. Geez.... just thinking about them is making me hungry again. Do youself a favor. Eat a light breakfast, and a very light lunch. Don't fast, you'll shrink your stomach and have the opposite effect than what you would expect. Also, stay away from the buffet items - rubbish. You're paying a premium for the meat. Take advantage! Remember to save a little bit of room for the dessert. The Papaya Cream with liqour is not only delicious, but the papaya contains a natural enzyme that aids in the digestion... Pretty pricey. But well worth it. Come here if you want to give yourself a meat-treat! Dinner + drink + dessert + tip = $85
