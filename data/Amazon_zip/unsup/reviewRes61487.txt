I love it, my dad and I go here at least once a week. I guess some people would consider it to be "dive" like but the food is great. The price you pay and the amount of food you get is just awesome. I always go home with half my plate since the amount of food is quite large. I've had both the chicken noodle and the tomato and rice and I love both of them! Everything is great here!
