Delivery is always pretty fast, usually under 40 minutes. The prices are moderate but total worth it for the quality of the pies. Its brick oven style thin pizza and they have a ridiculous amount of combinations you can choose from. I highly suggest the four cheese....plain and simple but it has slices of smoked Gouda that add an aftertaste that I have never tasted on any other pizza. It is I've also had the Baltimore which is loaded with lump crab meat. If your looking for some delicious pies with combinations galore give fogo a shot.
