WOW! I had come across Icosium Kafe reviews in the past and finally went to dinner there last Friday with a friend. The menu is amazing! You can choose between their signature crepes or make your own with their numerous organic options. Very tasty! My friend and I each ordered our own dinner crepes and shared a dessert crepe. We split a bottle of wine (god bless BYOB). Our total check was only $27! This is my new favorite restaurant :) Only downside would be the size of the restaurant. It's small so you may have to wait for a table.
