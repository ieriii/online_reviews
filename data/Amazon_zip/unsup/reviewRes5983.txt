Updated after going a few times: their pasta, pizza, wine and service are excellent. their pasta dishes are perfectly al dente. pizza was delish. salad was yummy. im married to a man whose pasta dishes are better than most italian restaurants so we are both glad to have an italian restaurant that we look forward to going to. everything else is good, but does not blow you out of the water - still a fan though.
