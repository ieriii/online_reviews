I don't know if there is much need for me to add another 5-star rating to the 100 others, but i just have to get this off my chest. It was an unforgettable experience. We did the 12 course dinner. Before i went, i was thinking to myself...how can one possbly eat 12 dishes? And the 24 course meal? forget it! but each course was a delicate morsel of perfection. to call it just food seems like an insult. the combination of taste, smell, color, texture...it was more like an edible art exhibit that totally opened my eyes to how food can be prepapred. now, this is not the kind of dinner i want to have everyday. perhaps once a year. But certainly at least once in a lifetime. Worth every penny. All of you reading this...don't hesitate. Just go. you'll be glad you did.
