The huge menu means there is always something for everyone at Grand Lux Cafe. Pair that with a great drink menu, great views of the Mag Mile, and Yay, I'm a fan. A relative of the Cheesecake Factory, the swirly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory decorating scheme is kind of fun. If you don't like fun, please leave the fun to me and the tourists at GLC! I've been to GLC many times, once spying a fresh snowfall at a Michigan Ave. window seat. Nice! My last visit, seated in the circular rotunda room, was a great place to catch up with Daphne L., Anita Vacation, and Pearl Jam, herself. I ordered chicken enchiladas in green sauce off of the Lunch specials menu, and it was fabulous. As was the Sangria. Stay thirsty, my friends! Because Grand Lux has a nice bar, where you can belly up with one of their Specialty drinks and let the Mag miles you walked just melt away. I know, I'm really quite easy to please, a simple man, a GLC fan.
