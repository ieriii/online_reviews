I don't know why you would have your wedding reception at any other Chicago location! The value was incredible. We were treated like rock stars all night....from April (You rock, April) taking care of us during the reception to the amazing comped bridal suite and parents' rooms. The view is breathtaking (we didn't need to spend any money decorating the room because the view takes care of it all) The food is very good. I thought the prime rib was a tad peppery but the guests I talked to thought it was delicious.Many of our guests said it was the best wedding they have ever been too (see my other reviews - Toast and Jam DJ, Alliance Bakery, and Peter Coombs Photography) and HICMP had a lot to do with it.Barbara Martin, the event planner, was so cool and helpful during the planning process. She exudes calm and confidence. We didn't need to worry about a thing because she had it all covered. I can't say enough nice things about Barbara.The only drawback....and it is easily fixed if you "deal" with it ahead of time is getting out of town guests, who are driving, to the hotel. Our guests who were using a GPS to navigate to the hotel were directed in circles. I got the word out with acutal driving instructions and that did the trick. (so funny that out of town guests have no clue what the Merchandise Mart is or where the Sun Times building is).
