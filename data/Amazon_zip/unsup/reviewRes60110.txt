If you want Pho then Go!!!!! Absolutly the best Pho I have ever had!! It is one of those addicive foods that make you crave, crave and crave .. So what do I do?? Go back for more! I have also tried other things on their ever so large menu and they were all grate! Service is Outstanding as always! I like the camolflage shirts they wear so fitting for a restaurant named Tank! When you arrive there you will knotice everyone working very hard as they are ALWAYS busy (Number one indicator of a truely Good restaurant). Expect to sit with other guests which is not all that bad, I actually enjoy it,when i go alone I dont feel as lonely anymore. Go get some Pho and then you'll know!!!
