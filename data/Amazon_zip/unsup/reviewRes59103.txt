I love Yolk! This is the must visit breakfast place in Chicago! You going to have to wait for a table-but it is well worth it! I love the menu an the staff is great! It is never a dull moment because the place is always packed!I enjoy crowds, so the Yolk is my number one breakfast spot. I love the counter because I can see my food being prepared and you are always meeting people. So make sure you put the yolk on your list of spots to visit for a great bite to eat.
