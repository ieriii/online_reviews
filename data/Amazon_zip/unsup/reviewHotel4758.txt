Walking into the main lobby of the Palmer House for the first time is a great experience. Everything is beautiful with high open ceilings, historic woodwork and molding, great fixtures and tapestries. This is definitely a historic place in Chicago that anyone visiting should see.The hotel is close to many great things in Chicago. We came to see a concert at the Chicago Theater and it was an easy walk to there.I'm giving it three stars because we booked our room online and it was supposed to be 2 queens. When we arrived, we were notified that they had awarded all the 2 Queen bedrooms to Hilton Honors members and all they had left was single King rooms. I was with a relative, and we decided we could bare sleeping together for one night. When we arrived in the room, it looked as though this was at one time a janitor's closet converted to a bedroom. The room was absolutely tiny. Our bed took up most of the room and there was very little space to walk around or place our bags. The mini-fridge didn't even open all the way because it hit the end of the bed. Plus, our mini-fridge wasn't even working.Sooo....unless you're a Hilton Honor's member, I would be leery of booking rooms here. There are no guarantees and it definitely felt like they treated people who booked from on-line discount sites (such as http://hotels.com) as second class citizens. Still, if you can get a good deal I would recommend you give it a try because it is such a beautiful and historic building.
