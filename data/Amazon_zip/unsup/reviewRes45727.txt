A great addition to a fun neighborhood. The decor is very interesting -- literary Irish, with stained glass and a library area and quotes from Oscar Wilde circling the room. Our server was attentive and helpful -- couldn't have asked for more from her. The drink menu was interesting, the beer list expansive and the prices reasonable. There wasn't a lot of diversity on the menu itself and much of the food was very heavy, but then that might be true to Irish cuisine and the restaurant's concept. We were there on a nice Friday night in summer and it was noisy and crowded -- this makes me question whether I'll go beck when the weather cools down and those seated outside will move into the already loud inside.
