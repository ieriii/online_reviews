I've been coming to Geja's for about 7 years, this is my all-time favorite restaurant. The service is stellar, the food is excellent and the ambiance is incredibly romantic. I've been to Geja's with many people over the years. Everyone really likes it, though some wish it wasn't so dark and others are concerned that they will not properly cook their own food. I think it is really fun and love the entire dinning experience.
