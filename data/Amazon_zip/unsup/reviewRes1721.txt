Put on your line-waiting shoes and head to Hot Doug's, because this place completely lives up to its super-hyped reputation. You'll be in for the encased-meats experience of a lifetime. Wild boar, rabbit, even RATTLESNAKE dogs have been served here. They go beyond just weirdness; there's real artistry behind these creations. Their "classics" are great, too, and cheap. And the duck fat fries are extraordinary. I second the tip that some other reviewers gave: if you like hot dogs for breakfast, showing up at 10:00 is a good way to avoid the rush (although there's usually still a little wait). Also, always check the website to make sure they're open on a given day. Hot Doug likes to take holidays whenever he pleases. I say he's earned it.
