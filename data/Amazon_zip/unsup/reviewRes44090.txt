Spur-of-the-moment V-day dinner plans brought us to Kinzie Chop House last night. I was surprised they weren't totally booked, but apparently they weren't because we were able to snag a table for an hour after we called. We got the teeniest, tiniest table imaginable (I'm guessing it was the last-last-last minute reservation that did it) but thank goodness the hubs had the sense to ask for the empty normal-sized one two tables away. They were very gracious, moved our stuff for us, and took VERY good care of us after that. We got a complimentary sparkling wine toast (some special for valentine's day) as soon as we sat at the new table. We decided to forego the Valentine's Day Menu (which was pretty reasonably priced at 119/couple, including wine pairings), wanting more freedom in our dinner choices. I had the NY strip and he had the gi-normous 24oz porterhouse (it took some work to talk him out of sharing the 48oz porterhouse, which is meant for, like, 4 people) and both were cooked perfectly. Had some mac&cheese (fantastic - penne with a 4 cheese blend, but the cheese is not overdone, and a panko/chive topping) and some grilled veggies (meh). For dessert, he had the profiteroles, while I had the chocolate terrine, which was awesome but I needed 2 cups of coffee to cut the sweetness of this one. Overall it was a fabulous dining experience.
