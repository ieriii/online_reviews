Cafe. 28! Your food could never disappoint! (That was supposed to rhyme. not sure if I succeeded) so if the food's so great, why the 2 stars? Oh..because of a ridiculously SNIDE and rude server! And that they ran out of the awesome butter that I've read so much about. We had to ask TWICE just for bread and butter, that's about 10 minutes after being seated. And only be disappointed when we were given cold, hard, barely inedible bread and cold sticks of packaged butter. The calamari app and papas rellenas were fabulously deliciously addictive. BF had a spicy special drink that had slices of jalapenos in it which he loved. We both practically ran to the bar for the mojitos as soon as we entered the bar because the smell of mint was too enticing. We also split the roast pork which was super tender and came with the most delicious black beans & rice. So basically everything we put in our mouths (made in the restaurant) was 5 stars. But man...that server. We saw him less times than the food runner! Also..I'm pretty sure he smirked at me when I needed to look at the check before giving him my credit card. I know when serve is really bad if even BF gets ticked off. He has the patience of a saint.
