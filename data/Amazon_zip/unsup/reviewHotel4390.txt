The pros- Excellent lobby, everyone that works at the hotel is very nice and will take care of any problem you have quickly. You can't argue with the location and with that comes a heavy price tag. I can't complain about the actual price for the room but all the extra add ons really get you. Its 25 extra for a third person in the room. Thats a bit much.  Internet was 15, I didn't use it since I have a smart phone but 15 for internet is def. on the high end.  I had no issue with the room, bed was really nice and bathroom decent. The cons-You hear everything that happens on your floor, from someone flushing the toilet to entering their room. This is one of the loudest hotels I have stayed at.  And when you pay around 300 a night, it would be nice to actually get a few hours of sleep.
