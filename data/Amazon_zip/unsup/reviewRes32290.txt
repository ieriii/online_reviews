When planning a recent visit to Chicago we did a little research as to where we should spend our time sampling some of Chicago's finest food. Sunda came highly recommended from many sources so we figured we had to try it. The server was awesome, he was friendly, helpful and had a good personality. The fun really started while we waited at the bar for a friend to join us and the bartender recommended a great wine - Cloudy Bay - must try! The sushi was very fresh and unique. The decor was quite beautiful. We were there for lunch which was quiet but I could see it being a great place to come to at night.
