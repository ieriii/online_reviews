I adore this place! I'm not a born Southern, but I consider myself a lover of it's food. This place is the best to hit Andersonville since whenever. When we walked in, it felt like a posh Southern tea house. One star is taken away because they didn't have sweet Southern tea. We started with boiled peanuts, which is like their bread and butter. I never have had them, and they were amazingly addictive. it really brings the legume flavor out. I even peeked at Lee Brother's cookbook to make mine own at home. We got chicken livers to start.These puppies were huge compared to what I usually cook. But DAMN cornmeal GOOD. Underneath them was a buttery piece of bread and FRESH succotash. We decided to eat order a sandwich and split, which was a great idea. Everything on the menu looked amazing though. We got the Pulled Pork and the Hamburger. The Pulled Pork was divinly good, with it's vingery bite and the chow chow was great with it. The burger was actually really good too. The cheese was amazing on it. The bread with each sandwiches were doughy good, too. We each got mac and cheese. It was ok, alittle watered down, not enough salt, but could of been incredible if fixed. I would go again in a heartbeat!
