After living in Chicago for nearly ten years, and sticking to a completely vegetarian diet for nearly three, I am shocked - shocked I tell you! - that last night was my first trip to the Chicago Diner. But certainly not the last. I gave up meat cold turkey (or cold...tofurky?) three years ago and haven't missed or craved a thing. Except - and don't judge me here - chicken fried steak. But last night dreams came true at the Chicago Diner when I ordered their Chicken Fried Staek - a spot on, absolutely delicious, seitan version of that classic guilty pleasure comfort dish.  The vegan milkshakes? Stunning. Our server? So kind, efficinent, and helpful. Definitely a place I'll be visiting again and again.
