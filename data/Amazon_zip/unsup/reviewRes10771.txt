Many of the locals in Chicago rave about this place. With an hour long wait over this past Sunday, something must be good. I am glad I am not the one who had to wait for our table of 5. I actually would recommend people to only have a maximum of 4 people so you can be seated quicker. Larger groups are highly discouraged unless you go during the weekday. I love the decor of this place. I especially loved the light blue tiled wallpaper with the candle sconces. I also love the fact that the wall had niches to store your coats and belongings in while you are dining. I had the Tomatillo which consisted of grilled chicken, egg whites, avocado, your choice of bread (I chose the whole grain bread), sliced tomatoes, spinach, and I ordered an additional side of potatoes. It was really good. I was impressed by the fact that I did not have to ask them to substitute the egg whites since it is a healthier solution. Also, I had a sample of my friend's red velvet pancackes. It was very delicious. I do not know if I could eat that solely as a main dish, but I think it is appropriate for everyone to try at least a bite of it. The service was excellent. She was quite engaging in our requests and even chimed into our interesting conversations. Without any hesitation, I would love to return back here again.
