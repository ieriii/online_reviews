The wait was expected, the service was very good, friendly and helpful once seated. On to the food... First, know that these are very small dishes for the price. Think tapas size, you'll need to order a lot. Our family of four ordered a total of 8 dishes. Skip these: - Bone marrow smear. The grilled bread, capers, cilantro and sea salt was enough flavor, the bone marrow was an expensive greasy distraction. Not understanding the appeal of this dish whatsoever. - Pork on mashed poes. Nothing wrong with this dish, just nothing special to report about it. Meh. - Fried eggplant parmesan. Again, meh. Other good options, so skip this. - Wagyu beef. Borderline, but considering the price its a minuscule amount of meat and potatoes. Great flavor, yes, but unless you're a beef connoisseur you'll prolly enjoy a really nice filet somewhere else and get 8x the meat. Get these: - Beet / Goat cheese / Pistachio salad. I didn't even think I liked beets til I had this, very very good. - Veal sausage. The standout dish for our table, just a really great flavor to the meat. - Fried olives. I'm biased here cause I love olives and chorizo and its just a unique dish i'd never considered before. - Charred green onions. This is borderline 'skip' but it was better than I expected and, c'mon, ya need some greens somewhere considering how much meat and grease you're about to eat, right?
