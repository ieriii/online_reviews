So, what this place has really going for them is that its the most charming and romantic eatery in all of aville/edgeh20. The food too is good, not great. The tuna bruschetta appetizer was a bit on the fishy side but the ravioli was excellent although not hearty enough. They do have a fabulous wine list though and what looks to be a great outdoor patio. Service was acceptable but not as polished as I'd expect from a place with this price point.
