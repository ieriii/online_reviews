Great food. Went there (group of 7) to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had two wait staff. The male staff seemed better at taking the food orders, etc. I am not sure that the waitress always understood what we were trying to order. I felt like there was a language barrier. But otherwise, we all had a great time. The live music, the drinks, the ambiance....all were wonderful. The owner came to the table a few times and was very attentive. Before we left, he offered us a complimentary drink. Great attention to detail. We are already planning to come back. See you guys on May 16.
