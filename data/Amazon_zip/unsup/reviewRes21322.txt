I love hot dogs! Ha. This place is an awesome summer spot when you just wanna be a bum and not get out of the car. The dogs are ok, but they suprisingly have the BEST CHEESEBURGERS!! I never order burgers b/c I never cared for them, but for some reason they are spot on here. Go here for the burger, not the dog! Go to Gene & Judes for a Chicago dog. Besides, am I the only one that finds the pickled green tomatoe disgusting??
