I visited Chicago in July and wanted to stay in my daughter's neighborhood. I booked one of their rooms above the restaurant and bar. It was clean, modern and very comfortable. Noise from the bar does drift upstairs, but I was so beat at the end of each day that it never kept me awake. If you are sensitive to noise, you might want to stay elsewhere, but they warn you of this before you book. So the buyer beware. The staff is young and oh so hip, and though I was 30 years older than the average patron, they treated me like a rock star. On check in you are given two tokens redeemable for whiskey sampling from their extensive selection. Bar staff was friendly and mixed me an awesome Old Fashion while even sharing the recipe step by step as he made the drink. I had dinner there one night with my daughter, and we both enjoyed our meals. The patrons were also friendly, and we made the acquaintance of a lovely couple sitting next to us who were out on their date night. This place is not for everyone. Some will undoubtedly find the food weird, the lack of "normal" beer disappointing (as I heard one woman complaining), and the preponderance of body art pretentious. But I'm a city guy who now lives in the boonies, and L&E was perfect for what I wanted. It was like staying in an old western saloon minus the dirt, gunfights, gambling and brothel. Eat. Sleep. Whiskey my friends!
