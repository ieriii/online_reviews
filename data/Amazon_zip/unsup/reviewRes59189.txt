This is one of the better sushi places I like to go to, especially when happy hour starts which is I believe 4 days out of the week! You get half off *most* of the sushi menu. Sushi X' choices overall are superb and each of the rolls they make are good, unlike some places where one is better than the other. The place itself has a nice ambiance and is much smaller than their sibling restaurant on Diversey. Sushi X is a place for good sushi across the board, bonus for happy hour and pluses for good delivery time.
