I willingly visted this restaurant on monday around noon with my sister who is a vegan. I surely am not a vegan or a vegetarian but I am willing to try anything about once. I had the eggs with potato-tempeh hash, and biscuits, also served with a seitan sausage patty. I was a little weary of eating anything that was made to taste like anything else. The sausage patty I did not like in the least. There was no flavor, and for a meat eater maybe its because I believe it so so hard to honestly duplicate the taste. It seemed a little dry. Now for the eggs, to me an egg is an egg, cage free, free range whatever they all taste the same. The potato-tempeh hash was very delicious. It had red pepper, green peppers, and cubed potatoes and tempeh. I must say though the best was the biscuits. They were awesome very fluffy and so yummy. I am not sure what the sauce was that was served on them since it lacked flavor. The coffee was very strong (no complaints here.) My sister ordered the miso corn chowder which she said was pretty good, a large fresh orange juice, and ordered a cobb salad to go which looked huge with seitan meat strips. Our bill was $34. The waitress we had was super friendly and was great reccommending things for a non-vegan to try. It is a pretty small place maybe 15 tables. It seemed very friendly and well if my sister asked me to go back again I would certainly try something else.
