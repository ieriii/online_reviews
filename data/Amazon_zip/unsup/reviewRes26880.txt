After eating at The Art of Pizza and hating their deep dish, I was VERY skeptical. I wondered why people from Chicago subject themselves to these doughy monstrosities they call "pizza." Didn't they know that better exists? Oh but they do and its called Pequods. And it is AMAZING! It is light and crunchy and the caramelized crust is heaven. I ordered a small thin crust for myself because I was so afraid of the deep dish. But alas all I did was eat deep dish because it was like a drug. Eat here, love it. Tip: it takes about 40 mins to make the pizza, but you can call ahead for dine in or take out.
