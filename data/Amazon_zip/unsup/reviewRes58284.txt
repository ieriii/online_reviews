Now, going to Mexican restaurants with my Mexican mom is a true ordeal as everything, according to her, is not up to par with her traditional cooking. I must say, however, we were both excited to eat at this restaurant because we have witnessed how Rick Bayless submerged himself into Mexican cuisine with truly admirable dedication. To start off, we had our Jamaica drinks, and the hint of lemon in it (I believe) immediately hit me, it was a nice twist to the traditional drink and was equally as refreshing after a full day of sightseeing. Moving on to the tortas, I was bummed to learn that the person who took my order had messed it up and ordered a Milanesa instead of the Tinga Torta. But I was hungry and could not wait to eat. Boy was I glad to have settled with my order, as I was blown away by the delicious combination of breaded chicken, beans, salsa, cheese all stuffed inside of torta bread. To top it off, the torta was placed into a panini press which just made the cheese melt and fuse together with the other condiments- heaven!. I could not say the same for my mom, the chorizo in her Choriqueso torta was not not great, I'm hoping it was because it was seasoned differently to what we were accustomed to, but it was still edible. For desert, we went for the churros which were not too sugary and very light to the stomach, just the right ending.I must however say we were there before rush hour and they placed a couple at the dining table with us. I did see some empty places across from us, I don't know why they didn't seat them there, guess they wanted to rush us before the rest of the clientele got there. I just find that awkward and it completely ruined the experience. Luckily, we were almost done with our meal because I absolutely hate eating in front of hungry strangers. =) Nonetheless, it was overall a great experience.
