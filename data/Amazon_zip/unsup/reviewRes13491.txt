I really hate to give this place only two stars, but in my book it falls short of three. I know that this place is primarily a seafood restaurant and not so much a diner, so take this review with a grain of salt. I went here the other day during the busy lunch rush. I really wanted some breakfast food so I ordered the three eggs w/ potato pancake, meat, and toast. I wasn't impressed at all. It seemed like everything was undercooked. The eggs were too runny and the potato pancake was pretty runny in the middle too. If this is how it's supposed to be then let me know and I'll edit this review. I just don't think it was cooked enough. Anyway, for breakfast I would go somewhere else, but I will definitely be back here to try some of their other items and I'll hopefully be able to raise my rating. I really want to.
