Being long standing fans of Avec, trying Publican went without saying and our expectations were high. We absolutely loved our evening there and they exceeded our expectations and then some... Getting out of the cab, and seeing it for the first time, it's bigger than I had expected and the rows and rows of giant ball lighting was a stunning impression. We were greeted by 3 friendly host staff and taken to one of the 2-tops. Our immediate impression was how loud it was. I mean, it is loud. But I think that's part of the fun and intrigue...and after downing a few amazing beers recommended by the knowledgeable and passionate "beer sommalier, well you don't care about the noise and you couldn't imagine it any other way. We had oysters, grilled octopus (amazing), pork rinds (delightful airy puffs of flavor and terrific with beer-a must), followed by the charcuterie plate with Foie, pork pie, lovely pickled peppers, and the winner of the evening---the HEAD CHEESE! oh lord, that's all we've been talking about all day, what a terrific surprise and full of memorable flavor. The repect for the pig is truly reflected in that delicious slice of meaty heaven. (drooool). We ended up splitting the Braised pork ribs with homemade turnip kimchee and freckles of textural and sweet pomegranate. Another wonderful addition to the evening and some of the best kimchee I've ever had (and will try to find a recipe for). Looking forward to going back again soon, these guys hit it out of the park in service, design, and cuisine.
