My husband and I went to Sapori about a week back, during a warm night,  We really enjoyed the window seating, where we could enjoy our dinner al fresco, but without being on the sidewalk. The manager recommended a wonder Verde as a palatte cleanser and the drinks were delicious. The waitress was a little less attentive than we would have wanted, but very friendly and sweet. My husband ordered the braised lamb, and it was good -- but probably could have been more flavorful. I ordered the gnocchi, which made me yawn, but still comforted me. Great ambiance and friendly and helpful staff would make me want to go back, but we'll probably order something different next time.
