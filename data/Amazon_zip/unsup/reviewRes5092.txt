Another recommended place to check out during my visit to Chicago. The concept of the place is really cute - wine, swine and cheese. Dropped in for a late lunch. They have open seating at the bar, so I was able to snag a table relatively quickly. The prices were extremely reasonble. The dishes are a bit smaller in portion - more tapas sized. Had the beets with goat cheese and pistachios. A fail proof combo. Recommended by the serve, had the cirspy pig year with the kale salad, topped with a fried egg. I was a little hesitant about the pig year, but maybe because it's very thinly sliced and fried, can't really taste it. The kale salad was a good balance to it. Finally, had the port shoulder with atop mashed potatoes. The pork falls apart so easily and melts in your mouth. All of the dishes were solid. I really wish they had a place like this in New York, because I would definitely be going back multiple times.
