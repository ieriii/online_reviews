My girlfriend and I went to Bin on a Saturday after a morning of shopping.  On the recommendation of our waiter we both had a wine flight. Robert recommend cheese to accompany our wine. It was our first time there and we can't wait to go back. I can't wait to try several items on the menu. The service was outstanding too.
