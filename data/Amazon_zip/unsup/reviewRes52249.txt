This is a Chicago institution. Was in town for a convention and my room overlooked the restaurant. Ever time all day, the wait for this place was out the door and down the street. When I dined there, the wait was 2 hours long. HERE IS THE SECRET TO CUTTING THE LINE: Go to your local hotel concierge and ask for a Gino's referral card. Show it to the host and get to the front of the line. Now the food: Its "ok" Its Chicago deep dish with a real nice buttery crust. It not a two wait in line pie, but its a good pie. The Legend is what you want to order!
