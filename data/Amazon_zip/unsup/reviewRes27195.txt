How can such a big guy serve such small entrees? I spent $170 (3 apps, 2 entrees, 3 drinks) and left hungry. This meal started out great: - sweet bread hushpuppys were great minus the fennel pollen, girlfriend loved the white tuna sashimi, scallops with brown butter were good. Almost forgot I had some foie gras lollipop with pop rocks on it. Super rich, but fun and only $5. Then our entrees came.........hers - sturgeon filet. i thought it was really good, she liked it but said she would not order again. small portion. mine - Wagyu beef flat iron. Not only was this a super small portion but its almost like the emphasized how small it was by putting it on the biggest white plate i've ever seen and putting the entire entree to a single far side of the plate. It looked like they forgot to put the rest of the dish on my plate. Our server started so many of her sentences with "Chef says...." that my first thought was "chef does not want me to leave here on a full stomach." After we got our first courses the meal was on schedule for 5 stars.....then the entrees came and left me almost mad that "chef" served us such small entrees. The vibe in here is great. Big laugh of the night is when I asked our first server how a PBR could be the most expensive beer on the menu ($9)? He went off on a real funny tangent about how places are think they are being hip or cool by adding PBR to their menu so the chef wanted to make a statement by adding it to the menu with such a high price. To sum up the review - I am sad that I chose this place as my last dinner in Chicago. We had to get a late night burrito from a tiny taco shop because of how unfulfilled we were. That should never happen after eating at a restaurant like this. I live in Southern California and my last meal in Chicago was a completely average carne asada burrito that I can get on any corner in my neighborhood. FML.
