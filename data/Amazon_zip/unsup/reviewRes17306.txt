Well-done, Violet Hour, well-done. The prices aren't as bad as everyone is making them out to be - you get what you pay for, people, so feel free to stick with the Johnnie Walker Red if you prefer to keep things cheap. They have a good selection of bourbons that aren't listed on the website. We came toward the end of a Saturday evening and chilled in line for a bit. It's an all-comers type of place, with a mix of groups, established couples, and first-date types. Just be aware that there may be a line, and enjoy the people-watching - it's worth the wait. Definitely the type of place where the location you're placed should be correlated with the type of evening you're having. The fireplace room is perfect for smaller groups and established couples looking to wind down the evening hours; the high backed chairs elsewhere are better for first date types; stick to the bar in the front if you don't fit into the aforementioned categories - there's a nice variety of people there and it seemed to be a quality place to relax for a bit. The doorman when we were there seemed to have a good grasp of where to place people, although it might not hurt to scope out the layout while you're waiting in line or ask him where he would recommend sitting. There's a good amount of movement in and out so once you get toward the front of the line you may have some options in terms of seating.
