I am reviewing the rooftop lounge which is really like a separate lounge than the restaurant. Be sure to get here early on the weekends as the line gets long quickly. This is really the place for people watching, it has it in abundance. The ambiance is what you are coming for on the rooftop. It has somewhat of a South Beach feel and attitude. It can be a little chilly once the sun goes down, there are gas heaters available if requested. The bar has the usual fare and fairly expensive prices but again you paying for the scene and to be seen. The rooftop does close early, by midnight so have additional plans if you want to make a long evening of it. Overall was a fun place to hang with friends and not have music blasting in the background but still have a cool club/lounge feel.
