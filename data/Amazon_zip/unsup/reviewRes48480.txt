You need to know how to do The Publican right, in my opinion, to get full satisfaction from the place. First, expect to be there for awhile. The service is slow and intended to be that way. The courses come out at different times and all dishes are meant to be shared. Sometimes you gotta wait a little while to get that next drink, but if you're prepared for this, you'll brush it off. The best part of The Publican is the meat. Three different types of aged ham, the feta-topped skirt steak, the summer sausage, the white sausage, and the half chicken are all memorable 3 weeks later. And of course, the beer selection is fabulous. Tons of microbrews and imported beer that even a mild beer fan like myself had never heard of, mixed in with some of the more popular micros and imports.  So try it when you've got time to lay back and enjoy The Publican...it's worth your patience.
