Went on recommendation of hotel staff. One of my friends also saw it on food network. We let the waitress order all our food and pick our wine, and it was so delicious. Wish I lived in Chicago so I could go back. I recommend to anyone visiting. Very unique food with great atmosphere and friendly staff.
