Can't really give it a rating as we ended up not eating here. Reason? My 40-year-old wife was carded and since she had mistakenly left her wallet at home, was denied entry. I'm 43 and was carded as well. Look, I understand potential liability and all that but to deny entry or demand identification from people who are twice the drinking age is pretty ridiculous. The staff claimed it was the law. As parents, we don't get out too often but I don't remember reading that Illinois passed a law demanding people of all ages being carded. Don't misrepresent a company policy as "the law." We have gone here regularly for the 5+ years we've lived in the 'hood but will not again.
