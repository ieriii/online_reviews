This is a great place for dates, a girls night out, or a nice lunch. I have eaten here plenty of times and I have never been disappointed. When you go make sure you request a table near the windows facing North Michigan Ave. they have the best places in the place. Its an upscale casual dinning experience. The chicken Pot pie is delicious and huge so be prepared to take some home with you. There drinks are good, there salads are good and the choclate chip cookies are delicious. ------------------- 1/14/2012 Ok so I recently came here yesterday to celebrate my friends birthday. There was 8 of us but they would not let my friend make a reservation. They told her she could only make a reservation for a maximum of 4 people. REALLY? I would think that they would allow reservations for a larger group with the minimum being 4 people. They first told us we had to wait for an hour, ok I could do that. An hour passed and we had to wait for another 30 minutes. And they wouldn't seat us unless our whole group was there. I ordered the jambalya which I've had before and was quite delicious, so I ordered it again with brown rice. Once my food arrived I begin to eat the rice and it was crunchy dry and hard. I would think that a fabulous place such as the Grand Lux would know how to cook something as simple as brown rice. I was highly disappointed. The rice was on the same plate as the Jambalya. You would think they would bring me a fresh new plate but instead the waitress just brought me some more rice on another plate. I guess they were having an off day.
