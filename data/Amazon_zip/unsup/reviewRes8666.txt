The food was great, the service was excellent, and the restaurant is larger and cuter than I thought it would be. There were five of us and we each had a slice of five different pizzas: bufalina, diavola, salsiccia, prosciutto e rucola, and bianco nero. They were all delicious, but my favorites by far were the diavola and the prosciutto e rucola. We also got an appetizer, the fritti del giorno, which, on that particular day, was a prosciutto, basil, and buffalo mozarella sandwich that had been deep fried and covered in marina sauce. Delicious! I'm definitely going back.
