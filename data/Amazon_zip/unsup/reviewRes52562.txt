I give Brazzaz 5 stars, they are pretty competitive with the other Brazilian places I've tried. The salad bar is awesome! The veggies was so fresh and there was a lot to choose from. The mushroom risotto was so good and I loved the cheese tortellinni. The service was great and the place itself is very classy. The staff was very nice and friendly, and they conversed with my wife and I which made us feel even more comfortable and welcomed. The meat was served continuously and they also had pineapple ( I guess grilled), this was my wife's favorite and also my first time trying heated fruit. I had a great experience and would like to go again.
