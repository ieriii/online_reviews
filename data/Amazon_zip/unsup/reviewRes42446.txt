Tank Noodle is the perfect pho place. You will find no trendiness -- just large, steaming bowls of pho, alongside heaping plates of sprouts and basil. I used to eat pho regularly in a Vietnamese neighborhood of suburban Washington, DC, and didn't realize how much better it could get, until my brother-in-law took us here. Highly recommended.
