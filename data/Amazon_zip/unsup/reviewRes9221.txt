Sorry, I came here for the first time this past weekend and am just not up to giving this place another chance. It was my friend's dance concert at the Ruth Page Center, and they had an after-party with a free champagne toast (who am I to turn down free bubbly?). The place was ungodly crowded, had a cash-only bar, and was teeming with waiters and waitresses seeming to crawl out of the woodwork just to hobble directly into your path balancing really wobbly trays. I watched one waitress drop a huge tray of pink (no idea what the flavor was supposed to be, so I am going by color) martinis on the floor. That is just alcohol abuse. I literally toasted my champagne to the dance company and called it a night, bringing a good chunk of my group out the door with me. There was no room to move in any direction on foot, much less sit anywhere, or even lean up against a wall. Everywhere you turned, you were in someone's way, or someone was nearly bumping into you and giving you nasty looks. Not my cup of tea. I am not a fan of Rush street anyway--too touristy and full of sleazy guys. Speaking of which, one of them stared shamelessly UP MY DRESS as I was coming down the stairs, and then attempted to speak to me while I hailed a cab. Not so much, buddy.
