There must be something about Tuesday nights at this place. We had Edamame, Soft Shell Crab Tempura appetizer, and two fancy rolls and were able to get out at about $20 a person. Not too bad for posh sushi places. Their special "tiger" was spicy scallop with avocado and other goodness. I vote they make it a proper menu item. The Tempura was OK, but pricy for the amount you get.  Very polite host and server.
