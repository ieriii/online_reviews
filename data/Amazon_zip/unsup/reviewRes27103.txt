They say you are what you eat... i guess having the chance to grub here a couple of times colors me a swanky and privileged foodie. The food was top grade but the meals definitely leave you wanting a tad bit more sustenance. The desserts were the most memorable here - i would suggest popping in for a drink and a dessert if you're in the mood for a classy yet lively ambiance. The pastry chef from WD-50 in NY was visiting the last time I dined here and we got to taste some of the best edible works of art. cross pollination FTW yay!
