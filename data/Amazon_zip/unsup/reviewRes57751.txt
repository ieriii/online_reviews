Charming, Quiet, Unpretentious and nested away in Chicago's gold coast, what I adore most about the place is the relaxed and friendly environment. Never have I felt rushed to depart, that's a nice treat in my mind. Great place for close knit friends to converse, relax, maybe even pay chess and of course enjoy any meal of the day. Also super wonderful for enjoying some ME time reading a book over tea. If you are into soups, they're simply fab, I'm a fan of the black bean soup! Entrees are awesome, had a paste dish for dinner a few weeks back and totally hearted it Janet, the owner is super kind and crazy passionate about her place & people. She's also got a great memory, I haven't been in quite sometime, in the mist of dinner, she came over to say hello and remembered we had met. How cool is she? Everyone wants to be remembered, right?Great place, check it out. You will return! Oh yeah, I do miss the late late night hours, however midnight isn't so bad.One other thing, I would agree with some of the other reviews that serve can take time, I always accridited it to the attendation to detail and a home style kind of feel. It's nice to have that in a busy city, less stress is always good. Perhaps if you are in a rush and don't have time for Quality conversation/connection w/family/friends and food, schedule a time to do so, because I believe everyone is totally worth it.
