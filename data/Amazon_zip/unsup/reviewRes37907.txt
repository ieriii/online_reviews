Four stars as a pub: for its very innovative menu and extensive list of Belgian beers. Three stars for the actual food. Mussels, which as the signature Belgian dish, should have been phenomenal, were just good. Not bad at all, just not the earthshaking-transport-me-to-Brussels-with-my-St. Bernardus experience I wished it had been.  Our appetizer was on the spartan side - the game fowl equivalent of two entire chicken wings (actually come to think of it, I've had chicken wings that were larger) with "micro-greens." Mind you, I am against anything served with micro-greens and I'd an inkling this dish might be lackluster, but hubby insisted.... The taste was fine, but I tell you, for a $14 appetizer, it should have been far more substantive. This isn't one of those five star restaurants where a 2 oz portion strategically arranged on a strangely shaped plate with artistic dribbles of this & that woos the pretentious "less is more" crowd. This is a pub, people! Mind you, I'm all for eating with the eyes, but sometimes, it's just totally off base. I'd return on an slow night for the beer and maybe to try a sandwich or something more "pedestrian."
