This was my first experience at a Rick Bayless restaurant. I took a few co-workers with me. We got there around 4pm so there was no line. The hostess was extremely helpful in teaching us how we get seated after ordering first and helped me pick out the favorites on the menu. The guy taking my order even gave me samples of the hot chocolates and the agua fresca. Excellent service here. I got the Passion fruit agua fresca $2.50 which was so fruity and refreshing. The carnitas caldo was a bit salty, but it had the crunch from the veggies, about 6 oz of carnitas, a few dumplings, avocado, and cilantro. I asked for it extra spicy. I could really taste the pork in the broth. I wished it came with some rice, noodles, or tortillas. We saw the next table getting some chicharrones so we ordered some, too $3.50. It had sprinkles of cilantro, lime slices, onion, and queso fresco. The lime had a huge difference and the sauce had heat (but tasted more like Cholula). We got 3 Churros $3.75 and didn't get the chocolate sauce for $1 more. We ended up meeting Daniel, the owner of The Lime Truck that won the Great Food Truck Race on FoodTV this year. He gave us his chocolate sauce for the churros, and let me taste his Pork Belly Caldo. The chocolate sauce kicked the churros into a whole new level of goodness. The Pork Belly caldo was a red broth, but a mellow pork flavor. Not spicy. I'll be back here for sure!
