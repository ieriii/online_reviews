I wasn't really feeling this place. The decor and the outdoor biergarden-style patio is really amazing. The food, however, was disappointing. The antipasti ordered by my party was bland and mediocre at best. The vegetables were all tough and flavorless. The meat on the antipasti was fine. My halibut was good, though it was dominated by the mountain of farro that was a good three times the size of the halibut piece. Other dishes ordered were disappointing as well, especially the overcooked and flavorless roasted duck. Service was OK, neither outstanding nor terrible. Our server seemed strangely irked that no one ordered dessert or coffee, which was odd, but whatever. Have to say I don't get the posi reviews for this place, but perhaps it was just a bad night. I'd be willing to give Piccolo another go, but hopes will most definitely be tempered next time.
