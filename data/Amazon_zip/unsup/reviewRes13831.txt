I just can't rate less than 5 stars! We were in town for our nephew's wedding, so it was a very brief visit to Chicago. Dangit!  My Hussie just had to yelp and find such a cool Cuban cafe...and we only got to visit this cafe once.  It was lunch time and we enjoyed this meal with our newly wedded nephew and his lovely bride. And he treated us...awwwww, extra cool. Empanada - ordered two types - 1. beef 2. goatcheese. Mmm. the outer skin had a nice crunch to it. It reminds me of a perfect McDonald's fried apple pie (yes the fried pies are the bomb). Maduros - ...mmmm, that tender sweet plantains is delicious.  Avocado salad - romaine lettuce, tomatoes, red onion and a whole lotta avocado. Best avocado I've ever had, I must say. And seasoned with olive oil, S & P. That's it. So simple, yet so satisfying. Cubano Sandwich - Ham, roast pork, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard on French bread. Pressed and toasted to perfection.  A Cuban staple you can't go without. Materva Yerba Mate Soda - when you want a quick pick-me-up. You got some serious caffeine, sugars, and corn syrup in a can of these! Wanted so badly to come back for dinner here, but had another engagement to attend. Oh well, we know where to go next time we're in Chicago. Until then...Buen provecho!
