This place is awesome! It's my favorite stop for coffee on the way to work in the morning. The staff is all really friendly and quick. I moved to the city a couple months ago and after about my fourth visit one of them knew my drink. They also have free wifi if you're hanging out for a while, and a nice outdoor sidewalk area in the summer. Great alternative to the Starbucks down the street.
