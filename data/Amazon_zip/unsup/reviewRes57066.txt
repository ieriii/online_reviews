I know places are difficult on a Friday night...but this place goes out of it's to make you feel uncomfortable. Bashed by wait staff as they scramble to get food to tables and 10 minute wait at the bar to get served whilst we waited for a table. So pint in hand of their own brewed beer my husband and I eagerly took are first sips. The beer was very lively one might say, having lived in the UK and traveled to many fine pubs...this was unusual and I thought fairly difficult to drink. A fizzy ale is a strange sensation. We waited about 30 minutes and finally got seated at our table and then waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to appear. He was nice but highly stressed as he manned a small poky corner of the restaurant. The appetizer arrived a spinach dip with very little spinach..it was OK. Pizza and another beer arrived. This time we decided to sample an IPA. We got a fruity cloudy beer that was how should I put it...odd. Pizza is OK but have had better, plates are too small to fit the large slices on and the people sat on the next level above us nearly knocked our pizza over several times due to the cramped setting. We ate and left. Would not entertain going there again...
