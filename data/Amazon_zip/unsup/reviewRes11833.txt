I went here because of all the fabulous reviews this place got for brunch, but it was anything but fabulous... the wait was ridiculous for food that is so-so and way over priced... All of which I can handle, but then maybe three or four bites into my meal, a cockroach went running across the table! I nearly got sick! I gave this place two stars instead of one because they did comp our meal and were very attentive, but I just couldn't go back without thinking about that cockroach running past my plate!
