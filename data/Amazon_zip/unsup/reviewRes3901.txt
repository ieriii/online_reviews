Just cause I'm born and raised in Chi and considered a "twinkie" does not mean I don't know my Korean food! I LOVE my Korean food and when I went to Crisp today, I was so excited to try it. When I went in around 12:30PM it was semi-crowded and we were able to find seats. I was kinda surprised at how small the place was but I guess the smaller, the homier? We ordered our food from the front and the guy seemed friendly and also recommended the popular dishes to us since we were new. We ended up getting the Baby Buddha, Seoul Steak Bowl, and the 5 piece chicken wings with two flavors (Seoul Sassy & Crisp BBQ). The Baby Buddha is bimbimbop aka rice bowl with tons of veggies such as carrots, spinach, meat, and a egg. It was not warm as I liked it to be but it was delicious and yummy. It tasted like how a bimbimbop should be. My boyfriend's dish Seoul Steak Bowl was OK, just a rice bowl with tons of bulgogi. The chicken wings were really flavorful, the my favorite sauce was the Seoul Sassy that was spicy and so saucy! The Crisp BBQ reminded me of childhood wings I had and it brought back memories.These chicken wings def kick butt. Next time I go, I will only get the wings and skip out on the bimbimbops.
