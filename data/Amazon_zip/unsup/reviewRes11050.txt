This place is over-the-top awesome. First of all, even if you're not a beer lover, you will discover one from this locally brewed smorgasborg of fresh-tasting beer--dark and curvy and top heavy are my faves! Now, as far as the pizza, phenomenal. The crust is crispy and chewy, the ratios of sauce and cheese are right on (not a lot of cheese, but trust me, it doesn't need it), and we discovered the best combination of sausage, fresh basil, and jalapeno. And, pleeease also try the mixed green salad--big enough to share and simply yum in a bowl;) 5+ stars! Go Piece!!
