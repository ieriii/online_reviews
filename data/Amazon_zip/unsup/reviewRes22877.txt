Hello, FOOD SNOB HERE. Living in NW Indiana, I do not get up here to often. But I'm glad I went out of the way ,and it was out of the way. Seen the two big dogs on TV. Hot Dog Paradise. Usually when you eat a dog you taste everything on it. The meat in this hot dog was bigger and jucier. Truely a great taste. You are able to taste the meat more than the trimmings. If you have bad fries with a hot dog or burger it ruins the meal. Here the fries are excellent. They look like White Castle fries but taste 10 times better. Use your imagination now. This is also truley a blast from the past. One of those last of its kind places. If you love hot dogs this is a must!!
