So I read the reviews for Coast before I went to the restaurant and I went there expecting attitude and douchebaggery. I have to say, I didn't find that to be the case at all. When we arrived, the place was packed and the hostess said that it would be a 25 minute wait for the table, but that the sushi bar was open. We immediately sat at the sushi bar. Our server was very nice, funny and was around when we needed him to be. (And his birthday is 2 days before mine, which makes him even cooler.)  We had the california roll, crunchy spicy tuna, unakyu (mmm, eel) and the dragon roll. Everything came out very quickly and tasted very fresh. Maybe I went on a good off-day. I don't know, but I will be back.
