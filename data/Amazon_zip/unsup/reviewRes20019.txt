To be perfectly honest, I think my favorite thing about XOCO is how it desperately tries to be something less than it is. If you ignored the line, the reputation, and the quality of food you would think you'd have entered any generic higher-end fast food joint. XOCO really wants to be the next Chipotle knock-off, when it's obviously so much more. Protip: You must get churros and hot chocolate with your meal. And you will ask them to only bring to them to you after you're done with the main course, so you get the warmest dessert possible. I went with the pepito, which was the unbeatable combo of pork and cheese. The bread had a great crunch to it, and I'm still praying for the poor Mexican family who Rick Bayless tortured to get their amazing secret spices. At least, that's how I imagined it went down. You don't become Top Chef without getting your hands a little dirty. I think I was more impressed with what my friend got, the duck soup. A little scant on the actual duck meat, but more mysterious Mexican spices is never a bad thing. The star of the show were the famous churros and chocolate. I loved that the authentic hot chocolate was dairy free, and the churros - sprinkled with bits of chocolate! Good lord. Those chocolate creme filled churros you've seen at amusement parks hope to one day grow up and become these churros. With their hugely extensive menu, I'm sure I'll be back - especially to sample anything new the twisted mind of Bayless comes up with.
