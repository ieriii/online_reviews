I've had my fair share of awesome sushi, mostly in the Seattle, WA area, but Coast is definitely my favorite. I love the volcano rolls, the fact that they have BYOB, the decor and the ambiance. I usually come here with a group of my friends, we order edename and a huge platter of rolls and after about 20 minutes we are ordering another huge platter of rolls. No complaints whatsoever, Coast is freaking fabulous.
