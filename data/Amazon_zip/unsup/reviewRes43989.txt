I will make this simple! 1. The service was adequate. He definitely seemed annoyed to be there. We went during lunch and with so many people talking, it was hard to hear him over the other conversations taking place. Plus he never smiled nor made us feel welcome. 2. On a happy note, the food was excellent! I had their swordfish salad special which had so many great flavors (mixed greens, beets, mango, apples). Amazing! I found myself ignoring my table guests so I could savor the food. My husband had the flat iron steak with the chipolte mashed potatoes--he said the potatoes were really spicy, but good and the steak was mouthwatering.  Atmosphere was great, it was pretty busy for lunch time. If the server/s could be more friendly & welcoming I would have definitely given this 4 stars!
