Absolutely unbelievable! Best brunch in the city, hands down.  A few months back my boyfriend and I accompanied a group here for brunch. Immediately, I fell in love with the charm of the atmosphere- the staff were all very cordial and at-the-ready and I particularly loved the rustic meets modern dcor with the communal style tables. Having arrived a bit before our party, my boyfriend and I got drinks and waited. He chose a seasonal cocktail, and I a mimosa. (It was brunch, after all!) Both were quite lovely. We were soon seated with our party, and my friend who had previously been there, took charge and ordered about a dozen different items- breads, sides, and entres, with a round of Bloody Mary's to start. Not my first choice in beverages, my mind was soon changed, and I became a fan. The Publican's recipe was unlike anything I have ever had before, and I enjoyed every sip. Our meal soon followed, and I can't tell you one dish that stood out, as all were spectacular. The presentation was lovely, and the unique combination of taste and textures created a true culinary experience that I soon would not forget. My boyfriend LOVED the bacon with maple syrup and the weiswurst, I enjoyed the omelet and we both thought the breads were scrumptious. Needless to say, I left very, very full and pleased. I will be back again very soon to try a few items that also caught my eye, which was, pretty much, the entire menu.
