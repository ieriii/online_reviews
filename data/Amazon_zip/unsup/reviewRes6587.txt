Here's the good stuff: Service - Top notch. We threw all kinds of things (think chicken episode of Portlandia) at our server and he had answers for everything. Everyone was attentive and the timing of the food was perfect. Ambiance - Cute and comfortable inside and outside Food - For the most part. My partner ordered the St. Louis ribs and he couldn't say enough good things about them; tender, flavorful, made with love. The bacon cheddar hush puppies were also very good. There's only one thing that didn't put a smile on my face: My food: I ordered the Kobe brisket and while the flavor was good, it was pretty dry. I also ordered the honey butter cornbread which was gigantic and again, while the flavor was good (and a nice compliment to the brisket), it was a bit dry and a little too crumbly. It could have been a fluke, or had something to do with the fact that we were sitting outside. I would definitely return and recommend to others.
