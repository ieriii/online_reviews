I love the laid-back atmosphere of Icosium Kafe. It's the ideal spot to end an evening with a dessert crepe in a cool, comfy setting. My friend and I had just finished dinner but still wanted to talk a bit more, as well as have some dessert and immediately Icosium came to mind. The decor reminded me of being in a Cost Plus World Market (except all of this stuff is authentic and not made in China). The walls were covered with tapestries and the smell of mint tea perfumed the air. I ordered a coffee and we split a raspberry/chocolate crepe. I felt bad because twice I had to ask our server for more hot water as the coffee was way too strong for me. And this wasn't even Turkish coffee; this was plain old American-brewed. The crepe had real raspberries, which was a pleasant surprise as I was expecting frozen ones, or worse, raspberry jam. We were going to split another crepe but this one was so rich, we decided against it. It was busy in here on a Friday evening but we weren't rushed in any way. We felt like we were in one of those old bohemian coffeehouses in the 60s where you could hang out all night and talk. After reading all the great reviews for the savory crepes, I will definitely be back to make my way through the rest of the menu.
