We went out of our way during our trip to Chicago to get to this place as the reviews were good. I am from Romania so I have terms of comparison for the food. My husband is American but likes our cuisine. The food was ok. The eggplant spread was mediocre, my mom makes a lot better one. The mititei and the polenta were really good though. For main courses, I got the stuffed cabbage and it was pretty good, slightly too salty though (and I love salty). My husband got the Veal Paprikas and it was excellent. For desert he got the appe strudel and it was excellent. I was very excited to get an old time favorite, the Dobos cake. Well, this was nothing like the Dobos I know .The real Dobos should have very thin layers of cake, and many of them. This only had a few thick (and some slightly burned) layers of cake. The taste was not too bad though, it somewhat resembled the real thing. The prices are really hight . Our meal came to about $85.00 or so. We did have a yelp deal of 20 for 40, so that helped. The owner asked me if I wanted him to add 18% gratuity on the bill. I told him that I do my own tipping after. He then proceeded to give me a lecture on which amount I should tip on. I told him that tipping in the USA is not mandatory, only recommended and it needs to be earned with good food and good service (which we got both, relatively speaking). He seemed to take offense to this but we often use groupon deals and I am pretty much aware of how tipping works. I left a 20% tip and I hope that by reading this review, the owner will have learned a lesson in customer service.
