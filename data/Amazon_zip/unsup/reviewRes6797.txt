Some good stuff.... Some uhm ok stuff... Some bad stuff... Our reservation was for June 16, Saturday.... My bf's mom' birthday, my dad's birthday and fathers day celebration, all in one.... The most wonderful thing about this reservation is Nick... He called I believe a day or two to confirm appointment, he accommodated the earlier reservation that I requested, sounded so genuine... I was sold. when we got there... Valet sign.... But no valet guy. Hmmmmm.... He came 10 minutes after... Are they not supposed to be there when they actually open? Since we live in the burbs, and on a diet, we wanted to have an early dinner, knowing we will be pigging out and we have to drive 1 hour back... We were their first customer at 4pm... 6 of us excited to try this restaurant... Benjie, our server was very friendly and formal at the same time. I like. He was attentive, helpful and handsome... Yeah yeah yeah... That counts... Anyways.... 'eye rolling' Let's discuss food.... Hmm... Calamari.... 5 stars... Light, crunchy and fresh... Dee lish... Crostini di avocado....3 stars... Meh, i expected too much.... Salad.... 2 stars.... Seriously, I wouldn't even order that next time... Zuppa di pesce..... 5 stars... My bf got the spicy one, it's humongous... Good for 3 people... Believe me.... But it's delicious... Lobster raviolli.... 3 stars... Uhm... I can get that flavor from Olive garden, nothing special... Ribs.... To die for... 5 stars.... My son was in heaven... Succelent.. Juicy.... Yum Tiramisu... 3 stars.... It's tiramisu.... Panna Cotta... Oh my lord.... I want to get this delivered to my house everyday please? Pretty please? Definitely 5 stars.... After paying close to $400 plus tip.... ' rolling my eyes again' not for frugal people, that's for sure.... No one knows you after... Went to the washroom, the servers don't even smile anymore.... What??? I just spent $400 freakin dollars? Whack.... This place was in full swing by 5:30.. Seriously, mostly Caucasian ... Our table, a mix of Asian (only asians when we were there), African American (my bf) and his mom, Italian.... But still.... I suggest Sapori trattoria employees to be courteous, to everyone. Even after guests have paid.... We travelled from the burbs...I had my hair done, and we drive new Benz's... Treat us with some respect.... Before, especially after we pay, Dammit...
