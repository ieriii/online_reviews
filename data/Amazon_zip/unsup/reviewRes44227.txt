The salad roll is possibly my favorite thing in the world. If I could, I would subsist solely on these salad rolls. Brown rice, fat tomatoes, ginger puree ... yum. I realize the salad roll probably isn't what most people head to a sushi place to eat, but, I promise, it's really good. (I also really recommend the gomae.) This restaurant also gets high marks from me because the last time I ordered I had to wait on the phone for a while because the restaurant was busy, and they sent me free edamame as compensation.
