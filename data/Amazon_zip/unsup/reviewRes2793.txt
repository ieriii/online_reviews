I'm giving this review 4 stars but with with a major contingency. I would give it 5 stars if I could only rate the desserts, but I can't. My review is going to be kept simple.  Skip the meal, go strait for dessert.  4 of us went to dinner & none of us were impressed with the meal. Across the board, it lacked originality & flavor that you expect as a restaurant such as this. However, when it came time for the dessert, it was a completely different story. Delicious, inventive & beautifully presented.  I do believe that you can make reservations for dessert only...you'll have to double check.
