Great Costa Rican food at a decent price. They have wonderful fruit and/or oatmeal shakes and the various meat plates can easily feed two people. Everything on the menu here is delicious. For an interesting treat, try the potato tacos. They're deep fried like flautas and served with a generous portion of guacamole. They're great if you bring a vegetarian friend (and so are their veggie empanadas). For garlic lovers, I also high recommend the tostones con mojo (deep fried plaintains with a pile of garlic on them). I did go once when the tinted squid was more than a bit off, but I'm forgiving them for that because everything else is so tasty. It's cash only and BYOB and gets quite crowded some nights but it's usually quite easy to get into for lunch.
