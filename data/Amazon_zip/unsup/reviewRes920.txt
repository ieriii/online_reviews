Great prices, great dog variety, awesome fries...basically kicks ass. Did the chicago, foie gras, and a pate dog...all were pretty dang good. Pate one had some crazy unique Mediterranean-like flavors from that butter. Only thing that sucks is the hour and a half line...Why do you have to close so early (4 pm) and closed on Sundays?...they would be ba jillionaires if they were 24 hours.
