Way over-rated.It's so dark inside we had to use the table candles to read the menu. And the tables are packed so tightly together it's like flying coach. Not a chic crowd -- the beautiful people have moved on. Hostess was so snooty it needs to commented on -- but I will say the server was better. Food was mediocre -- not value for money. There are too many other restaurants in Chicago serving better food for the same dollar. I had the ginger marinated duck -- it was pedantic. My companion had the salmon vermicelli -- it was a $12 entree for $23. There are better options.
