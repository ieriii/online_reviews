Was brought here to experience true Chicago-style deep dish pizza and was thoroughly impressed. Allow at least 45 minutes in your dining schedule for them to make the pizza from ordering--deep dish is apparently no speedy affair! Beer and drinks were a bit pricey, but probably no more than any other local dinner spot. Deep dish isn't the same the next day, so come with friends!
