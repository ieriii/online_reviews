I enjoyed my time there sitting at the bar. I liked watching them make the cocktails almost as much as I enjoyed drinking them. Almost. That being said, I think this is not the place for those of us who have little patience and not for those "looking to have a drink" I think you really have to know what you are getting into before you go, so be prepared for a little forced pretense, an extremely dark setting, some experimentation in flavors and a quiet atmosphere.  I've been a couple times for happy hour cocktails and I can see how this place would get annoying if it were crowded or if you were there with a group larger than 4. This place is best enjoyed when it's quiet and sparsely populated so that attention can be properly lavished upon the cocktails and the artistry that is put into making them.
