my boyfriend loves steak ...so this is a great addition to the sometimes boring steakhouse...visited on a saturday night ... we didnt have a reso but were able to get a spot at the bar (thanks for the great service leigh!) and than a table in the bar... they had live music love it and the food was delicious ! great place to get dressed up and have a night out... cant wait to go back
