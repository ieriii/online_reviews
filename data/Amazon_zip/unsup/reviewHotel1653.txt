I was procrastinating on V-day plans and ended up booking this hotel for a last-minute staycation. The hotel itself was very beautiful. I liked the sweeping staircase--kind of reminded me of the one from Titanic. The lobby is pretty standard, I don't understand why people rave about it. The service didn't really stand out. The concierge was not very good. She didn't really give me any helpful tips/information like they usually do. Her only suggestion was informing me of the 4-course Valentine's Day dinner at the hotel restaurant. Our room was small-- but since we didn't have any luggage-- the size didn't bother us. We also didn't hear any noise from the other rooms and the hotel was quiet overall. We got free wifi by signing up with their rewards program so that was nice. The bed is hands downs my favorite part of our stay. It was hard to leave it :/ The location is probably its biggest selling point. It was too cold and windy to walk but I can imagine that it would be super nice in the summer. Cab fare is about $7 plus tip to the restaurants off of Michigan. I would rate my overall experience as 3 stars but I'm taking off one star for the non existent service. I will probably pay the extra money to stay at Hotel Palomar next time.
