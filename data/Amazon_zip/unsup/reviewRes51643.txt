I really love Garcia's! Homey, low-key, lotsa families and daters, and neighborhood-ies go there....great mix of diners! Walking in is like a 5th dimension experience; tiny entrance, not so tiny space really. They even have a small bar thru a doorway if you have to wait to be seated. At that bar, they will serve you an ASS kicking margarita, so be careful! They really pack a wallop that you won't see coming! Delicious and simple and fresh food; I've had the fajitas, the carne asada and the guacamole....beans and rice are great. Chips are hot from the fryer and just cannot be beat. This place is easy to walk right past, I've done it for years. But if you're in the mood for good solid comfort food, you've come to the right place.
