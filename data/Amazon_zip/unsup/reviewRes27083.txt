Yum! Went on a Monday night, it was bustling but not crowded. I definitely recommend heading upstairs and getting a big comfy booth. The upstairs was much quieter - there were still games on TV, but I think the TVs were muted. They didn't mind at all that my group sat and talked for quite awhile. Pizza came out very quick and was delicious. Good variety of drinks available and the prices are great for the quantity and quality of food. Prices for fried sides looked a little high but that was probably for the best as it encouraged me to skip the sides and save room for yummy pizza :)
