wish there were more places like this downtown! bright and spacious, huge menu, lots of solid food at a really decnet price. we showed up 20 minutes to closing and had the peking duck, roast pork over rice, and shrimp dumpling soup (although i think they gave us pork dumplings) - all were really good. why do they close at 10? if opened later I'm sure there'd be a post-bar crowd looking for late night eats.
