My husband and I decided to try this place out after all of our friends raved about it. It was pretty delicious! The plaintains were my favorite part. I got the steak tico. I really enjoyed the rice and beans as well as the plantains and roasted veggies, but the meat didn't really do it for me. My husband got some sort of deep friend pork and yuca. That was delicious!! The people who work there are also extremely nice. My husband accidentally ate a jalapeno and was dying and they brought him out some plaintains with sour cream to neutralize the burning. We got take out from them one time too on a friday night. The burritos were delicious, although it did take awhile to get them. Nonetheless, very tasty and we will be back!
