I'm surprised this hotel got such great reviews. I suppose my experience wasn't bad but it certainly was not 4 stars. I must have gotten a non-renovated room because it was really small, dingy, the hair dryer didn't really work and everything inside was a little on the small side, all these small nooks and crannies made it uncertain what exactly it was I was supposed to use. Overall check in was easy, check out was easier. They held the bags on the last day since my flight out wasn't until late. The place was mediocre priced but for the room and the amenities that I received, I would have expected it to be even lower. The location is great but sort of overshadowed by the Hancock building. It's easy to get taxi's from this area as it is right near Magnificent Mile. There was nothing bad about the stay, but it was definitely unimpressive and could have been better in some ways taking note of the price. I will probably hesitate to stay here again unless I get a killer deal.
