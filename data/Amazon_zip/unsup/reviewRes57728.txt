This place was flat out awesome! I went with my girlfriend for our first time, although the coffee wasn't stellar, I got an omelet and she got the lox. Every veggie was so so so fresh and tasty. I've never had that thought before about freshness (I usually scarf my meals, especially breakfast) but it couldn't be overlooked.The omelet came with all sorts of veggies and even the lox with the uncooked red onion and cucumbers were great. The hash browns were also wonderful, I would go back in a heart beat.Highly recommend this place, great job serving breakfast.
