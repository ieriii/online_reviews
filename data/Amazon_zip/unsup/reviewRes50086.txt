Came here with Emily F. for the Super Bowl. I ate boneless Honey BBQ wings (that actually tasted kind of off), Buffalo Wings (delish), and a BBBLT (the boy I shared this with LOVED all the bacon, I thought it was overwhelming). I also had about 5 Ketel One + Sodas, which were REALLY STRONG, until I figured out I really needed to switch to water.  I appreciated that they had a drinking game set up for us when we got there with the rules printed out, and that the waiter, Adam, was very attentive.  Just an fyi, if you reserve a table for 12, as we did, there is a $400 minimum. We had no problem hitting that over the course of 5 hours.
