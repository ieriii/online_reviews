I am so excited to have this amazing restaurant in Chicago! My husband and I went there last weekend with some friends from out of town and it really exceeded our expectations! The whole place is sexy, hip and fun!  Our dinner was great. I don't know who could eat that much food! Everything is SO big! The lobster mashed potatos were amazing. I think I could live on them alone. They weren't cheap, but were worth every penny! After dinner we just had to go sit at the bar. It is so beautiful! The bottles lined up behind the bar, the swanky chairs, the dark room....we drank martinis that were to die for. Our bartender Justin made amazing drinks, was charming and entertaining! I would go back just to sit in the bar. With service this great, drinks this easy to drink and mashed potatos this tasty, we will be back for sure!
