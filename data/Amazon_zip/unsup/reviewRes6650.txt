I came here on my last visit to the CHI to visit with a friend. She's been a fan of Chicago q since it opened and she's had parties here etc. They've been good to her, so why wouldn't she want to show it off? Chicago q is very cute & white picked fence looking. I only sat at the bar because I was waiting for my friend. After a while, I felt bad for not having a drink, and sleepy, so I ordered a French Press of Coffee. It was okay. I think I do a better French Press at home, but hey, not everyone loves a deep, dark coffee like moi. Upon my friend's arrival, we moved to the patio. Sweet, cozy, and we had our pick of the tables. The GM came out to greet my friend and was very pleasant to me as well. This is a great little patio for people watching in the posher neighborhood of the CHI. I seriously have very little to say about the food because I really didn't have any. This day was HELLA hot and I had NO appetite. I did order the BBQ flight and I enjoyed the pork and the chicken the best. They brought approximately 6 sauces to try. I enjoyed the mustard the best. The corn bread was WAY too sweet, I would have preferred maybe the jalapeno kind, but like I said...I wasn't hungry. The BBQ chips and pickles the were complimentary to each table were amazing. The service was spectacular I'd go again, and probably next time with an appetite.
