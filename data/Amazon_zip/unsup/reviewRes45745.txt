Ok, I have eaten at Wilde more times than I have fingers on my hands, and first of all, it is finally great to have a real, decent, normal bar/restaurant like Wilde on Broadway, because all of the other places are serving grade D meals in less than clean establishments. Wilde has a welcome decor, warm, cozy, nice wooden finishing s, fireplaces, library area...a cross between an Irish pub and mansion-like decor. The service is very good and the food is top-notch bar food...quality-wise and taste-wise. I highly recommend the Fish n Chips and Shepard's Pie. One note, I noticed all of the lower, two star ratings below are from people who are trying define Wilde from snobbish, anti-establishment perspective...these people will hate anything that is actually done nicely. One writer complained that Wilde wasn't dirty enough like a real Irish pub...come on, what a moron! Another 2-star rater complained that they wouldn't customize their meal..."they had all of the ingredients based on other meals served near-bye...", I mean are these people real? If you want custom made meals go to a sushi restaurant or the "Counter" burger joint, they'll make a custom burger for you, but if it's not on the menu don't order it...they're not your mother, they're a business! Anyhow, you'll love Wilde...enjoy!
