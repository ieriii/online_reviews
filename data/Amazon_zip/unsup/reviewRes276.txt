Meal of a lifetime. We ordered the Tour menu (20+ courses) and a reduced wine pairing for two people. Yeah, it was expensive. Really expensive. Almost as much as my rent.  But as a wannabe foodie, it was worth every penny. It's as much an experience as a meal, and I never wanted it to end...until the final course, which ended the meal on such a note that I finally felt ready to go. Even the wine pairings were awesome, illuminating different types I had never even heard of. Service was amazing and attentive, while still being friendly and not stuffy.  If you do the Tour, try to not have crazy plans early the next day. It doesn't make you feel full, but it does take many hours to "recuperate".
