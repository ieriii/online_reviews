The salad bar at this restaurant is FABULOUS!!! Oh my gosh, my boyfriend took me here this past weekend after we went to Lincoln Park Zoo and it was really crowded so we found a spot in the bar. Love the atmosphere!! Great bar tender!! Anyway when we finally got seated I indulged in the terrific salad bar while my boyfriend ordered a hamburger. To die for. Great burger and salad bar. When we told the waiter that it was our first time to eat there he came back with a complimentary dessert. Unbelievable and we will be back.
