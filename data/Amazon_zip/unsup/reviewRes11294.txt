Best crust on a pizza I have had anywhere, and I am a pizza freak. Fair prices, great beer, good music. That said, I avoid it like the plague on Saturdays, when they have full-band karaoke. They play great music otherwise. My rating was originally five stars, but I've taken it down after the hostess significantly underestimated my wait time twice. There's a good chance you'll have to wait here, and the only places to do it are outside in the cold or inside where it's claustrophobic and you're in everyone's way. In both situations there's nowhere to sit, and after standing for 30-45 minutes, it can really kill your mood. But man, this pizza is absolutely transcendent.
