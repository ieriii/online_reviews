I was so excited to eat here and was unfortunately soooo disappointed. We sat with empty drinks several times in the night and this was a bigger deal than normal because the food was disgustingly salty. Even my husband, who puts extra salt on everything and never leaves a bite on a plate, couldn't finish his dish because it was so over-seasoned. The sides were equally as salty. Not my favorite pick in the city.
