Argh. I REALLY wanted to love Longman & Eagle. I'd heard good things about it, I'd salivated over the menu. But in person, it just didn't live up to the expectations. Unlike some of the other reviewers, wait and cost were neither of my concern. We hit it up on a random Sunday night and waited about 30 minutes at the outside bar area to get a table outside. It was completely pleasant and expected for a restaurant like this. I started my meal off with the Black Cherry 101. It was sweet, well balanced and delicious. Ground breaking? No, but quite tasty. From there were ordered a range of dishes including the Skirt Steak, Roasted Cauliflower, Pork Belly, and something else that slipped my mind. I have to admit that I was underwhelmed with the food. One, I'm wondering if we hit it on an off menu day & ordered the wrong items. I was really hoping for something creative and unusual and quite honestly, everything at the time seemed pretty straight forward. Looking at the menu now there are far more creative things than there were when I went. While nothing we had was awful, things were more in the average to good range, which is less than what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Had I gotten this food from a no-name restaurant I would have been satisfied, but with much hype comes high expectations. Food aside, the experience was good. The patio was charming and the service was good. I never once felt rushed and my water glass was always promptly refilled. I'm considering a second visit in the hopes it will be better, but at the moment this just wasn't as good as what I was expecting.
