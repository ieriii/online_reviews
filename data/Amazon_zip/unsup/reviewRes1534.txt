I've been to doug's a couple times.  I've had the Chicago Dog, a couple of celeb specials, and the thai sausage one. I'm sad to say... I am not that impressed. They are good hot dogs, but I don't find them amazing. Actually, I think I like the Chicago dog best, maybe i'm just a chicago dog type chick.  However, note to others, I went on a monday at 1:30 pm and was out of there by 2, including line and eating. What up!!!!!!!!
