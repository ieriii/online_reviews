Yay vegetarian! I love places that let me eat anything I want with abandon! And even given that, I still felt a bit guilty eating the fake bacon products...it was a weird experience! I think I ended up with a sweet potato burger. It was a bit overdone and didn't much taste or look like sweet potatoes. But that was ok. It was good. The fries were QUITE yummy :) The location was pretty awesome too. A bit unexpected (my first night in Chicago -- I had no idea where I was being taken), but a cool spot.
