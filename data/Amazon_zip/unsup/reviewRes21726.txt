Superdawg is awesome. I don't know why it took me so long to go...maybe it was that it was so far out of the way...but I know I'll be back many many times. The polish is awesome, the dogs are great, the fries delish...I have not a complaint about the food at all! Long live Superdawg and its deliciousness! On a nice day you actually have three options for eating at Superdawg. 1) stay in your car and have the car-hop 2) go in the little dining area and eat in (which is what I did and it was fun!) 3) eat at one of, say, 4 tables with umbrellas outside. All options seemed pretty fun. Yeah, they get busy but not insane...it's not a deterrent. The reason why they're busy is because people love this place. That's a great thing to appreciate.
