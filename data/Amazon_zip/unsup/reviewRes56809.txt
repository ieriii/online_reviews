I came with my husband and a few friends and I must say we had a great time. The pizza was just like I remembered in Italy. Our waiter was great, I think his name was Jeremy. You could tell Jeremy really liked his job because his energy and enthusiasm had us exited about our meal before it even arrived!! We will be back again and I will tell all my friends. The Sorrentina was amazing! Great service and great food!
