The masses pretty much have this one right. I give it a 4. Good, solid quality sushi that isn't too expensive (and it's BYOB). And I'm basing this on the nigiri, because throwing mayo or cream cheese on your 'creative' rolls just hides bad fish.  My best sushi experience in Chicago so far. Better than Toro in Lincoln Park, and much much much better than Sushi Ra or Sushi X (now sushi para x?).  Give it a go, people. Get the sushi plate, yum.
