I enjoyed staying here immensely. The staff at The Drake treat their guests like royalty and, with the beautiful lobby and glamorous history, you will feel like royalty as well. My mom and I stayed here last summer in one of the suites. However, they had overbooked that night and ended up having to place us in a smoking wing. My mom is extremely sensitive to smoke smell and I don't care for it either. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do about it so they upgraded our room. The suite we ended up getting was beautiful-- it was a corner room so it was bigger than most and had a wonderful view of the lake. We actually witnessed a tornado by watching it sweep across the lake from the safety of our room. I'm a big fan of historic buildings and luxurious and over-the-top decor. Give me blood red velvet curtains and gold embossed leather walls and I'm a happy woman. So you can see why I was so impressed with The Drake. The clientele this hotel attracts is equally impressive. I was in the tea room the same day a woman was throwing her bridal shower there. When I went to the powder room (really, "bathroom" doesn't do it justice), I overheard the woman crying about a lost diamond ring and her friends trying to convince her it's not a big deal at all. You can bet I was on the floor looking for it. The Drake is a wonderful place to stay if you're on a vacation that you want to make extra glamorous, decadent or special. On that same note, I wouldn't recommend it to business travelers as there are no office-type amenities and, while the service is great, the staff tend to take their time.
