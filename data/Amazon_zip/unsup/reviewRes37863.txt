Of all the places I miss now that I no longer live in Chicago, this place is #1. The atmosphere here is so fun, the food is delectable, and the beers are... well, to describe each one would be hard, but let's just say it's worth sticking around to try them all. Bartenders are great even though their job is so stressful. Service is pretty fast even during the busiest nights. The worst thing about this place is really just its popularity... it can be difficult to get a seat! But it's worth the wait.
