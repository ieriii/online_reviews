My boyfriend took me to Alinea in August. Upon entering the outer door of Alinea I felt as though I had entered some sort of weird sci-fi movie. Walking in from the street you are instantly sucked into an alternate world. The dim dreamy light and curved hallway lead you to doors that instantly open. There the hostess greeted us by name (how did she do that?!) and immediately led us to our table. We did the 12 course tasting with the suggested wine pairing. Started out with a shot of vodka! I think this was excellent, not only for the course of food but to relax before you splurge half a months rent on dinner. The rest was a delightful blur. Highlight: Black Truffle Explosion, I think I love you! Creative! Amazing flavors! Great experience! Impeccable service!
