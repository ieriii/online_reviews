I was excited to finally try this restaurant that I'd heard for so long was a good place to get hot noodle soup but was so disappointed. The interior and restaurant itself is what it is, which is okay, but the food was unacceptably bad. We ordered a shrimp noodle dish that was cold and had no flavor whatsoever. My seafood egg noodle soup had 3 pieces of seafood. The beef noodle soup had a strange flavor profile and frightening red color. The egg rolls were thin and the diced ingredients were mushy. The pan-fried noodles are inedible and tasted more deep-fried than pan-fried and have very few ingredients aside from the fried noodles. The only good dish we had, which was actually pretty good, was the pork chop. The bubble drinks also tasted like the fruit was not fresh. I love Vietnamese food, especially noodle soups, but the food was low quality and our bill was still over $80. We brought our two young kids and it was scary because the seating is so close together but the servers are walking around carrying these hot bowls of soup.
