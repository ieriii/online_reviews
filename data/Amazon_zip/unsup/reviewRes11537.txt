Piece is fine. the pizza is good, the home brewed beer is better and it's always way too crowded. I don't get the hype. I've had delivery/take out numerous times and although I enjoy mashed potatoes on my pizza, I still like red sauce/sausage/giardinera (LOUD flavors) more. Finally actually ate in Piece for the sad, sad, sad NFC championship game (had to drown myself in the Trippel to make it through the game). We got there at noon to stake out our booth for the game and too many others had the same idea. Tried out all the apps, the spinach/cheese dip and guac were my favs. The guac has a slight kick. We started out with a round of all the beers in sample sizes and decided with a pitcher of the worrin' ale. It's light, tasty and easy to drink in large quantities. I also had 2 pints of the Tripple, and huge glass of the dark and curvy. My hypothesis is that Chicago needs more bars that home brews. We're really lacking that and so everyone piles into Piece when really it's not that great. Put a Bell's brewery and pub in Chicago and Piece will lose half its customers and then finally people don't have to wait an hour for a table on a weekday night.
