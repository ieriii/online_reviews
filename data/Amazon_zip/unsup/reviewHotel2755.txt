The best place to stay in down town Chicago. I've stayed at least in 5-6 different hotels in the downtown chicago area for business and pleasure. For the money-location and service- I'll be staying at the James from now on. Its similar to the W without the "chaos." Very modern. Fantastic service from the door men- to spa to the front desk. And only one block away from michigan Ave. Centerally located. I've stayed at the James twice now- first time business- second time pleasure- and both stays were consistant. And added bonus- the Kiehls products you get in the room. And need to give special kudos to Scott - Lobby Assistant Coordinator- gave us good tips on where to go and even got us into a popular bar with VIP- no wait in line status.
