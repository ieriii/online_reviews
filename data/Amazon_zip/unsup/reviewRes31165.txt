This was great experience through and through. Party of 4 and we sat in the bar room. Festive--fun and the live music s a great touch. Our server was terrific. Great personality--explained the food options well and was extremely attentive.  The food was first rate with the steaks being prepared perfectly as ordered.  Overall in a city that boasts great steakhouses this one is on the top of my list.
