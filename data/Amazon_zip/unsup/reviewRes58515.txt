A Cautionary Tale:The food was fine, and the bartender (Pepe) was fine. We were there on Cinco de Mayo. It was busy, but that wasn't bad either. My wife went to the bathroom. She was washing her hands & someone else flushed the toilet. All the cold water shut off, and she scalded her hand. She was shaking in pain. Her hand was burned when she got back to the bar. The bartender gave her a napkin with ice, which helped ease the pain. When we went to leave, I told the THREE people behind the counter what happened. TWO of them LITERALLY TURNED AWAY FROM ME WHILE I WAS TALKING. The other guy leaned back, folded his arms, and asked, do you want to talk to someone about that? I thought that was what I was doing. I reiterated that I was telling them this to prevent others from getting hurt, and suggested that they put up a sign or better yet-- GET THE PLUMBING FIXED. The guy could care less. I sarcastically remarked that his heartfelt compassion was so overwhelming that we had to leave. TOTAL A$$holes. I emailed the company about it. They haven't responded AT ALL. CUSTOMER SERVICE === EPIC FAIL! AVOID this place like the plague. They don't deserve your business.
