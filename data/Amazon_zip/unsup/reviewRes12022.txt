Very good beer, and we ran into Rahm Emmanuel there. The salads were hearty and tasty. Truth be told, the pizzas just didn't do it for me. They were fine, but nothing special. Somewhat betwixt and between: if you want to do thin crust, do it; if you want to do gourmet toppings, do it; ... It was fine, and a good spot for a big group birthday party, but nothing special pizzawise.
