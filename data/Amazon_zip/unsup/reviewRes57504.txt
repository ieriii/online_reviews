This was the most TASTELESS Greek dining experience ever. Food was bland, and the GYRO was the worst I ever had, again TASTELESS. The Flamming cheese was not hot and tasted more like a glop of churned butter milk. I brushed my teeth several times afterwards, flossed and still had that taste in my mouth... The only thing that was good was the chicken, and who can mess up chicken?
