I went in for St. Patricks Day, in search of some green beer and corned beer. I thought they had a great atmosphere, with some good St. Patty's day music. But, their pints of green beer were $6, they actually upped the prices instead of offering a St. Patty's day special, I guess its a good plan to make money. The $13 sandwich was filling, but nothing spectacular. Service was good, our waiter was there when we needed him. I don't know if I will be back though, the food really didnt excite me for the price.
