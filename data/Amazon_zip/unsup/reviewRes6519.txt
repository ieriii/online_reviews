My expectations were high, and they were met. Yes, the wait is long. But it's worth it. Give the hostess your cell phone number and go enjoy some pre-dinner cocktails at the cool wine bar across the street. You'll get a call when your table is ready. The small plate concept really works, allowing two people to sample and share a wide variety of dishes. Plus the prices are very reasonable. Dinner for two with drinks/wine for well under $100? Yes, you can do it here. We started with the roasted corn and mushroom salad. It was unique and outstanding. Next, the prosciutto pizza. It was Italia-authentic and delicious. I loved the little wooden container filled with spices to season the pizza--salt, red pepper flakes and oregano mixed with black pepper. Extra seasonings weren't necessary but they certainly enhanced the already wonderful flavor. Then we had the rigatoni with sausage. Good Lord, it was divine. Lastly, we split the strip steak. Perfectly cooked to medium and so flavorful. We ordered a side of brussel sprouts to accompany the steak; they were nicely done and a good accompaniment. We capped off the meal with the chocolate hazelnut mousse and a scoop of the homemade vanilla gelato. The gelato was better than any I've had in Italy, and the chocolate creation was spectacular -- you'll fight over bites of the crunchy toffee-like bottom. Our server, a somewhat portly guy, was very efficient, friendly and helpful with recommendations and always there when we needed him, despite the fact that the place was at capacity. I will make this one of my regular spots when dining in the city. It's right up there with Coco Pazzo, my favorite restaurant, as one of the best Italian dining experiences in Chicago.
