I am very disappointed that I have never visited this place sooner. I have lived in Chicago my entire life and never visited Dougs. I did so on Friday, and let me say, it was awesome! There was a bit of a wait outside, but the weather was decent, and it moved fairly fast. We got in line probably about 3:40 and the restaurant closes at 4. Well, we finally got in and order at 4:00pm and they werent even trying to rush people out of the place. In fact, Doug made us feel like we could stay as long as we wanted!  I was just so pleased when ordered our delicious meal and Doug greeted us with a smile and some jokes! You can tell he puts care into his establishment. The fries are top notch and fresh, and the sausage - is other-worldly. Try the Atomic Bomb, the combination of HOT spices and fruit infused cheese is awesome. Will be back again!
