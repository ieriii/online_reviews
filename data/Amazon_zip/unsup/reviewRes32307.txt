Four of us went here for lunch today. We were not overly impressed with the buffet...it looked a little tired/like it had been sitting for a while. So, instead, we simply ordered off the regular menu. Perhaps not as good an economic move, but better in terms of food. I don't have their menu in front of me now so I can't remember the names of each dish we had but I can summarize: We had the tilapia in berbere sauce which was good though could have done with larger chunks of fish. We also had a lamb dish and it was disappointing. The lamb was a bit tough, not so tender at all, and it was a bit of an etiquette question in terms of the bits of bone and where to put them. We had the yellow and the red lentils. The yellow were better. Then we had a steak dish with cottage cheese and goshen. It was great...so many fresh spices going on and then BAM a fair amount of spicy heat. The coffee is definitely enough for two...I drank most of one pot and boy was I h-y-p-e-r. The service wasn't all that friendly. Not mean or dismissive just not all that attentive...when we asked for a recommendation the young woman wasn't all that excited about giving one. Ras Dashen's meat courses are maybe a little better...and they have a wider variety of vegetarian dishes. There's a parking lot behind the place, $5.
