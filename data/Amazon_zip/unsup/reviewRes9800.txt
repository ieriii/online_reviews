Loved this place. Great ambiance, and the wait staff was friendly, prompt and totally professional. My group even got comped some appetizers and really interesting cocktails, which was a welcome surprise. As for the food, my group shared everything, but my personal favorites were the Pho (soup), Goi Cuon (appetizer), and Ga Xao Cari (chicken with yellow curry). They a location in New York that is wonderful as well. Great dinner!
