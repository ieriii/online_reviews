The only downside is that it's cramped and busy. If you like fish, come here. it's fresh and done in a ton of different ways. And they have a LOBSTER ROLL which is the best food ever. Also Hoosier Mama pies.  Staff has always been nice to me, though extremely blase about how everyone is bumping into each other because it's so cramped.
