I went there for the first time on Saturday night. I drove and street parking is pretty assessable. Also, valet is only $5. The atmosphere is festive and fun. The music is good, not too loud. We had to wait about 10 minutes for our reservation, but while waiting, a cocktail server asked for our drink order. The ceveche is fabulous. We had the trio of scallops, crab, and shrimp. Our server, Louise, was amazing. He offered suggestions on drink pairings with our dinner order. He also did not sell to the person, he sold to the food. By that, I mean, he suggested beer with my halibut. Servers do not usually suggest beer for a female. I was very impressed. Over all, the food was great and the service was outstanding. I will definitely be back.
