The pizza was AWESOME. Loved it, would definitely pick up pizza again. If you love beer, they brew their own. You can sample them for a buck a pop which is pretty sweet. Not a beer fan, but trying home brews is fun. We went there on a Sunday night. It was SO overcrowded, we waiting over an hour for a table for 7 people. It would have been fine if they had said come back in an hour. But first it was 20 minutes, then we would go check in, then another 20 minutes, checked in again, another 20 minutes. The waitress was rude and didn't have time to tend to her tables. This could be due to poor management, you don't give one server 3 tables of 10 and 3 tables of 3, no one is able to keep up with that. Cool place to grab pizza, I would just go back when its less crowded. They only take reservations for parties of 10 or more.
