Gino's was on the hit list of places to go to in Chicago!! We were ready and willing to chow down on Chicago's best! and boy were we dissapointed =( Nothing wrong with the pizza but realized that it simply wasnt our type of pizza. Way too much sauce which drowned out everything else. Sorry Chicago, I give you thumbs up over New York in everything else except the pizza.
