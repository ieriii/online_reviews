I went here last night with a group of guys with pretty high expectations. The service was great, beware the tables have metal bars underneath that you can easily knock on your knee on. Sounds like a weird comment? Well 3 out of 6 of us hit that bar pretty hard so i wouldn't be surprised if others have as well. We started off with the spring rolls, egg rolls, crepe, and the marinated beef sandwich. The rolls were good when using the sauces (both the plum and house hot sauce are excellent). The beef and crepe were my favorite of the bunch. For dinner I went with #39 loaded beef noodle Pho, seemed like the way to go for a first-timer. Beware the dish is huge, i think i only had 1/3 of it, and quite a bit mysterious as far as what all is exactly in there. All in all i can safely say i'm not really a Pho fan which maybe makes my review skewed quite a bit - wasn't too impressed. I liked my friends dishes more so than mine. I would definitely go back to try something else, the menu is massive - it literally looks like a children's book (thick and with pictures) - and the BYOB is always a big plus.
