I'm a big fan of Rick Bayless so I was excited to go to Frontera Grill. We dined for Saturday brunch, luckily we made reservations or else we would have been waiting for awhile like many other folks did.  I had high expectations for this place and for Mexican food being from California (SF and L.A.) and although it was tasty, it fell short to what I would consider a stellar meal. I had the chilaquiles- my favorite brunch dish, the flavors really popped but the sauce was a little too runny, I prefer more mole, like the way they prepare it at Tacubaya in Berkeley.  My boyfriend, on the otherhand, had an amazing omelet with chorizo. We also ordered a side of platanos- it was cold, like it had been sitting out for sometime. It also comes with sour cream and cheese, but since I'm not a big fan of sour cream, I ordered it on the side- which for me was a smart move. I love the vibrant decor, multi-colored walls, Mexican art and latin music. Service is friendly, attentive but our food took awhile to come out. I probably would return to Frontera Grill for dinner or perhaps try the menu next door at Topolo.
