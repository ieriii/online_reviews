Oh, damn do I love New Haven style pizza especially when it's done as well as Piece does it. It is great tasting pizza.... but do yourself a favor... order it over the phone, double park, pay quickly and get the hell away from the nuckleheaded crowd.... this place just brings out the dopes... still, it is really great pizza... to go... In a town full of pizza places, this pizza is worth driving across town for. Seriously. It would be great even if there wasn't a Cheap Trick connection... but there is so it is that much better...
