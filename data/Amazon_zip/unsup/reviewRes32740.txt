This place is pretty good. I have be be honest, I don't have much to compare it to. I've only ever eaten at one other Ethiopian place and it was pretty bad. I can't tell you what I ordered except that it was beef...or was it lamb? Anyway, it was good and I'd definitely go back. There was a musician playing and he really added to the atmosphere, which is kind of lacking otherwise. The food is very pretty and the wait staff was very helpful in figuring out what to order. This is important at a place like this with so many unfamiliar menu items. Try it out. It's great for big groups and their lunch specials are nice.
