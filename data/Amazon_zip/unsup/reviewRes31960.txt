I love this place! The food is worth the wait. And wait you will! Try the milkshakes (although last time they were out of ice cream, how is that possible?). The marinated seitan is terrific, my favorite is the reuben. I've never made it to dessert because the portions are big, but everything looks great. I just wish they would expand so that we could go more often.
