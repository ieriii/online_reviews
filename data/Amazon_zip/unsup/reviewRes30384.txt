We used to live a few buildings down from 3rd coast and we love it. The four stars is not really for the food. The menu is similar to diner food but they do offer daily specials. My hubby's go-to item is their cajun chicken penne and mine is the tuna melt. The penne dish has a really nice kick to it. Although the name "cajun" doesn't really come to mind when tasting this. I say it's more of a spicy alfredo penne. The tuna melt is your standard tuna melt. However, they make it just the way i like my tuna melt to be (with the bread slightly buttered instead of dry). I like it on rye with tomato. I also love their sweet vidalia onion dressing. I ask them to put it on the side of my salad so i can use the extra on my sandwich. If you are not that hungry, try the cheese plate to share. They put apples, crackers and either a marmalade or jam alongside different types of cheeses. With a glass of reisling, it's a really good late night snack. We love the old style decor with it's dark wood details. We also love the fact that they put up art work from a different artist every few weeks on their walls. If you happen to see something you really like, these art works are for sale. We also love that they are open late. The staff is always friendly no matter how late or how close to closing time it is. (We went one time and it was about 15 minutes to closing yet they still served us!). Overall, it's a great neighborhood place to go to if you are not feeling like cooking or just want a quiet drink with a snack. p.s. You should try at least one of the soups of the day. It's always good.
