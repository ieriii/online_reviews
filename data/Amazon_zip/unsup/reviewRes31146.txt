I really wanted to give this place a chance, i really did. But. . . . it just wasn't good. No, I'm not a vegetarian (actually I'm on the polar opposite side of the spectrum) but I know good food. It wouldn't be fair to place Chicago diner in a "Vegetarian Category" and base it off that. Because good food is good food, and bland food is bland food. I had scrambled tofu and french toast. I pretended to enjoy my meal since my brunch date was excited to take me there, but to be honest - I left there starving and feeling like I had just eaten cardboard. . . . And haven't been there since.  :( Sorry Chicago Diner.
