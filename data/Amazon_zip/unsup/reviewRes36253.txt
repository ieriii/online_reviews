Thought today I would try a place I kept hearing rave reviews about. So I went to Meli cafe and my 4 star rating is based solely on the food which was fantastic. My service on the other hand was a little lack luster. The waitress couldn't explain what the soup of the day was, she was very dry and acted as if she didn't want to help me and my friend at all. Like I said great food but the service left a lot to be desired.
