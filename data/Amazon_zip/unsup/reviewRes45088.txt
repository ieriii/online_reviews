Ok everyone, America is the fattest country on the planet and Chicago is one of the fattest cities in America. The portions here are what they should be. You don't need 8 lbs of pasta. Now, $16 for 6 ravioli is a bit ridiculous. I had some kind of thick pasta in tomato sauce and it was average. If I bought fresh pasta I could have made a better dish at home. My girlfriend had the $2.66 a piece ravioli plate with mushrooms and bland wouldn't begin to describe it. The menue didn't exactly have a lot of options either. The portions are fine if you aren't Tony Soprano but it is a little pricey for what you get. The waiter picked out two great wines for us so that was nice but not enough to get me to go back. If you are in Andersonville and you want Italian, go to Leonardos which is right up Clark Street or just go across the street to Calo. Both are far superior in terms of flavor, variety, price and atmosphere. It wasn't terrible but I probably won't give this place a second chance due to the other choices in the neighborhood.
