I have had better Thai food in numerous places. The appetizers, tigers cry and the fried shu mai, were absolutely outstanding. The main courses of Chicken pad Thai and the kuay tiew kee mao really lacked flavor. I am disappointed because this was niece's introduction to Thai food and I should have taken her to my tried and true hole-in-the-wall.
