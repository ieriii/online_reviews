This is my favorite Korean BBQ place in Chicago. The Wan Kalbi is my favorite. Whenever I go here, I always order the seafood pancake and the wan kalbi. The tofu soup they bring you is always tasty too. If you haven't been here yet, go and try it! You will not be disappointed. However, if you go during the busy time, be prepared to wait....and wait.
