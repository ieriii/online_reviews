This place is a gem. My wife and I had our first date here and it was love at first taste. Authentic food, great service, and knowledgeable staff. They are quite a bit more popular now than they were several years ago, much to Chef Anthony's credit. He has built a strong menu and assembled a charming staff who know Italian food and wine very very well.
