Always get the Polish ( called Elvis) grilled, with sauteed onions, sports peppers, and mustard (Maxwell street style basically). It is the best I have ever had and having parents from Poland, that's saying something. On top of it they are only $2.50 a piece which is a steal anywhere. Also, I keep reading people waiting for 2 hours in line, go between 3-4PM Monday-Thursday, and your wait will be very short.
