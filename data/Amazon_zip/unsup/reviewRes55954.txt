My girlfriend kept hearing great things, and it's near where she lives, so I said OK. I'm not impressed. The entrees all hovered around $20, and salads around $10. The insalata cippolina e pomodoro was good, but my entree was less than OK. I ordered the tenderloin brasciole, which is traditionally layers of stuff rolled up in beef and braised. This was to served over a pile of BOXED PASTA. I am not convinced that their pasta is homemade as claimed. This rigatoni looked just like a box of Prince brand dried box pasta. Also, the brasciole was a waste of tenderloin. It was a dried out thin layer of meat filled with grated parmesan(nearly undetectable, redolent of raw minced garlic (YUK!) and flat leaf parsley. The server seemed aloof, the bus boy seemed in a rush to clear my empty salad plate while my girlfriend was still eating, and the sponge-painted walls were atrocious. Also, the art displayed next to me was a painting of the bones around the pelvis and sacrum. This is where poop lives before you eject it. There are better BYOBs.
