Overrated. Was told wait would be a half hour, it was an hour. Had the eggs benedict... they were ok. Poached well. Just nothing spectacular. Bongo room has more of a unique selection, such as different types of Hollandaise. Our server was really bizzare, like he was high or something. "I have coffee??" Ummm ok are you offering it to us or just letting us know what is in your pitcher in the form of a question. Weird. Not worth the wait.
