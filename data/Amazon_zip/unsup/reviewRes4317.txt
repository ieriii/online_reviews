What can I say here that hasn't been said already? I'm in L-O-V-E. From the beautiful dancers swaying/tapping/jiving/swinging to the music, the clarinetist/saxophonist tooting back and forth from each instrument w/o missing a beat, the tall dashing leading man crooning at the mic (swoon), the adorable elderly gentleman dancing the night away back into his youth, the "commercial breaks" advertising toothpaste from back in the day... *sigh* I think I was born in the wrong era.
