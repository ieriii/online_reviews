WOW! WOW! WOW! I've never had Persian food before today and I can enthusiastically tell you I'll be back!! Dear God, the food was sooo good. We arrived very early at about 11:30 am and were seated immediately. The waitress was wonderful, very patient, helpful and friendly. She assisted us in getting our 3 young children situated in their highchairs (our eldest child being at school). I ordered the Shirin Polo (Sweet and Sour Persian rice ) with Chicken Tenders as it stated on the menu that it was "a very highly recommended Persian specialty". Boy, were they right on THAT one. I had NEVER in my life has rice with the texture and quality of this stuff and the chicken was so tender and juicy that I couldn't believe it! This is a dish NOT to be missed. The portions were huge. I ordered the Persian Tea with my meal and was very happy indeed. My husband ordered the Chenjeh (Rib Eye) which was on the lunch specials menu and he loved every morsel as well. We ordered my two young boys the Joujeh Kabob (boneless chicken breast) that they inhaled and then fought over the saffron rice! LOL The portions are so large here that you could easily split one order between 2 or 3 people. We also ordered Hummus and Baba Ghannouj as appetizers which were phenomenal...even my 9-month old daughter was smacking her lips with every spoonful I fed her! :) For dessert, we shared 2 orders of Bomieh (fried dough with saffron honey syrup)....so, so good! When my sister visits from NYC, this will be the first place I take her! DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!!!
