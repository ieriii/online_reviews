Sunda's service is wonderful. There food is delicious. We went on a Saturday night...around 5:30PM. The place was quiet and we had a great conversation...by 6:30PM...it was wall to wall people and very loud.If I had any complaint it would be the noise level when the place is full. All hard surfaces. It would be great if there was some acousitc work done there.However, it was still super and we had a new waiter...who was great. We would definitely go back again...maybe not on a Saturday night....maybe Tuesday or Wednesday around 5:00PM...we liked the quiet!
