I am staying in Chicago on business and our client has a discounted rate at the Fairmont. In fact, I am enjoying their homemade apple-almond granola with fresh fruit and fresh brewed coffee as I write this review (delivered with the New York Times), and you can't beat it. I have a partial city, partial Lake Michigan view that is gorgeous, and the rooms are incredibly spacious. It is a great set-up for business travel (unlike some of the hobbit rooms you get in New York or San Francisco for twice the price). The service is impeccable as you might expect, and the location is great for running by the lake or shopping on Michigan Ave. Oh, and for work. Almost forgot why I was here.
