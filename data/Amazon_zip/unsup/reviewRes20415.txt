When the line at Frontera is too long, you can still patronize Rick Bayless. What a genius business idea! But is he a culinary genius? Probably. We each had a torta - SO had the pepito short rib and I had a chicken jalapeno. I spent most of my time picking off the overkill jalapenos and wishing I had ordered the pepito. Once I had remedied my sandwich, it turns out I really liked it. The breads were surprisingly good. We also had chips and salsa and guac - it was pretty decent (this coming from a guac hater). I was SO SAD to see you could not get churros at 7pm. There was one lonely churro sitting in a pan and it looked so good even as a leftover that we almost asked for it anyway. Yeah - it looked THAT good.
