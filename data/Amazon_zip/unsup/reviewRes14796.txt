First off, there used to be a lot more Italian bakeries and restaurants in and around Old Irving and also on West Belmont and old timers will remember that even this place allowed dining room smoking before the ban (very Rat Pack no?) Well, the smoking is gone (fine with me), and this is one of the restaurant hold outs in the neighborhood. This is traditional Italian-American upscale dining, and not some sort of jazzy fusion place so if you are looking for "hip" Italian try somewhere else. This said, the food here is top notch and the service is stellar. The wine list is very good as well. I love the touch of having valet parking. It is just loads of fun! The stracciatella and minestrone soups are great, and the salads (I always order mine with crumbled blue cheese) have never let me down. Fried Calamari is my favorite opening appetiser as is the Bresaola. I am a fan of the Linguine and black mussels, as well as the Farfalle Boscaiola. The veal is always good as well. The table prepared Bananas Foster is worth it so save room! Last time I was here my girlfriend and I ate two wonderful steaks in one of the little booths and drank about five little bottles of prosecco! One night, they ran out of Calamari and they gave our table a big discount. Enzo and Angelo do a great job! I have been coming for over 10 years, and friends and their families have been coming for over 20. It is nice to see a Chicago original hold its ground.
