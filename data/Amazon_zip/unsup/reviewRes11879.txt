Too bad this place is so full of idiots, frat guys, girls who work in the office with you a little too drunk, servers who could care less that you are there, and don't get me started on how unbelievable rude the hostess was to me the one time there was a wait. And TVs everywhere your eyes look. So don't eat there. Get that shit to go cause the beer is good and you can buy it by the jug and the pizza is good and has good toppings.
