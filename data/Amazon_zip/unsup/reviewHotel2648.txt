Ok 1st things 1st. the location is hard to beat. 1 block from michigan ave is awesome! the lobby is small but hip, so thats ok. the room amenities are pretty BA. robes for each person and slippers is a great touch. the wet bar is top notch, and also top notch pricey. luckily there is a trader joes across the street and they sell pretty good beer/wine.  our 1 and only issues was the street noise. we were originally on the 4th floor facing the street. the windows are not the double pane variety, so any noise on the street is very noticeable. my wife and i could not sleep the first night, so we called down and asked to have the room changed. they changed us that night., but we had to switch to two doubles. they said they would switch us back to a king the next day, but that didnt happen. for the amount we paid for the room i was expecting alot better service and a sound nights sleep another weird thing was they didnt have any ice machines. so if u wanted ice, u needed to call the front desk and ask for someone to bring it up. now in the middle of the day, thats fine, but during prime time, we waited an hour for ice, which is unacceptable. overall, it was a cute hotel, but i wont stay there again.
