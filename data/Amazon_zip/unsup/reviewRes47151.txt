Oh how I love you Uncommon Ground! You never ever disappoint. I love the atmosphere, the staff are always super nice and helpful, and the food...the food! Some of my favorites: tomatillo soup, calamari, sweet potato fries with goat cheese sauce, short ribs...the menu changes based on season, but I've never had a bad experience.
