I went to the Oyster bar side for an app and drink. It is fairly noisy and all the tables are squished next to each other so you are essentially eating with a couple next to you. They had a whole sushi menu plus they are a seafood joint so I thought I would try a roll. I tried the spicy tuna roll. I highly recommend not eating sushi here. The tuna was warm and a bit slimy like it had been sitting in the heat. I have eaten quite a bit of sushi in my time from several restaurants so I'm not just complaining about eating sushi. I was worried that I might be sick later but that never happened. I'm guessing with staffing a full restaurant they must make their rolls in advance and then serve them up when the time comes. The king crab legs next to me looked pretty good though.
