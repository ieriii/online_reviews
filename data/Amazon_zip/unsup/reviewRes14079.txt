I was excited to check this place out after the prompting of my wife. We walked down to Glen's for breakfast on a sunny Saturday morning and took a seat outside. The wait staff was friendly and prompt. The coffee was good and smooth, like a diner's coffee, and the pancakes were sweet and fluffy. Both of our meals were ho-hum beyond that. My wifes corn beef hash was completely unpalatable and my "Mediterranean" eggs consisted of unflavorfull, though fluffy, scrambled eggs with sauted onions, peppers and fresh spinach on top. It didn't feel like a completely executed idea. All egg meals come with their home style potato pancakes which we both loved. It was creamy inside, maybe from sour cream and a smooth white cheese. I was hoping for the crispy deli style kind with apple sauce but this hit the spot just fine. I would try it again. Just avoid these two dishes for breakfast.
