EAT HERE. Ooooh, it is good. The BEST pizza and the BEST beer in the WORLD. Well, at least in MY world. Holy cow. I got their white pizza (thin crust w/ olive oil and roasted garlic and mozzerella) with artichoke hearts, more garlic, onions, mushrooms, and best of all: goat cheese. Man that was one smelly pizza, but wowza!... so worth the gnarly breath afterwards. And, truthfully, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but when my friends got two pitchers, I figured I should at least try it. Aah man! Best beer I've had! We got a pitcher of light and a pitcher of dark beer. Both were awesome. And we accidentally went on a kareoke night and it was pretty fun. No cheesy stereo system, either. It's a live band that accompanies all the drunkies on their favorite songs! The only minor annoyance--it was SO loud that you had to yell into the other person's ears! Other than that, go... and invite me!
