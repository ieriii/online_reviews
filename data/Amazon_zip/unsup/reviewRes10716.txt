It was tough coming up with a rating for this one. I've been several times, craft beer drinker that I am, and have had an experience where I think one star might be too many, yet also spent several hours wanting for nothing more than a higher tolerance. More often than not, it's a solid place to go. The menu is somewhat limited, especially if you want something other than pizza, but what they do have rocks. Some of the salads are very good and the various topping combinations for the pizza are quite tasty. I've recently discovered what I think my be the best topping mix: basil, bacon and mashed potatoes. It F*CKING rocks! No other way to say it. Don't say it. Don't even think of arguing--don't even let that little thought creep in your head--unless you've had it first. Besides, I'm obviously not listening. Trust me, you'll dig it. The beer is pretty damn solid as well. They do a great job with hoppy beers: Wingnut, Dysfunctionale, Amarrillo Brillo, Bertha, Quintet Anniversary, etc., as well as authentic German wheat beers: see Big N Curvy (aka Top Heavy), Dark N Curvy, etc. They have some other great beers, but I consistently find these to be the best to my tastes. The service varies and can lead to long waits for refills, etc., but as long as you know it's coming and can plan for it, there's nothing too bad.  I also typically try to avoid the crowded weekends and go during the week with buddies after work.  For all you beer fans, you must visit: the 2006 World Beer Cup Champion Small Brewpub and Brewmaster sits within your reach. What are you waiting for?
