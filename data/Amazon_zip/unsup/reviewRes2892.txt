I choose this restaraunt because I wanted a super-special place where I could propose to my girlfriend. The folks at Tru were fantastic about it...very patient with my nervous phone calls; they brought the champagne perfectly on cue, and overall were really sweet. This isn't the sort of place we normally go to, but the service people were gracious and explained everything without a hint of condescension. We went with the prix-fixe menu - we both had seafood appetizers, and for the entree I had the ribeye while my girlfriend had the prime rib. For dessert we had the dark gleaming chocolate, and the ice cream with chicory texture was possibly the best thing I have ever eaten. I can taste it as I think about it now! The little "candy shop" dessert cart was also wonderful. In particular I was delighted to try the Canelle de Bourdeaux. Divine - perfect creaminess with just a touch of crunch and honey! You *must* try some of the cheeses, especially the sheep's milk cheese; they serve it with sweet bread and a little honey and it's, again, amazing. I said I went here to propose, and I want to make a special note of how extremely nice they were about us being a same-sex couple. Frankly, when I was calling places to set the proposal up, a lot of places were incredibly rude. A few places were surprised that a woman was proposing (assuming I had a boyfriend), and then when I explained I had a *girlfriend*, two places hung up on me and a third gave me a lecture! Tru, however, was absolutely professional, sweet, and sincerely congratulatory. (Also, reassuring, when my nervousness almost got the better of me!) If you are looking for a memorable, relaxing, unique experience, try here.
