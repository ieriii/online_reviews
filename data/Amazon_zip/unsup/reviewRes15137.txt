We were a party of 4. Waited about an hour at 7:30pm. I thought that was kind of ridiculous especially since they seated about 10 groups before us that arrived way later than us (party of 2 or 6). I was ready to call up 2 more buddies just so we can get seated. Once inside, the ambiance was pretty nice. THe music wasn't bad but it was WAY too dark. We had to combine about 3 candles they had just to read line by line. Not a big cocktail guy but the girls loved the drinks. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Lagavulin on the menu. Overall I would go back there if it was for a birthday gathering or something of that sort but probably wouldn't make it a point to go there just for a night out.
