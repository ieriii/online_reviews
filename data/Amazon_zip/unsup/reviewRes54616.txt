BYOB!I love Sultans. My husband and I are both vegans and this is a staple in our diet. Their food and drinks are a little on the pricy side so if you can I'd recommend bringing a drink if your a cheapskate like me!Try the aloe drinks, they are amazing!100% vegan unless otherwise noted, this is just the place for a sweet vegan date ;-)
