Wow! Food was AMAZING! The meat was done very well, the dessert was out of the world, the drinks were delicious, the service was excellent and the ambience was cool. All in all, a great dining experience! Highly recommend it! The place is HUGE, so watch out if you are looking for a more intimate dining experience - they had over 400 reservations the night we dined, so it is definitely a mini restaurant -city. The food was high-end and appropriately priced -- dinner for two with dessert and 2 drinks each was in the $140 range. We did have a $100 gift cert for $50 from the local radio station's dining guide, so that might be something for you to check out if you do some advance planning. (http://www.wtmx.com/dini)
