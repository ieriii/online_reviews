Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Food was excellent! Had a big group with me so we all pretty much tried each others dishes and didn't have anything bad to say. Service was excellent and the place is nice. Not sure if i'd ever go back but if i'm in the area i'd definitely would remember this place and go.
