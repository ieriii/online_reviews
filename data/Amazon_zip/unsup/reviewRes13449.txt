absolutely large beer selection. although it was lunch and didn't feel like drinking, i got a hard cider that just tasted like plain apple juice. appetizer: went with everyone's recommendation on bacon popcorn, and now i'm sure i have cardiac disease! there's literally bacon ontop, and bacon fat poured ALL over the popcorn, and a pile of parmesan ontop. we didn't even get to the bottom, but friends say there's a pool of lard at the bottom---just, share between 4-5 people and you should be ok. I had the pork belly burger which was all fat in a bun, and the bf got a farm burger with the egg in it. both tasty, but I wouldn't get it again considering pork belly fat plus the bacon was WAY too much.
