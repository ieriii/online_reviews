I'm a Southern girl, and I like my Mexican food...but that also means, I am incredibly picky and critical about my Mexican food. Thus far, Garcia's is the only place I've been to that I can say I can tolerate. I usually don't even bother trying Mexican restaurants because I am always disappointed. However, their tostadas and guacamole are heaven sent, along with their margaritas, They're good and strong. And they have a variety of flavors!
