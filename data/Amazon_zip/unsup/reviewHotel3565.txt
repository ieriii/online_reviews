We stayed here for four nights in January and had a wonderful stay. We made our reservation through the hotel's website for a regular King bed room and they upgraded us to a junior king suite when we checked in. The room was on the 7th floor and we had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan. The hotel itself is historical and it has retained its charm through the decor and rustic style furniture. At the same time, the bed, linen, bathroom feels clean and does not look dingy or old. The suite was huge. There is an entryway when you first come in which opens up into a sitting room with a couch (which I believe could be made into a queen bed), two arm chairs, desk, TV, and closet. This is connected to the bedroom with a King bed, another closet, and another TV! My only complaint was that the tub drained a bit slowly and they were not really able to resolve the issue even after I had asked them to clear it. We were celebrating a special occasion and the girl at the front desk was very nice to acknowledge this when we were checking in. The general manager also sent us a cake and a bottle of champagne the first night to help us celebrate! The hotel is located towards the end of Michigan Ave so it is a bit further from the Loop and restaurants but there are plenty of buses that stop just a block away from the hotel. The closest Metro is the Chicago Red Line which is about 4 blocks or a 10 minute walk away. On the other hand, the hotel is really close to Oak St beach, which seems like it would be a great place to enjoy the lake when the weather is warmer.
