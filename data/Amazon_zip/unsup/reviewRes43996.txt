Quickly becoming one of my fav sushi places in the city. Everytime I've been to Wakamono I've had a great experience (now 3 times!). Appetizers Edamame - like that it's flavored, makes it a little diff Tuna Sampler - Super white tuna sashimi is yum! Also includes toro! Rolls Mango - REALLY good Oedipus - Tasty but maybe a tad heavy on the sauce Spicy tuna - some of the best in the city. BIG chunks of tuna! Snow White - if you like super white tuna this is perfect! They are generous with the fish here (not rice heavy rolls). Plus their cocktails are also delicious!
