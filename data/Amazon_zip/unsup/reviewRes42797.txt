Stopped by after work for a quick fix. Had the half chicken and 2 sides (garlic mash potatoes & garlic rice w/black beans). The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sides were great. The garlic rice w/bbeans was my favorite. A few days later I stopped by to grab a slice of pizza, however I ended up quite disappointed. Perhaps my palate for pizza is unsophisticated because i LOVE Papa John's. But Fogo's pizza was very dry with the sauce. The pizza dough tasted very burnt and hard to chew. Ill stick to their chicken.
