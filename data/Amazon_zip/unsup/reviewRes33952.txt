Ode to the Orange French Toast: Hint of orange spice Melting savory sweetness If love had a taste... Yes, I may have an altogether unhealthy relationship with food but I know what I like and I went back two days in a row for the Orange French Toast. The first day I'd had the waffle which was good but my friend had the Orange French Toast and I had food envy so I HAD to get my own plate. For some reason spending the entire day there eating breakfast didn't appeal to her, hence the reason for the return trip the next day. I didn't mind the wait. The first day we sat at the counter which I think is more fun, just watching them put the orders together was amazing. The coffee was good, I wish I'd tried the banana bread french toast.. .but that just all that more reason to return to Chicago.
