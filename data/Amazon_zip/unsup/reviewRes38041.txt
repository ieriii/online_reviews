Giordano's is one of the best deep dish pizza's in Chicago. I also really enjoy their thin crust. The service at this location was great and everything tasted really fresh. Here are my top five pizza places in Chicago (both deep dish and thin) 5.)Giordano's 4.) Gullivers 3.) Lou Malnatti's 2.)Leona's 1.) Burts Place
