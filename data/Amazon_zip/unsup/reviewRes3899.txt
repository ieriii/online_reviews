Crisp clearly does not need any more 5-star reviews on Yelp, and I wouldn't bother writing this review, even though I love them, if it wasn't for a particularly awesome sauce customer service experience. We went in on a Thursday night, around 7:30, and the place was packed as usual for that time. After ordering and finding a seat, we wait for around 10 minutes for our food and I notice others who ordered after us are getting their orders. I thought there might have been an issue with our order, but before I could say anything, a guy (I assume a manager) and tells us there was a mix up, our food is on it's way and we are free to help ourselves to anything from the beverage case, and help ourselves to the popsicle case on our way out. We graciously accepted the offer and our food arrived maybe 5 minutes later. This, people, is simple customer service that so many places just don't get. Very often, people's beef with a place here on Yelp has to do with poor customer service, and their issue could probably be resolved by an establishment making any kind of effort to right the issue. In this case, it's not like we made any kind of fuss about the non-issue, but they recognize that they made a (very minor) mistake and were proactive at addressing that. Crisp gets it. Plus their food is fucking top notch.
