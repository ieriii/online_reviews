Deliciouso! Food coma central. The food is cheap and authentic, parking its decent. Byob. Breakfast is wonderful but get there before 10:30 or you will meet a giant post church crowd. My friends had the pork rind omelette, chorizo and egg omelette. The piece of steak you get for 3.50 extra its well worth it. Disappointed in the tres leeches cake didn't look like the pictures on the website but I'll live!
