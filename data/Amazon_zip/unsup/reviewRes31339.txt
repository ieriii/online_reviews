I have never eaten at a vegetarian place where things tasted more synthetic. I'm not saying they are, I'm just saying that they're trying way too hard and end up just making terrible food in the process. The mac n' cheese tastes nothing like mac n' cheese. How hard is that to mess up? Twice? I second the reviewer who bemoaned all the fake meat. You can do amazing vegetarian and vegan dishes using fresh food that doesn't feel like it's been ground up, pureed, left in the sun, dyed, and set on the counter for three hours. Even the shakes seem "off." I have given this place so many chances. Especially for the price, it's obscene.
