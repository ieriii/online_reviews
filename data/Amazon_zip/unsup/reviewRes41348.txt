Ruth's Chris is my absolute favorite. I think that their sweet potato casserole is actually a recipe passed on to Ruth by God himself. Seriously, it is that good. And their steaks! Perfect, every time. So why not the five stars, you say? While it may be a minor nit, I think that the setting of this restaurant doesn't do the food justice. It's in an unremarkable building, with a sort of cramped interior. The food, service, and even the cutlery remain top-notch, but for a place that's this amazing, I would expect a setting somewhat better than the Bennigan's-esque interior. With some restaurants, this is an OK trait because it feels like you're at a hidden gem - but when you're dropping $100/person on dinner I don't want to feel that - I want to feel like I'm in an amazing location. So, dammit Ruth's Chris - take over NoMi's space, to assert your position as the best steakhouse in Chicago!
