after asking around for the best chi-style pizza, countless locals recommended this joint. it didn't disappoint. we had the deep-dish pepperoni, and the cheese was literally flowing over the sides of our plates. we were easily filled with the portions, and the price wasn't too steap. definitely a nice, family-style place, where the food doesn't let you down.
