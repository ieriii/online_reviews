This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of Chicago, perhaps the world (outside of Italy, but it's close). I've been coming here for years and the owners are family friends by now. The food is SO FRESH and homemade. You can't go wrong with any dish. They don't take reservations, so expect a wait Thurs-Sat. It's BYOB as well, so the price is great. I strongly recommend the homemade pasta or the salmon with balsamic glaze, but you really can't go wrong. Note: There is very little waiting room and no bar, so be prepared to either wait outside or be cramped inside. Still doesn't detract from everything else.
