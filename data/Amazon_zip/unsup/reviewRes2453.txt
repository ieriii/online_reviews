Want to eat the most exotic hot dogs you can find out there? This is the place! Wait is super annoying but their amazing fries cooked in duck fat and the amazing varieties of different kind of hot dogs you can find is a hard to anywhere else. I had tried their alligator meat and as much as it sounds disgusting it was that much tastier. Try it out folks!
