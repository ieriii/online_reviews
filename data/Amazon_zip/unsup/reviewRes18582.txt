dark and cozy and byob. love it. ive been here many times. there seems to be one or two dishes that are just not worth it. but have no fear! the waiter has always made great suggestions. i personally find it hard to go out for italian food, because, lets face it... even my kitchen handicap roomate can make spaghetti. the gnocchi is flawless. i love it. worth every penny. especially the stuffed with asiago... and the sauces are real REAL good. the appetizers and seafood. awesome my only complaint seems to be chicken. i dont order chicken too often, but twice the person i was with ordered a chicken dish and had some complaints about it. definately recommended
