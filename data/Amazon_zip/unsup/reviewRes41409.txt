I'm a huge fan of tank noodle. It's the one little restaurant in Chicago that made me feel like I was in Arcadia, CA. It's not the cleanest...nor the prettiest, but their pho tai is consistent as all get out. Don't have to worry about flavorless fixin's here. The peppers are potent and the bean sprouts are fresh. My one complaint is don't expect stellar service. One of the waiters brought an over flowing plate of something to the table across the aisle and totally spilled on the guy's coat and didn't have the courtesy to tell him or try to wipe it up. He just left it! When he noticed that I saw, he made awkward eye contact and pretended like nothing happened.
