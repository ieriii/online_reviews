I went there for the lunch buffet. The food was pretty decent, but nothing super amazing. I was hoping for a few more selections to choose from. The Gobi Masala stuck out as being pretty good. One additional thing, the service was pretty good. They were very attentive and good with filling waters and clearing plates, making the experience a bit better.
