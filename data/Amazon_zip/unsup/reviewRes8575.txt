Tucked away in a north side neighborhood of Chicago is one of the best if not the best Pizza restaurants in the US. The Ambience, Service, and the food are second to none. The Antipasti are equally good. If you are lucky enough to be there when they are serving Minestrone Soup you will have a special treat. The wine list is good and affordable. They have top end Italian wines if you care to splurge.THIS IS A PLACE NOT TO MISS if you are in Chicago
