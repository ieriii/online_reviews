Went to 3rd coast a few weeks ago and was pretty impressed. I'm the type who always has really high expectations for a spectacular breakfast experience but am always disappointed because it's "just breakfast food". We had eggs benny, the sausage meal and the stuffed french toast (yes, we like to eat...excessively). The stuffed french toast was delicious with the bananas, brie and nuts. My eggs benny was average, but the sausage was quite tasty. The coffee was also good. Would go back for the french toast and like everyone has said, the place is cozy and great for a date or friend gig.
