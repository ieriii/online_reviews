I was really excited to try this place because the menu is everything that I love. Any place that has lardo on the menu is good with me. Sadly we didn't have a good experience. I knew it woud be busy but my boyfriend and I were okay with this and figured we would just grab a drink at the bar while we waited. Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long because we couldn't get close enough to the bar to order a drink. When the waitress took us to our table we were a bit surprised that she was putting us at a communal table that was almost full. Now I don't mind the social atmosphere of these tables but when half the table has to get up and I have to squeeze past shrubs to get to my seat it's just not pleasant.  Once we got settled we tried to make the best of it. We both ordered a beer with some fried manchego and the whipped feta spread. When the waitress came with our beer I was surprised by the small glass she handed me. She explained that it was the end of the keg (yuck) but that she would be back shortly with another glass for me.  15 minutes later I finally had to remind her about my second glass. She came back and explained that they didn't have anymore so I had to switch beers. Thankfully they didn't charge me for the first glass of sludge. The food was okay. The fried manchego was nothing special. The whipped feta dip was nice and they did offer to bring us more bread when we ran out. Mind you I did have to remind them as they forgot about us again. I think if I was going out with a group of friends for a social evening this place may have been a good choice. It wasn't what my boyfriend and I were looking for.
