I enjoyed my breakfast here. The restaurant is bright and cheerful, our waitress was helpful and prompt. I like that they offer the flavored creamer on the table as I dislike half and half or milk in my coffee. My food was very good. I love breakfast so you'd really have to work hard to ruin it. We had no wait but we met people there on a weekday around 9am.
