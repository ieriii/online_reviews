6 of us went for lunch...(on the referall of Tom, My nail tech.) We drove 90 miles to go there and Trader Joes. Was worth the trip!!. Based on reviews we ordered spring rolls,a congee dish, a pho dish, and then an assortment of seafood and chicken main courses.. The only item we did not like was the congee dish. kinda like a chicken broth and rice soup,but rice was mushy...perhaps that is how it is supposed to be , but we did not care for it....BYOB was allowed and we enjoyed wine w/our dinner....Be sure a ask for Jome to wait on you, because his service was excellent from start to finish!He opened our wine,brought glasses and after dinner brought to go containers for all of our leftovers!
