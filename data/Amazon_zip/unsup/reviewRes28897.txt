This place is getting 4 stars because the service was great! That's what I remember most about this place. Our waiter was awesome. I wish I could remember his name. Me and my boyfriend even wrote a note on the receipt letting him know how great the service was. My glass of wine was delicious, also. My meal wasn't GREAT, though. It tasted a little overcooked. But, it was edible and I ate most of it, anyway. We only came in this place because the bar connected to it, "The Other Side", was full and had no place for us to sit. But, I'd come here again... I'd just order another dish.
