Key word here is value. 7 bucks will get you a delicious big bowl of pasta w/ softdrink. Pasta is really good and portions again are very big. Bruschetta's are awesome also. I usually get the rigatone bolognese, farfalla chicken, or the spegghetti fruitti demare. All excellent! Ingredients are also very fresh.
