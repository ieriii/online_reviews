I love coming to Artopolis. I would say that the food is pretty good but I think that this place is mostly about the atmosphere. I love the breezes that come through the windows on the top floor. I also love the color schemes and light decor. it is not overdone but it makes you feel very comfortable. I would suggest eating the Lime Tequilla Pollo if you would like a main course that is light and the rasberry white chocolate mousse for dessert. The wait staff is friendly but if you're in a rush this isn't a place to get in and out fast.
