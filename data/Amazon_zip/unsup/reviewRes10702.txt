Baron Von Awesome. Love the beer, also love the pizza and salads.  Its only fair to mention that Piece is noisy and crowded, and the wait can be quite long (and the hosts don't really care how long it takes for you to get a table).  Clearly none of those things bother me too much, because it still gets 5 stars! If only they delivered, sigh...
