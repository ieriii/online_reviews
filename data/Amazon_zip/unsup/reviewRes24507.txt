I'm a bit late to write this review since this is based on an experience from Oct 2, 2010 aka my wedding day. I wanted to share my awesome experience with their catering. Henry Cerdas was our contact, I believe he is the owner. Great guy, super chill and accommodating. We wanted a budget wedding but didn't want to standard wedding food Since we loved Irazu's food we decided to give them a try. On Henry's recommendation, we went with a beef dish, chicken, and veggies. He suggested sides of beans and rice and ceviche for appetizer. The ceviche was served with chips, which at first sounded tacky but it allowed guests to eat it much easier. I could tell based on that recommendation Henry had done this before. He provided ice, dinnerware, and plates which he purchased just for this! We also used his wait staff which was cheap. They showed up an hour early, set it up and made it look great. For the food, delivery, and wait staff it cost $1,200 (not including tip for servers) to feed ~60 peple. Even writing that sounds expensive but if you've shopped around for caterers, you can drop an easy $4,000 for simple appetizers. If your goal is a more laid back wedding with some interesting food, I'd recommend you give them a try. He totally made our wedding "Pura Vida." Thanks Henry!
