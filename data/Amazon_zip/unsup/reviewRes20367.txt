This is an excellent sushi spot, with a very good vegetarian selection. A restaurant always gets props from me if at least one of the specials in vegetarian, and this place did not disappoint. I would recommend the shitake maki and anything tempura. The mango and tuna roll was also excellent. Stay away from the maki with tamago and spinach. The flavors did not mesh well, and the spinach texture was too soggy for a roll. Great deserts, too. You can get a scoop of each of their ice creams for $6. BYOB, so I brought in a sixer of Blatz bought at The Corner (bar) on a cold walk through Bucktown from the Fullerton & Oakley bus stop. Service was helpful and attentive as well.
