Carnivale has great food and drinks and the atmosphere is unmatched by anywhere I've been in Chicago. I can't think of a better place to have a huge party. I loved it so much, I even looked into booking it for my wedding reception! Then I remembered that I'm not having a $100,000 wedding and that was the end of that. The first time I went was a Wednesday and they had live music. It was really lively and people were dancing in the bar area but not in an annoying way where they would interfere with your dinner conversation in the dining room. I can't say enough about the ceviche and I had a paella-like dish that was also good with TONS of fresh seafood. I'd give this place five stars except for one glitch. I've been there three times with a reservation. All three times I've been sent to the bar for at LEAST 25 minutes. Twice I've had to get up and ask where we were in line for a table before I was seated immediately and once they told me my pager must have been broken. I almost think it's part of the business plan to send you to the bar before seating you. That's fine for a girl that loves her manhattans as much as I do. But it's just kind of sneaky, you know???
