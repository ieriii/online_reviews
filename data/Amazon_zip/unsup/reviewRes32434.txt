Now this was my first attempt in trying ethopian food. And I must say I am a fan. Yes, the food is just amazing, very well blended spices. This place is really packed during the weekend, so just make sure you call in early for reservations. We just decided a t the nth hour to try at Demera's and ended up waiting for quite some time. But I must say the server did take good care of us, found a place at the bar and she re-assured us that it wouldn't take that long. After a long wait and the amazing aroma of the spices it was like bring me the food. We ordered vegetarian food and it was just great. The injera is nice and soft more like the Indian pancakes (dosa). Definitely will be visiting again.
