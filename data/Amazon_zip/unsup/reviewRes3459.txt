YUM! This was my first Korean food experience and I was very pleasantly surprised! I ordered a Seoul Steak Bowl and it was absolutely delicious. Great mix of flavors, and the food was super cheap! AND BYOB. It's kind of a hole in the wall, but I went with a group of friends who wanted to catch up and they had no problem with us staying there over 2 hours.  The chicken wings could have been better. They didn't have a ton of meat on them, but we split 1 order, so I only ate 1 - therefore not a huge loss. I will definitely be back to enjoy another bowl! :)
