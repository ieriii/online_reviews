I don't know anything about the food, but the beer selection here is one of the best you'll find in the loop. Dogfishhead, three floyds, goose island - matilda, etc. You won't find this stuff on most bars' taps around here. If you're looking for a nice place to sit and have a solid beer, you can't go wrong w/ The Gage.
