OK...think Laverne & Shirley, think American Graffiti, think best dawg in town (well, maybe Hot Doug's is better?). This 50's drive-in is more fun than....(you fill in the blank). Typical chrome & black, aqua-lined exterior topped with giant Dawg statues! Great dawgs come with crunchy fries all served in a cute little box. Car-hops, milkshakes, sodas, and plenty of ketchup. What more could you ask from a blast from the past?
