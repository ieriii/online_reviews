Oh Garcia's, you and your margaritas, you had me at hello. Seriously, my only complaint is you don't do the half pitcher of margaritas anymore. The single glass is not cost effective for what my wife and I want to consume usually, but the full pitcher lights us up and leaves me sprinting through the neighborhood and waking neighbors while I sing in buzzed glee all the way home. Oh, and you serve food too? Cool. Food is good not great. This is not exotic dining. Enchiladas and tostadas and guacamole are all credible, burritos are ridiculously huge. It ranks for me as good and perfectly acceptable tex-mex / mexican food. But the real reason to come is tasty margaritas.
