Friends of ours were in town visiting and wanted to check out Publican for dinner. After securing reservations we were excited to eat! We arrived a bit early so the hostess directed us to the bar area where we had some pre-dinner cocktails while waiting. The decor is casual with these great 70's style lights hanging from the ceiling which created a romantic glow, fun pig pictures on the wall and all this warm wood tones. It had a really comfortable feeling to it.  After being escorted to our own personal "pig pen" we were promptly greated by our waiter who reviewed the menu and suggested some items to share. The menu is unique, full of pork items and a great combination of local items. We started with the ham sampler, mussels and beet salad to share. All were very yummy. I had the grilled salmon that was topped with morel mushrooms and a on top of a pea puree for my meal. My husband had their "ribs". But I wouldn't expect to receive the traditional ribs you might get at other restaurants. The ribs here were more like a steak. One of the pieces was quite fatty but my husband said had a nice flavor. We paired that with an order of grits. Overall, our service was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. We had a lot of fun with our friends and would recommend to friends/family visiting the area.
