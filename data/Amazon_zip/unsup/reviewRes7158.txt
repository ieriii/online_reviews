Initial impressions at a recent lunch here: Nice space, friendly service, extensive menu, high prices. I was a bit turned off by the two different levels of ribs (regular and competition style); are they saying the regular is just okay? The waiter explained it that the competition style takes longer and has some additional ingredients, but that was odd. Nonetheless, once the meal began, I was confirmed as a fan. They start you with some pickles and chips, which is nice to whet your appetite. Service was fast (got baby backs and St. Louis--not competition style!), which was much appreciated at lunch. Bottom line is these are the best quality and best tasting ribs you'll find anywhere near downtown. Plump, tender meat, nicely seasoned, plus good choice of three sauces. Cornbread on the side was a bit above average. While the prices are a bit high, that is to be expected for the location, and the quality of the food and of the place itself more or less justify the prices. My only real complaint was the lack of extra napkins, which can cause some issues if you like sauce. All in all, a very nice addition to the area and a good place to get your barbecue fix. I look forward to returning for lunch and to trying for dinner.
