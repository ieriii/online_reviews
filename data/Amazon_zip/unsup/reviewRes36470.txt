I concur----BEST crab rangoon I've ever had! This is my new favorite sushi joint. The nigiri was fresh, and the maki rolls were absolutely amazing! Four maki rolls, nigiri & crab rangoon for only $55.00. VERY reasonable prices, unbelievable sushi, excellent service, and it's BYOB. *My recommendation: Las Vegas & Spicy Blue Crab rolls Can't wait to go back & try their thai food----HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
