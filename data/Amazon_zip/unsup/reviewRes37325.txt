After a nice swim in the lake during the summer, or before a movie at AMC River North, I can ALWAYS find an outstanding quick and quality dinner from F&O. Salmon burger and sweet potato fries, yum!! Earlier in the year I bought the Groupon and actually tried out the 'grocery store' part and enjoyed that too! The baby octopus and black squid ink pasta was awesome...and would actually go back and pay for it next time without a Groupon!
