I went just after they started serving lunch (a few minutes after 11) and there was no line. But midway through our meal this place was packed.  Had the Woodland Mushroom Torta which has mushrooms and goat cheese and a chile salsa. I liked it. The tortas (sandwiches) are not huge, but they are a pretty good size for me and the bread is especially tasty. The guacamole is also really good.  For 2 tortas and a guac and chips (no drinks) it was $28 which to me seems a bit pricey, but everything seemed fresh and tasted good so no real complaints.
