Expensive, sure..... executive service with skilled servers. Have a question, knowledgeable staff is ready and waiting. The salad bar is outstanding, it's a meal in itself - many a veggi perished @ my fork. Plenty of variety. The meats were excellent - I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times and never had a bad experience. It's all you can eat and never once did I hear, Sir we are closing our doors, it's time to go. Good experience with the valet service, quick and friendly. Not a great drink selection, but you don't come here to drink. The hosts are very friendly and someone always comes by to check to see that our visit is going well. Been to other Brazillian steakhouse, but this one set the bar. Only if they let us take doggy bags home.
