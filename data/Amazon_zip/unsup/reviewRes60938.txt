This was my second visit to this restaurant. We came in for a late dinner after a show and the staff was very patient with us. I had a cheese flight and the polenta cakes. The cheese was fantastic but the polenta cake was a bit salty. We also enjoyed the cheese fondue and several people raved about their burgers and the "surf & turf" tartar. Always something interesting. Always something delicious. I just wish I hadn't missed the grilled cheese sandwich from the last menu change.
