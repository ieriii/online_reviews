Went her for dinner again with the fam...and it was just as delicious as I remember. Some of the party didn't get the AYCE and ordered off the menu. The Hubs has the sturgeon and he said it was awesome and cooked perfectly. My Mom had the shrimp po boy with and said it was a little too dry. I am thinking next time I go I have to order off the menu too...that just means I have to go any day but Tuesday. Oh, also, they gave my niece some Cheerios, and Brian is the best server. I love this place.
