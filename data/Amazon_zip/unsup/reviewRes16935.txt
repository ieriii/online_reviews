All you need to know here is LUNCH BUFFET! ($16 or so) It features a wide variety of Indian dishes all tasty and fresh. And as a bonus a decent selection of wine. But wait there's more - a free tandori chicken appetizer and basket of non for every table! Be careful or you may not be able to go back to work...
