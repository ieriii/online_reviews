yeah yeah yeah...i went. whatever. i was craving steak. i must say though...out of all these restaurants, ive tried zed, fogo and this. brazzaz has the BEST salad bar. i had to go twice. the steak? everything was meh..except for their filet. my o my...my knife literally slid through that meat! but the service was good, the people were kind, it's clean. price...expensive...but i would try it once just for the salad bar! :)
