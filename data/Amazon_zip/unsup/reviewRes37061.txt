Yessir. Brussel Sprouts to start. Would you like them with truffle oil or bacon? BOTH. So luscious and hearty. Also, add the Mac and Cheese. Oh my. The cheese is organic-y goodness, with a bit of panko-like bread crumbs on top to give it a bit of crunchy texture, to break up the extreme cream of the cheese. i got the Brisket sandwich for a late lunch. He got the Black Earth pork rib. Both served with the frites or shoelace-like fries. Oh so good. Organic beef and pig, just killing me. Had several types of beers here. I recommend anything Two Brothers, just because they are from my hometown-ish area. I left happy and full. Took a serious nap after that one.
