I always thought a good name for a churrascaria would be Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeat, as that's certainly what you get there.  Fogo was wonderful, and I doubt I can say anything different than what the other 337 folks have said. Exceptional service, perfectly cooked meat, and fried bananas. They are on top of their game there. If we wanted a certain cut, they'd send it our way. Our glasses were never empty, our plates were always removed, and our bellies were always full.  I probably would normally give it 4 stars, but I got engaged right after dinner there, so it holds a special memory with me now, and hence gets an extra star. ;) Oooh, I guess that's something that hasn't been said yet, right? Yay!
