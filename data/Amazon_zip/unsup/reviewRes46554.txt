I was really unimpressed. For only serving burgers and other burger-type sandwiches, it was really expensive. I got the salad bar and it was ok, but you had to pay extra to get meat in your salad and Ruby Tuesday's salad bar is 100 times better, not to mention cheaper. The inside of the place was straight out of the 70s. I don't think they have redecorated since they first opened. I really don't understand the appeal or why they are getting such high reviews. I won't be returning to R.J. Unhhs anytime soon.
