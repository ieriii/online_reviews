This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago and every friend that I have recommended it to has agreed. My first time was 3 years ago when a couple college friends who came visited Chicago made reservations to meet up with my wife and me because they had heard Vince V. and Jennifer A. had recently dined there. I've gone 2 times since and each time is equally impressive. I recommend the spicy spaghetti dish with seafood. I've tried their other dishes and they're great too. They have a decent selection of wine and local beers and above average dessert. The decor is respectable and service has always been superb, even with a party of 12. Reservations are a highly recommended. Mia Francesca is a fun and consistent place whether on a date or a group of friends with great Italian cuisine. ***** FIVE STARS
