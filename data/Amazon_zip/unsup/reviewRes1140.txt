AMAZING!!!! I am so, so, so glad to finally have had a chicago style hot dog done right, actually in Chicago! Heard from a local friend that this was the best, and I agree! I've had Portillos before and while they are good, it doesn't even compare to Doug's. The taste, ambiance, people, and general business way out-classes the other dog places I have been to... (except for Pinks). We waited an hour before ordering and it was worth it! The prices are so incredible, they could charge WAY more and still be this popular, guaranteed. Ill most likely never be back, but I am so glad to cross this off the bucket list! :D
