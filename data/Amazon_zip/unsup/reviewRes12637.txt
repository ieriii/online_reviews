The latest 5-star to my entourage. Welcome to the mix Texas de Brazil! Overall: Gorgeous spacious inside, vaulted ceilings, make you feel like you are somewhere exotic. The self-serve area is ENORMOUS (70+ items) and extensive. Blew me away by the taste and variety. The meats are clearly tasty as ever. Not a bad deal when all is said and done. The deets: Texas de Brazil is a well-known concept here in Chicago - unlimited food from the "salad bar" and meats served at your tableside. Unlike their competitors, Texas de Brazil does an AMAZING job with the "salad bar" (notice that I put quotes around that for a reason). This "salad bar" is not your grandmother's salad bar at Sizzler's. We are talking about grilled asparagus with raspberry vinagrette, parmesan cheese from a huge block, prosciutto ready for the taking, crispy bacon whispering secrets to your ears, seared tuna (raw on inside) that is almost still jumping because it is THAT fresh (and tasty), assortment of peppers from all over the globe, sushi rolls with variety, soup of the day (lobster bisque is superb), mashed potatoes, cod stew, rice/beans, and of course.... salad. Just the salad bar alone is a deal at 25 bucks. The next time I go, I will only order the salad bar and just feast on the wondrous fish there. When it came time to try the meats, I was already half-stuffed. I must say that all of the meats I tried were nothing but delicious. Quite frankly, you can't go wrong whenever you go to a Brazilian style steakhouse. In my case, it was not worth the extra 20 buckeroos for the meat option - simply because I was so happy with the salad bar and getting stuffed with that. I will gladly come back here, gorge myself with the fresh "salad bar," and bring some buds to cherish this place with me. (btw, I must give props to our server Jeff - very professional and a real delight to our dining experience!). Cheers my fellow Yelpers!
