Note: You need a good laugh? I originally reviewed the wrong restaurant, City Noor Kabobs. FAIL! Thankew Ms. Caitlin L for pointing my erroneous review. Oh Noon O Kabab, how you filled me up with scrumptious pita slices, feta cheese, hummus and that huge dish of meat and rice. I knew I would be eating Middle-eastern cuisine this weekend... and you came along. (ugh...I hate reviews like that...) I underestimated myself when I got there. "I'll only eat some of it and take the rest home", I said. My friend Caitlin L said the portions were HUGE.. and it was, but I was HUNGRY. It was all GONE when it was over. I asked for some spicy sauce which strangely tasted like salsa from Garcia's Mexican Restaurant. It was my first time trying dill rice and it will not be the last. The decor of this place is nice and we were seated immediately. I guess we just got there before the Sunday dinner rush. Mind you, this place isn't exactly cheap... but it was money well spent. Not a place to go to for a quick fix (See: Taza's, Sultan's Market...), but a nice sit yo' butt down restaurant. Total bill was hovering around $27. Not bad.... Will return when the time is right.
