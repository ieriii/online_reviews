Yeah, yeah, I know: Vegetarians have no business reviewing a restaurant that features foie gras, veal, and pig's face cooked in duck fat (aka tete de cochon). Trust me, I would have happily ceded my seat at Longman & Eagle to someone who would actually enjoy eating here and hopped across the square to try out Lula. But alas, the dinner location wasn't my call. I have high hopes that this place only uses meat from "happy" pigs, cows, ducks, bison, etc. but I can't say for sure. The menu just says that the meat is local but doesn't go into more detail. I got the cauliflower and lentil dish and while it was interesting and not the usual token veggie entree, I wasn't blown away it. Certainly not to the point that it overcame the sight of my DC scooping out bone marrow and spreading it on adorable little toast points. I didn't even enjoy that shit as a meat eater and now it's seriously sick to watch. Aside from there being, like, four things on the menu I could eat (two of them being salad, another being a pretzel appetizer), L&E isn't all bad. I really liked my cocktail, the Harvest Sidecar. It's a perfect fall drink. I also liked the Gruyere donut dessert. It tastes like sweet cheese curds. Way too rich for more than a few bites, though. My significant other dug the whiskey flight and the pretzels. Service was awesome. Our server (Cordlandt or something, naturally) was all over the menu and seriously could not have been more knowledgeable or friendly.
