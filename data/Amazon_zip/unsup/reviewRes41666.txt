Great choice for my first Vietnamese experience, however I didn't realize Pho was the speciality, so I didn't order it. I feel like such a moron. I must go back to correct this oversight. There are a lot of great reviews on this place, so I will only add a note that you can BYOB. No corkage fee baby!
