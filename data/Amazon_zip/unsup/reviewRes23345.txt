We went there with some out of town guests (one of whom lived in China for 6 months) and they were as impressed as we were. It was spicy, authentic, and overall....tasty. Take a group and share, it's best when you get to try a little bit of everything. The only problem I had was that it was a *tad* bit greasy. I will definitely be back to try the hot pot. :)
