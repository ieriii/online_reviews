This place is awesome! Have to say I was in between a 4 and 5. Ended at a 4 because the atmosphere is a bit lacking. That said the service and food are great and the price can not be beat. On Tuesday's and Wednesday's they have a phenomenal deal where you get a multi course meal for $12.50 per person. The food tastes super fresh, seems healthy, and you get to try a bit of everything. I highly suggest Simply It if you are going out for a casual meal and you want really good quality food at a great price with super friendly service.
