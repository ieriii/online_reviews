Yummmmmy! I live in the area and unfortunately the area lacks good restaurants...I think. But, Indie Cafe tops all of them. The presentation is great, the food is wonderful. Lunch specials and reasonable dinner prices, as well. I love the sushi, and the Thai food is good too. I recommend the Pad Thai and the Crab Rangoon. 6/28/08: I have been visiting Indie A LOT lately. Everyday there is a lunch special from open-3pm and the prices are not only cheap, but the amount of food you get is unbelievable! Choice of soup or salad, crab rangoon (3 of them), egg rolls (2), or one other appetizer option, and then a main dish, and the options are wonderful. This option is only $6.75! They also have sushi selections, and Japanese. The price on those are different but still so affordable. I recommend the rama chicken, crab rangoon (best I've had), shrimp tempura maki, and sweet potato maki. Also, the lunch special is for dine-in, carry out, or delivery. Basically, I'm obsessed.
