Had a great meal at Sprout last night. My fiance each ordered the tasting menu- which at $65 each is a pretty good deal for 5 courses at a restaurant run by a chef who just got nominated for a James Beard award. The decor was comfortable, and our waiter was responsive, and very friendly. And the food? Mostly, I loved it. I had the octopus for a first course which somehow (despite the tentacles) tasted like the best comfort food you ever had. The second course was a celery/cauliflower soup that was incredibly tasty. The centerpiece was quail- warm, flavorful, beautifully presented quail. Next was grilled cheese...kind of underwhelming. Salty, and kind of palette overwhelming. The last dish I had was "coffee", again, very good, and a strong finish to the meal. Great restaurant. My compliments to the chef.
