Simply beautiful! Located in the heart of the windy city, Omni Hotel offers top notch singular service. Quick and simple check in and the rooms are quaint. The views are incredible, reminds of the couples retreat movie quote: "It looks like a screen saver." The view of Sears tower up close and personal, I had a take a moment and just soak in the view. Don't forget to join the select guest program for free wifi~!! Room: A Cleanness: A Overall: A ps. Don't forget to try Cafe 676 and their PB & J Waffle Panini *trust me its GOOD"
