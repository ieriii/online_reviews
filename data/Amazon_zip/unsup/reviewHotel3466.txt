So, I stayed at this hotel for one night and had a couple of beefs with the hotel. I had a special rate that was being offered, but it was noted that I may have to contact one of the hotel staff to ensure that I could get the rate. Well, despite 3 phone calls and 3 messages, that hotel staff member NEVER called me back. Ever. Thank goodness for decent reservations operators who helped me out eventually.  As for the hotel itself, it's location is fabulous. It is right on Michigan Ave (entrance slightly off Michigan Ave) - the TIP TOP TAP building! I will echo others' comments on the closet sized elevator (if I had large luggage, getting in would have been a problem!) and small-ish rooms. The check-in was efficient and nice, and they gave me and my friend one of the "larger" rooms. Boy am I glad he did, because even then, it was a bit tiny! Of the room itself. One major problem which was the floor between the room and bathroom - almost stubbed my foot on a nail (pointy end!) twice - they seriously need to fix that problem as the last thing a hotel guest wants is another tetanus shot on their vacation/trip! Another smaller problem - the fact that they wanted to charge you for internet access! Thank goodness we managed to find some "free" wireless from some other buildings nearby. I personally didn't mind the bed, but my friend thought it was too hard.  Hmmm... it wasn't all bad! I loved the shower! :)  Overall, for the price paid, not bad, especially for the convenience of the location. But they definitely could fix things, starting with their staff - CALL PEOPLE BACK!!!
