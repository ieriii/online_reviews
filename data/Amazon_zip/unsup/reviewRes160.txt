Dear Alinea, I must thank you for the best experience I have had in my entire life. The service was outstanding!!! the wine pairings were divine. For a 26 year old; I feel blessed to have eaten at a place like Alinea. We had a 16 course dinner that left me wondering if Grant Atchatz was secretly god himself! For the people who complain about prices...... you are all extremely stupid!!!!!!! Of course this is going to me an extreme amount of money but to "be honest" the food was completely worth it. And I have to disagree with Jeanus when she said this is bad place for first date- If my gf took me here I would marry her on the spot!!!! Yes and thats after only 2 glasses of wine:) Thank you Alinea, Sincerely Mike
