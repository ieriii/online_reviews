The best brewpub in Chicago, easily. Not much to add here that the 485 reviewers below me have not mentioned; however, do note a recent expansion in its menu to cover more veggie and even vegan options, which is as smart as expected, considering the relationship with Handlebar Cafe. I would say it's annoying how they ran out of three of twelve beers on tap when I was there at five on a Friday if the other nine were not so refined and premium for their price. Indeed, the cheaper Revolution offerings are on par not with standard craft fare but more the 22 oz-ers offered by Three Floyds, Two Brothers, Goose Island and other local breweries. There are very few misses in food or beverage, and the rotation in dark stuff - whether the General, the Rye Stout, the Sodom or Gomorrah - are all best in class. There's no better way to deliver alcohol to you.  Like all the best of the best in this city, Revolution gets insanely packed. But, unlike all other places that are so crowded the patrons spill into the doorway and street, it's actually OK to be a sardine here. Maybe it's because it's just big enough - unlike Kuma's, for example - to have some real turnover. Maybe because beer snobs, unlike wine ones, can handle a stand-and-chat, happy enough crammed, so long as they're standing next to friends, sipping on some of the best in the world. Contentment is contagious and, at Revolution, deeply infectious.
