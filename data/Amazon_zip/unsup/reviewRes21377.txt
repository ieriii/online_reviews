Good, solid food, but not fantastic. The system they have in unnecessarily (at least on the off night I went) rushed. They have a weird number system and hostess that doesn't make you feel very welcome. Their soups and carnitas sandwiches are great. The prices are probably a little high for the casual atmosphere, portions, and get your own water place. I'd come back, but it's not a place I need to go to all that often.
