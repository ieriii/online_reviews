Our regular taco delivery joint has service a little later in the night so I searched Grub Hub for other joints that were closer. I quickly decided to give this a shot after reading all of the 5 star reviews. Unfortunately, We were pretty disappointed. The steak tacos were waaaaaay too salty for our liking. Yes, I know it is Costa Rican, but i wasn't expecting to taste the ocean. I had avocados, sour cream and cheese added in case it was bad at least those 50cent a piece, additions (per taco) would save them. They didn't. Their steak fries were my filler in case it was all a failed feat. With that being said, they're huge, crispy and delicious. If I wasn't so hungry, they would have been perfect for poutine. That saving grace and the 20 minute early delivery were the only reasons I gave the restaurant two stars. The look on my boyfriend's face, when he bit into his steak torta, didn't even make me want to try it. Needless to say, he didn't even eat 1/3rd of it! Oh, and props to the delivery boy who had no clue it was a cash order who almost gave me my food for free, he was all confused when I gave him the money. I sure could use that money right now! Really...
