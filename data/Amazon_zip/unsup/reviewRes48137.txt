Came here for breakfast while in town and yum!! Dcor: Interesting. It has an upscale feel but at the same time, it's set up like a barn/farm. The booths to the sides are 'gated' like in pigpens and the main tables that spawn the restaurants are communal tables, and these in turn, circle around a cocktail/drink/mingling area. It seems like they took care of every sort of seating! Service: Fantastic! Always had my water and coffee constantly filled and was constantly checked up on without being annoying, haha. Food: - Zucchini bread with blackberry and walnuts & ricotta cheese: SO yummy!! I didn't' expect it to be so delicious and decadent. I warn you to not get so full on this yet for more yummy things! - I got the red wine poached egg benedict. I personally did not think the red wine that it was poached in added anything much to the flavor, but I enjoyed that the hollandaise sauce wasn't overpowering. Proscuitto isn't really my thing, but I do admit that this was fresh and tender. - Friend got the works, with the biscuit, bacon, potatos, etc dish. It was ginormous and he seemed to like his dish too! Overall: I loved this place. Yes, it's a bit pricey but I thought it was worth it. Oh and love the coffee mugs!
