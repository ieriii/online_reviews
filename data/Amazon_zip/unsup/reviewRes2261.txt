Went on opening time to avoid the queue. Specialty dogs were great and wanted to try everything. Price of regular dogs cheap while specialty dogs were $8 or $9. The order taker and cashier who I assume is Doug was really friendly. My family and dad enjoyed it. Will visit again next time I come back from Manila.
