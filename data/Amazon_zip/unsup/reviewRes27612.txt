Went for lunch during the week. Ceviche was definitely hit or miss. My chicken with mole sauce sucked. And I don't use that word lightly. I forgot what my friends ordered, but it was definitely VERY forgettable. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be Mexican cuisine with American spin or fusion Mexican, but I definitely expected more from Rick Bayless... lots of pomp and circumstance, but in the end... no enchilada I've had way better Mexican cuisine at a fraction of the cost in McKinley Park.
