so i went to this place for fathers day with my father.... M. hanerys was way to long of a wait. as our second choice i think this was a good choice. both me and my father had the eggs benidict and it was pretty good. his friend had the wheat pancakes i think. i guess he kinda enjoyed them. i did like the venue though. very relaxing and mellow. the service was great. coffee was eh...... not illy.
