Love this place. Great food, nice atmosphere, and BYOB!! This is the kind of italian place that makes you think authentic. The waitor speaks just enough english to take your order, talks italian to the table next to you, and you swear you saw his grandma making pasta in the kitchen window. Great!! The service is friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The ambiance is romantic and simple....No loud music or tacky decor. A perfect date place, or good for a night out with the girls. Now on to the food...delicious!!  Bruschetta with mozzarella is fresh and aromatic, the pappardelle is homemade and cooked perfectly. The menu had a good sized selection of items and none of the portions are so huge that you leave there wondering why you just got served 2 pounds of pasta. Oh, and the best part....its BYOB! I love this place and will go back. All the dishes I got- appetizer to dessert were wonderful.
