I am giving this place 5-stars because the quality of their steaks is A++. In Chicago, its easy to find a good steakhouse that cooks steak exactly to your liking and that is very-well seasoned. But few places can do steaks with a perfect crust, and this is where Wildfire sets itself apart. With all of their steaks, you get to choose one of about 6 or 7 different crusts/topping which is exceptional!  And the food tastes good to.  But the thing I am really going to rave about is their generosity with their wines. I ordered a wine flight which comes with 4 wines for $13. Good variety and good price, I thought...but I was blown away because the size of each taste was about 4 oz. That means I got two-thirds of a bottle for just $13, and that includes being able to sample 4 different varieties of wine. You couldn't even get it that cheap as some retail stores!  So, I will definitely go back because I want to try the rest of their cuts with the rest of their crusts.
