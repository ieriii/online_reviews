My family likes to go to this restaurant. However, the first time I was able to go there, no one greeted me at the door. I wandered around the restaurant to see if my family had been seated and still no one spoke to me. I finally flagged down someone who worked there who answered me rudely and then turned away from me while speaking so I didn't understand her partly because I couldn't hear her and also because she had such a think accent. Furthermore, I am pregnant and needed to eat something while waiting for my family to arrive and they refused to seat me even after I told them I would order. They also spoke to and seated people who arrived after me. Those customers who arrived after me were also incredibly rude and added to the overall horrible and very unpleasant experience I had there. I would never give them the pleasure of my patronage because the memory of that awful experience is ever-lasting.
