A great big packed bar with some really good dishes and fantastic home brews. Especially loved their wheat beer, which would probably be one of my first picks at the liquor store if lined up next to the commercial brands. I did have a few issues though. My fish & chips came out SOGGY. Like they fried it and then dropped it in the sink on the way over. In retrospect I probably should've sent it back, but just peeled the skin off and ate the fish plain. Polenta fries did not live up to expectations, but the sweet potato cakes exceeded them.  At 10oz, the burgers are just too damn big. If they went with 6 to 8 oz it would hold together better and not be quite so bellyache inducing. It's a shame since otherwise the burgers are done very well. Also, didn't care too much for the desserts. Rosemary in my cherry bourbon cake? Too overpowering.
