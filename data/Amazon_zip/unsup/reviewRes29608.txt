This place is amazing! I started going here last year, but just now found the time to write a review. The food is amazing and they give you a pretty decent portion. Also, the selection is kind of small, but you do not get tired of it. The waiting staff know the menu like the back of their hands and get you your order very quickly. The only downside is the space...its gets a little crammed sometimes, but thats how you know its good since its really busy!
