Definitely a cheaper, welcome addition to the Bayless family of restaurants in Chicago. Churros = nom. I actually wasn't a huge fan of the caldo (soup) I got -- vegetables & black bean. Just felt like a bunch of stuff was thrown into a broth without much thought. I think this place is great for hot chocolate/ dessert, though. Also, I got to meet Rick Bayless there on opening day so I can't complain :)
