I don't want to reiterate what other people have already said, so the topic of my post will be: How to Optimize your Hot Doug's Experience. First of all, if you want duck fat fries, those are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, and on those days, there will always be a line. So it doesn't really matter when you come (unless you come before 10:30 when it opens?). Yes, people will still come when it's raining or snowing.. weather doesn't stop people in Chicago from carrying on as usual. Weird. Anyway, you know that "Food Buddha" show that the Sunda chef does? Well basically, in each episode, he goes to a restaurant and orders OOE -- "One of Each". This same approach should be used when ordering at Hot Doug's. Come with about 5-6 of your friends who are willing to share food and together, you can order one of each of the specials. Once you have all your food, people can try the ones that look appealing to them, and basically, everything on the menu looks good, so you'll probably want to try them all. I think I've liked most everything I tried -- but if you're not a big cheese person, you might have to remove some of it. They pile a LOT on each one.
