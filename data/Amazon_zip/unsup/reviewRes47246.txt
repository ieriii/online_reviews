They have some really tasty burgers on PRETZEL buns. Yes Pretzel buns! We went on a day where they has half price wings so we had to have a few of those. They were good but I think they could have been a tad hotter. The burger was nicely cooked and the fries were homemade and good. Another place I would go back. Everyday they have a different special which increases my chances of going their more often.
