I always thought that Vietnamese food had to be a hole-in-the-wall with sticky tabletops, greasy chairs and (sometimes) thumb soup, you know - you order your pho and they bring it to you with their thumb on the side. Dig - This classy tastefully decked out place is a real winner. Authentic, French Vietnamese decor complete with vintage black and white photos from the old days, great ambiance and even better food - oh - did i say that their food rocks?!  Drink/Savor/Sweets - Everything here is really good and it's been a while so I can't recall their menu but the two things that I still remember are their pho ( with melt-in-your-mouth-tender beef & a savory broth), beef salad and the crispy spring rolls. Le Colonial - please contact me if you are interested in opening a second location in Los Angeles!
