Love this place...couldn't recommend it enough if you are a beer/pizza lover. And who isn't! However I would have to say that the beer is what gives this place a 5 star rating. If there wasn't internally brewed beer I would give 4 stars for the pizza alone. The beer is absolutely splendid---and in my opinion the BEST locally brewed Chicago beer I have tried. I am a pretty avid beer enthusiast and have tried the major Chicago breweries and they all fall flat compared to Piece. The selection isn't huge but they hit on all the beer types and each one is marvelous. If you are a beer fan you owe it to yourself to check this place out even if you aren't eating. The Camel Toe or Dysfunctionale are my personal favorites. Now, on to the pizza. This is definitely a more contemporary thin crust establishment. The pizzas aren't cheap but they are rather large. A medium will feed 3 people with decent appetites. The ingredients are always fresh HOWEVER stay away from the Chicken as a topping. It's definitely of the the pre-cooked frozen variety and doesn't work at all next to the rest of the suburb topping options. Side note the place is staffed almost entirely by hipsters and hippies. It's rather bizarre but they are friendly, helpful, and overall much better servers than the type of stuck up bimbos you tend to get up North. Anyhow check this place out one of my favorite spots in that area. But's it's no hidden gem since wait times during prime hours are rather long. This place is very popular and for good reason. But I say put your name in and spend the hour sampling some of the best local beer in Chicago!
