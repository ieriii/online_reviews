Here's how to have a good time at Hot Doug's: -Go with a group of 5 or more people. -Order every special on the menu (and some duck fat fries, if available). -Cut each one up into small pieces. -Try as many different hot dogs and sausages as you can. For some reason, while paying $7 for a single sausage seems expensive, paying $10 for bits of six different sausages seems more than fair. I went here with four other people, and for $40 we all walked (or perhaps hobbled) away stuffed. Well worth the 45-minute wait in line. Hot Doug's is one of Chicago's truly unique restaurants, marrying "low class" and "high class" cuisines flawlessly. I plan to bring all of my out-of-town visitors here; I can't think of anyone who wouldn't love it. I like that Doug personally mans the front counter at all times. He's way too nice for a guy who has to deal with the public for 5 hours every day. Also, he has really cool glasses.
