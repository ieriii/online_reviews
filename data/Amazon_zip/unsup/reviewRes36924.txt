It saddens me to write a poor review for Indie Cafe because I was really rooting for this place - always recommended it to friends. The service, however, is horrible. We waited at least 15 minutes after being seated for anyone to stop at our table. After that, it was about 20 minutes for any food to arrive and, after we were finished, another 25 minutes to get our check. I eventually had to get up and walk to the other side of the restaurant to find a waitress. The panang curry is fantastic and the sushi very good as well. Don't go though if you're hungry and want to eat soon. Or bring a snack to tide you over.
