I think Opart Thai has the BEST Pad Thai ever!!!!!!! I took two of my coworkers there (in Wilmette) and they loved it too! They also have amazing additional dishes such as the Pad See Eiw and the Curry dishes. I love their Egg Drop Soup too! I think Opart Thai is my favorite all around Thai restaurant in Chicago! They even have 3 locations in Chicago (2 city and 1 suburban). There is this one on Western and another one in China Town (1900 S. State St.) and one on Skokie Rd. in Wilmette. Check them out!
