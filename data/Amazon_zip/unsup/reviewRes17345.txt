Now I don't know what good Indian food is. All I can tell you is that I've tried quite a few Indian restaurants downtown and at Devon (mainly for lunch buffets), and I've got to say, that India House has one hell of a buffet. There are a variety of yummy curries, and vegetables, but more importantly they give you fresh naan from the kitchen and the also sizzling chicken tandoori on a hot plate. I also love the mango sorbet dessert. Everything is extremely tasty and all for under $15. Good deal!
