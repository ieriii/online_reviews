This is my go-to restaurant when I have guests in town! Greek Islands never disappoints. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table with no reservation at prime dinner time. The service is always been great, and you can't beat free valet parking. Absolutely love the fried zucchini, flaming cheese, and ALL lamb entrees. A definite MUST if you haven't been here yet!
