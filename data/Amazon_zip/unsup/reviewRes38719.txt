Mediocre is the best word for Giordanos. Perhaps once an institution this is now a tourist trap with poor service, watery and mealy sauce, ingredients delviered so sparsely that you're forced to hunt for mushrooms or green peppers in your deep dish. If you're looking for authentic Chicago pizza don't believe all the blandanistas who are seduced by the glitz or the epic clutter of knick knacks or the location. There's better to be had for anyone who is clever enough to call up and talk to a someone who actually lives in Chicago.
