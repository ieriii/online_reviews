So disappointing! Due to all of the previous reviews and even the menu, I thought this place would have been great. I was sadly wrong. Pros Colorful interior/exterior designs Friendly hostess' Constant water refill Dinner arrived fast Cons Super unfriendly waitress (almost like we were bothering her just by being there) Food was super salty The mojito I got was flat and bland Food arrived TOO fast ( we weren't done with our appetizer yet) Really loud, you have to yell since the hall is so loud and there was a band playing in the other room Overall, extremely disappointing. It was my birthday dinner and I was so excited To try the Churros but after how rude our waitress was and the overall quality, I just wanted to go home. Bad. Bad. Bad.
