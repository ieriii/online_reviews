Ok I love ethnic street food and love Mexican food. Maybe my expectations were too high? I went one Sat late morning to this cute cafe (I guess that was our first mistake). The line to sit was an hour long so we decided to take out as the wait was 10 minutes tops. Ordered some tortas to share (a chorizo one and a chicken one) and had some special juice they make. The juice was actually unique and tasty. The tortas were nothing special. I don't get the hype around this place. I am kind of a foodie and love trying new places. This was average at best. Have since talked to others who say the hot chocolate--esp the almond flavor-- and the churros are the thing to order. I don't know, I wanted Mexican street food, not Mexican deserts that I could find anywhere.
