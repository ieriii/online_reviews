Two people can eat here for less than $10. The dogs are the best. The fries are pretty damned awesome. Free refills on the pop. Doug is always cheerful and the waitstaff is quick and courteous. Why else would tons of people wait 45 minutes in line? The latest review I just saw of this place says: "hot dogs are the worst here. They taste greasy and sour. I got very sick to my stomach. The fries are very greasy also. The pop is flat and way too sweet. Plus they are way overpriced and the service is terrible. I even seen a roach" LMAO! funniest review ever. I hope you all know it's a joke.
