I'm not sure if I actually like the food here but going here is definitely an experience. They have several drive ups that you park at and order your hot dogs, hamburgers, shakes and fries and then a girl on roller skates comes out with your order and attaches it to your window on a tray. It's just a novelty....but you know...I'm okay with that.
