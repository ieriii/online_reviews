Love, Love, Love this place!  Have been going here for years and it's still my favorite. Remember it's BYOB and they'll heat your sake up for you.  You must try the Red V (it's not on the menu, but they continue to serve it if you request.) If you don't feel like the wait, just go a little early as it usually doesn't get packed pre-7pm.
