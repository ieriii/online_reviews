There is not nearly enough Vietnamese food in Chicago. If you go on Metromix and click "Thai," you find 211 restaurants in the Chicagoland area. If you click "Chinese," there are 822. But searching for "Vietnamese" yields only 59 - and half of those are within a few blocks of each other, along or around Argyle Street. There's something wrong with this picture. When done right, Vietnamese food tastes fresh, clean and healthy - and that's just how Simply It tasted tonight. I ordered from this restaurant for the first time. The food arrived within the expected timeframe, was packaged carefully and well, and was still hot when it arrived. And both the guy who took my order and the guy who delivered the food were unusually friendly. Already, we're off to a refreshingly good start. The Tamarind Shrimp Soup was divine - an interesting mix of plump shrimp, fruit and vegetables in a delicious broth with just the right amount of spice. I also had the Coconut and Mango Beef - a wonderful mix of fresh veggies, mango and beef - and a very tasty Tamarind smoothie (thank you, Tuan). I had a hard time choosing which dishes to order, because so many looked good. But I won't have a difficult time choosing which restaurant to order from next time. Let's hope more restaurants like Simply It open around town and bring more of this excellent food to more parts of the city.
