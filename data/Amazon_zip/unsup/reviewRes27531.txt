Good standard Mexican food in a colorful atmosphere. Terrific value. First customers are welcomed with complementary chicken soup as well as the usual chips and salsa. The menu offers all the standards and the service was good. Our waitress was quite patient dealing with a lot of kids and meeting their needs. They especially liked the Mexican sodas. It's BYOB and they'll open wine with no corkage fee.
