This is definitely one of the Rush St area's hot spots. My first two visits there were great, however, my last visit left me questioning the food. I really enjoyed the appetizers (ahi tuna tartar and monkfish); however, the entrees were just okay. The cod sounded great on the menu and the quality of the fish was great, however, the sauce was very bland. I'm going to give this place one more shot to win me back.
