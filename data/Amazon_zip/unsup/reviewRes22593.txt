Admittedly, until last week I was a Chinatown virgin. It had always been on my to do list, but organizing people for a trek south of Roosevelt is easier said than done. Dine Around is the excuse we use to eat everywhere to collect reciepts for free admission to the Chicago Gourment Food & Wine Festival. Stop #1 - Lao Sze Chaun...to go. Don't miss: Tony's Chicken with Three Chilis -- it was still crispy when we got home, and so delicious we managed to clear the entire oversized container. Be careful of: Lamb with curry powder. Still order it, just make sure you have a cold beer handy to cool yourself down a little. Hot! Two entrees + veggies + rice was more than enough to feed the two of us that night, with leftovers enough to feed the boyfriend twice the next day. Honestly, don't waste your time trying to find decent Chinese food outside of Chinatown. It doesn't exist.
