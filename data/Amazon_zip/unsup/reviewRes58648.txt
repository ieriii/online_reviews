3rd Coast is a great place to start the day off with. A full menu that favors the AM taste buds. The food is good. Ones order is filled quite fast. Well prepared with a pleasant presentation. Children are welcome. Good value for the dollar. Recommend early arrival especially for breakfast. Mid AM may find yourself with a 5-10 minute wait. 3 Coasts is for real and the staff works hard to make it a fantastic experience. Note: Stayed at hotel down the street from 3rd Coast. Happy to have found 3rd Coast. Nicholas P Heille, 3460 Garfield St NE, Minneapolis MN 55418
