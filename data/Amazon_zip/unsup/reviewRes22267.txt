I did a little sniffing around ahead of time because I didn't want to go to just ANY restaurant in Greek town. A fellow foodie gave his personal testament to Greek Islands: He said he'd tried the rest, and all paled in comparison. So my expectations were rather high. I walked in and was impressed by the sheer size of the venue. I live in Hawai'i, where NOTHING is this big, let alone a Greek place. Then there was the extensive menu: Even my husband, who is not a fan of many things exotic, had his pick of chicken and beef dishes. Since I couldn't find souvlakis (my favorite) on the menu (Am I blind???), I went with the gyro plate. My order came with a warm pita, a heaping pile of meat and a dish all by itself of the best tzatziki I have ever had. I wanted to lick every last bit of sauce from the dish, it was so ridiculously good. And there was so much gyro meat that no matter how much I liked it, I could not finish it all. Now THAT's my kind of Greek restaurant! But I do have to dock Greek Islands one star for their side Greek salad. Seriously? You cannot slap a slab of feta and couple of olives onto a tossed salad and call it Greek salad! It was horrendous. If I hadn't ordered it, I would never have known . . . but I did. And now I can't get the image out of my head. The service at Greek Islands is attentive and super friendly. Even though the employees sometimes spoke Greek to each other, I never once got the impression that they were making snide remarks about the customers (which you know happens at some ethnic restaurants). I will definitely be returning.
