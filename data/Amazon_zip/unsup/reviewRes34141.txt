Egg & Cheese Pie = orgasmic. Okay, I totally agree that the Falafel is dry. What I love about Sultans is everything is totally customizable, fresh and dirt CHEAP. When I get my Falafel, I only get one ball and add veggies. Depending on who makes it, it can come out too full and then break at the seams whilst you are eating it. That can be annoying. Lentil soup is good, but a tad bland; load that shit with lemon. I've had the lamb. It's good and juicy. Sultans is fantastic for what it is: cheap and fast. It's kind of like a bona fied fast food restaurant. I love it and you should, too.
