We had to rent a car to get there and it was definitely worth it. We got there before it opened and there was already a line down the block. Doug himself greeted us at the counter and schmoozed us before he took our order. He even took a shot at my boyfriend for wearing a Mets cap.  We ordered off the specials menu mostly. It was last July and my fondest memory was of the sirloin dog. It had those crunch onions on top and was beefy delicious. We also had some greek dog with olives and feta. The Dog was also great. I believe we went on a non duck fat fries day so we ordered the cheese fries instead. I must say, I'm not a fan of excessive use of cheese, but these were damn good. The cheese was more creamy than cheesy. I will be returning this July for the Taste of Chicago. Hot Dougs is not one of the venders, so I will be once again renting a car to sample the specials menu.
