I have never ever ever been to any Wildfire location. Ever. Amazing, I know. So when I was presented with an invitation to dinner at this location I jumped at the chance. Although, I am not sure if I ever don't jump at the chance for a free meal, but C'est la vie. My first experience at Wildfire met most of my expectations, even exceeding them in many ways. Dark rye raisin bread on the table (where have I had this before??) TASTY Main Course: All the proteins ordered by my group (steak, pork chops, fish and shrimp) were big portions and nicely cooked. My 2 large pork chops were tender and juicy and large enough to doggie-bag half of it. The sides are also super large. (Au gratin Potatoes MUCH better than the box my mom used to cook). Wine List: To be expected in a steak joint. Server: Kind of creepy in a "please like me" way, but did not hassle us when our dinner exceeded hour 2. Dessert: Oh. My. God. Really, did Mr. Server-man need to stop by with a tray of all the offerings? I bit my tongue from saying "I'll have one of each" and acquiesced to splitting the trio of desserts (key lime pie, chocolate peanut butter pie and ice cream cookie). Delicious. Even with my wine-filled belly and half my dinner in a container, I still found room to poke my fork into these delectables a number of times. Wildfire is a good place for a nice meal at lower than astronomical prices. Save room for DESSERT.
