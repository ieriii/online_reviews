First off Kudos to Josh the host. We had made reservations for 7 but there was a possibility of it only being 5 maybe 6. Josh went ahead and gave us a 6 top which we ended up needing. The place was packed at 7 on a sautrday night so it was loud inside and I will have to go back to sit out in the patio area b/c it looked so nice out there. Bacon wrapped dates so tender and not overly salty like I have had before.The Ropa something or other was good but I should have gone with something a little more flavorful.Everyone at the table said there food was good and the baked goat cheese was very popular. Our server was a little lacking she didn't even introduce her self and the expo/ bus team was seen more than her.
