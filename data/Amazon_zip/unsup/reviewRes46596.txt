RJ Grunt's had been on our list of places to try for awhile, so my husband and I went a couple times in the past few weeks, once with friends after the zoo, and once with out-of-town visitors who were hoping to eat something light before a chocolate tour the next day. We all had great food each time. The menu is pretty standard for a bar & grille type place, but there are a lot of choices and everything everyone ordered was good. I loved the salad bar, the burgers were delicious and huge, the shakes are really good, and it's an all-around fun place. Check it out! P.S. I haven't been, but I've heard their Sunday brunch is also really good--I'll probably head back there to sample that.
