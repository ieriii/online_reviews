i used to go here quite a bit for lunch meetings and thought the food, service and ambiance was always top notch. as more sushi places have entered the scene, sunda has grown stale and way too pricey. we went today and shared 2 rolls the server recommended as well as each had 2 entrees. not impressed. the hype is not worth it, the service was pretty poor and the food was mediocre. union, shiso and even RA are better.
