From Seattle to LA to NY to Chicago, this is hands down one of the Top 10 best Sushi spots ever. Period. The decor is fabulous, the seating is good for two to ten (though a 4 top would probably be best for an overall superior experience). The Dragon rule will ruin you and the service is consistently good.
