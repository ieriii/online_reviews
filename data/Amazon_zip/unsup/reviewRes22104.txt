WOW. So rumors are true...the Oatmeal Shake is AMAZING. it is quite filling and you can get it mixed with something else ie strawberry or banana etc, but even the plain oatmeal shake is outstanding. PLENTY of vegetarian options here! Had the 'award winning' burrito, definitely delicious, very fresh tasting The empanadas we had as an app and it was actually quite delicious My sister had the potato tacos and raved about them as well this is definitely a BYOB place...pretty packed for a Tuesday night street parking on milwaukee for us was no problem. ps CASH ONLY
