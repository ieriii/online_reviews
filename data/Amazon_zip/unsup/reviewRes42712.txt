I checked up on the reviews of this place before I went so I already knew going in I was going to order two things: -Le Bar St. Germain (St. Germain, Lemon & Prosecco) -BONE MARROW!!! The drink was really good and refreshing. It was still nice outside, so we ate outside after work one night. The drink is sweet & very lemony, so beware if you don't like those things! Like woah, I can't even believe I ate BONE MARROW! Seriously, people, why is this cool right now to eat? It came out in ACTUAL BONES! Stacked bones, with this gelatinous filling (the marrow) where you scoop it out with a tiny spoon and out spread it on your garlic bread. I just couldn't get over the consistancy or the big pile of animal bones sitting on my table!! The actual dinner was amazingly good. I ordered some sort of polenta covered meat ball and my friend ordered some sort of pasta dish with spicey meat. We both love meat so we both loved our dinner!
