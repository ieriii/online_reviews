Here's the deal with this place; they put a grill in the middle of your table and bring you raw seasoned meat and you grill it to your liking. They also server about 109 bowls of other foods and condiments that you didn't order as a side. Some are really good, some not so good and mainly I had no idea what most of this stuff was. There was some clear food of some sort...Seriuosly, clear as glass...and it was food...I assume it was some type of gelatin. But you have very little room on your table, that's how much shit they bring. Anyway, I took my parents there and I got the pork rib which was excellent my mom had one of the seasoned beef dishes which was good but not great...I would definitely order the pork rib over the beef. My dad got some fried fish I have never heard of before and he loved it and it was tasty. This is an entire fish that has been deep fried so if you don't like your food staring back at you, you may not want to order this. Once they finally took our order service was fast. I will definitely go back. It was surprisingly nice inside...At least nicer than I thought it would be for a strip mall....There were also a lot of Koreans eating there so in other words, this place has street cred.
