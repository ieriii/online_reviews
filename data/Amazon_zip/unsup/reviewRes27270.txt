If I was to rate this place purely based on the overall experience, it would be 5 stars because it was a really fun night. We took an out of town friend here based on a suggestion from a friend so it was a first time for all four of us. Our waiter was awesome - he was super friendly, very knowledgeable and dare I say, a rather entertaining fellow. He suggested that we all try the tasting menu to fully experience the menu as Chef Bowles intended it, so we took his advice. This restaurant is definitely meat-centric, so we were very intrigued to see what they would produce for a group consisting of 2 meat eaters,1 total vegetarian, and 1 pescatarian. Ironically, the pescatarian (me) and the vegetarian left the happiest. I wouldn't say that many of the dishes were *truly* mind blowing, but the fish main course that I had was exceptionally prepared. My meat eating companions did seem somewhat disappointed by their beef though. Our out of town friend was a chef from the Philippines, so we asked if they would allow us to see the kitchen for her benefit, and since it was a slow night, they obliged. That was really one of the highlights of the experience also - it was a gorgeous, immaculate kitchen and all the guys working back there were very nice and humored all of our questions, etc. Now, I am really not one to comment on price very often as I know that all good things usually come at a price. But, I really felt like this bill here was a little bit over the top, considering the food and very casual atmosphere. We only had 1 bottle of wine between us + 1 glass (I'm the lush) and the bill for 4 people + tip was about $550. I'm not sorry I went here, but I'm not sure that I'd return. There are more intriguing food experiences to be had for this price, but the service is great and it's probably worth a try if you have the $$$$ just based on the "fun factor" at least.
