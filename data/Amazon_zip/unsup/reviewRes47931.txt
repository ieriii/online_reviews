My husband and I dined here and thought it was awesome! We are foodies and go all over the country to experience different restaurants and we truly LOVED this restaurant. Christopher was great at the front and sent a shuttle to the hotel to get us and Scott was as an awesome help to the experience. I never give a restaurant 5 stars but the ambiance was fabulous and the food was better then all the other brazialian steakhouses I have been to. WE also ordered the seafood platter with lobster , crab, osters and clams that was equally as wonderful. Thanks Zed451...can't wait to go back to Chicago to go back again !!!
