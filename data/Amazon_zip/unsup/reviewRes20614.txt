I've been twice now and I really like the Gage. It is in Touristville, where I usually am not. We went the other night, pre-theatre (Yeah Animal Crackers!) and it was a great option. It happened to be Halloween night, and all the staff were in costume. I thought this was really charming and kind of personal in a weird way. Our server was a zombie, and very nice. I feel like I need to base my review on the location, because while some of the menu items and drinks have a higher price tag than I would normally pay, I think the Gage could actually get away with charging more based on location. Because we were going to the show, we didn't want to stuff ourselves, and we certainly weren't toting leftovers. Between myself, my hubby and my folks, we had two martinis and eight beers. (Ok that's kind of a lot.) My Hendricks martini was ginormous and deeeelish. Totally worth the 13 bucks. They have a thoughtful and decently priced beer list. I didn't check out the wine too much. We had the brie fondue, the mussels in vindaloo and the fried chicken livers to start. All VERY good. I could eat three baskets of those chicken livers. So yum. We split two entrees, the roasted chicken and the special, striped bass. Both were very good, juicy, not too salty, lovely sides, and a very pretty presentation considering they took it upon themselves to actually split the plates, which we did not request but really appreciated. Oh and I almost forgot! A side of roasted squash and bacon. Awesome! The noise level is high, and the tables are a little close where we sat, but again, it is touristville. If I'm in the neighborhood and need a go-to place, this is it.
