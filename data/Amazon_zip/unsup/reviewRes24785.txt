Theres a reason why this place is always packed and its because the food is really good.  Ive been to Barcelona and have tried different catalonian dishes and this to me is the closest you will ever get without flying to Spain. We ordered the following Braised Rabbit - Superb Garlic Shrimp - Good Mixed Ham - The kids will love this Scallop and Shrimp meatballs - nothing special we should have ordered another seafood dish like the halibut or the alaskan salmon Chorizo on sticks - it was ok too salty for my taste But the best dish was the Paella Valenciana, ive never had paella that was as good other than the one in Madrid. It says serves 4 but if ur ordering other stuff we found that this is more than enough. There was 6 of us and we had to take home some of it. Also theres a 45 min wait for this dish.  The prices are on the higher side compared to Cafe Iberico but the quality speaks for itself. I would go back to this restaurant just to have the Paella and to try other stuff. The only thing that I disliked about this place is our server, dunno his name but he wears glasses and acts like the stereotypical gay guy with diva attitude. Restaurants need to tell their servers that regardless of how upscale a restaurant is, servers need to serve their customers and that includes you Priscilla. If we werent a big group where tip was added onto the bill, I would have left a penny for this guy.
