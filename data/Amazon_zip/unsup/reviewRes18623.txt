I was very disappointed in this place. Rick Bayless, I always thought, would know his stuff, and he probably does, but the people who prepare the food here, not so much! Xoco was highly recommended by some friends in Chicago as well as Zagat, so it couldn't be bad, right? Sadly, it kind of was! I had the mushroom torta which was almost okay, with the exception that it was very, very bland. The bread was nice, but that was where it ended. To be certain, I don't expect their tortas to taste exactly like Mexican street sannies, but they were so far from it, they were almost...like...Subway. But at least you can count on all the crap Subway puts in their sandwiches to create an aura of taste, albeit nasty and fake. At Xoco, this did not happen. Their "Mexico City Style" hot choc is pretty darn good though. Keep in mind, however, that this place is small, and for some reason it gets very, very crowded. There was a line going out the door, almost to the corner. Overall, I do not recommend this place, especially not to vegetarians, and especially not to those who have actually eaten on the street in Mexico. There is a lot missing!
