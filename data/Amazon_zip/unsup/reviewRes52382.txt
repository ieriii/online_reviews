A little disappointed with the pizza, considering the expectations going in. Had a pepperoni deep dish, which tasted decent but definitely not worth the 45 minutes it took to make. Seated right away in the middle of the day, and service was friendly if not a little bit non-existent, which was disappointing considering they weren't even busy.
