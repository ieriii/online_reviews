I've been there couple times. I honestly think is very typical Chinatown restaurant but outside of Chinatown. I think the food is overpriced, but it seems that everyone else on the review didn't think so. I agree this is a great place for big crowd, the place is huge.I am not a big fan of duck (But I guess I have to tried it from here, since everyone talk about duck on their review.) so next time i am there, I am gona try their duck.
