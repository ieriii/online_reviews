Revolution Brewing Co. totally lived up to they hype! We were able to at least sample every beer on the menu, and they were all SO good! I love how hoppy many of the beers are -- yum! We ordered the bacon popcorn while we waited for our friends, and it was really yummy but waaaay too rich for two people though. We made it through maybe a quarter of the appetizer and had to stop -- it was just too much fat intake for us at one time. For lunch, our table ordered two of the pulled pork sandwiches, one margherita pizza, and one goat cheese salad. The salad was good but nothing special, the pizza looked yummy and my friend enjoyed it, and the pulled pork sandwich was delicious! The sandwich was definitely a winner and something I would highly recommend to fellow diners. We will for sure be back!
