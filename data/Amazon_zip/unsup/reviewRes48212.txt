Sunday brunch at the Publican is a fantastic culinary experience that everyone should partake in at least once in their life. I know I'm just jumping on the band wagon here but wanted to write my own shout outs to the corn/grits/kale (BRAISED KALE FOR THE WIN) combination to the pork shoulder, the bacon (yum) and the waffle which is so unbelievably light and fluffy...they should name clouds after it. The wait staff was attentive, the environs of the restaurant very harking back to the meat market days of Chicago and since we were four, the booth we sat in with the doors (which in retrospect may be like holding pens for not yet killed animals but whatever) all contributed all in all to an unforgettable brunch.
