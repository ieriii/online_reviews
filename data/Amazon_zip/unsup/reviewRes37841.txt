There's not much not to like about Hopleaf. Now that I've got that double-negative intro out of the way, I'll get to the details. In a nutshell, the main appeal of Hopleaf is the variety of their high-quality craft brews they have on tap. Great IPAs, Stouts, Ales, all that good stuff. Additionally, they also have a unique and tasty dinner menu as well. The fact that they have quail on the menu really sold me on this place, as it is very hard to find and always hits the spot. They also make a damn good briskett entree too, which I indulged in last night. I usually pass up briskett when I see it b/c there's usually ribs to choose from, but since Hopleaf doesn't serve ribs, I went the briskett route and was not disappointed. Made me forget how much I miss briskett. For those of you who are not carnivores, they also make a very good CB&J sandwich, which is my girlfriends favorite, and according to her, one of the best sandwiches ever made. It seems to be a customer favorite as well. You, the Yelp reader, may have also read reviews about Hopleaf that it is usually incredibly crowded and damn difficult to get a table if you show up during peek hours. I am not here to dispell those rumors, but I do have a bit of advice. If you don't want to wait 1 hour+ for a table, and 10 min+ to order a drink from the bar, then don't show up at 7:00 on a Fri or Sat night. It's like Yogi once said: "nobody's goes there, it's too crowded". I learned my lesson the first time I showed up at 7:00 on a Sat night, and waited damn near 2 hours for a table. Since then, I haven't shown up after 6:00 for dinner, and as a result, I've never had to wait for a table. Nothing wrong with an early dinner every once and while, especially if the incentive is great food/beer in a cool atmosphere.
