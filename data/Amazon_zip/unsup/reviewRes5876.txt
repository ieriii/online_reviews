in search of a delightful treat of baked french onion soup (bowl), I was transferred into a place for the Irish women called "heaven". i had been seated at the "martini lounge" (1 for dinner so to speak). also enjoyed the chopped salad. it had a citrus vinegarette dressing freshly mixed into a delight of blended chopped veggies such as lettuce, onions, corn, guacamole, diced chicken, (i minused the blue cheese), YUM-O! b/w 5pm-6:30pm M-F & after 9pm M-F you can receive 1/2 off $ appetizers!!! The brie cheese appetizer I hear is a Winner((per Charlie Sheen). The total price of my meal was $16. I thought it was a steal considering excellence in food quality and customer service by my server who was extremely helpful in my food choices. Always accept the bread and butter that's offered to you. It is warm bread, so delicious!
