Hella MalakasPambo has been gradually working out his liver to get ready for the annual Whiskey Fest. One must train if going to indulge and turn a profit at this event. Since Pambo a live in Pilsen and Mexican food may be God's best hangover gift, Pambo declare Taco y Burrito Week! DO IT NOW! DO IT! Eat as much Mexican as possible and don't be afraid of what Anthony Bourdain refers to as the nasty bits. Make sure to check out Pambo's other reviews as I will search for Chi Town's best Mex just for you my lovely and beautiful Yelpers, Opah!My parnter in crime for this event will be 80's legendary Chicago musician, Vic Vacuum. For those Vacuum virgins, Vic all 450# of him is an eating machine, Ozzy Guillen would refer to him as one giant Pirr on na. A monument to American comsumption.This place was Vic's first choice and quite honestly while pretty good Pambo was underwhelmed. The keys to Mexican is flavor. Flavor and FRESH made tortillas, and sauces so deep and spicy with flavor they brutilize that Thirsty Mongoloid hang-over right out of you. Let me say it again Nuevo Leon is good, but Pambo searching for something with that little extra, stay tuned. Feliz Taco y Burrito Week!
