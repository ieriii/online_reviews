excellent. very crowded though. ended up walking over to eat somewhere else b/c it was so crowded. that said, it didn't taste too different than other good deep dish pizza i'd had in other cities - there was nothing about being in chicago or this particular place that somehow made it even better. i was also by myself and in chicago for 24 hours, so that might have had something to do with it.
