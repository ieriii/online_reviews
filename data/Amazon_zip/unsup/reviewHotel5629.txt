I was there for a sales meeting last week and left the big conference room in a hurry! When I got home, I worked from home for the next two days. As I was getting ready for a party Saturday night, I couldn't find my makeup bag. I started to PANIC! I called O'Hare, my friends and the Westin. Bianca McMillian from the security team called me back within the day- she had my bag!!! She happily packed it up and sent it back! Thank you Bianca!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
