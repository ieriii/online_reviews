Off the bat, this is not a place to take date, if you are concerned about getting to know her, or actually talking to her without having her say what? several times. Yes it's damn loud, and yes its also unreasonably loud, and I don't even mind loudness lol, so that should be pretty telling to anyone that knows me. That being said, the loudness detracts from everything in the place, i mean the waitresses can't even hear you, like tone it down a few notches, i doubt anyone will think any less of you Lockdown! The food is good, burgers are the specialty here, as you will see, and if you can get past the obnoxious loudness of this place, you will recognize that the service is also very good, friendly and attentive, and it definitely gets Lockdown at least 3-3.5 stars. The burgers are NOT Kumas, nor would i even make the comparison The atmosphere, aside from the volume is actually pretty cool, kind of an eclectic vibe with tons of TV's playing the same loud rock concert, i even asked if their were other people living in the building cause i felt sorry for them, its almost like living above the double door must be, but apparently the owner of Lockdown owns the building so thats good. Summing it up, good food and service, but relaxing with somebody or a group trying to talk? Not happening
