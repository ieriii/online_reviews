I totally love this place.  For starters it reeks of cool! The decor is from the 30s and 40s, which was an era that spelled style with a capital S. The music is fabulous - we've seen a variety of bands here including a rare performance by Harry Connick Jr. , who is even better looking in person, and Lavay Smith & Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers. We also love the Sunday Night Poetry Slams hosted by Marc Smith, who is a truly great performer and poet.
