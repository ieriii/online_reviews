Just ordered a pizza from here, which I've done a couple of times already. Unfortunately, this time, the person who took my order was incredibly rude, and so was the delivery driver. When I opened up my pizza, there was cheese on it, despite the fact that the first thing I said when I ordered it was no cheese. When I called them back, the guy who picked up said that there was nothing they could do since the original guy who took my order never wrote that down. This is ridiculous. YOU messed up, not me. Why should I pay for something that I didn't order? They were unwilling to fix the mistake, so now I have to call the owner in the morning. This is insane. Aren't you supposed to make the customer happy??? I will NOT be ordering from here ever again.
