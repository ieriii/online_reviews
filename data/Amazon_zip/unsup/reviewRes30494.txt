I had heard many things about Nana and have been meaning to check it out for quite sometime. Living in the Bridgeport neighborhood I was eager to see what all the fuss was about, and I love that this restaurant has brought visitors and popularity to our neighborhood. I took my cousin here who was visiting the United States for the Summer from Ireland. She had spent most of her time on the East Coast in Boston, Cape Cod, and New York, and immediately told me she missed the food from home, and did not like American food as much..... Nana, is everything it is cracked up to be!! The decor is adorable with a very contemporary (hardwood floor and exposed brick) lofty feel.  The food was amazing, My cousin and I ordered the Lemon Pound Cake French Toast with Raspberry Mousse sauce and the Biscuits and Gravy with Duck (sounds bizarre but a great mix). My cousin told me this was the best breakfast she had in the United States. We loved everything. We enjoyed complimentary muffins and berries sent out my Pastry Chef Amy :) We even brought home our leftovers and enjoyed them later. Can't wait to go back. Very inexpensive for the quality of food. Great place for breakfast, brunch or lunch!
