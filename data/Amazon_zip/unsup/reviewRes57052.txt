Alright...I generally like this place, so good things first...Their pizza really is EXCELLENT!Large pies, thin crust, fresh toppings...all you'd ask for.Some of their home made beer is also pretty good.Now to the things that have p... me off the last times I went:The staff is not nearly as friendly as they used to be. If I wait for a table for almost 2 hours, I don't want to be yelled at by the staff for standing in their way close to the bar...Which leads to No.2 and 3 of my recent complains:This place is just too crowded and way too loud! When there are approx. 200 people in your venue (mostly in larger groups) eating pizzas, drinking beer, talking...why would you turn up the music THAT loud?So don't go here if you want to actually talk with your friends/group.If you decide to go, to grap some of that great pizza, just make sure you bring plenty of time. Even with a reservation for a group of 12 we had to wait for hour table for 45 mins a while ago...3*** only because I REALLY like their pizza and keep coming back for it!
