We were there Oct. 8th. Wonderful food and atmosphere. Andrew our waiter was great and very personable. He wished us a happy anniversary and tended to us as if we were his only table. Steak was as promised, very tender and flavorful. We will be coming back! Great place for couples and groups of people. A little pricey(hence the special occasion) but worth it. Keep it up Ruth Chris!
