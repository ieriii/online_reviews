Apparently, the city of Chicago is on crazy pills when it comes to their Italian food. Yes, I've said it before and I'm going to say it again. This place reeks of cheesiness. Why does every Italian place I go to on suggestion of friends just end up terribly? I hate when people use superlatives to describe every single restaurant with absolutely no basis for comparison and Davanti falls into that category. "OMG It's amazing, the best, the absolute top.." - Uh, really homie? You've obviously never been to Italy.. I'll even take Sbarros over this. They were out of 4 or 5 things we wanted to order. Regarding what we did order: they didn't tell my girlfriend that her pizza was going to have an egg plopped in the middle of it. Moreover, it wasn't even properly cooked and it was runny. What?? How is that Italian?? I'm okay with some really over easy eggs, but why did you have to crack an egg on my perfectly good pizza and then not even cook it a tiny bit??? My boyfriend could essentially order only one type of pasta - bolognese - since they were out of everything else. Uh, gag me - it was super boring. If I order an Italian staple, I expect the fact that it's simple to make it shine. It should be amazing. It wasn't. Our appetizers - we had the asparagus and the salumi platter. The asparagus: it was a bit cruchier than I think "al dente" should be. The chef obviously phoned it in when it came to sauteeing the vegetables.. Wow, I'm getting angry even as I write this.
