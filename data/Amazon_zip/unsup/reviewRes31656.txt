Went to Nana today for the first time, after seeing good reviews on Yelp. After walking in, I was almost positive I'd love it - it was half-full of customers at 2pm. The waiter and waitress were cute as can be. The coffee ($3) was delicious (but I was almost out before the waitress came by to refill it) - and the cream comes in a little metal pitcher! Breakfast items are served until 3pm, perfect for a late riser like myself. I had the stuffed french toast ($10), it came with a little cup of whipped cream with a raspberry on top, and all in all the presentation was beautiful. Delicious, too! I ate every last bit and was perfectly satisfied. They were playing oldies, which just added to the ambiance. I will be back, with friends, and hopefully I'll become a regular!
