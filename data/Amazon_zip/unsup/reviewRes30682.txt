Ok here is the breakdown, impeccable service, good food, great desserts and dark romantic atmosphere. We went here for our one year wedding anniversary and it turned out to be a good choice. Yes it overpriced but for special occasions I think you can look past that. Look to spend about $45-$95 on entree alone.  I ordered my steak med well because I am 6 months pregnant but realized that it was closer to med rare, we notified our waiter and he took it off bill. My husband called to make a reservation and they called the morning of to confirm and also called a day after to ask about our experience there nice touch. We had to order the butter cake and when they brought it out they threw in a huge slice of chocolate cake and wrote happy anniversary in chocolate on the platter! The butter cake was amazing!!! Wow! And the chocolate cake was served with a huge side of fresh thick whipped cream. Heaven. FYI the scallop potatoes were so so and the cheese used was a tad bitter so I'd skip it. The chopped salad was delicious as was the bacon wrapped filet mignon and scallops. The array of bread that try I've you when seated is also yummy. I'd definitely return for another special occasion and am still thinking of that buttercake!!!
