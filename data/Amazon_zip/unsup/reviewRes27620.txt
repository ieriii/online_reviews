Bottomline: Nice bar atmosphere, good beer, nice overall buzz. The pizza is fine. The carmelized cheese perimeter and sauce are excellent, but the rest is lacking. I understand its a deep dish, but it is entirely too doughy. If the whole top were carmelized we'd be having a different conversation.  I would go back, but I've had better pizza for sure.
