Reader's Digest Summary: I've been here twice now. I came a second time, wanting to give this place a fair shake because I've seen how well-reviewed it is and thought my first visit was an anomaly. The verdict: Very average for the price. Food was either overly salted or generally bland. Service is inconsistent. For the prices you're paying, you have much better options. If you want good Italian nearby, I recommend Caro Mio (a fantastic BYOB Italian restaurant in Ravenswood). Full Review: I'm not a prolific Yelp reviewer. I'm too lazy to review places unless something warrants mention. To wit: Anteprima. First Visit: With guests in town, we (party of 4) stopped in for what we thought would be a nice dinner. After all, this place has been well reviewed and isn't considered cheap Italian food. Collectively, our group was disappointed with the service and the food. The service bordered on rude and standoffish. Our best efforts to be affable and sincere went unrequited. The food was even worse. One of the pasta dishes we had could've been submitted to Hell's Kitchen with Gordon Ramsey. The other dishes left us all wanting. We joked that we should've stayed home and made dinner ourselves. Second visit: My wife and I went recently, ready to give this place another chance. I will admit, the service was much better. However, the food was mediocre. I had the tuna-wrapped prosciutto. If I'm paying $23 for a special it should deliver. I'm not even expecting greatness. Just good, passable Italian food (which is setting the bar fairly low). This didn't. For something wrapped in prosciutto, you'd be hard-pressed to mess that up. My wife got two small portions of two pastas. One was salty, the other boring. I won't go into the details of pasta. Who cares, it's pasta and I'm already going long on this review. We've had better. Save your time.
