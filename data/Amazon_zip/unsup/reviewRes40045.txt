Prior to my visit to this restaurant, I heard that it was fantastic from several people. It is. The food is great, the ambiance is warm and the bloody marys are fabulous. When we initially came in the host told us there was an hour wait so that seemed like a no brainer to go somewhere else. Thankfully, before we walked out we asked the host if we could sit at the bar which she was said was fine. I guess I just wonder why she did not offer it to us in the first place. Anyhow, it was great other than that. The bartenders moved quickly, were really nice and made tasty drinks. My friends and I tried the chicken and waffles, wild board sloppy joes and some sort of egg scramble thing--they were all so good! All in all it was a great experience for me and I will definitely go back!
