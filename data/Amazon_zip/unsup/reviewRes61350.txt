Slippin!  Just went here the other night with some friends, I was craving the Ropa Viejo that I had last time but it was not the same. The overall experience was...... AH-just ok. The service was just "alright" and the food was mixed all around. Even the empanadas, which I was really looking forward to, were soggy and kind of bland.
