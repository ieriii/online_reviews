I really loved the pizza here, my guy not so much. He said it was like eating "air" pizza. My friend and I enjoyed Spacca's pizzas. They are authentic and it's nice to try how pizza is supposed to taste in Italy. They put minimal toppings on their pies. We shared a couple of pizzas, the tomato basil and the sausage pizza. They barely put sauce on their pizza and I like a saucy pizza! Their wine serving could be a tad bit more generous. They serve it to you in a tiny juice glass. Get here early on a Friday night or you could be waiting forever! Ask to be seated outdoors on the patio. It gets very warm and loud because it's a small restaurant.
