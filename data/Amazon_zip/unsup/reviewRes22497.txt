Lao Sze Chuan is one the places my friends always go to. I like it a whole lot better than Joy Yee's. At Lao Sze Chuan you are never disappointed from lack of flavor, though most things come out similar in flavor, a.k.a. spicy and maybe salty. Poor service is to be expected in Chicago's Chinatown. But the food is worth a half hour wait, though I wouldn't have the patience to wait much longer than that.
