I've only been here once, but I'll definitely be returning! The place is comfy, the food was great, and the service was good! It's much better priced than Karyn's and the service is a thousand times better! I was a little sad they were out of the vegan cheesecake, but mousse cake made me forget about that entirely. I had the chick'n parmesan sandwich which was very tasty and HUGE, I could only eat half so I was happy to take the rest home for the next day! Our server was really nice, I'm not the kind of person to be freaked out about them sitting down at your table to take your order. Over all, skip Karyn's and go here for food that is just as good without all the pretentious bs.
