So I've been here a few times and it's alright. Not superb but just alright.  The interior is great with it's nice long undulating bar. The space is also divided nicely but I must say that it is unusually loud. It was a Wednesday night and while there was a lot of people in the place it shouldn't have had been so loud that I had to yell the bartender my order, which he couldn't even hear. After the second attempt I pointed at the drink I wanted. I believe this to be a huge design flaw, there really should be some soft surfaces to capture some of this noise. On to the service; my bartender was attentive and nice. When he left I had another ask if I needed anything. I felt taken care of at the bar. The service in the dining room could use some improvement. We had forgotten utensils and a request to leave off a condiment which was there on the plate when the dish arrived. We had to wave down the server on more than one occasion, which is one too many. The water boys, on the other hand were attentive, this is a nice touch. It just showed me that while the water guys were paying attention to what was happening on our table, the server had no clue. We had to ask for the bill about 15 minutes after we had finished eating.  The food: the food is good but it isn't excellent. This last time I was at Gage was January 2008. I've been traveling so when I came here a year and a half later I expected to see some changes to the menu. Not so. There wasn't any marked change nor was the food any better but rather, it was just OK. They had a good thing going when they first got started but their standard seems to have dropped. I hope this changes.
