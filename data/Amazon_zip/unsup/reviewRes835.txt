I know this is a favorite for carnivores. But, I would like to add that their veggie dog is much better than any I've had, including the diner-style-counter at Whole Foods. Hot Doug's will also substitute the veggie dog on a specialty option. I had one with smoked gouda and blackberry mustard. The french fries were great. It was worth the 45 minute wait in near nineties heat. (I have never been there when there was not a line half way down the block.)
