Was a bit worried after reading reviews, but turned out to be great. I picked this place after it was recommended by friends, it was my boyfirend's birthday (a foodie) and heard longman & eagle had an impressive menu. We got there on a Sunday night around 6:30 and were told our wait would be 5-10 minutes, which we were THRILLED about since we heard we could wait up to 2 hours to be seated. They asked for our IDs at the door, which I found a bit odd. 10 minutes later the hostess tried to seat us right by the door, which we politely refused, and she really sweetly got us a great table near the back only 5 minutes later. Our waiter was your typical nonchalent hipster, not overly friendly or helpful but very efficient, got the job done. There were a handful of girls who brought us samples, brought dishes out, asked if we needed anything- they were pleasant and added to the atmosphere. The FOOD was PHENOMENOL.Drinks: He got an Old Fashioned, I got something named Daisy-? and both were fabulous. Appetizers: Melon & Fig salad, Ricotta Gnuddi, Soft Pretzel. Entrees: Pork shank with cheese grits and sauteed spinach, Beef with Lobster. Perfect portions for two, the food was quite rich so I wouldn't have wanted a bigger plate. I would definetly go here again! It's great if you are in the mood for some exotic plates. Atmosphere was fun, felt like you were some southern, Civil-war era restaurant. Menus/decor/branding is very chic. Give it a shot.
