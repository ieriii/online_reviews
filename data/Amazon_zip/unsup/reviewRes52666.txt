I received 2 comp dinners for Brazzaz, I had reservations at 9 PM on 3-11-2011. Place wasn't crowed. We went in and they gave us our table, our waiter, again, Jonathan took great care of us, he was friendly, polite, and made sure he had what we needed. The meat was tender, juicy, and just DELICIOUS! However, I do have to say from experience that Brazzaz needs to work on handling bigger crowds, other than that, my experience was excellent!!!
