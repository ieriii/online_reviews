Come here for quality, authentic Italian pizza and a good selection of southern Italian/Sicilian/Sardinian wines by the glass. I love restaurants that offer unique Italian wines instead of the standard chianti/pinot grigio picks. I agree with the other Yelper who said this is the best Naples-style pizza in Chicago! My husband and I ate here this past weekend after having wanted to do so for some time. He is first generation Italian and I have lived and traveled extensively in Italy, so we're pretty tough critics when it comes to Italian food. This pizza is very similar to what you find in Naples (THE city for pizza). Extremely thin crust, fresh ingredients, and just the right amount of cheese. I had the margherita (red sauce, fior di latte mozzarella and basil) and added arugula because I LOVE arugula on pizza. They charged me $1.50 for it, but I guess that's the way it goes. My husband had the diavola (spicy salami, buffala mozzarella, red sauce and pepperoncino flakes), which was awesome. We had friendly and prompt service. Will definitely be back. Just wish I didn't live so far away!
