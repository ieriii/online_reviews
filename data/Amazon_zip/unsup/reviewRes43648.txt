On a recent visit to wicker park, my husband and i stopped at the Milk and Honey Cafe. We stopped by in the early afternoon and the place was slammed. Being somewhat intimidated, we turned around and walked out. However, after visiting a few more stores we decided to head back and give it another shot and im glad we did. I had the Avocado, Smoked Gouda, Romaine and Tomato with Cracked Mustard and Turkey on Multigrain Bread. I love avocado and if you do too, you should definitely get this sandwhich.  My husband got the Smoked Turkey Reuben with Sauerkraut, Swiss and Dressing on Rye and he was happy. If i lived in Chicago, Id definitely venture to this Cafe often, especially after visiting the Handmade Renegade store next door. Seems like a great spot to hang out and chat with some friends.
