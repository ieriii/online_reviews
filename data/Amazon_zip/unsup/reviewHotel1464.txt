We're Chicago suburbanites but decided to stay overnight one weekend after snagging a fairly decent deal on Priceline. Omni is literally right on Michigan Avenue (although it's probably better if you get a room that doesn't face Michigan Avenue for noise reduction). Very ideally located if you intend to shop on the Mag Mile. It's a beautiful hotel, although the lobby/reception is technically on the 3rd floor so you have to take 2 elevators to get to your hotel room. Not a biggie but during busy times, you'll wait a long time for an elevator. It is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated and very clean. No bed bugs issues either! LOL. Bed was pretty comfortable. Bath amenities are nothing to write home about, but it is a clean, decent bathroom.  We had room 1118, and it is a bit of a bizarre L-shaped room. Didn't really seem like a suite to me, and the bed didn't seem separate from the living area space. it wasn't a huge room as some other reviewers reported and we only had one flat screen TV, so maybe we didn't get a true suite. But it is still a nice room. hey have a nice turn-down service, too. But maybe we got 1118 because that's the Priceline special. Only two complaints I have are these: (1) Parking (valet) costs $49. There goes the bargain we got on Priceline. (2) The bed in 1118 shares the same wall as the bathroom in the next room. So whenever the people in the next room go to the bathroom or turn on their shower, that noise blares in your ear. Loud as hell. Every time they ran their shower or used the toilet, we heard them. Also, there is a hell of a lot of door slamming. Too bad they can't do something to soften the sound of the door.
