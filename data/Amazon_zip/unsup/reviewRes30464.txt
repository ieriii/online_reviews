Had a saturday night dinner with the girls here....perfect ambiance for us. Sushi rolls were creative and the atmosphere definitely inspired us to drink, laugh and feel like the pretty girls we are. (Cocky statement, I know, but true.) Rock Shrimp Tempura was a big hit, so much that we got two orders for the table. I had the Lobster and Wagyu roll and the Scorpion roll, both fresh and wonderful. Someone in our group ordered Pad Thai with Chicken and said it was really good, but I did not taste it myself. However, as this person is a picky eater, I believe it had to be in order to pass her test. I had two Polynesian Storms and they were great...very fresh and invigorating....I cannot wait to go back for lunch and try other items when the cost isn't as expensive...but still worth it.
