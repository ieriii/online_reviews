Eh. Not the place to go if you like real, honest sushi. I was really excited to try Coast after seeing "Check Please." My husband and I were a little disappointed, I hate to say, since I really wanted to love this place. It just felt very average. We yearned for fresh sashimi and innovative roles, but it seemed every maki roll contained either fried fish and/or way too much panko ("crunchies"). The food was decent, and the atmosphere tries to be club-ish. Didn't hate it, but didn't love it either. BYOB was a plus in my book though.
