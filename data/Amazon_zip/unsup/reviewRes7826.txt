I so wanted to give this place more than three stars. I had heard their thin crust pizza was magnificent...well, it was not. It was doughy and chewy. thin and light in the middle, edges and crusts chewy and half cooked. Some of the pizzas were better than others...avoid anything with more than two cheeses in it. The pizzas I tasted with fresh basil, tomato, and mushroom, and one cheese were good. A guest in our party turned into an obnoxious wine snob at the start of meal, and perhaps tainted my experience. May her and her uber sensitive nostrils and palate go to wine hell. Watching her preen and strut around the wine list was exhausting. BIG huge kudos to our server. She rocked the meal, and the unfortunate bitch I dined with. Her maroon hair and patience were born of this world...bless her! Hmmm, 4 star food, 2 star company. I'll try Spacca Napoli again, by myself. Cheers again to the gal who served us. She was sharp, cute, and should be on a reality TV show near YOU soon.
