So, I went on a chicken crawl with some friends, hit up 4 different wing places in Chicago and this was our favorite. Huge wings, and the sauce had just the right amount of heat. We got Spicy Garlic and something else. The server said that the two were very similar, and they were. And both still delicious. Will be trying a the place again for trivia night.
