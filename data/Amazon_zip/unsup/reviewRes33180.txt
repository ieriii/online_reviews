I do not go to Yolk on weekends. I repeat I do not go to Yolk on weekends. I walk by Yolk. I see the lines. I am grateful that I live around the corner and am able to make a weekday visit so no hour+ long waits. It is pure insanity if you come say around 10 am on a Sunday, so just be prepared with a good book or a friend to keep you occupied during the wait. That being said...it's a big menu with lots of great treats. I rarely order it because it's so filling (and fattening), but by far my fave item is the banana bread french toast which comes with a side of peanut butter to slather on top. Pure decadence. If I'm in the eggy mood I'll opt for the West Coast crepes - scrambled eggs, avocado and mushrooms stuffed into sweet crepes. Double bonus? Yolk now brews Metropolis coffee!!
