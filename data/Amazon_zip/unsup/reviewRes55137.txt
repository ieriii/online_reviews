I have heard nothing but great things about Chicago q. So i had to try it. And I'm sorry to say, I did not enjoy them. I loved the chips and tea, but other than that, I will not go back. The food was bland to me and my family. Maybe its because we are black and we are used to bbq tasting a certain way.? I don't know. This food is perfect for a diabetic. Seriously the chicken wings were good. But the pork chop, and ribs were not good. And i absolutely hated the mac n cheese...... Yuck. Bland, bland, bland. A no-no for me.
