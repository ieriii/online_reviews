It seems I'm a bit late to review this restaurant but after such an amazing dinner why not add another 5 star rating. My date and I started the evening with a wonderful bottle of wine and the chefs selection of 12 oysters. The Oysters seemed very fresh and were presented with a wonderful description of each. Ok so I waited so long to finish my review I just need to summarize and say wow!! Lol I still think about this place and can't wait to return. For me, my to three are Girl and the goat, Naha and The Publican. Mmm sweet breads ;-)
