This is my all time favorite bar! The beer is fantastic and the food is great! I have never been in the back part of the restaurant due to the fact that everybody in your party has to order food but I have heard that's really nice and they have a great beer garden! I know the front part of the bar is always loud and the tables are always full but that is what makes this place exciting. You have to always be on the look out for a free table and race to claim it. I love the environment here it's truly a classic bar. Check it out!
