This review is based on my experience when I visited in October. It was Saturday, and we were celebrating a friend's birthday, plus, we were tourists of Chicago...thusly, it was easy to crack some jokes, laugh and (*gasp!*) have a little fun. That being said, we were nowhere near acting in any sort of inappropriate way. However, the doorman made it quite clear that such light-hearted behavior was unwelcome. We were told SEVERAL times (i.e.-we were berated like children) not to be loud once inside, or we would be kicked out...and this was after being made to pay $12 to get in. So once we walk inside, we find people packed in like sardines with no place to sit down that isn't already occupied, and everyone around us talking casually over the jazz musicians on stage.  I'm sorry? Did I miss something? Long story short, we left. I could give this place the benefit of the doubt and just chalk it up to being the weekend, but that doesn't excuse the doorman's rudeness. It may be a better place to go to on a weeknight, but for $12--I thought it was overrated.
