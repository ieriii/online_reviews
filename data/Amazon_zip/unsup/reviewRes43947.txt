newbies to Milk & Honey may find it mildly daunting - it's quite hectic in there. that is no reason not to go though! follow these simple tips, repeat, and before long you'll get the flow without the fluster: 1. after avoiding anyone trying to exit as you open the door to enter, pause, look both ways for oncoming traffic, and then proceed to any empty spot about 5 feet from the doorway. 2. wait for a host(ess) to ask how many are in your party and take a number-place-holder-thingy. 3. turn to your left to review the chalk board menus, scan seated diners' plates, peek into the salad refrigerator, and then stand in the line behind the cash register/order-taker person (often 4 groups deep, leaving you just where you started at #1). 4. watch your elbows as other patrons and servers maneuver through the line with cups of coffee and plates of food... all while your stummy grumbles and you change your mind about what you want to order 3x. 5. be ready to order as your turn approaches. 6. place your order and pay. 7. turn to your right, make a quick left, and gather utensils and glasses of water. coffee (intelly), tea, and juice will be served to you as you hang out near the open kitchen and salivate some more. 8. when the host(ess) calls your number, follow and sit at your assigned table with cups, glass, and utensils in hand. visibly place your number-place-holder-thingy on your table. 9. server will bring your food and take the number-place-holder-thingy. 10. eat and enjoy!
