A co-worker suggested Bongo Room and I am so happy we tried it! It's a little on the smaller side, and the only reason why I did not give the rating 5 stars was because we waited almost an hour. The food is creative and amazing, as busy as they were, our server Adam never forgot to check on us. We'll be back again, this time we'll try to beat the crowd!
