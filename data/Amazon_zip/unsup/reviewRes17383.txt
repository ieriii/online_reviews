I can be a fairly adventurous eater (Except for meat. I play it safe with meat.) but for some reason until recently I never had Indian food. India House is near my work and was my first taste of the cuisine. I've had lunch here several times and always for the lunch buffet. I love it. They have a great selection which changes slightly from day to day. The service is usually good although a couple times I had some issues getting my waiter's attention. I have only been to one other Indian restaurant so I can't really compare it to others, but this food seems top notch to me. And here's a tip: don't forget the rice pudding stuff and mango ice cream mixed together for dessert. Alone they are good. Together they are really, really good.
