I have been to SSGS many times before but I am not planning on going back. One night after me and my friends have a reunion, 14 of us go to San Soo Gab San at around 2am. There are lots of people eating inside, I ask the female waitress if they have a table of 14 available. She then she starts complaining in Korean to the other employees. But says yes that we have a table. As the waitress takes our order she starts rushing us. Some of my friends who had never had Korean food were asking her about the food and ingredients and then she started to complain and started becoming very rude to us we felt very disrespected. Then when she took the order of the last 2 people in our group my friends said they weren't going to eat. The waitress all of a sudden screams at the and says "If you aren't eating here then go out!" At this point we all had enough and just got up and left. I'm never going back nor recommending people to that place again.
