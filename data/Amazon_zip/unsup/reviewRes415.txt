Holy CRAP.... We had the 12 course and boy was I surprised. For the first time I had dinner using ALL of my senses. Presentation was on a whole other level, you'd never think to mix soy sauce with chocolate?! Service was very attentive and at the end of the night.... I was in heaven. We spent a good 10 mins staring into the kitchen....they've got a gazillion and one ppl working the line. By the way, when you first walk in, it's like boarding the space ship on star trek (oh yes, the doors slide open)...crazy!
