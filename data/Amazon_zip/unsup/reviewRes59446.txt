I gave the place four stars, but it's really more like 4-1/2. We were all very impressed with Giordano's. After spending princely sums on restaurants in Chicago and getting, well, not what we felt was our money's worth, this fine pizzeria was a breath of fresh air. The service was excellent, even though the place was packed, the pizza and appetizers we got were hot and very good. I'm not a deep-dish pizza lover, but I had some of my daughter's and I wished I had ordered it. Even so, the "thin" crust pizza my son and I shared was superb and more than enough for the both of us, plus some for a doggy bag. The final tab, less tip, for six people was $72. That's one of the least expensive meals we had in Chicago, and easily the tastiest. I highly recommend Giordano's.
