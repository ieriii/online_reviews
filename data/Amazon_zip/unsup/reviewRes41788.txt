Oh. My. Goodness. My dinner at Ruth's Chris was one of the best meals I've eaten. Absolutely phenomenal--pure eating bliss! My mouth is watering from remembering the dinner and thinking about this review. First, we had drinks at the bar - the bartenders were very nice and the drinks poured generously. A great start! For a salad, my boyfriend and I split a Caesar and it was perfect - fresh, cold and crispy romaine topped with amazing freshly grated parmesan. The other couple we were with split a wedge salad and they loved it. For dinner, we all had filet - I ordered the petit filet with shrimp. YUM! My plate came out hot with bubbling butter at the bottom of a perfectly cooked steak. Such a treat! For sides, we ordered sweet potato casserole (I HIGHLY recommended this), broccoli with cheese, and lyonnaise potatoes - all delicious but the sweet potatoes were definitely my favorite. I'm pretty sure that I didn't say much besides "Mmmm...Mmmm....MMM!" the entire time I was eating! The service was also spectacular - our server had a great sense of humor and we had a lot of fun joking with him. This was an absolutely perfect evening!!
