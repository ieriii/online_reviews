Shockingly, this place has really fast table turn. Even on a busy Sunday morning, I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. The menu is very large and definitely is a crowd pleaser The coffee is some of the best in town. They also have plenty of lunch items on the menu if you're not a breakfast-heavy brunch person. The decor is modern but not pretentious. Check it out.
