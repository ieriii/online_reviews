So, everything in Downtown Chicago closes really early? My husband and I were visiting Chicago from LA and did not realize that if we waited to eat dinner until 9:30 pm, we'd be in major trouble. THE GAGE TO THE RESCUE. Stumbled upon it because it seemed to be the only thing still open, have never been happier with an accidental discovery. The food was amazing, the vibe is great - but I'm writing this review because we had, hands down, the best waiter I have ever had in my life. This guy was the pro to end all pros. Dear waiter who served me & my husband two venison burgers at 10 pm a week ago, please never leave your job. You made our experience fantastic. You are a diamond in an industry of coal.
