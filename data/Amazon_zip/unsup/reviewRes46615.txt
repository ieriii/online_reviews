It's never easy to find a place where everyone in my family will eat. Sister's a vegetarian, mom can't stand the smell of garlic (so no Italian), dad is cheap and won't go anywhere fancy, and me, well...I'll eat just about anything. So when I moved into my new apartment down the street my parents were pleased to see that I lived so close to RJ Grunt's. THE ORIGINAL LETTUCE ENTERTAIN YOU they screamed! Apparently they had come here yeeeears ago when they were dating in the city. The menu is huge and they have just about everything under the sun. I have yet to try these nachos that everyone seems to be raving about but I have been very satsified with my chicken fingers and California chicken wrap. My mom always sticks with the Mr.Chicken sandwich. My sister (the fish eating vegetarian) enjoyed the fish tacos, but not the corn tortillas. They've got Blue Moon on tap which always keeps me happy and the service is pretty good. It gets crowded in there since it's a small place and the tiny women's bathroom has one stall and enough standing room for 2 other people. Yikes!
