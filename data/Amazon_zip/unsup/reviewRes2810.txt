I went to TRU with my girlfriend on her birthday last year and the experience was definitely mixed. The staff is over-the-top and, in my opinion, obnoxious. If you get up they come over, fold up your napkin, remove it, and bring you a new one with tongs. My girlfriend got a DRIP of sauce on the table and they immediately swarmed her, picked up her plate, put down a napkin, straightened it, wiped off the plate, and put it back down - all without saying a word! Jesus christ, chill out! As for the food, our main courses of lamb and beef were quite good. My scallop appetizer wasn't that impressive, I think my girlfriend had bone marrow ravioli which was great. The desserts were good, but I expected to be blown away and I definitely was not. I had a good time there but for what it cost I would not go back.
