i'm a hot doug's zealot. i've waited in line for 20 minutes or up to two hours and it's been worth it every time. doug is a classy and friendly guy. i recommend: the crawfish and pork sausage, the duck and foie gras, the rabbit, and the duck fat fries! you get free refills on soda. fun and iconic place to bring friends from out of town.
