I liked this place a lot.... was on a pub crawl with the girls,on a quest for cute men. Didn't find any here either, ( I am told by my friends the handsome man is an extinct species). But the Gage was cool. Dark with a high ceiling where you can actually have a conversation with friends.The waitress was attentive and took good care of us. Their Vodkatini was amazing, and they made it extra dirty. My friend got a mojito and plus an order of fish and chips. The tarter sauce was a tad thin.... but that's my only gripe.Mixed crowd, from professionals who work in the area to tourists having a drink...
