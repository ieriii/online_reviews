This has just became my favorite sushi place! It's very well worth the wait (definitely do call ahead for reservations b/c it will be abt an hr without a proper waiting area). The special rolls are amazing...and overall there are a lot of amazing rolls to choose from. It all tasted so fresh. Definitely a bonus that it's a BYOB! There is a bit of a "scene" vibe...the trendsetters are definitely hanging out here.
