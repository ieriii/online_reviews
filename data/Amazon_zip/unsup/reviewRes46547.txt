They have a alcoholic chocolate milkshakes that is popular, but I had Three Floyds Gumballhead which is always a treat. The burgers were talked up a lot by my friends so I had high expectations. And considering the fact that it was the birthplace of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, I expected more. Sweet Potatoe fries were pretty good and you get a large pickle. The inside is vintage with cool decorations. Worth going to once, probably not again.
