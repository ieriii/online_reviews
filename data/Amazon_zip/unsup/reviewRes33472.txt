First off, this isn't a proper review. why? because i've only really had about three items on the menu, the falafel, the egg and cheese pie, and that other thing that i can't remember the name of, you know, that one, oh, you liked it, i thought it was alright, my least favorite out of the three though. well disregarding the latter, those two things are A- material, not A+ because there's not anything super special about them, they're just good. but what makes it a five star place? well the price, so so cheap. and also that it seems i will just never get sick of falafel. so sultan's just keep it coming...
