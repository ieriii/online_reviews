Lovely decor, but is it more than just a pretty face? I was trying not to break the bank, so I didn't personally have any sushi. Besides, a number of the appetizers looked appealingly creative. I had some basic gyoza, and chili tempura calamari, since it's slightly unique and I love calamari. The gyoza were fine, though nothing to write home about. The calamari was poor-- not well prepared, with nothing that one would identify with the word "chili". Furthermore, the batter was decidedly un-tempura like-- it was heavy, greasy, and generic. My boyfriend reported that the sushi was good, but he didn't walk away raving about it. Our service was not so great, and everything was a skosh pricier than it really deserved to be. Returning to the atmosphere of the place-- I have to admit, it's really lovely, from the koi pond beside our table to the giant bamboo forest print plastered on the wall behind the sushi chefs. They garnish the water with cucumber, which is a nice touch, and provide you with warm towels before the meal, like other higher end sushi restaurants. They don't, however, give you a free pot of tea, which I usually expect with all the other trappings they presented. So I admit it was a lovely experience, but not one that led up to a transcendent meal. It's also expensive-- and at the end of the day, I think over-priced. Also, our service was not great-- we were eating really early (like, 4:30 pm) and so were the only people in the restaurant, yet the waitress was very unavailable, and the sushi chefs seemed to only kick into gear preparing my boyfriend's food until he asked the waitress was the hold-up was. There are plenty of other sushi restaurants within the surrounding blocks, so I don't think I'll be back.
