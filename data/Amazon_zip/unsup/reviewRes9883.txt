Over two hours to have our entree served, after we asked. On a Tuesday night. Did not get the seating we requested either. Even though we specifically made arrangements for them, and booked a 6pm reservation...on a friggin Tuesday... Food was OK, probably a 3.5 , but the lack of service when being charged $16 for a glass of wine is, frankly, inexcusable
