This would be yet another 3.5 stars. crowded, unnecessarily hot (even for the winter), and loud, that didn't deter from some pretty good steaks and sides and salads. oh yeah - and appetizers, too. not at all bad! In a crowded market, it does not stand out, but it does not embarrass itself, either. from what I've been told, the wine selection and pairings are good (a good sign).
