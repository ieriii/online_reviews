I dunno about this place. I don't love it, but I don't hate it.  The menu is large like it's counterpart, The Cheesecake Factory, but the food is just ok. I could definitely make most of the items at home and they would probably taste better. Also, since it's right off of the Mag Mile it's always packed and there is always a wait. There are way too many restaurants in the area to go to that are so much better.
