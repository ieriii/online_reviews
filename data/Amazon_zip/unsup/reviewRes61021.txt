I met some co-workers after work on Thursday for a beer and some wings. A friend of mine told me they had great wings. I ordered the spicy wings but was not too impressed with them, they were a bit soggy, the spicy wing sauce was good though. They did not have a huge selection of drafts and the place was kind of small. I don't have any major complaints except I was hopping those wings would have been a bit better. The vibe was OK, I would go back!!
