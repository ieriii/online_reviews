Although the pizza isn't "Chicago" style, I really enjoyed my time at this joint. The young, hip, might I add attractive crowd was fun, not too noisy on this New Years holiday afternoon. There were various sports games (notably the hockey Winter Classic) on the LCD screens. My friends and I were seated promptly, since we volunteered to sit near the door. The variety of beers was impressive, my Festivus was very tasty, and complimented our pizza very well. Our pizza: New Haven style (not sure what that *really* means... its some type of thin crust, but not New York style), medium, with italian sausage and green peppers. EXCELLENT. The service was excellent, we were warned that pizzas were taking a little long, so we got some guacamole to start out with.  In all, 3 guys were able to drink a few beers and get a good sized lunch for under $60. All in, this spot is a solid 4 stars. Price, ambiance, tasty food, and hip location all come together to make Piece worth your time.
