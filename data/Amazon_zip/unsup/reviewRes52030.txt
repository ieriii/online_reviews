Gino's, Gino's, Gino's East, it's good, but I was expecting a little more. I think they have really good pizza pie and I really enjoyed the whole experience. The server was great and the pizza, very good. Perhaps I was expecting too much per I've heard this is the SPOT for all pizzas of Chi town. I ate, thought it was really good, but sadly, the chicago styled pizza from the bay area (N. Cali), Zachary's, was better. I know all you folks from Chicago will send me some hate notes and stuff, but let's face it, Chicago is an AWESOME city, but Gino's can't compare to Zachary's. If you're in N Cali, check it out. Sorry, but if it makes all of you feel better, I think Gino's East is the second best Chicago style pizza i've ever had. =]
