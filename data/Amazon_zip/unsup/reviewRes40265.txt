L&E is my neighborhood watering hole, it's literally one minute away including time to lock my front door and crossing the street. Pretty awesome place, my favorite thing about this place is the bar (literally, the actual carved wooden bar is awesome) not to mention some pretty good mixologist who know how to make unique concoctions that you've never tried before. The food is good as well, I personally think the brunch menu is the best. Dinner menu has an array of organ meat pates, things in tiny jars with fancy schmeres of colorful sauces and such, it's hipster lets not kid ourselves, but it's done well. The only thing is, now that it's Michelin star rated it's busy, busy and for a neighborhood watering hole it gets super packed, especially on the weekends. One thing that I don't like, you end of smelling like beef fat fries as soon as you walk in the door, but then again so does everyone else. Give it try, you won't be disappointed.
