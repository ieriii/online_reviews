There's been a lot of talk on this site about Zed, but did anyone know they serve brunch on the weekend? I was in town for a family reunion and my cousin took me to Zed for "breakfast" - wow, was that an understatement! There was so much food! The harvest stations, I think they call them, are filled with things like Italian french toast (made with panettone, of all things), and tons of different yogurts, fruit and desserts. And these chefs kept coming to our table with dishes like duck hash browns, crab cakes and fried chicken and waffles - I haven't had chicken and waffles that great since I lived in Louisiana! There was some great cajun spice on that chicken, just enough kick to combat the sweet maple syrup that comes on the waffle. I highly recommend you check out Zed for brunch - I just wish there was one in SF!
