I just went there this weekend with one of my best friends. We started with the grilled octopus. I'm not usually a fan of grilled octopus - many places make it too chewy. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it at Anteprima. It actually melted in my mouth!!! For my main course, I ordered the ricotta and chard ravioli in butter sauce. While it was very rich, I enjoyed every morsel. But then again, I love butter! For dessert, we shared a lemon custard (I'm not sure what the name is exactly - the pannacotta?). It was light, creamy, and not too sweet. Just right after a rich meal! We shared a bottle of Il Bugiardo 2002. I don't know much about Italian wines, but if you like merlot and shiraz - you'll like this!
