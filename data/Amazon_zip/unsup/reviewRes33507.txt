Love and adore. So much. From the hand-scrawled menus to the cozy little space that is intimate enough for a date and lively enough for friends, there is so much to love about Mia Francesca. My favourite is the Quattro Stagioni pizza: prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom and egg on a delicate thin crust. The waiter places the dish before you, breaks the yolk in the centre and swirls it evenly so it cooks on the hot surface. The result? A lovely symphony of crisp crust and soft silkiness of a perfectly cooked egg. Oh, I will fight anyone for the last slice of this pizza. The menu is updated often and I've never been disappointed with the quality of food here. Sigh, Mia Francesca. Where your water glass will never be empty, and your taste buds will never be let down.
