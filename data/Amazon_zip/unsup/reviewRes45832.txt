Neelam P. told me I had to check this place out if I like beignets - so of course I did!  The place was packed and we had plans to go to see a show that afternoon, but we really wanted to try it! So, we got a seat at the bar and ordered our lunch there.  Drink: Sparkling Spanish Rose: yumminess, it had Champagne, Sangria and Fresh Strawberries...soon to be followed by a coffe though Mojitos: also good there, was nice to see they made it fresh Eat: Red Velvet Pancakes: Though I didn't eat this, my friend said it tasted like heaven. these are HUGE btw, it would definitely be more than enough for 2 people to share. Breakfast Beignets: came with 3 different sauces an also a HUGE portion, definitely didn't finish but the sauces added a nice touch.  Overall, this was well-worth the rush to get to the show we were rushing to make!
