This place is a total dissapointment. Or joke. Not sure which. Yes, they also told me I had to be out of my table by a certain time because of the many more important (I presume) guests coming later. Really? GREAT first impression. (Sarcasm, ok?) Place was empty till we left before the 7:00 on a friday mark they had warned us about. Corn fritters= dangerously deep fried HUSH PUPPIES with a few kernals of corn__YUCK Spicy tuna over fried nigiri rice with jalepeno? WATCH out for the GARLIC:( Not only was our possibly stoned waiter super slow but he totally did not bring me my roll that I had ordered to be my dinner-this is after I scoffed at the unpleasant appetizers above mentioned. (It was a friday night People- not trying to go out after like a garlic monster!) SO he brings the check and NO roll for me. I politely asked if the hamachi roll was still on it's way.... "the what?......Ooooh, you wanted that after all?" Um yeah!!!!! He should have right away ran to get one made and comped it. Didn't happen. I left hungry, and mad.
