Based on the reviews, I'm wondering if I've just had bad luck, but I've experienced a major drop in quality on my last couple trips. The bread is still great, but everything else seems to be toned down. The meat is less flavorful, the toppings are more sparse, the fresh herbs and ingredients that were a hallmark of my past trips have given way to a more mass-produced feeling. The XOCO empire has expanded to O'Hare airport and likely has its eyes set on a national expansion. I wish him all the best, but at 12 bucks for a sandwich, I'm expecting a little more.
