I went there for brunch with my girlfriend yesterday. Overall, I had a positive experience. Service: Great. The servers were very friendly. Down to earth. They worked as a team and that made us feel comfortable. Food: Good. I ordered an omelet with fresh greens. The plate was good, although a bit expensive considering the salad was not that substantial and the omelet not very big. I'm fine with the omelet not being very big...I understand everything doesn't have to be supersize and less is more sometimes. The omelet was very tasty, with sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, goat cheese, and spinach. The salad however, was weak. I opted to go with the salad instead of the house potatoes. This was an option on the menu and not me inventing my only side dish. That being said, I shouldn't have to relinquish high quality just because I choose a salad over the presumably more filling and tasty potatoes. All I'm asking for is something else in the salad...perhaps some shaved parmesan, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, something...toss me a bone. Instead, I ended up with some green sprigs lightly tossed with a dressing and salt. Weak! My girlfriend had a delicious chicken sandwich. It had a spread infused with sun dried tomato, goat cheese, and who knows what else...tasty! We also split a bowl of butternut squash soup. Tasty!! Although I like my gf's butternut squash soup better because it has a more pungent flavor due to not using cream (and healthier), I understand that telling a restaurant to avoid using cream in soup is like taking away a chef's knife. I enjoyed the soup.  Ambience: I like the space. It is very minimalist. A bar. Seating. Clean.  Price: What you would expect from a gastropub. Not cheap. Not overly expensive. Overall: Because I liked the vibe and the food was on the whole, more positive than negative, I'd go back. I'd be interested in checking it out at night, especially because I saw one of my favorite beers on tap!
