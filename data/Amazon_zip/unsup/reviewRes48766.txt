Hahaha, this place has a million reviews. Yes yes, the dinner is outstanding. I just want to add that the brunch is tits. Go here on the weekend and get your breakfast on, y'all! I haven't needed a reservation for these earlier visits like you need for dinner, and everything is beyond perfect for a little less than I actually would have expected.
