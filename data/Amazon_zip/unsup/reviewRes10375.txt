There was a line to get your name down, before you get to the actual line waiting for the table. It's like, another line in a line. Or a line within a line. You get the gist. I hope. Yes, they have live band karaoke - but I came here mainly for the pizza. And the brews. One of the very few places that offers white sauce pizza. With sausage and bacon and mushroom and half-jalapenoed (the bf don't dig spicy stuff) - I'm good to go. Wouldn't ya?
