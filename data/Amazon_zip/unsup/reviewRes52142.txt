Yummy pizza! We stopped in for lunch and ordered the Chicago pizza with sausage patties. It was good pizza and we enjoyed the restaurant. It did take about 1 hour to get it, which I find kind of crazy. But the beer was cold, the atmosphere was nice and I would eat it again! (Next time I would get there before I am hungry though!)
