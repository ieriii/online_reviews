Love this place! Friendly service, pleasant atmosphere, and amazingly fantastic pizza! The crust and sauce are delicious, I'm drooling just thinking about it. Been there multiple times, both to eat in and take out. You'll have a wait (the normal 45 mins. or so for deep dish) when you order a whole pie, but you can order by the slice in store. Decent price for a slice or two and something to drink. Parking can be difficult, depends upon what day of the week/time of day it is. I've parked in the lot (very tiny), on the street, and been blocked in out on the street ... but that person was waiting for his pizza, and promptly came out and moved his car so we could leave!
