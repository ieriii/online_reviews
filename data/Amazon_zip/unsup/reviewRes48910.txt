Brunch at Publican is what dreams are made of. The bloody mary with beer sidecar and Intelligentsia coffee is great started. The pork cheek sandwich with fried egg on top is amazing. Pork cheek sounds a little weird, but my good buddy Anthony Bourdain says that cheek is the best cut of meat on any animal/fish. I now have to agree. Not sure how they prepare it, but it is almost a pot roast consistency that falls apart when you cut it. No knife needed. The bacon stole the show though. It was house cured and cut super thick. I'm talking 3/4" thick. This ain't Denny's grand-slam style. The interior space was nice and the service was spot-on. I will definite be making reservations here next time I am in Chicago.
