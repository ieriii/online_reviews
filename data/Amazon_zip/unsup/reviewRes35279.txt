I ordered a 1lb lobster stuffed with Blue Crab meat and topped with a light layer of cheese. The crab was very good, not too much cheese and it was a large portion. The lobster was tough and chewy; it lacked any real flavor. The 'seafood' rice it was served with was boring. I didn't eat it frankly, I didn't see the point it was flavorless and dry. The price was average $30 for my lobster plate which seemed reasonable.  I'm not a big fan of over seasoned or 'decorated' dishes; I like clean simple flavors with good ingredients. Which is what I was expecting. With the reputation of Shaw's I was expecting the seafood to 'stand on its own' I was disappointed.  Our group ordered the Au-Gratin Potatoes; which was the best thing I tried all night. They were creamy and decadent. We enjoyed the homemade peppermint ice cream that we shared for dessert. The service was great, very nice and prompt. I would think twice before spending that money to go back. It would be a nice lunch but was a let-down for dinner.
