After being a hardcore Bentonara fan (mostly because of their volcano roll) I decided to go outside the box and try this place after reading so many positive reviews from my yelp "friends." Man, this place was fantastic. We had four rolls, tea, edamame, and mochi for dessert. Each roll was beautifully designed and presented on separate plates, the jasmine tea was well brewed, and the edamame had plenty of salt. :) The atmosphere is cool too - small and understated room; it really feels like a local place but it's very clean so you don't leave wondering if you'll be making a visit to the porcelain throne in a few hours from bad fish.
