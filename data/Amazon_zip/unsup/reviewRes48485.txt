I think I misordered but I would definitely go back. I loved the look and feel of the restaurant. What place do you go where the waiter personally goes through the menu with you? Not many places. Our service was exceptional. Our duck prosciutto was fantastic but our half a whole chicken and frites was just "good enough". I loved the wine and the bathrooms has c.g. bigelow soap/lotions products. nice touch. I heard they have brunch and a ever-changing menu. I will be back. :)
