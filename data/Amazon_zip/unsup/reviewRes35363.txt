One of my absolute favorite places in Chicago. The Peking duck is the aboslute best! What really seperates it from other peking duck is the delicious dumplings that come with it. Be warned, you need to call in early, there is usually a wait. If you plan on ordering the peking duck (which you should), you need to call in the order days early (not sure exactly how many).  The price is fair, especially for the portions, and the quality is top notch. Stop reading this review and get your butt to uptown!
