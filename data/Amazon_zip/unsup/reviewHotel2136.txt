Great location, reputable name... but far too rundown of a hotel to be considered 4-star. We've stayed here a few times (and on both occasions our needs were met for what we were looking for), but each time it just seems to be "okay". Because of that, I would rate their Chicago property a generous 3 stars. On the other hand, I really wish I could review their international locations. The properties in the Middle East (Dubai Festival City, Abu Dhabi) are beyond 4-star service, facilities and amenities - definitely a well-deserved 4 stars. I would rate the property in Dubai at nothing less than FIVE. But then again... the United Arab Emirates would surpass even the biggest critic's expectations! Overall a superb hotel branch to give and get points with. We have been happy with InterContinental hotels for our go-to or last minute hotel needs, and their international properties are spot on.
