I have been to the Bad Apple Twice, and I cant wait to get my hands on another one of their AMAZING BURGERS!!! The first time we went we got the goat chees fondue (YUM) and I got the Imperial, I thought to myself this is seriously the best burger I have ever had. My friend had the Beer Can Chicken and she loved it!! The second time I went we had the French bread pizza app, very very tasty!!! The pesto was so fresh....ahhhh I can go on about that, but I must tell you about the little piece of heaven I had in my mouth for about two seconds!! I say two seconds because it was so darn yummy I ate it so quick!! "THE STEAK FRITTES" OMG this buger was litterally like butter melting in your mouth....I loved it, LOVED IT!!! My next treat will be the "SLOW BURN, it just looks awesome. I have to say I really enjoyed the atmosphere!!! The place is awesome, hey any first dates out there? This is a perfect first date place, fun, hip, friendly!!! The bar is amazing from the beer list to the creative drink list...try the Persnickity Lemon it's awesome. The bartenders rock!!! Cant wait to go back!!!!! Apples never tasted so good!!!
