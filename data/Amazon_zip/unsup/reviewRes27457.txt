I'll admit it: before I moved to Chicago, I had never heard of Rick Bayless. I'm not a foodie, I only passively watch Top Chef when there's a marathon on, and Mexican food is probably my least favorite cuisine. Rick, you almost made a believer out of me. If there's one thing I do appreciate, it is a perfect ceviche & a perfect guacamole (ok, that's two things, I lied). On both these accounts, Frontera hits it out of the park. If you are a ceviche fan (or even if you're not), definitely go with the trio. The highlight was definitely the Ceviche Fronterizo. Sadly, the one I thought I'd like the most, the Coctel de Atun, actually turned out to be rather bland. And the guac. No words. Just do it. I seriously considered licking the bowl, but sadly I've only been here on business lunches. Once I come here and am able to drink alcohol (curse you business lunches!), the bowl will probably be licked clean. I tried a smattering of the cazuelas: the pollo ahumado is creamy, smoky deliciousness, and the queso fundido is a heavenly heart-attack in melty-cheesy form. Sadly, the service knocks Frontera down a star--I was tempting to knock it down two. I understand it's lunchtime and it's busy. But when we arrive when the restaurant is still empty at 11:30am, waiting 15 minutes for drink orders alone is unacceptable. And another 30 for chips & guac? Really?!?! Unless someone needed to go hand-pick the avocados for each order, there's no way a lunch crowd should be expected to wait like that. Maybe I've only been there on off-days, but I'm still not impressed.
