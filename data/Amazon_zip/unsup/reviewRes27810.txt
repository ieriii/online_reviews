Came on a weekday night for a birthday celebration, was pleasantly surprised by the food, creativity, and service.  The truffled popcorn that they served instead of bread was a great starter to whet the appetite.  We tried: - spring pea bisque - creamy and bright, poured straight from a beaker at the table. - sea scallop almondine - wild alaskan halibut with fiddleheads and morels - dark chocolate torte - strawberry sponge cake They also gave us a scroll of the evening's menu to take home as a birthday souveneir.  Overall solid food and very friendly and accomodating staff - would definitely go back, and preferably on a weekend night.
