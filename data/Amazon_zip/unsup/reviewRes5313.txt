Was in Chicago for business and saw this place from the hotel window. I was very impressed. The wine list all "old world" no US wines. Good selection of value priced Bordeaux and Burgandy. THe "grazing" style menu was very nice. The Beet and Goat cheese salad could have been turned into a sucessful entre, the milk fed pork shoulder was fantastic, tried the roasted bone marrow but I was really a fan - others raved about it. Best part was the service, knowledgable, friendly, quick with a recommendation, readily available. Kudo's to Alexa who was our server as she was one of the best I've ever dealt with. Overall Great Resturant, worth the detour.
