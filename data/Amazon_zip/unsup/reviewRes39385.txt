I really wanted to like this place especially since the group I was with waited 3 hours to sit. I know....3 hours is ridiculous but we got to the point of no return and would feel even more irritated if we left after 2 hours.  They don't take reservations which we knew and expected to wait 2 hours...3 hours is insane and annoying. This place is small with an open kitchen in the corner. It's hot and smells like a kitchen. Ew I wasn't impressed with the food either....had the sloppy joe, bone marrow (sick), and tried the steak. I refer to it as "man food". Every guy I was with loved it. Every woman I was with, not so much. However, I know a lot of people that love this place so might be worth checking out.
