For a Saturday morning, there wasn't much of a wait. There's a good amount of space but it's not too large. Our waitress was friendly at first but when I asked for extra butter, she gave me a look like I was asking her to physically churn me some.  I would probably only go back if I needed a brunch spot in that particular area but since I don't live close and the food was average, I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
