Everyone and their mama has been raving about cupcakes. What the hell is the fascination? I have been fighting this craze for the past year. I'm old school, so screw you cupcakes, I refuse to be converted! Just like a missionary...these damn cupcakes came to me..they were on a mission to show me the way to sweet salvation and all that glory. My little sister, once again had to show me a thing or two about food. Tucked away in a neat little box were 5 of the most beautifully decorated "cupcakes". It's blasphemous to call them cupcakes. They are mini cakes dammit! I tried the pumpkin spice, the chocolate hazelnut, red velvet, and they are damn good! I'm a believer now..and I just might stop by if I'm ever in the area.
