two words: meat coma. i usually only go when i have a business meeting and i get to expense it. and i usually have to stop myself from eating an inappropriate amount of meat in front of the big wigs. but one thing is for sure. flip up that little green circle, and the meat men will swarm the shit out of you. after you are done, i hope you have a few quality hours for a meat nap - i usually have to sleep 4 or so hours after eating at fogo.
