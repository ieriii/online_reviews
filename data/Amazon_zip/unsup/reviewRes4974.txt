Phenomenal!  There is not much that has not been said!  Their wine list is European, extensive and moderately priced.  They tout over 50 bottles under 40 bucks.  We had the roasted beets with goat cheese which seemed to be incredibly popular and was very good, but not the star of the show.  We also had the lardo crostini (fatty, smoky, salty, deliciousness), the crispy pig's ear, which definitely was the star of the show, the mussels with pancetta was fantastic and the second runner up is the balsamic braised pigs tails.  I certainly did not know what to expect when ordering them but to my surprise it was a sweet, ham-y delight.  We also had cheeses which were fantastic served with their mustard flavored chutney and bread.  I don't often comment on the bread but the bread that accompanies their dishes is charred out the outside and in the center it is slightly soft flavored with olive oil, perfect for dipping up anything!  Just a fantastic meal and I have a hard time believing anything on the menu is not great.  I will return to test that theory, however.
