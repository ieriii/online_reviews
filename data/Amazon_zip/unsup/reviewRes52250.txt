Now that's a pizza! I'm a southern Cali girl with Chi-town roots and have always been a deep-dish pizza lover. SO let me break down what I loved: I had the sausage pizza (patty style) which is what they are known for and came highly recommended by my server. The crust was light and crispy. There was meat in every bite as the sausage was an actual layer in between sauce and cheese. The pizza matched the atmosphere as it wasn't pretty and refined but rugged and perfect. I would definitely go there again, and it surely gave me a sampling of true Chicago Style Pizza.
