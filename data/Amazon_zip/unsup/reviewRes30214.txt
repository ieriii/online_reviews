Free your Mind, and your Meat will follow! Chicago Diner is meat free! Vegetarian and Vegan options rule the rooster-free roost here. As a meat eater the only trouble I had with ordering, was deciding which yummy-looking dish to get! Deciding on the Oaxaca Ravioli served over a small bed of greens with fire-roasted salsa and sour cream, there was a distinct pumpkin taste to these yummy ravioli and the dish was great! Ordering the Blueberry Basil Limeade to go with it was perfect for a nice summer night, but it seemed pricey, given that I make this at home and I know it's not that ingredient-intensive. Other dishes I snagged a forkful from my dining partners were the BBQ Pulled Pork (which was a little stringy and smoky), and the Polenta, which was served with zucchini, carrots, and squash, and was great. I didn't try the Raw Nachos, crazy huh? I, Nachos, will be back to try this Raw food take on my favorite food! There's a great beer selection and we sat on the awesome back patio, lit with cute strings of hanging lights, and surrounded by trees and plants. Thanks to Becky W. for arranging this Veggie Supper Club! I will be back for those Raw Nachos with a craft beer on the side!
