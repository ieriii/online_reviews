The good: - The units are large. The living room was nice. The bed was comfortable. It was good to have a refrigerator and microwave. The bad: - Parking was outrageous (over $50 per night) - Poor water pressure - Although nice to have, the microwave and fridge were scuzzy Things that other people may find good, but I found terrible: - It was chaotic. There were kids running around everywhere and lots and lots of people milling about, mostly waiting in crazy long lines for free cheap alcohol. There must have been a pool, because there were a lot of dripping wet, scantily clad people everywhere. Kind of gross.
