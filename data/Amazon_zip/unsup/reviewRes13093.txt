I actually want to rate this place lower, but I haven't actually experienced anything wrong with the food I've eaten. I've just had high expectations for the place and I've been let down both of the times I've gone there (once for brunch and once for lunch). Now, I realize that I should probably try the place for dinner, but after the service these past two times I'm hesitant to go back. I just think it's ridiculous that they never have things that are on their "specials" menu. I understand that restaurants run out of food sometimes, but it seems to me that they never actually have the item on the menu and then claim they "ran out". Also, during my last visit, the waitress completely forgot to bring the appetizer we ordered and kept confirming what our sandwhich order was (I would have rather had her just write the order down). For brunch and lunch, there didn't seem to be anything that exciting on the menu, but the food tasted fine.
