Drinks are WAY overpriced. A margarita was $18 which is insane even for a native city dweller such as myself. All the martini's were about that price too. The beer and wine were reasonable. I mean, I'll pay $15 for a martini but $18 (I know it's only $2 difference) but is insane. There better be crack cocaine in there for that much!! ha! The steaks were very expensive even for a nice steak place but my steak was excellent. Probably one of the best steaks I have had at a restaurant other than in Italy. The pork chop bone was also excellent. The sides were only OK though. I thought the mac n cheese was dry with no flavor, the scalloped potatoes were very good but still lacking in taste, and then creamed spinach was solid but that's really hard to mess up. The lobster bisque was only OK. I would say a bit watery with not that great of flavor. The french onion soup on the other hand was very tasty and would definitely get that instead. The cheesecake was excellent but the chocolate cake was only OK. The service was solid but not great. Our bread didn't come until the soup and even then I had to ask for it. Then our sauces did not come with our steaks so we had to wait for them as well which again was annoying. Also, I called ahead and specifically asked for the cheese cake to be brought to the table for my husbands birthday without me asking and they brought chocolate cake instead which annoyed me. Overall, I would say pretty good, but I would rather go to Gibsons for a cheaper meal with a solid steak and better sides and service.
