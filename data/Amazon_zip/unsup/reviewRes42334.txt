Since I've read so many good things about them, I decided to make a reservation way in advance for our first dinner in town. What a fabulous first impression of Chicago it gave us. I was happy with pretty much everything: the hosts who were so welcoming and kindly suggested us to go down to Curio to wait for a few minutes because it's quieter, and then came down to get us when the table was ready--service! The lively crowd and vibe; the friendly and attentive (yet a bit pushy and rushy) waitress; the marrow and the sensational toasts... oh boy, the marrow. And my pasta (fun shape) puttanesca had the perfect balance of saltiness and spiciness. I felt so satisfied after the meal. Sitting right in front of the kitchen was a lot of fun. It was a really busy night but they seemed to be really organized in there. I guess I have a soft spot of restaurants that are decorated in black. It always works for me.
