I have been looking for this place, as it turns out, my whole life. I know, Longman & Eagle wasn't made just for me - but when I walked in I felt like I had found MY bar. Granted, I'm sure so many people have walked in and felt the same way, but how could you not?  This place is so meticulous about the art of beer and spirits and drink making that it would drive a person just looking to get completely wasted by pounding drink after drink nuts. That's not the point when you come here (although, I must add, that after a few drinks you'll be off your rocker should you wish). These guys will take 5 minutes on your drink and taste it before they give it to you to make sure it's up to par - and for only 8 bucks per drink you can't beat that.  Prime example of how much these guys care about their craft: My girlfriend ordered a drink, got it, and while it was well made, realized she didn't like the taste of it. She's not one to complain about drinks but figured she would ask for another one - worth a shot, right? So she goes up to the bar and apologizes, but says she just doesn't quite like the drink she got - no questions asked, the bartender apologizes, takes her drink and makes her a different one based on the tastes she described she liked. Flash forward 5 minutes and she's sitting next to me saying she's drinking the best cocktail she's ever had. This place rules, on top of the host buying my whole table a round of delicious whiskey shots and the steigl pils on tap in the back beer garden, there are still a million other great things I can say about this place. The food, the ambiance, everything. Truly great.
