I really liked Carnivale. Great atmosphere, great sangria. I am a vegetarian so I had the spicy type pasta and it was very good! I heard the skirt steak was excellent as well. I had the Churros and they were excellent! Place runs a bit expensive, so not a every week type of casual place but very good and worth it! Small portions so beware.  The restaurant's look alone is worth a visit, it's huge and the decoration is amazing I just love to go and look.
