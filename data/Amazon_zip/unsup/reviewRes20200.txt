4.5 stars! HUGE portions. Reasonably priced. De-freaking-licious. What more could you ask for? I got the fish and chips here - they were very very well prepared with the tastiest dipping sauce on the side. I came here to meet a college friend for lunch and we were certainly not disappointed. She got a sandwich which she said was pretty good but I was definitely blown away by the fish and chips! The location is also extremely convenient as a meeting spot since it is right across the street from Millennium Park. I used to think it was pretty hard to find something to eat at a reasonable price right by that wonderful little tourist trap but now I worry no more! The only thing was that it's very crowded and a little loud, but hey what the heck. :)
