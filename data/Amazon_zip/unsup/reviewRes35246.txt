How often have you lived through a birthday's celebration AND a live, full blown reenactment of "Meet the Parents" all at once?!?!? Not that many times, right, at least if you are not coming from a XXXL size family....and I am not. So that was the first time for me, and Shaw's made it all right, nice and...yummy?!? It was easier for me to relax and focus on my plate since I was not under the spotlights; my sister in law was. I think she did a great job out of it, and so did her boyfriend - just in case you were wondering. Me, I did a great job cleaning my: - cup of lobster bisque, which was by far the best one I have ever had on this side of the pond and which only flaw was to come in a cup, not a bowl....not a SALAD bowl. Big mhunks of lobster meat guys. - plate of grilled mahi with apple-Mango Salad and jalapeno vinaigrette. Just. Superb. - share of potato 'au gratin'........so cheesy and delicious, I had to refrain myself from putting the casserole in front of me and just wolf down the whole thing. I almost shed a tear when our waitress took the thing away.... A revelation: the chocolate cake. I have a tendency to dislike these chocolate monsters that you find in many restaurants, these dark towers so insipid and dry that we call them in France 'Christian chokers'. Well - not this one my friends. Very moist and very tasty, it was a little chocolaty wonder. I just sat back and enjoyed, glad to be married and not to have through this ordeal ever again. Fingers crossed.
