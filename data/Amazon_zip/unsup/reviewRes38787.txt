I love pizza. Yet, I am a picky pizza eater. La Villa is the most frequent order my squeeze and I order from on the reg. The pizza is good, I think some of the better in the area. The menu is extensive. But I've never been in, just ordered delivery. I'm a fan.. as yelp puts it. But... my only qualm.. and I don't know if its enough to prevent me from ordering.. is that they are SO RUDE when I order on the phone. Every time I call for delivery I am immediately put on hold, but never told Just... "La villa... *mumble* hold" ::click:: "What do you want? phone number?" "Any thing else?" "Any thing else?" "45 minutes to an hour" I practically have to yell..."I'm going to pay with a card!!!" before they hang up on me. I mean... c'mon, I know i can get a little needy with my ordering but can i get a little sugar on the line? I know I'm splitting hairs.
