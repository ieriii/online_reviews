My whole life I've hated pickles. Nothing can ruin a meal as much as a pickle can, I've always thought. Then I ate at Chicago Q. And before you know it I'm eating their bread and butter pickles they start every table off with like they're candy. And that was before I had even ordered. I could tell this was gonna be good. I had the pulled chicken sandwich and others at my table had the pulled pork and ribs. The meat was incredibly tender and the variety of sauces were so good. Not to mention there was enough food for three of me. I'll be back, Chicago Q, and I'm gifting my whole family jars of your bread and butter pickles, because it's the right thing to do.
