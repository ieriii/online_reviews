Are you kidding me??? The best grilled chicken I have ever had!!!! You walk in and smell the delicious ingredients grilling. I have no idea what kind of rub they are using but I found myself almost licking the plate. The place is kind of small but very accommodating and if you eat in they will try and make as much room as possible for your dinner experience to be comfortable. The Samba music in the background is great also. Our small group of 3 ordered a large pizza, 1/2 BBQ chx and half Alexia, as well as a whole chicken dinner based on reviews. Wait, I didnt mention the pizza. The pizza guy is rollin out the dough right in the window. Fresh ingredients all over the place. There is definitely some over portioning going on here but I am not complaining. All and all a great food experience.
