A wonderful experience. We arrived for the 6pm seating with everyone else. We were first served our drinks (which included non alcoholic beverages/$5 corkage fee). Then we had the amuse which was a tuna tartare on a chinese spoon. I ate it in one bite. Yum. next the first course, which was a duck proscuitto salad served with cucumber and quail egg. The dish was delicate and a great starter to get my appetiite on. Next the second course which was a citrus bouillabaise with shrimp and clams. Probably my favorite dish of the whole meal. I savored every piece of seafood and then all of the soup. Next was a lentil phyllo and crispy coconut cake served over thai red curry with a side of lime custard. What a wonderful combination. The phyllo and curry were spicy yet tasty, and the custard calmed everything down. I didn't need sip of water or anything. Next the main course which was grilled escolar (fish) over asparagus and pistachio beignet. Just wonderful what more can I say. And finally a chocolate medley dessert. Everything was plated and served well. The tastes were all amazing. The atmosphere was quiet and romantic. It was a wonderful expereience.
