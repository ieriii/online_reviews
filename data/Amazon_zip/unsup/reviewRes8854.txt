I've been waiting for so long to write about Noon-O. I just couldn't get into the writing mode, having been on a negative restaurant review streak for so long. Ok, silence. Let's begin. No wait... I don't know what to write, oh God, I'm getting all nervous and flustered and feeling anxious... Ok, breathe. My mouth is watering...JUST DO IT ALREADY! So first you get a plate of warm pita bread with cubes of goat cheese, onions, dill and radishes. Hell, this would be enough for me, I could be fine with just that. But there's more. I always get the same dish because I don't like trying new things, although I always preach about how important it is to try new things. Oh, oh here comes the warm Caspian Eggplant appetizer, the perfect start followed by the Joujeh Soltani, a large skewer of deliciously marinated and seasoned chicken breast, and one skewer of seasoned ground chicken breast served with Persian dill or white rice, charbroiled vegetables and Persian salad.  Mmm....and now for the Shirin Polo (the Sweet & Sour Persian Rice) with juicy Chicken Tenders; oh man, just thinking about the pistachios mixed with orange peel jam, carrot and Persian sour berries on top of some white rice... Ok, it's over. That wasn't so bad. Oh, don't forget to order dessert. The choices are all either Greek or Italian for the most part but don't be scurred... the tiramisu is AWESOME as is their pistachio ice cream that comes in generous portions. Service is fantastic, portions are good, food is fresh. Their juices are delicious (try the pomegranate!!!). End Rant.
