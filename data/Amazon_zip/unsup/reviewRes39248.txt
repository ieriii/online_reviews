This is hands down the best Korea bbq I remember having. It's been years since I've gone to this place ever since I moved, but I've never been to a place which serves over 20 kinds of DIFFERENT ban chan in one seating. The marinated meat is so flavorful and I love that you get to cook it over a charcoal grill, and not your regular gas grill. Do not overcook the meat or try to crisp it up, as the staff would not be too happy about that! =) Like many have reviewed, service is not the best... they don't really speak english and can be quite rude most of the times. I remember too that each of us will need to order an entree ( no sharing) allowed. I think asking for extra ban chan might not be free. I think if you speak Korean, you might get a little better service here. This place is open late; till wee hours in the morning and I like the tatami seating (limited) that you could just chill and eat some Korean BBQ. Even with the mediocre service, I always think about going back there to get my Korean bbq fix whenever I'm in town.
