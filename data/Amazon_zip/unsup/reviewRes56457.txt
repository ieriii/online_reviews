My husband and I went here for the first time 4 years ago (Dec 2009). We went on a cold December night and were fortune it enough to have had made reservations in advance. The place was packed but we were seated fairly quickly. We were even fortune it enough to be there on a night when Rick himself was there. He was nice enough to sign a book for my husband. I had their signature steak, plantains and black beans. This dish was AMAZING!!! At the beginning of this year I knew I would be going back to Chicago in March and tried to make reservations. They said they only took so many reservations and that I would need to come in as a walk in. So, my husband and I went there on a Saturday night (March 2012) and stood in the overcrowded bar for THREE hours and were never seated. We left there hungry, frustrated and mad. We just went there again on Friday night (August 17, 2012). We had made reservations ahead of time and were seated very quickly. However, their signature steak dish was such a disappointment. The steak was flavorless. The plantains that were so creamy and wonderful that first time I came in, this time were dry and overcooked. The black beans were the same too - dry as a bone. We also tried two different kinds of tamale's. I LOVE tamales and I've actually learned to make them from Rick's book. So, it was so disappointing when they came out. The black bean tamale stuffing was dry and way too thick for a tamale. The other type of tamale was so awful we sent it back. My husband and I are huge foodies! I am a huge fan of Mexican food! I'm also a huge fan of Rick Bayless. I first started watching him on public television years ago and now have DVR'd all his new shows. FYI - I like the older shows better! It's hard for me to write such a bad review about someone I'm such a huge fan of but after our experience Friday night I told my husband I would never drag him to this place again.
