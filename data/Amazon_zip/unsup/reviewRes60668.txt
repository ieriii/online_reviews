Grand Lux is a great restaurant for a dinner date, families, going out on the town night. I went with my family, had an amzing drink, wonderful buffalo wrap appetizer and delicious salmon for dinner. It's also pretty good on prices and it's located right on Michigan ave. where all of the action is!
