I truly believe Rick has created a whole new concept to fast, gourmet food. The entire process of ordering, and seating is done differently here to move people. But the food you get is something you would receive at a sit-down place. I had the Ahodaga, and it was, amazingly spectacular. The toast was crusty, the sauce was well balanced, and the meat was tender and juicy. This was my first Rick bayless establishment, and I can say that I'm a believer now (I've always thought he was gimmicky). I would def come back to try the other tortas along with some cocoa.
