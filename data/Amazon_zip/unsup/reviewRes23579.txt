So, some girlfriends and I tried this place for brunch a while back, and we were really excited. We ordered a whole bunch of different stuff to share, and it all tasted great (nutella crepes, i mean--for real, people). But the service was TERRIBLE. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. (It's really annoying to type that way, but the service was so bad, I just had to.) There were a whole bunch of employees floating around, and there were only a few tables. Random people would stop by to ask if we needed anything, but apparently only our waitress could actually fulfill any of our requests (think waiting 20 minutes for a refill). When we finished, we waited 30 minutes for someone to come by so we could ask for our check, another 20 for them to bring it. We tried to split it on our credit cards, but 15 minutes later they told us their credit card machine was broken. Thankfully one of the girls I was with had cash, but we waited ANOTHER 20 minutes for change. Do the math, that's OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF just to get and pay our check! To make matters worse, we all started to feel sick about half an hour after we left, and we were hungry again 2 hours after later! All that said, I might go back if someone else was paying and I didn't have any plans for the entire day.
