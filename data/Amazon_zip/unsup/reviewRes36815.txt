Ok, I went here again and took my mom and I've decided that I won't come back anymore. I realized that their portions are tiny!!! I don't know what I was thinking the first time I came here, maybe I was just excited. I was extremely put off by how small the bowl of tom yum soup was. It cost $4.25 for a tiny bowl that I could finish with just 10 spoonfuls. I also didn't think it was that good...I'll go to En-thai-ce for my tom yum. I ordered the tempura sushi that cost $7.00 and contained 6 small pieces....I'll go to Tokyo Marina for that. Beef salad was alright, it was spicy but not as lemon-y as all the other great ones are. So, I'll go to Opart Thai for that! Green curry was a decent size. I still like the atmosphere and decor. So, I'll skip it from now on and go to Grande since it's a Thai-Sushi place and their portions are bigger.
