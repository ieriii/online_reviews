I'm not writing this update because I visited Irazu again recently or because my opinion has changed. I am writing this review because shortly after posting my original review the owner emailed me to let me know he appreciated my review and that he couldn't wait for us to visit Chicago because he is excited to meet our new baby. Support this local business any time you can. Business owners like this are a dying breed.
