It's been established that I hate brunch at Wishbones. BUUUT I just recently realized that I actually really enjoy dinner there. They have really good food at a VERY good price. Bf and I shared a bottle of malbec for only $13 (which was their special/ Even though it was margarita night, I can't turn down malbec. I ordered the bbq ribs and bf got the country fried steak. Both were delicious and large portions of food. He really loved the corn bread they give you at the start of the meal. Well Wishbones, guess you're off my sh*t list and I WILL BE BACK (for dinner)
