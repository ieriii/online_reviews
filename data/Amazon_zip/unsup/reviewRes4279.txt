I have never had a bad night here. Love the room, drinks, people and most of all the music. You could pretty much walk in here any night and see a great band for a very small entrance fee. I especially love the fact they ask you to NOT TALK during the concert. I especially recommend ALFONSO PONTICELLI and SWING GITAN on Wednesday nights and ALAN GRESIK SWING SHIFT ORCHESTRA on Thursday nights. ps Don't let the guy with the Dali mustache and a stern face at the door scare you :-)
