I have been wanting to come here ever since Rocky B posted the first review. It sounded tasty. Then the overwhelming amount of friends who were telling me how great this place was, my friend Sarah G talked about how great their Buddha Bowls were... fine I'm there. I had an hour before my next client, I had put in a two hour workout in and I was starving. I was going. I knew I was going for the healthier version of the traditional Bi Bim Bop, the Buddha Bowl. Going for the brown rice, five vegetables, some chicken, it was something I had been craving this all week long. What I didn't have was a lot of time. However I was supposed to come here, there was a free parking space in front waiting for me. When I came in I was greeted by one of the owners. He made this review go from four to five stars. He was more than happy to tell me all about the place and their food. He was so passionate, I myself could hardly wait to get back to work to try this stuff! Looking around the place, it is simple. plenty of selections of drinks have and a good amount of seats. It all took about five minutes, the owner gave me some extra hot sauce, just in case I like it a little spicy, which of course I do. When I got back to the gym, I had just about ten minutes to eat. I quickly opened up my bowl, dropped in some of the hot sauce and dished in some rice and stirred it up. Oh my sweet Jebus. It was wonderful. I quickly polished it off... I was full. My second stomach wished there was more, but some times you just have to tell that second stomach to be quiet. I really can't wait to go back, I know they have their fried chicken, they have their burritos... screw that.. I just want another Buddha Bowl.
