Highlight of this place: BYOB. The Tiger cry beef reminded me of korean bbq beef. When a tiger cries does is weep korean bbq sauce? I guess so. I ordered the thing before brocolli lover, same idea but with peanut sauce instead: meat + sauce over a bed of steamed (american not chinese) broccolli. It was ok but I really needed my fill of veggies so this did the trick. If I was staying longer in Chicago I'd definitely come back here and try one of their other 100+ dishes. The portions were perfect and surprisingly didn't feel full even after all that beer and rice.
