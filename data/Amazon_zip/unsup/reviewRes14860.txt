Great local restaurant. This is the place to visit if you are tired of national chain restaurant and looking for something different. The place itself is tiny with only counter and stools inside. But they have a few tables outside that's great for a sunny day. The food was excellent. We had the steak and pork dinner, yucca in garlic sauce and the guava pastry. Both dinners were good but next time I want to try the Cuban sandwich. I don't recommend the yucca though. It was like flavorless potatoes. The garlic sauce helped a little but still pretty bland. Pastry was very similar to an apple turnover.
