Wow. It might seem hard to justify spending nearly $700 for a 4 hour experience for two that doesn't put you at risk of jail time, but Alinea manages to do it and leave you craving for more. We had the 24 course meal and lost count after 6 as our taste buds drifted off into a post-coital bliss... only to perk up again when the next culinary invention was placed before our astounded eyes. And the next, and the next. It's truly a never-ending parade of little gastronomic orgasms that words cannot do justice to, and must be experienced to be understood. The service was impeccable, and while I resented the hard sell on wine pairings at first, I came to quickly realize that it really did complete the meal, and I'm glad I buckled to their overtures.
