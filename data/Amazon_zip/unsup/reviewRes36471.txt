I could honestly live off of Indie Cafe's delivery service. Eating there is really nice as well, though I could imagine it being very cramped on a busy night. The service is extremely friendly, and the portions are enough so you get plenty of leftovers (a must for Thai). The Crazy Basil Fried Rice is one of the most lovely dishes to ever grace my palate. Someday, I swear I will get something different. I've been telling myself that for the last year, but it hasn't happened. Oh well.
