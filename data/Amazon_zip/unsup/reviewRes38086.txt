Yes, I was a tourist. No, I had never had "real" deep dish Chicago pizza. Did I like it? Not really. The ingredients just didn't taste like quality for me. The small size was more than enough for 2 people to share...the bf and I had one slice left over and at the thought of eating it later, we didn't even want to take it home (a major shock for us!) I won't return here, and I wouldn't recommend it to other people.
