Just got back from dinner at Texas de Brazil... WORST service I've had in nearly 20 years here in Chicago. WORST. First off, we went because Megan got an email from TdB wishing her a happy birthday and inviting her to come in for dinner... 2 for1 for full dinners. So we follow the instructions, print out the letter, and present it to our server at the beginning of the meal, AS WE WERE TOLD TO DO. Big mistake. When we gave her the printed email, you would have thought we'd called her mother a whore. She kept pushing $90 bottles of wine when we asked about the house cocktails. Then she brought us the cocktails, but no water. We waited 15 minutes for the water, then finally flagged down a busboy. From this point on, we didn't see our waitress again until I asked a busboy for our check at the end of the meal. One of the FEW duties the server has is to bring you a plate to start so the meat can be delivered to your table. Had to ask for those, too... and she NEVER brought us clean plates.  Again, she only came over after our meal was over and we asked for our check... and THEN she asks if we wanted more cocktails (we did, half an hour earlier) or dessert (no, we wanted to get the HELL out of there). Also, I asked three separate servers if there would be any lamb coming around... half an hour after I started asking and long after we no longer had plates in front of us, someone finally brought some by. THAT was actually funny, because we had no plates or silverware at our table by that point. Look, the food and drinks are good. The restaurant is lovely. I'll never go back. I MUCH prefer Fogo de Chao. Suck it, Texas de Brazil.
