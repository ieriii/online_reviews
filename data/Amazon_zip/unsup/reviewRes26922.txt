Eat here! I just had my third visit to Frontera and it just never disappoints. Tourists- the wait here will be 1.5-2 hours! You won't see Rick Bayless, and you'll hate the food because it's not like ChiChis. Yes, go to the Weber Grill or "that place in the hotel"! We'll wait in the bar as you leave... Locals- Psst- the wait times you are quoted really won't be that long. Plus, you'll want to treat yourself to one of the Seasonal Margaritas like Cucumber, or the one with Rhubarb while you wait. Our quoted 1.5-2 hour wait at 5:30pm opening bell was around 30 minutes. Appetizers- Frontera Guacamole- nice and fresh and full of lime! Keep it at the table to top off your entrees. Herb Green Ceviche- big chunks of yellowtail in lime juice and it's green! This was excellent. Look for the Ceviche Trio served in cocktail glasses if you're in the mood to try a few. Entrees- Mole Trio- I love moles, and being able to try three at once was awesome. The current offering was a mole poblano enchilada, the pork coloradita, and roasted vegetables in green mole. The coloradita and the mole poblano were the best of the three. Our server Charles was great all night! I have no idea what the official name of the dish my dining partner ordered but Charles suggested a chicken dish on polenta for her, that was absolutely amazing. Since it was my birthday, my dining partner had conferred with Charles to do something special for dessert. Our Sopa de Frutas with rhubarb, pineapple and a sweet red broth had "Happy Birthday" written in chocolate on the side. What a nice touch. The dessert was refreshing and really sweet. I would love to come back to Frontera and make a meal out of the Street fare- there's a Trio of those, as well. And I look forward to many more special visits to Frontera!
