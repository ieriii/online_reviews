This place was great! We were on vacation in Chicago after coming from Madison and NW Wisconsin, and we were very tired of having typical WI breakfast of eggs and toast made in a bar/diner. It seems really popular, but they were able to seat us after a reasonable waiting period in the main room. All the waiters/waitresses/busboys there seem to be all working super hard because it is so packed! We had some AM drinks which were very good and full of healthy booze. I had the veggie hash and it was AWESOME! Broccoli and hash browns, soo good together. There were some bell peppers and other veggies thrown in there too, so very YUM. It was also served with two eggs and some really yummy marble rye; i think I could have also chosen wheat or sourdough, etc. If you live in Chicago, or you are just visiting, I would def recommend coming here.
