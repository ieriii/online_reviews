My boy friend and I went here sometime in September for a last minute "fancy shmancy" night out on the town. It was a Saturday night and we got here around 9pm (called for a last minute reservation but they were booked) so we had to wait a little while to be seated. The wait was shorter than we anticipated - which was nice - and we were seated at the sushi bar. This was my first time sitting at any sushi bar - so of course I was enthralled by the sushi chef's and their technique. I make sushi occasionally at home and you better believe I was eyeing them as they cut the most perfect sushi I've ever seen in my life. I think I got it down now... lol...not. Okay but anyway... It was my first time sitting at the sushi bar but I really did enjoy it. The sushi chefs were working diligently to serve the very crowded restaurant and yet their work still looked so delicious and perfect! It takes me nearly 5 minutes to cut one tuna roll at home... no joke.  The sushi was delicious! Very fresh and looked absolutely beautiful. Obviously it's a pricey place, so don't plan on leaving there with a bill for 2 at less than $100. It is also a LONG dinner type place - meaning don't expect to be in and out in less than an hour - try more like 2 hours+. However, it is well worth it. If not only for the delicious food, but for the people watching.  The people watching is almost better than at O'hare! I was captivated by the beautiful men and women... where did they come from?! I swear I never see this many beautiful people in Chicago... I'm pretty sure Sunda flew in the cast of Gossip Girl or something. Who knows..
