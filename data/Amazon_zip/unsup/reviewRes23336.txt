A friend of the bf suggested we meet at Icosium Kafe. Glad he did. I'd never had Moroccan food and it is YUMMY! Despite the awesome reputation for crepes, the bf and I ended up sharing the special, just because it sounded so intriguing. I can't remember what it was called, but it was essentially a chicken, stewed in a clay pot in a savory sauce that had olives, preserved lemons, sweet potatoes and other ingredients in it. I'm not quite used to having small whole lemons in my food, but I did very much enjoy the dish. I'd heard the coffee was amazing and yes, I'd have to agree that it is. However, since this place IS a creperie, the bf and I had to try the bannanas foster crepe. Outstanding! Oh yeah, no ice-cream at this location.
