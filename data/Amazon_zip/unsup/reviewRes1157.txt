Okay over 500 reviews...I feel silly adding my two cents, but I will anyway. Yes...you will wait in line. Yes...the line moves fast. Yes...it is worth it! Yes...they only take cash. Yes...they have very short hours of operation. Yes...it's a tiny little place, with limited seating. Yes...it is tubular, encased meat heaven. Yes...this place is a little gold mine for Doug. No...I will never try just a "Chicago Dog" here (they have too many unique ones to try) No...I have never been disappointed eating here. No...I have never tried the duck-fat fries, because I have never been here on a Friday or Saturday...but I will...one day. No...I am not too scared to try the "Foie Gras" Dog....just getting the nerve up!
