Although Violet Hour is not perfect for every outing or every guest, I give it an unabashed "woohoo" for the quality and the uniquity. If only that was a word. I guess all the rules give it a bit of a snooty mask, but it's channeling another time and another place, where I for one want to be.  For one, I'm in lust w/ the Alice in Wonderlust decor. Sitting in a make-shift "booth" is great for a date thing, so long as you've got plenty to say (think - you, your date, alone, traincar to timbuktu). Pretty f'n sexy but with the potential for great awkwardness. I recommend sitting up at the bar if there's a seat available, so you can watch the bartenders mix up the drinks with their own version of tender lovin care, medicine droppers and all. Even though the barstools are backless, they're roomy and surprisingly comfy.  Some of the professional mixers have a steampunked Christopher Reeves (circa "Somewhere in Time") air about them. Hmm... no complaints here. Every drink I've sipped (working very hard not to drink down in 3 minutes like I'm want to do) has been divine. And strong. They're well worth the $11 price tag, and the snacks are nothin' to frown upon either. Like everything else at this place, the food is totally unique. In a good way. A real good way.  The whole thing harkens back to another time, and I adore that. The only thing I'd like is for it to be a -teensy- bit louder. I don't want a crowded club vibe, no siree, but I wouldn't mind the music upped just ever so slightly. Oh, and I've only been on weedays. I've never gone on a weekend and never never never never never evah would. I've seen the lines, and I don't do lines.
