Planned a work dinner here and it was a great experience! The staff was super friendly and accomodating! The food is delicious and we had a mojito bar with fresh fruit... greatest thing ever! The rooftop space was fabulous and all the little spaces inside were great as well... A little pricey but most definitely worth checking out!
