Lounge area is cool but I've seen it before, it's nothing new...rooms are SO outdated and that god awful tacky shutter window looking into the bathroom...I get what they're trying to do but it ain't workin!..it just seems silly to me and like it's trying too hard.. I dunno..the W was cool back in the early early 2000's... there are far more cooler, nicer, hipper, newer hotels in Chicago I'd stay before here. And the hallways were dark and dingy. The W is for two type of folks....20-somethings OR Married folks who have been out of the scene for a LONG time, lives in the burbs with 3 kids, rarely goes out and are totally clueless about what is hip these days, so they come to the W because of the name.... And I'd be willing to bet they go to Howl at the Moon, The lodge and Dicks last Resort for a fun night out.
