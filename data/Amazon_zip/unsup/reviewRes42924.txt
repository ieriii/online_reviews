I was disappointed with their sausage. I ordered a deep-dish sausage and tomato pizza for delivery. This isn't good quality sausage. They use the small, round, cardboard-like texture "sausage" that you might find in a cheap frozen pizza. Not good... not good at all. If you can't even get SAUSAGE right, there's a problem.
