I only give this place three stars because of the beer selection other wise it would be two.This place is small and crowded. We came here on a Saturday at about 8pm with a total of four people. We were told that the wait would be an hour for a table to eat. So we decide to get beers from the bar. Fantastic selection. The only way I would ever come back here would be to drink from their impressive beer list and that would be it. We end up going upstairs to wait for a table. The upstairs has tables but they seem to be only for drinking and not eating. There's also a very very small bar up there that only sells bottled beer(no seating at the bar either). We end up standing for a good 25 minutes until a group gets up from a table and we take there seats. More than an hour rolls by. It was interesting because we had no idea how the hostess would actually find us when our table was ready...anyways. We send one of the members of our four top down stairs to ask the hostess when our table will be ready as it has been over an hour. She tells him that they are behind and that our table will be ready soon. He comes back up to tell as this and also tells us that names have been crossed off after ours...suspicious...Another 30 minutes rolls by, so we decide to all go down and stand right near the "hostess stand." We end up getting a table within 5 miinutes. We order the meatballs for our app which were just okay. It only comes with three and we weren't told this. I had the brisket with the mac and cheese, so did one other person in our party. My fiance had the brisket sandwich that came with fries, and the other member of our party had the mussels. Brisket wasn't anything to write home about, and I don't know what the hype is about the mac and cheese. It is flavorless and not good. We finish our meals(sort of) and leave pretty quickly. I would only maybe return to this place late night for a couple beers.
