I came here for my anniversary with my boyfriend. My only goal was to have a memorable eating experience as special as the occasion! Tru completely lived up to the expectation and more! The attention to detail was phenomenal. They had printed "Happy Anniversary" with my boyfriend's and my name on it at the top of our very own personalized menus! And at the end of the dinner they gave them to us in lovely envelopes for our future scrapbooking :) We loved it! The service was probably the best I've ever seen. From 2 waiters coming out simultaneously to pour our waters at the same time at the same rate to the elegant way they presented each of our dishes... amazing. There was never a missed step and the attention made it so that we felt like we were the only people in the restaurant. The waiters were also incredibly knowledgeable and kind, never rushing us to finish our plates and were never overbearing. The food was great to excellent. We got the prix fixe menus which we thought were actually reasonably priced with great options. I got the bay scallops wrapped in bacon - unbelievable. Probably my favorite dish of the evening! The scallops were cooked to perfection and had a lovely bacon flavor which was not too salty or overbearing. It was perfect. I got the prime beef ribeye for the main course which was also very good. Overall, a great experience and very nice for special occasions. Happy celebrating!
