Stayed here Christmas Eve and it was quite nice. The room had a lovely view of the river and the gorgeous architecture of Chicago. Nice big bed and good toiletries in the bathroom. Nothing stunning beyond recognition, but very nice. For a few bucks extra, breakfast was included. Big buffet (but the pancakes and French toast were cold). Overall, nice. Not very nice: no free wi-fi in the room. What kind of nonsense is that?!
