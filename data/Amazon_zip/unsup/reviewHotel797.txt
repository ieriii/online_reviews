yes, this is what a moderately expensive hotel is supposed to be. it is always always always the same; service, rooms, healthclub (well that's actually been upgraded in the past few years). you can't find a nicer valet guy...wish i could remember his name cuz he always remembers mine, like a scene from a movie. not that i even stay there thaaaaat often but this older gentleman always says, "Ms. my last name, you're back. Good to see you. How's Champaign?" the crowd here is so focused on work that you never feel like wishing it was ok to shush people...everyone is already shushed. i've never had a single bad experience here.
