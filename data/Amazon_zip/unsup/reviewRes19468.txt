This is a fabulous place if you end up there with an ugly date---dim lighting my friends! Checked out Coast the other night with some friends and absolutely love that they are BYOB along with no corkage fee! Service was great and for as trendy as it was, it wasn't too terribly loud. My only gripes was the amount of sushi I got with the White Dragon Roll (which tasted absolutely amazing), it seemed like only a few pieces for 13 bones. But then again, I live in Charlotte where you get alot more bang for your buck. Other gripe-onesie bathrooms. I felt like they need one of this ticket dispensers they have at the deli counter there since the line got ridiculously long. Don't waste time circling around for parking--valet it for only $10!
