We took my parents there last month during their visit here. It was also our first time going here. We have gone to other Brazilian Restaurants in the city and nothing compares to this one. Food was amazing. Great selection of meats and salad bar had good options. The staff was very attentive and helpful. It was on the expensive side but well worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant.
