I was in the basement of Gage for a private dinner party and could not have been more impressed.  Gage does Gastropub in the best possible way - they do delicious, approachable food with interesting, unexpected twists. Cinnamon salad dressing, beet salad with tart, juicy grapefruit wedges, tuna tartar on perfectly ripe watermelon slices, and duck confit stuffing were just some of the highlights. Moreover, the staff was fantastic - professional, friendly, and attentive.   Somehow, Gage managed to be both fabulously pretentious and wonderfully comfortable at the same time. So basically - 5 stars!
