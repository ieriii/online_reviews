Let me begin by saying if you find Wing Stop and Hooters to have awesome wings...don't go here! The wings at Crisp actually have some thought and care put into them and mediocre pallets might be overwhelmed if prematurely exposed to such well crafted food. The flavors were well conceived and the Bee Bim Bob was awesome. Without getting into too much detail about the ease at which I ordered and ate to the presentation which was simple and refined the place rocked. Definitely a must return.
