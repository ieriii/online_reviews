This place was sooo much fun and great! If only they took reservations...it would be perfect.  It is in a very very small space. There are a lot of tables and a lot of people filling those tables. In the center there is a long table where you may some strangers sharing their table. This is NOT a good date place...but good for small groups. But beware it is very loud. The food was amazing!!! Note: This is more of place where you share...everything is small plates. So if you are bad at sharing, do not come here. Now getting back to the food...I can't remember everything that we had. But there was eggplant smear with toasted bread and goat cheese.....by far my favorite thing on the menu. The eggplant was not over-seasoned and marinated to perfection. My mouth is watering right now thinking about it. We also had some type of pork dish and the meat just melted in your mouth...it was cooked to perfection!!
