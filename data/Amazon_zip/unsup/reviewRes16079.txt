I've wanted to go to Carnivale for a LONG TIME, & I'm happy to say it did NOT disappoint! The food was amazing! Perfectly seasoned; no need to add salt or pepper. They're so confident about that aspect that they don't even put salt or pepper on the tables! :-) For apps we had the mixto ceviche, guac, ropa vieja, empanada, & jamon. The ropa vieja was our fav & the ceviche was delish! I enjoyed my main course which was the Chuleta, but my bf's Churrasco was beyond words. It's a great piece of meat, perfectly cooked to order, and a very generous portion. Other dishes ordered: Salmon special, Flank Steak special, Halibut, & Arrachera. Everyone was happy and finished their plates. The server was knowledgeable, helpful, & ever present when we needed anything. Drinks were good as well. I highly recommend the Caipirinha; similar to a margarita, but less sweet. (Great drink for those who tend to guzzle.) The decor is vibrant but not ostentatious. The overall theme is very colorful but in warm tones with over-sized accessories. Our table was great and we were seated promptly with our 6 pm reservation. You don't get to officially check in until your entire party is there. You can make your reservation online through their website, and any adjustments to the reservation can be done through the same process. You do have to "register" on the webhost that they use called OpenTable, but it's not inconvenient imo. We had 5 apps, 9 drinks, and 6 main courses for an average per person of $57.50 (including the crazy Cook county tax of $34.19). They included an additional gratuity of 18% and made it very clear that it was included so an additional tip was your choice. Overall I'm thrilled with our experience, and will definitely be going back!
