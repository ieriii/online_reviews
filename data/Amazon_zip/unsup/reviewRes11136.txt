I went here with some co-workers on a weekend sometime early 2011. Wait was long, about hour and 40 minutes. I've never heard of The Bongo Room until one of my co-workers mentioned that we should all meet up for brunch. Brunch was okay - I had the Eggs Benedict with one Red Velvet Pancake. I liked that you could just order one pancake, instead of having to order an entire stack and feel like a pig after eating everything. Food was okay, nothing too memorable. I remember not liking my pancake. It was a bit dense and not as light and fluffy as I hoped. Didn't have the red velvet flavor I thought it would have. Orange juice was overpriced, and it didn't taste like it was freshly juiced. Nothing I hate more than having to pay for overpriced juice I can get from a store.
