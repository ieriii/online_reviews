My partner and I order from Indie Cafe pretty often--probably once every 2 weeks or so. We have always loved their food, and we have eaten in the restaurant and appreciate that it is BYOB. Unfortunately, we have recently had problems with their delivery/carry-out service. A couple of months ago, we picked up carry-out dinner from Indie. When we were turning onto our street to go home, Indie called and said that they had given us the wrong order. By this time, it was too late to turn around and go back to get the right food. Tonight, we ordered delivery. Again, Indie messed up our order and delivered the wrong food. It was almost 10pm when we got our food, so by the time we figured out that the wrong food was delivered we did not want to wait for new meals to be prepared. On both occasions, the restaurant has given us store credit for the mistake without argument. I think that is the right thing for them to do, but I wish they would find a way to keep this mistake from happening in the first place. If not, we will have to find a new favorite Thai place.
