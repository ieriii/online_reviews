8 freaking stars. Not 5. Perhaps it IS the colored blue and red light bulb eyes on the roof mounted wiener couple. Maybe its all about design here, the boxes, the car hop...Whatever. Dude, there is simply no denying the fact that the hot dogs here are wonderful, and the Whoopskiburger is hands down the best damn burger you could bite into. A little shake after-wards, the green tomato/Whoopskidawg burp...a grease nap. You can live on this stuff, why wait in a blockbuster line for a "Hot Doug" when you can throw it in park and have Chicago's best hot dog clipped to your window via tray and smiling carhopstress? These people don't give a damn if you put ketchup on it either! I love me some Superdawg.
