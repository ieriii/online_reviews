Wonderful Brunch Place with quite a loooooooooooong wait though! I'm a huge Eggs Benedict Fan -- and you can definitely find some unique eggs benedict-like dishes here! mmmmmm.... yummy! Try the Banana-Chocolate-Pancake Signature dish -- but share it with folks b/c it tastes more like dessert than brunch food!
