Had a 9:00pm reservation and we weren't seated until 9:45. To be honest, I didn't mind all that much. However, the place was packed to the brim with people (definitely violating fire code) and the staff does absolutely nothing to try to restore order or control the crowd. Everyone packs in like sardines into any open space they can, so that half the diners have a crowd of people practically hovering over their meals. Might be worth eating here when it isn't crowded, but I have no idea when that is, and don't really care to find out.
