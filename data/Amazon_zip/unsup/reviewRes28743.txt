I came here last week with a girlfriend of mine. I was having a terrible day, this visit did not make it better. I originally had planned to go to Roseded but they were over capacity so we came here. We came in, they sat us. We waited... AND waited... AAAAAND WAITED. I literally thought I was being punk'd because I was there for about 20 minutes before the server rushed over to us ready to take our order. How about some water please? Can I please have some water first? So he leaves aggravated w me and comes back in a flash w my water. I noticed they didn't have Mongolian beef on the menu, which I know is a Chinese dish... but they do at Roseded, so I inquired about it and he acted like he didn't know what it was. So I explained what it was, (beef, green onions, broccoli, etc) and asked if he could recommend me something similar. THIS guy told me he was NOT Chinese and stormed away. o_O Okay what just happened? Did I offend him? i just wanted some food!!! I was starving and this place was losing my respect by the minute. How did I offend him by asking him to recommend something to me by describing the ingredients that were in a dish that I wanted o_O I was all over confused. The chicken satay was good. I wish I could say more about the place. The art was awesome. I sat under a picture of a beautiful woman who looked like a powerful Queen of some sort. I'm sure had I gone on a night when I wasn't so frustrated, I would've been able to shrug this off and laugh at this guy, but Opart just didn't do it for me. It was a terrible experience and I wont be coming back. :(
