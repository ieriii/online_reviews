This is STILL the real deal. I honestly haven't had better mozzarella di bufala in Chicago, and when you're hankering for Italy, it'll bring you right back. The crust is right (every bite of my pizza, every whiff of its aroma, made me feel Italy again), and the olive oil is Italy, distilled.  I just can't quibble with this place; and I think that if you've spent any significant amount of time in Italy, you can't either. It IS Italy, brought right here to Chicago. It's a gift.
