Oh my, Hopleaf is one fantastic bar! Lookin' for great imported & hard to find beers?: check. Want a cool place to hang out, with a nice atmosphere & even better lighting?: check. Itching for a bar that has a legitimate "no smoking" section?: check. Praying to show off your beer snobbery by drinkin' that Leffe in the proper glass?: check. Thinkin' about coupling your beer with some delicious food?: check. Obviously, I could go on...but I am kinda running out of verbs. If you haven't been to Hopeleaf, do yourself a favor and go. You'll thank me, I promise...unless, of course, you prefer Bud Lite and buffalo wings...
