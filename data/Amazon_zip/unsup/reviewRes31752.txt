I really wanted to hate this place.  It's got the same kind of douchey and pretentious trendy clientele...and staff...as Sushi Samba, but the food is actually really good. Rolls are good, but probably not any better than your local favorite (mine is Toro). The entrees are amazing. Try the beef lollipops, seared tuna, and my personal favorite --- the garlic noodles with blue crab.
