Cutesy bright little restaurant. Good for breakfast and full of organic eats for people who care about that sort of thing. Menu skews a bit Mexican for breakfast, and then takes a detour to homestyle southern American later in the day. The stuffed french toast was way, way too sweet for my taste but everything else looked so good that I'd go back.
