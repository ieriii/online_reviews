I already went once by myself and had a media noche (standard cuban sandwich on sweet bread, and some sweet plaintains). It was amazing This weekend I went with my fiance and we got the following: 1. Lechon Sandwich: roast pork, plantains, grilled onions, romain lettuce, garlic sauce 2. Media noche 3. fried yucca: similar to a french fry but even tastier with the homemade hot sacue (http://www.foodreference) 4. two cafe con leche (cuban espresso with milk) 5. bread pudding 6. cuban coffee (its made with sugar mixed with the coffee and has a unique sweet taste) This is one of my new favorite places.
