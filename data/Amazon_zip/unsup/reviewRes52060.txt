Amazing pizza and the waiter we had was pretty darn good considering he probably had 15 tables with 4-6 people each. He was really on his game. The place is a must stop in Chicago. Kids and adults can write on pretty much anything in the place. My only complaint was they were out of almost all thier Tshirts. But they can be bought online. You will have to wait a minimum of 45 minutes for your pizza from the time you place your order but the spaghetti comes out right away! When we went there was not wait. When we left there was a line out the door so go before 5 if you dont want to wait. It's not the cheapest but well worth the stop if visiting.
