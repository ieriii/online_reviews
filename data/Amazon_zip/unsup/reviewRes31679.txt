Sunda was fantastic! I had a reservation for 6:30pm on a Saturday night. We arrived at 7 due to bad traffic and they were extremely pleasant and seated us immediately. I had called ahead to let them know we were running late, but they have a 15 minute late policy, which they were lenient about. The food was amazing - every dish was delicious; the black cod practically melted in my mouth. The side of cauliflower is good, as is the Rainbow Roll. The char siu was very fatty, but when we told a manager, they changed it out for a leaner one. Atmosphere was noisy, yet casual and comfortable. The tall tables weren't very comfortable to sit on, and I had nowhere to put my purse. I would recommend coat check at the door. Loved it and would definitely go again.
