You know the food is good when you uncontrollably blurt out obscenities after putting it in your mouth. Bonus points for the venue when the table next to you is not only amused by the outburst but insists on ordering the same thing solely based on my reaction. In my case the dish was the steak tartare on toast., the outburst was 'holy sh*t amazeballs."  This routine was repeated again after trying the Bone Marrow on Toast, the hand rolled Gnocchi and the roasted Chicken. Now normally I wouldn't order chicken at a restaurant because it is just that, chicken. But this was different. The generous portion was succulent and juicy, skin on and melt in your mouth delish. The cocktails were equally good, I strongly recommend the Pimm's Cup.  The interior decor was beautiful, dim edison bulbs and artistic chandeliers dimly lit the comfortable tables and booths. Service was top notch, the waiter made solid recommendations and made sure that we loved our meal.
