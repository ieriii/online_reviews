I went to this place because it was given such great reviews. I regret it to this day. With reservations had to wait 45 min. Got seated and had no elbow room. i could have picked off of the table. The bill was outrageous compared to other similar places. Atmosphere is ok but the seating arrangement kills it. Cant have a romantic time. Recommend the melting pot instead.
