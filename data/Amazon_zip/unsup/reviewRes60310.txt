Although the staff is pleasant and smiling (as mentioned in Time Out), I couldn't believe that when I wanted extra sauce for a dish I had already ordered and was in the midst of eating, they stated it was an additional $2. Really?? You're kidding, right! The same for additional pot sticker sauce! I would never return because of this penny pinching policy.
