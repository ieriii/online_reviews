There are so many Italian restaurants in this city that it's hard to stand out from the pack. Sapori tends to blend in, but it's worth going for a decent meal that delivers enough bang for your buck (I've gone home with leftovers both times I've dined there). I recommend going in the summer so you can dine alfresco, but the interior is nice as well. Tables are lit by candles, which gives it a romantic vibe.  The wait staff was fairly attentive as well.
