I don't know why there are so many haters for this place. I got $50/night deal off Expedia, and had a great experience for that price. Sure the place is a little run-down, but give me a historic hotel with some cosmetic faults and the occasional broken light over a modern eyesore for $200 anyday. Recommend!
