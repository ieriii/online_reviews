OVERALL:4.5  FOOD:5  SERVICE:4  AMBIANCE:4.5  VALUE:4.5 Who leaves Cali to fly thousands of miles into a Midwest summer sauna only to wait 1.5 hours for....Mexican food?! Oh right, I do! But for fresh BAKED churros, Spicy Spanish drinking chocolate, AND homemade vanilla ice cream? And all after some scrumptious grilled goat barbacoa torta & 3 salsa varieties? Who WOULDN'T??!? Rick Bayless, I don't know you from Adam, but you make one mean torta! *If you bring a huge posse, be warned that they won't take your order until there's actually room to seat the whole party, so dividing & conquering can prevent having to salivate over all the delicious food you're NOT eating while in line.
