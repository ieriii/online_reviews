The brownie dessert (with vanilla ice cream on the side and hot fudge in a separate little cup to be drizzled on top, naturally) was simply meant to be for my two friends and me - the dish, as it turns out, includes three generous brownie squares. Score! That means three happy girls and no fighting over who gets the biggest severed slice. The pot roast was tender, juicy and out of this world - it felt like I was eating meat wrapped in rainbows and full-body orgasms. Hot people abound here, also. Just make sure to book a rez! The only thing I didn't like (hence four stars instead of five) was how rushed we felt once we ordered dessert - our waitress dropped off the check before we even took a second bite. Look, I get that this place is hot and busy, but at least let your diners make it far enough through dessert to breathe a contented "Mmmm" before you try to shoo them from the table to make room for your next guests.
