Grabbed a late dinner here once and it was pretty good. Ate outside, though it was kinda crowded we got seated right away. The food was good, the rice and plantains were high five worthy. Service wa alright, even though the server forgot our drinks and Empanadas, which are great, they are like Hot Pockets but you don't feel like your going to die after eating them. Not too pricey, and the outside seating is awesome. They were cranking Cuban tunes which made me feel like I was in an episode of 'Dexter', minus the murdering or naked body of John Lithgow. I'd come back here for sure. Wooo!!
