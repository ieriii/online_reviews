I finally had dinner at Frontera Grill, and it was delicious. We had a 5:45 dinner reservation on a Tuesday night, and we were seated immediately. The place was already packed, which surprised me at such an early time. Service was prompt, but not pestery. We had guacamole and chips for an appetizer, and I think I would've been satisfied just with that. It was amazing. For my entree I had the tacos al carbon with chicken. The chicken was delicious and juicy -- and not too spicy, which is fine with me. The portion seemed small when I saw it on the plate, but it was more than filling. Instead of dessert I had the chocolate mezcalero, which is a combination of mezcal and Mexican hot chocolate. It was a nice alternative to coffee and dessert. It was more expensive than I'm used to spending on dinner, and it wasn't the overwhelmingly amazing experience some people rave about, but I would likely return for a special-occasion dinner now and then.
