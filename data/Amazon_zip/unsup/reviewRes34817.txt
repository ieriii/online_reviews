Yummy, cheap, and fast. The decor is nice and they have outdoor seating although, some of the tables outside are wobbly. It's also BYOB and they have lots of vegan items. The staff aren't particularly friendly in general but they've never been rude. Remember to bring cash as they do not accept cards.
