saganaki too salty, beef and chicken shishkabobs portion too small (pricey basically) but the gyros were AMAZING. i havent had any other food in greektown to compare it to, so i'm not help there but there was a ton of meat, lots of cucumber sauce which is my favorite and enough onions. only gave me one slide of tomato though which was kind of odd... i would have liked another pita but oh well
