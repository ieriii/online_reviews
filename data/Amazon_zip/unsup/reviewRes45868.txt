I like this place, it's not super awesome or anything but it's nice. I had the pasta pommasomething, it and one other pasta dish were the only ones that were vegetarian. I chose this one because the other had olive oil in it. It was good. It looked like it wouldn't taste good *if that makes any sense* but it was pretty tasty. To the ladies wearing high heels THIS IS THE SLIPPERIEST FLOOR I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF WALKING ON! I couldn't even do my little strut for fear of breaking my face. All in all this place is nice, the food is nice the waiters are nice the view from the seats near the window are nice, it's just a nice place. Lol like this one guy here said, it's a classier TGIFriday's.
