My favorite cuisine is Italian. I also love BYOB's. I figured at some point, I would be able to combine these two awesome styles of restaurants. But in my own NEIGHBORHOOD? Right under my nose?  I love the decor and the lighting. I also love the fact that it was 8:00 on a Friday night and hubby and I didn't have to wait.  Hubby is a sucker for service, as am I. Our waiter was phenomenal. He also had a side-of-his-mouth grin that made me want to order anything he told me to. When he said "garlic bread appetizer special with fresh mozzarella on top," I said "YES YES YES" Speaking of bread, they give you a lot, and offer you fresh minced garlic to go with it. MMM. Hubby loves Chicken Vesuvio, so he ordered that, which is just like any other place's Chicken Vesuvio. That might reassure some people. I could care less because I go for pasta! I decided to take a chance and go with a dish on the specials list. It was chicken breasts with portabella mushroom ravioli in a mushroom sauce. It ended up not being the best choice for ME personally because the sauce was soooooo rich. It made for great leftovers the next day though when I wasn't stuffed from eating so much bread :) Next time, when we're back (and yes we will be) I will be ordering some kind of pasta dish with red sauce to cut down on the richness! We were too stuffed for dessert so I can't really comment but I'm sure it's just as amazing as the rest of the food! Lastly, the only negative comment I have is that the portions are huge, and it's pricey. Entrees run from $17-$23 and they charge you an extra $8 to split an entree. Ouchies. Still worth checking out!
