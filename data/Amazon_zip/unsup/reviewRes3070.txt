Definitely should have consulted Yelp before ordering, because the portions here are gigantic. The girlfriend and I were concerned that 5 wings and a Bad Boy Buddah Bowl wouldn't be enough, so we added a small order of fries for good measure. Ten minutes later, we were gaping at the size of the wings and the mountain of fries that somehow qualifies as a "small." We had the Crisp BBQ sauce, which was sweet and sticky, with just enough spice and smokey aftertaste. The Buddah Bowl was also larger than expected and easily seasoned with the soy sauce and siracha that grace every table. We'll be returning sometime soon to try another sauce and to bring some beverages to pair with our meal. Come here with an appetite, otherwise you'll be asking for a to-go box halfway through the meal.
