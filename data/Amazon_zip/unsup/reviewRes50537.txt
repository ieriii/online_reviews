A great new spot, especially for breakfast (as if Andersonville needs more of those, with Pauline's, Ann Sather's, Kopi, etc.)! I went for weekend breakfast. They serve Beignet covered in powdered sugar (just like at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans), which were great. We had the ginger sweet tea; it seems expensive at $3.50, but the presentation and quantity more than make up for the perceived cost (heck, Starbucks charges more for coffee). It's served in a tall carafe with at least three glasses worth of tea, with the flavor syrup in a smaller carafe nested in the larger, so you can mix your own. My girlfriend had the shrimp biscuits and gravy, which she enjoyed, and I had the sweet potato biscuits with andouille sausage. Delicious (certainly heavy for breakfast, but just the right portion). Overall a very pleasant experience. Southern hospitality is alive and well at Big Jones. A creative culinary twist on classic coastal southern fare.
