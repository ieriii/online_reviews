This place is so overrated. I don't get it. Against my better judgement I went back for a second try with a friend that wanted to try it. No different. The food is ok, but there are other Italian places in the neighborhood that are just as good, have better service, and you can actually hear the person sitting across the table from you.  Oh, and I thought the wine list was a bit pretentious for a place that is supposed to be a "neighborhood" dining room. No house wine? A lot of people seem to like it here, but I don't think I'll go back.
