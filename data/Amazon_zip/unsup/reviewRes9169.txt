This place deserves all the kudos it has received. The atmosphere is pretty chill, the service is prompt and friendly and the food speaks for itself. Great authentic Persian food right on the North side, I never woulda guessed. I tried the koubideh, chicken kabab, prime rib kabab, gourma sebzi, regular and dill rice and bomieh and baklava...all delicious and flavorful. The chicken and beef especially was super juicy. Everything with beer came out to be under $40, so awesome value! Highly recommended.
