Came here expecting well prepared steak and lamb and was disappointed with the food, it was good, but for the price I was expecting excellent. The seasoning seemed a bit off and the waitstaff was confused and slow. The sangria I must say was excellent and the bar was well prepped and the bartender knew how to make just about everything.
