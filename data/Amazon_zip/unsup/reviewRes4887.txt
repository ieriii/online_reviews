I'm not a fan of "Michigan Ave" touristy restaurants. This isn't one of them!! This is a real gem. Although the hostess didn't have a clue of what she was doing, we were told 90 minutes for a table, and 3 minutes later another person in our group asked and she said 40 minutes. We were seated in 20 minutes. The food was incredible. The turkey leg was huge. The shoulder steak was cooked perfect. The milk braissened shoulder was incredible. Bone marrow......very rich and flavorful. They have an extensive wine list. Very nice place.
