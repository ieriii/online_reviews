I had a deep dish with mushroom, spinach, and sausage. It's just average. Nothing very special about the crust or the topping. If anything the tomato sauce flavor is too overwhelming that it really doesn't matter what topping I put on there. It just tastes like tomato. The wheat beer I had, 193, I think? That was very good.
