Another place that people rave about. These places usually have me walk away thinking "Well, the food is good, not fantastic." and "I could do with a change of ambiance." Piece is no exception. The pizza is really good but it doesn't blow my mind. The beer is so-so. Decent for a brewery on site but how it's winning awards is a bit beyond me. I've been to some great micro breweries though so maybe I'm spoiled. It's also usually very crowded with a mixture of hipsters and bros. Go on a weeknight - and early.
