Overall, I found this place pretty bland. Went for breakfast with my wife, sister-in-law and nephew and nothing was outright delicious, all just so-so. Serve-yourself coffee was lukewarm and not great; a little stale. I had a breakfast burrito that was so innocuous it almost put me to sleep.  They really had nothing on the menu for my nephew to eat either -- he's five, he wanted pancakes, but they were "pre-mixed" so he couldn't get them without the bananas and toffee. He got a slice of chocolate pound cake instead, but that was pretty dry (he let me try a bite). I mean, if a five-year old isn't too interested in your chocolate cake, that might be a sign something isn't quite right.  Something weird also happened while we were there. A very nice woman greeted us when we stepped in, and told us it would be a minute wait. OK, obviously no problem. It was a semi-busy weekday. But then, shockingly, she went over and asked two women (who were already sitting and eating) to get up and move from a four-top to a two-top so we could have their table. Hard to complain about that since we got in faster, but... still surprising. And I felt like sort of an ass the entire time, because we had disrupted their breakfast. Weird. Two stars for being cheap and quick, but I'll probably stick to some of my other favorite breakfast spots around this part of town. Can't speak on the lunch menu.
