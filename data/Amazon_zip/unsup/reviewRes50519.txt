This is probably more like a 3.5 star review for me. We stopped in this past weekend and were happy to see that there was no wait for a table. Almost unheard of for brunch these days. We started with coffee, which was really good. For our meals, I had the nc crab cakes which came with two eggs, cheese grits, hollandaise sauce, and a corn muffin. The grits were awesome. They brought me back to my business trip meals in Mobile, AL. Good constancy with a nice cheesy taste. The corn muffin was also really tasty. My wife even asked for an extra one to go. The crab cakes were ok, a little bland though. My wife had the benedict with the Andouille hash. I wasn't a big fan of this one. I just didn't like the hash that much. One last note, our server was great. Francisco, I think? He was right on time with the coffee refills and check. Really just perfect timing throughout. I'd come back to try a few other things along with the corn muffin, cheese grits, and coffee.
