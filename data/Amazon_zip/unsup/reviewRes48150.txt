I've never had such a great brunch in my entire life. Even before digging into my meal, I took a picture of my food that, based on its responses from Facebook, could have earned a 4-star review based on just looks. Came with a group of around 10 friends towards the end of the brunch service, 1:30 on Sunday. We were a little bummed to hear that they had run out of Publican bacon (noooooo) but we washed away our sorrows with the unique "publican mimosa", made from a weiss beer rather than champagne. I had the most wonderful pork belly bibimbop that totally blew me away. I had never expected a dish to be so savory, so spicy, and so gorgeous all at once. The egg was perfectly fried, with a slightly runny yellow, that when combined with the perfectly tender seasoned pork belly was heavenly. If it seems like I'm using too excited of words now, you should have heard me while I was eating this! The best part about the experience was the perfect level of service. Our waiter was extremely patient, made many recommendations, made sure that our glasses were never empty (including coffee), and otherwise was great. The cherry on top, though, was not adding her own automatic gratuity, something I never would have believed for a group this size. Thankfully the group agreed with me and we tipped far more than she would ever have mandated. All I can say is that I can't wait to bring more of my friends and family in here- I've got quite the backlog after just a simple photo of bibimbop!
