CASH ONLY We arrived for lunch and were seated right away by an incredibly cheery server who was pretty on point as the lunch crowd was filing in fairly quick. We received our water and he took a drink order arriving back with chips and salsa to take our meal order. Nice spicy salsa that had the right amount of kick without being to overpowering. I went with the Pepito sandwich. Great blend of steak (or chicken) thick sauteed onions, cheese, beans, and Lizano sauce. What is the Lozano Sauce you ask... sweet and spicy deliciousness. My buddy had the Casado which looked fantastic too.  Food was great, service was on point, and the prices were more than fair for the amount of food served... nice overall experience. CASH ONLY
