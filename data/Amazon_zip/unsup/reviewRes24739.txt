Ugh. I can't believe I have to say this: I got food poisoning after eating here on 1/12/11. Now, of course, I can't be 100% sure- because I cannot go back in time and test the scallops that I suspect were the cause of my illness- but I'm fairly certain that Geja's was the reason I was singing out of both ends (at the same time) the night after eating there. I have never had food poisoning before in my life, so I definitely did my research and read about it first before deciding to point the finger at an innocent restaurant. Here are some other reasons why our experience was just, meh. *Our reservation was for 8:30- we waited for 30 minutes, so we sat down at 9. (Also, don't blame things on Groupon Geja's- you chose to put one out there, figure out how to deal with it.) *Our coats smelled like food and oil (and still do) after leaving, and after they had been hanging in the coat check (for which we tipped for) all night. *Our waitress, although very pleasant and friendly, may as well have been reading from a script. She told us everything we needed to know about the food and the fondue process as though someone had pressed a button on her robot back.  *The smell of Sterno pots takes away from eating the food. They don't really add much to the flavor of the meal. So, the food was just ok, I almost freakin' died, and we left smelling gross. Not exactly something I want to remember again for my birthday dinner. We won't be going back again. Sorry Geja's, you guys have some work to do. I am admittedly being a bit tough on you as well because I have to drink Pedialyte all day.
