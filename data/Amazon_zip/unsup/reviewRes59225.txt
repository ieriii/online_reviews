I don't think I will ever go back! I have been a long time customer and wanted to stop by to check out the new location Saturday night. It was a disaster from the moment I walked into the door!The restauarant is much larger, but lacks service and wait staff. Why would you open a larger restaurant and not be prepared? It took us forever to order our food. We were there for almost 3 hours. The food was very salty. No one offered any apology for the long wait. I hope they get their act together sooner than later. Good luck if you still want to check it out!
