Geja's is a little too dark and close for me. I've been there three times, and everywhere I've sat has been cramped. The selection of dipping sauces is very good, and it can be fun to essentially cook your own food, but for the price I would prefer a chef with more experience. It is nice to visit every so often, though. I will probably be back, just not for awhile.
