The friend I was visiting in Chicago raved about this place, even though it's not close to her neighborhood. We fortunately arrived a tad after 10am on Monday (MLK holiday) and found only a couple spots available. We took the last 2 bar seats and received ice water immediately. We decided to split the breakfast burrito and the peanut butter banana chocolate pancakes, which were INCREDIBLE. Huge portions are easy to split. Each entree was approx $10/each, which is so reasonable for the warm fun atmosphere, delicious food, and humongous portions. There are also cute little shops in the area that you can check out while waiting in the long lines for a table.
