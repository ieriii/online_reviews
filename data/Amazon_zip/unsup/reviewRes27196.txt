My co-workers were kind enough to take me to this place for what they said was "the best" Mexican food (besides home cooked food obviously). Good Lord. I left with my stomach being full beyond belief. I'm not usually the type to just keep eating regardless of how full I might feel. But this place brought that side out of me. The main room when you walk in is just way too crowded for my taste so I suggest going through the hallway on the right to one of the other two rooms. The seating is relatively tight but nothing too crazy. After our waitress promptly took our order, she brought out a complimentary dish which had a big slice of potato and a meatball on it. I have to admit, I hesitated for a moment because I didn't understand the correlation between the two. But I ate it. Oh my gosh. I've never had a potato cooked so perfectly before. The meatball was so moist. And the sauce that both were cooked in...yum! For a main course, I decided that I was going to stray a little from my usual choice of enchiladas with cheese. Ok maybe I didn't stray too far because I got three enchiladas suizas (with mole sauce). With that, you get refried beans and rice. For starters, I do not eat refried beans. They just don't look right. However, these were amazing. They weren't mushed up completely like I'm used to seeing. The mole sauce was unbelievably good. I cleaned the plate. And all for $6. I honestly wasn't expecting to have such a great experience at this place. Its definitely one of my top choices for lunch! By the way, its cash only.
