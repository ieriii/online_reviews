Typically If I hear the word Bayless I jump a notch. Now I hear the word and I groan inwardly. That's because I decided to go there on a Saturday, getting there around 5pm and still having to wait 2 hours to eat. What happens in 2 hours? 5 of their margaritas enter my belly making me plowed and obnoxious and forgetful of what the food tasted like. I remember the salsa and guac. I suggest eating the guac at Xoco, cuz that green gob will set you back $9.00 otherwise. Still very delicious, but a little pricey. The drinks are sadly fantastic. I think I was drunk off of 2, but I just kept drinking away. My suggestion: don't make an effort to try every drink on the menu, like I did. Not only will you be drunk and still hungry, but you will be broke. The food: a hazy experience. That's because by the time I finally ate it, It was like 8 pm, around 3 hours after we had arrived. I had the Swordfish, it was amazing. So was the rest of the food. However, I do suggest making reservations unless you're in the mood to be a lush like I was that night. Man, did I hurt the next day. Definitely worth a visit, but I suggest heading over to Xoco and trying some of their snacks if you have to endure an endless wait, which is typical of this place.
