I enjoy vegetarian food and this place has got a lot of it. I try to go every time I'm in the area. Its pretty busy considering Chicago isn't the most veggie friendly place so the few we do have are well known and often packed. The food isn't the best, but its completely veggie/vegan friendly and its mostly classic diner food which means lots of fake meat and twists to typically meat dishes. Its still greasy and still heavy, but meat free. The food can sometimes be a hit or miss depending on who's cooking. I've gotten the same dish more than once and each time it was a little different. The vegan shakes and desserts are excellent. If you're not into the food just try their sweets. Although its pretty pricey for greasy diner food so be ready to put down some dolla.
