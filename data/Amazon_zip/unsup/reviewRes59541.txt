The BEST Korean Restaurant.I go here every time I go to Chicago...They give you tray full of sides (different kinds of kimchis) & miso soup with most dishes.The only thing I dislike would be their parking space... It's soo small, I feel like, my car will get a scratch from parking there. (but that's not gonna affect their food)In the end, their food is excellent. P.S. They are open until 5am. That's gotta be the best.
