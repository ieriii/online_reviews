Great beer, decent food (nothing to go gaga over) would def make it a regualr spot if I lived locally. Great service by the bartender. Could have done without the creep customer that appeared to be coked out at the bar staring at my friends boobs the entire time, he could have at least bought us a drink instead of just staring lecherously at her. All in all a good experience, but the popcorn was nothing to write home about and I was expecting that to wow me.
