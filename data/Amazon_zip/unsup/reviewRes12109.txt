I have had Cuban food plenty of times from home made by Cubans to a restaurant with chefs that came from Cuba, and this place is not so great. The beans didn't taste right. Too runny, lack of flavor, and not nearly enough for my Ropa Vieja dish. Not enough rice either. My Ropa vieja was on the dry side, and lacked flavor, severely. Their plantains were delicious, but doesn't make up for the entire dish being lackluster. Obviously I am working backwards, so...the chorizo stuffed dates (appetizer) wrapped with bacon were very good. I don't know if this is an "authentic" cuban dish, but it was a daring move and worth it. The goat cheese appetizer was also great. I didn't have one, but my friend said the Mojito was very good. Bottom line, nice and attentive staff, trendy joint with trendy prices as well. Verdict - save your money and hit a cuban sandwich shop - there WILL be more flavor for less money.
