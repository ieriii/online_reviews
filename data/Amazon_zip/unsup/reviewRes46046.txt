I was brought to Grand Lux Cafe by a good friend. I walked in and it brought on a very "Cheescake Factory"-esqe appeal. It was packed full of families and tourists, and rightly so for its location.  The menu was quite large (correction - huge) but I opted for the lunch sandwich combo. I got 1/2 chicken salad sandwich (quite tasty and not entirely dripping with mayo), a cup of soup and a "side salad" which was basically a bed of mixed greens and 2 cherry tomatoes for $9.95. Not bad. I opted for the cream of asparagus soup, which was lighter than expected and fairly tasty.   With the abundance of menu items, everyone can find a dish to enjoy. I didn't look, but I'm sure there are kids offerings as well.  The atmosphere was busy and loud. If you have a small party, try to grab a table by the window. They seemed a little removed and offered a great view.  An above average restaurant worth trying again.
