In a nutshell, this restaurant has unique very flavorful food but has an overlycomplicated ordering/seating process and is overpriced. For the food, I ordered chips and salsa with guacamole, one of the caldos, churros and a beer. The chips and salsa are perfectly fine but come with an incredibly skimpy quantity of guacamole. I had no idea what a caldos was and was surprised when it was delivered but ate it with an open mind and enjoyed it immensely. Think of the caldos as mexican pho. The caldos are intensely flavored and have a perfect balance of flavors.  The churros were good as well but perhaps too doughy.My main issue with this restaurant is the bizzare method of ordering food and being seated. You are assigned a table but order at a register. When I entered the restaurant I walked to the register to order and was asked for my table number. I did not have one since I had not sat down. I was told to see a hostess. The hostess told me all seats were taken and instructed me to stand at the front of the line (at the register) and wait for her to come give me a table number. So, I waited for 5 or so minutes like a dope in an empty line looking at a person waiting to take my order at the register. When assigned a table number, I ordered and was shown to my seat and food runners brought my food to me. Very awkward and over thought for a restaurant that is somewhere between chipotle and casual full service mexican. So, 5 stars for food, minus one for the stupid ordering/seating arrangement and minus one more star because the basic meal I ate cost $37 with a small gratuity, which is way too much to pay for the atmosphere, quantity of food and lack of table service.
