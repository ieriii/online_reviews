Went to Swing Night Thursday for the first time and it's a great time whether or not you want to dance. 6 dollars at the door is reasonable, and the Alan Gresik swing shift orchestra (which has been doing Swing Night for 10 years) are amazing. The beautiful Amanda Wolff on vocals will not disappoint as she croons 'Mississippi Mud'.
