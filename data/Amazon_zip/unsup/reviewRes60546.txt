I absolutely love this place. The rock shrimp is SOOO good..highly reccommended! Service is great and the waiters are very friendly and always ready to help. It's a beautiful place too, I think the retunda is the best room in the whole restaurant..absolutely stunning. I also reccommend the pan seared chicken breast another one of my favorites. This place is wonderful..better than the Cheesecake Factory to me. It's wonderful and you won't regret it!!
