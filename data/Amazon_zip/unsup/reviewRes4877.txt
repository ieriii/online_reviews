During my last trip to Chicago we stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel. We wandered around the first night in search of a place to eat and just happened upon The Purple Pig across the street. Being from out of town, I never heard of this place before, which apparently has a following in Chicago. What really caught my eye was their campy entrance--a wrought iron gate with the words CHEESE, SWINE & WINE. You only live once, so that was good enough for me! Holla! Then when we got inside, we realized that this place actually means business. Don't let the corny entranceway fool you. Roasted bone marrow?! Fried sardines?! Crispy pig ear (so effing good)?! It was all delicious. All dishes were served tapas style, but with a unique twist and with innovative recipes. They also have a wide selection of wines.
