I could have reviewed Irazu after any of the many many times I have dined in or ordered out, and I would tell you to get the oatmeal shake and vegetarian burrito (loaded!). I'm sticking by that choice, but I want to review because of the customer service. I ordered on a busy Friday night and there was a snag in the ordering process. When I called to straighten out the issue, the man on the phone immediately reacted defensively to the situation although I had never placed blame on anyone. Usually, this is where it all goes wrong--I tell the person I am speaking with that I am not blaming anyone and I don't think the tone is necessary, etc. and then I am unhappy the rest of the night. But as soon as I started to argue back, the other guy relaxed and said he was sorry, it was just really busy and he didn't want my order to be cold. Now THAT'S what makes me come back (as long as the food is good, too)!
