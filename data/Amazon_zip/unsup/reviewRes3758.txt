Three stars for their creativity and personality, but if I were judging sourly on the food 2 stars. I watched with anticipation for weeks as they were under construction and chuckled each time I read their menu...... then the week they opened I was there.....  While the interior was bright and cheery it was a little underwhelming and cramped. I ordered One of the Buddha bowls with chicken and about 40 million types of veggies. Upon cramming into our little corner counter booth by the window I was impressed with their presentation but after putting it in my mouth the excitement fell totally flat. While the combo and seasoning was wonderful, including the BBQ sauce I was a little miffed by the temperature. So im assuming the rice SHOULD be steaming hot, the chicken steaming hot and the veggies chilled?? which is what I was expecting and looking forward to....and NO everything was a version of Luke warm room temperature.... im not usually the type of guy to make a big scene and take things back, so I didn't, it was tasty enough thought id just go back and try it again..... This time I still wasn't digging the atmosphere so I ordered to go, same dish......LUKE WARM!! I was pissed especially because with a side and a can of soda it was like 14 bucks! I tossed it I was so mad! ill try it once more but if that darn rice and chicken is room temperature ill scream... because I really want to like this place!
