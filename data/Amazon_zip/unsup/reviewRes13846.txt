My last visit the food and beer were extremely good but the service left a lot to be desired. It kept me back from coming for a few months before my sister went there and raved about it. She really loved the TV Party-a rye IPA which she thought was sweet and not IPA-y at all. We got there and of course it was busy and when I said I wanted a table for two the hostess said it would be 35-40 minutes. WTF! on a weeknight I think I went outside and kicked something for good measure because I was extremely hungry and ventured outside of where I was staying to give this place another chance. The wait time there is not as bad as they make it out to be. I was pleasantly surprised that it took about 10 minutes; clearly a case of underpromising and overdelivering. I had a different server this time, John who seemed genuinely helpful and friendly and when we couldn't decide whether to start of with anything-beer, appetizer, main course he gave us plenty of time and came back looking like he won the lotto or something-seriously that smiley. I already had the bacon fat popcorn once so had to have that. I had tasted their burgers and thought them good but something else caught my eye. The tofu dog with veggie chili, I am by no means a vegetarian but it really seemed tasty and he agreed-sometimes he just gets it because he likes the taste. I was not disappointed, it wasn't a fake hot dog but three thick strips of tofu covered in a really nice meatless chili. I had the Black power as an accompaniment which was the new oatmeal stout they had rolled out-tasty, definitely a nice strong dark beer but without a lot of the heft-think a Guinness without the full feeling you get. The TV party IPA was as advertised tasty, light and not crazy bitter. The lighter beers though were just okay-the anti-hero was too light and their wit ale was like Hoegarden that was watered down. Stick with the stronger, darker beers and you can't go wrong.
