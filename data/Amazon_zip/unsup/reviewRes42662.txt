After a nice Friday afternoon/evening drinking session @ a friend's place I was craving something with grease. My buddy mentioned a place that was right down the street and I said I don't care what it is..lets do it! We were gonna have them deliver, but my friend called and said something happened to their oven so they were out of commission. F--k!!!! The whole apt kept talking about the greatness of this pizza so I was getting more & more pissed at this broken oven. My buddy checked again and 45 minutes later the oven was up & running. I was ready to leave the party so I said I will walk over and grab a slice and my buddy had called in an order of cheese balls. I did not realize I had walked past the place numerous times getting off of the brown line and going to Durkins. Walked in to this small joint where happy people were dining in and enjoying BYOB. Walked in to a great deal of smoke. I thought this is a little too smokey for a pizza joint. I looked behind the glass and saw they made turkey legs, bbq and other goodies as well. I tasted the cheeses balls and they were great. I went with a slice of cheese & sauage...pretty damn good!!!! The guys behind the counter are pretty good at remembering good customers (they remembered my buddy coming in before). Not a bad place in LP to grab a delicious slice or a turkey leg for that matter. I walked down to Ashland & Diversey a happy camper chomping on a delicious slice of pizza.
