I hadn't been here for awhile and hoped that the "hoopla" over Rick Bayless on Top Chef Masters had died down sufficiently so the kitchen could get back to putting out a decent product, but nooooo! There's still an insanely long wait, the service is impatient and rushed to the point that they practically toss things down on the table as they're passing by, and the food is SO salty! (Probably so you buy more of their delicious, but tiny margaritas.) Tourists don't seem to mind paying exhorbitant prices for really mediocre although "inventive" food. The quality has gone so far down that the only thing they have going for them is the notoriety that allows them to ride on their past laurels. Which is really sad.
