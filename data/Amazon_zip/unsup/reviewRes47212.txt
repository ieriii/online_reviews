Ok, this place has by far some of the best burgers I have ever tried. I have been coming here since they open (I lived around the corner but have moved 8 blocks away). The Lockdown Warden and Punk Bitch have always been my favorites. Haven't gone through all of the burgers but working on it. Fries and dipping sauce are fantastic as well as other menu items like the build your own mac n' cheese, prison shanks and the barb 'd wire cheese fries which are ridiculous in a good way. Great beer selection with heavy music concerts all over the place even if you don't like it (then why are you here again?). I've seen this place change things around quite a bit since they open (really miss the pretzels and mustard that was given when they first open) but that's bound to happen as they are still keeping it real (I keep coming back). They are even showing up on TV as well as most best burger lists. PJ is a great guy to meet as well as their staff. Never really had an issue here worth docking stars for.  Bottom line: You could go stand in line at Kuma's for like 2 hours with bad service or come to Lockdown and get the same music, better service and better burger you deserve!! Oh yeah, half off burgers on Tuesday but sometimes you have to wait.
