This is our go-to for Ethiopian. We always get the meat and veggie messob with new combinations of things. A few of our choices have been misses, but most of it is a strong hit. Everything is spiced wonderfully and cooked until perfect. I usually get a drink -- for quality and quantity, the booze is very well priced. The service is always great. They also have possibly my favorite Belly reward ever -- if you go a million and one times (seriously, it's a really, really high number) you can get a cooking lesson from the owner/chef. I doubt we'll make it there that often because it's a bit more than most of our random "let's go out!" meals, but I love that it's a possibility, you know?
