Yum! Granted, this was my first experience with Ethiopian food, but it was a definitely a good one. Apart from the tasty dinner and homemade wine, the service was great, too. We had a pretty large group, and it didn't phase them. They even made sure to accommodate the vegetarians among us. I'd go back, though there's another Ethiopian restaurant with a lot of buzz I might try first :)
