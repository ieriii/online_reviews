This pizza truly is awesome. I considered it a solid four stars as there is other good deep dish pizza in the city, but what tipped me to make it five stars is that the thin crust is equally as good. That's something special, folks. My roommates laugh, but I tell you - it's the magical herbs and spices. Never had a problem with delivery, the one time I picked up they gave me a time and then said there was 20 minutes left when I got there. A pretty good record considering the frequency I eat there. And the pizza by the slice is a hell of a deal.
