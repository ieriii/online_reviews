Alliance bakery is amazing. I've had cupcakes from lots of places, but the cupcakes here are some of the best. The ingredients must be of the highest quality, and the head baker's skill is obviously superlative because EVERYTHING I've had here has been amazingly good. My absolute favorite cupcakes are the lemon strawberry ones; the lemon flavor is intense, and the strawberry frosting is buttery and has the prefect sweetness. Gosh, I have gorged on these pieces of pure delight. Anytime a loved one has a birthday, I always try to get him or her a cupcake from here. However, I always have to order more than what I intend to give, because I can never control myself and end up eating at least two on the way. (Also, I'd just like to briefly insert that oddly, a few other reviewers see alliance as a coffee-shop/hang-out/study place, which it kinda is, but really isn't. It's essentially a bakery, not a hang-out. You're essentially sitting in a bakery's seating area, so I think you've got to be really silly if you complain about it.) When I've been there, the staff has always been courteous and professional. The place is small, but also rather old-school and charming. I've never had their cakes, which are incredibly fancy looking (and too pricey to just splurge on my own), but I intend to splurge on one soonish!
