I went to "Simply It' for the first time tonight. I was complaining to a friend of mine that I can't yet find a good Vietnamese restaurant that compares with a place in St. Louis that I LOVE!  She took me here, and it was hands down, one of the best meals I've had in Chicago. I figure when I go back a few more times, and if the food is as good as I've had it tonight, I'll up my rating to 5 Stars from 4!  I had #36 or 37(I forget which). It was a chicken dish in a mild ginger sauce in a pot, served with rice. It reminded me of traditional French cooking actually. Everyone expects Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese cuisines to be saucy and messy and complicated with all sorts of flavors.  This chicken dish was utterly simple, tasty, delicious, satisfying. It was healthy food that filled you up in a good way, not stuffed. I love the garnish of onion which I mixed in with my rice and chicken. It was tender and fresh.... I agree with Beth R, it is a place I could eat every day, eat healthy, and interesting every time.  The Avocado Wontons (prepared like "crab ran goons") were fantastic. They weren't purchased frozen, they were made there! There was a creamy consistency in the filling that was so delicious. It had flavor, it wasn't covered in old grease flavor from a fryer that's rarely changed. You can tell they change the oil in the fryers often, because the taste is simply the taste of the appetizer sans everything else on the menu! The dipping sauce was perfect, it was sweet, but not saccharine, and not too sweet for what it is!!  If you're on Lincoln, this place is well worth visiting. If you're no where near Lincoln, it's worth going out of your way for!!!! Seriously! And if you're in St. Louis, go to Pho Grand for good Vietnamese!
