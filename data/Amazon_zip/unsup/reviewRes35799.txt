This is you pretty standard average seafood place. Has a great old school atmosphere which I really enjoyed. The Lobster bisque was good. However, I had the lobster pasta in a cream sauce and to be honest with you, it was not anything really was that amazing. It was very well prepared and good presentation, but it didn't WOW me. I've heard lunch is the way to go for some rolls. Will def. comeback, but can't say this was the best seafood ever.
