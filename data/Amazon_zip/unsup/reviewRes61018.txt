We had an event at the Fifty/50 last week and it was a amazing time! The food is to die for! With a menu based on secret sauces, you wont leave disappointed. The atmosphere for games is exciting! You really get into it. You have to try the burgers and those fried chicken wings...yum!!! I guess the only complaint is the parking situation but what do you expect for the area. BIG BIG BIG fan of the Fifty/50!
