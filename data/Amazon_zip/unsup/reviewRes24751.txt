I came here for restaurant week and I'm glad I did. It's a fun place for fondue and feels more authentic than The Melting Pot. The service was OUTSTANDING, the food was tasty, and the drinks were a plenty! I got a 3 course meal for $33 but this place is pretty spendy outside of restaurant week. The only negative thing I can say about this place is the terrible old oil smell when you first walk in. It was overwhelming! After about 10 minutes I got used to it and the rest of the evening was fantastic!
