Xoco already receives quite the number of reviews and in the chain of Rick Bayless's Chicago-must-eats - I have to contribute. I'm going to ruin my secret, but that's the whole idea of a review. Most people come here for lunch or dinner and have to wait in super long lines, but here's the secret - breakfast. Xoco serves breakfast from 8-10 AM and if you get there before 9:30 there's literally no wait. The hot chocolate is so thick and delicious, but in this July heat I highly recommend the iced chocolate that is spiked with a little peppermint. The menu is short but if you're in the mood for churros and chocolate, chorizo torta, huervos rancheros, or chilaquiles then come here. Portions are perfect and it's self-serve sparkling water! Even the water is amazing... come on Rick Bayless! So if you're up early, crave some Mexican flavors, and want to taste some Bayless cuisine without the 6 month-advanced reservation, I recommend having breakfast at Xoco.
