I like this place. Alot. Everything I've had there is amazing. I mean it. I like that Doug only keeps this place open during weird hours. I like that he wont add anything to the menu if it means extra work. I like that he is the sweetest hot dog vendor in Chicago. My yuppie sensibility also likes the idea of having fancy cheeses and sauces on such a trashy medium and my trashy sensibility loves the fact that you can order fries cooked in duck fat. Five stars but for the fact that I thought all the sausages were house made. Yes, I really did think that he made Vienna hot dogs from scratch. I'm naive like that. Can I have a corn dog fried in duck fat?
