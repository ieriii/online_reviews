I've been here a couple of times, last night being the most recent occasion. Usually this place is super packed with a long wait and I can never wait that long to eat, but last night we only had a short wait and we got a booth :) I like that you get to pick from 3 different kinds of pizza bases and then all the toppings. We got a red pizza with pepperoni, olives and other basic toppings, a white with chicken, basil and tomato and we also got the caprese salad which was good. Sadly, I'm not a beer drinker so I can't speak for that, I believe the only drink options were soda or beer (I got a coke). The food was good, although I found the red pizza to be too soggy to pick up and eat (I dunno if it's always like that or perhaps our choice of toppings?)
