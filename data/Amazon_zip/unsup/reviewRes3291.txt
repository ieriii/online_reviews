Yes, I was the person whose life was threatened* when I asked for ranch dressing with my spicy Bud's chicken. That alone gets an additional star from me! And yes, I was talked out of it but I assured the kind gentleman that if I did indeed require ranch dressing, then he best be gettin' it for me. But it didn't come to that. Which is saying a lot from a woman that loves her ranch dressing. I traded chicken with a friend who had the "don't call it chicken terriyaki" chicken and agreed that it tasted like chicken terriyaki. Ain't nothin wrong with that. My beverage of choice that night was a wee bottle of Bacchus-D, which looks like it may contain the cure for botchulism but instead gave me quite the energy boost. I was told that it preceeded Red Bull by 40 years, and tasted quite similar. I also plan to use the bottle as a bud vase. Right now the place is cash only, but I'm sure they'll have some sort plastic acceptance soon. *I don't really enjoy having my life threatened...but when it's obviously in a joking matter it's all good.
