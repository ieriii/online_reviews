I have loved Sunda from day 1. They have a great room, great food, great service, and the best fish in town. We recently found out that most of the fish they are using is imported overnight from fish markets in Japan. We had dinner at Sunda last night and it was wonderful. Sunda it's always a pleasure. Thank You
