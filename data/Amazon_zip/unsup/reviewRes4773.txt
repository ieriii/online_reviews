This was the best restaurant dining experience i have had in a very long time. Excellent service, delicious & adventurous food, good wine, and reasonable prices. The dishes on the menu are all unique. I had Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio for my appetizer and it was a revelation. I struggled not to lick the bowl. I will go back for that dish alone. For my main I had the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with smashed potatoes and tzatziki. It was also a delight I hope to repeat. Family-style seating on the patio added to the experience rather than impairing it as I expected. Wow.
