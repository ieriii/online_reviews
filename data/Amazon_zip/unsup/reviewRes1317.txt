My boyfriend and I were having the biggest (and most stupid) argument of all time, but I swear to god we made up the second we set foot in Hot Doug's. He devoured the duck fat fries (i wasn't a huge fan-too crispy), and I snarfed down my rabbit sausage. Pretty awesome concoctions. I can't wait for venison to come back on the game of the week menu. Plus! They have chocolate soda. SO awesome. So very good. No guilt.
