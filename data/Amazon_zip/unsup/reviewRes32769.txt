We had been waiting to go here for about a year after it opened, and finally made it for my b-day. It did not dissappoint! We ate outside, even though I loved the interior decor, I was glad they offered that since we don't get too many nice hot nights in Chicago and this was one of the last of the season and we were able to enjoy that. I had been wanting to try the food buddha's classic crispy rice pan fried sushi topped with hand cut spicy tuna/jalapeno & the seared american kobe beef tartare. Those were both great, I highly recommened. I can honestly say I have never had any sushi quite like this!! But we followed that with the truffled tataki sashimi and choose the all of the above option- beef, tuna, and salmon. The salmon and tune were very good, but the beef was so amazing that we decided next time to order just 10 of those!!! OMG can you say mouth orgasm?!! I always say you can never go wrong with truffles or kobe beef, especially when you combine them!!!! We also had the organic miso soup and one lobster roll, those were good too. The duck....what....pork? buns were awesome, those were the last thing we ordered and it was the perfect end to our night. They are soft warm and rich, filled with yummy duck, our tummys were stuffed after that. Now we have to go back again to try more of the menu, I can't wait!!! Oh, and the service was top notch! We never had to wait thoughout the whole meal, it was almost like the server could read our minds. Billy might be teaching them his tricks : )
