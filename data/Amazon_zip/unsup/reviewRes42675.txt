Stopped in here with my coworkers the other day. They had had a meeting where my boss had ordered from this place and they were just raving. I hadn't had it yet, so I remained a skeptic. I am a skeptic no longer. The pizza we ordered was insanely delicious. I moved past my comfort zone of two slices and went for broke. I seriously felt like I couldn't stop eating it. And I cannot remember which pizza it was, so I must apologize fellow yelpers. I have not only let you down, but I have let myself down. I do not know what to order again, and this saddens me greatly. Also, I feel obliged to mention the awesome service. The owner himself checked in with our table and brought us our pizza. He was kind and made sure all was taken care of. That's service straight out of a freaking commercial. But it wasn't a commercial, it was REAL LIFE. Real life with pizza. Delicious, delicious pizza. Mmm. So gooood. What was it called? There was meat, and vegetables... and more meat... Jesus, if only I could go back to that moment... Is time travel really that out there an idea? I mean, with all of society's technological advances, surely I could go back to enjoy that pizza, figure out it's name, and share it with the world. I mean, there's always the possibility of creating a time paradox, but the risk would be well wort- You know what? I'm rambling. In summary, I strongly recommend this place.
