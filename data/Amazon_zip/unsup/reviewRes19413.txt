The Gage probably had one of the most extensively boring menus I've seen in a long time, for the prices they were charging. None of the higher priced menu items seemed very interesting, and it didn't seem worth the money. I finally settled on Today's Fish and Chips. Deemed "today's", because the Fish and Chips are wrapped in "today's" newspaper, these strips of fluffy fried fish were pretty well done. I don't think Guiness in the batter comes out very well, and the fries were pretty standard. I get it, the Gage is convenient for tourists staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, or visiting Millenium Park. However, I don't see the draw for locals to go to Gage. There are a lot of places that charge similar or cheaper prices for food that are much more inventive. With the exception of the pretty well stocked bar, I don't see a reason to visit the Gage.
