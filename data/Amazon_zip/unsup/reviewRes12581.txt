Loved most of the food and service. The pluses: Service was attentive with wine being poured to ladies first. Restaurant is clean, attractive and lit appropriately for dinner (Bring a flashlight to see menu if over age 45.). Food was mostly good. Three items that were misses: 1. Emeritus Russian River Pinot Noir for $42 a bottle wasn't good RR Pinot. 2. Appetizer wrap you should skip, tasteless. 3. Flank Steak is more like shreaded taco meat, skip. Hits: Almond crusted Halibut Pork chop was huge and great sweet coating. I would go back again just wish that the flank steak was explained better. Rating about 3.5 stars and more like 4 stars if the wine and two dishes noted were better.
