I had no real experience with the Doubletree, but seeing as it was a Hilton, I had some expectations. Upon inspecting the website, the rooms looked very sophisticated and modern. When arriving the main lobby was very spacious, smelled amazing and had many friendly employees to help out. They gave us our free cookies and kept them coming throughout the stay. However, once arriving to our floor (4th), the experience started a downward spiral. The hallway was not air conditioned, and extremely muggy and hot. Our unit was nice and cool, however did not have the flat screen television that was on the website, but our 27 inch tv was fine. Other electronic snafus included the house phone on the nightstand not working as well as our mini-fridge having a sensory-based system so we couldn't even take out the items to keep our drinks cool. There were also snacks upon the counter that the stated that it was electronically weighed and if you touch it, you will be charged. Families traveling with small children must have a lot of charges! The cleanliness of the bathroom was less than desired. There was painted-over mold on the ceiling as well as chipping paint. Likewise, there were stains on the wall above one of the beds. The blankets were amazing and down, however the pillows were too soft and there were no extra blankets. The satellite also went out multiple times, which was probably due to storms at least one night.  The location was very convenient and riding the CTA wasn't challenging at all. Due to the few issues we had with cleanliness and electronics, I may be deterred from staying here again.
