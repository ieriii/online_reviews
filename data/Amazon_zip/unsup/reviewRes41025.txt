Yes it's good "drunk" food... but what isn't? La Pa's is also really good, way above average Chicago taco stand food. All 3 Ashland locations plus the around town Express locations are all good. The carne asada tacos are the draw. Don't go burrito unless you're drunk because the well-seasoned, slightly charred carne asada flavors need to meld with the corn tortilla (unlike a burrito's flour tortilla) and cilantro and onion to provide the perfect bite.
