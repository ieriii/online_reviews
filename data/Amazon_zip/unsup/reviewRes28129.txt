I dream of this pizza, I salivate just thinking about it and want to run to the airport and jump on a plane. Not just because my BFF Tami is there but because of Chicago's food. It does take a while to cook an amazing pizza pie - so chill, watch some sports on the tube and drink a little bit. My favorite pie has been mushrooms and black olives - the sauce has a strong tomato taste, but the best part is the crunchy crispy divine crust of cheese and crust that wraps your taste buds in a dance of dirty dancing! I even purchased my own tank top and the cool thing about their logo is it has a whale that looks like a thong or under ware on top of its head - anyone know what that is?
