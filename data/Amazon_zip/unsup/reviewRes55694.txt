I am not quite sure what the rav about this place is. it is not bad, but it is not great.The feel of the place is nice. I do like the set up and how they have the menu written on the wall/chalk board. It is a small place, but it does have a nice vibe to it.The service here is sold. I did not have any problems what so ever. It was somewhat busy when I went for breakfast...everyone is very polite and prompot.The food prices are not very good. You DNO NOT get what you pay for. Breakfast for two, with tip, ran be $45.00. I received an ok steak, eggs, toast and a juice - person who I had breakfast with had the same. The place is nice, servers are pleasant, food prices and food quality is not all that.I would not make this a must-go-to diner.
