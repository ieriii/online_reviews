The chips and pickles are excellent and made me excited like a 5-year-old boy getting his Nintendo 64 on Christmas. The hush puppies ironically make you scream and the shrimp and grits channeled my inner southerner (well, south of Wisconsin). The kobe brisket sandwich was solid and I recommend trying all 4 sauces at least once before making a commitment, otherwise you have a 50/50 chance of a divorce. The pulled pork sandwich my cohort Dragon had was delicious. I would recommend trying that on your next visit. Highly recommend.
