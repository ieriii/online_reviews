What you are going to get here is your standard Hilton stay. Don't expect anything fancy.  Positives: Great location. Clean rooms. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great views. Great service. Kiosk for boarding passes Negatives: That Hilton room decor Loud air conditioning No free wireless in the rooms (come on, get with the times here) Overall though...a comfortable stay which is all I need on a business trip.
