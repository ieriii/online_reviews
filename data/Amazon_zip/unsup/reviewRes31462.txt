This was my third time there and the least impressive. My dad and brother had breakfast burritos and seemed to enjoy them. Dad also said the hot chocolate (made from owner-made ganache) was some of the best he'd had. I had a salad with apples and cheese that had a dressing made largely of oil. It needed citrus or vinegar to add zip. My poblano cheese grits, however, were amazing. Mom's huevos rancheros were a little too greasy. Good, but not amazing. Based on how much I have enjoyed past meals and how good other people's orders looked as they went by I will definitely be back.
