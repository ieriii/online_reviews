Excellent lunch. The service is fantastic as well. These people know how to cook and they know how to make you comfortable in their space. What a pleasure. Great pizza,great cheese and bread, great pasta, great Caesar salad. The decor is new-old but that is a minor distraction. This crew has it right.
