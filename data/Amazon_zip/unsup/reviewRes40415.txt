Que the meat (barbacoa is my favorite), fresh onions and cilantro and play me the violin. These tacos makes me wanna cry they're so good. I can't tell you which one of the identical looking location is the original or the best. I just know that it's one of the best drunk food in the city. It is cheap. It is authentically Mexican. It is definitely not gourmet or fancy so it is best in the sense that you don't feel cheated for your money. It's tasty and easy on your wallet. Not a nice, sit-down place, although they do have seating. Please, don't expect what you haven't paid for.
