It's a fun, vibrant place that also serves up some delicious Latin fare. I am a fan of their mojitos (the mango puree one is delicious!) and made-to-order guacamole. The desserts are pretty fantastic as well. Each time is jolly time. Great for a date or groups. It also features live music some nights which I have yet to check out.
