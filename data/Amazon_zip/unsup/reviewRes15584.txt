Wow, it's been such a long time that I forgot I had written one for Calo. But now I've been there, and not just had their takeout. Four of us went to Calo on a Saturday night around 6:00PM. There was a very short wait and not even enough time to get a drink at the bar. We all ordered different items and shared. I stuck with the traditional Lasagna which was great. The menu is full of enticing combinations of pasta and chicken and seafood and veggies, and sauces. I could not make up my mind. I love the clubby atmosphere. One of our group was unhappy with the service, since the waiter, who was right off the boat from Naples, never returned to the table to refresh drink orders. I think that would have been our only complaint about what was a fun and stimulating traditional Italian spot.
