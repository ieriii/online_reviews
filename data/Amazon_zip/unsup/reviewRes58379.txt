Just tried Chicago q for the first time last night.I would definitely come here again. Standouts include the bbq chips and sweet pickles that others have mentioned. Delicious. The bourbon flight was also an outstanding deal if you're a bourbon fan.My wife got the pulled pork shoulder which was outstanding. I got the Kobe beef ribs which were just so-so. Although they had great flavor, they were not falling off the bone as advertised. Pretty tough actually, but still quite tasty.I have to say I was underwhelmed by all four sauces. My favorite was probably the mustard-based sauce, which is a tough one to find at most BBQ joints, so if you're a fan of that type of sauce, Chicago q may be your mustard mecca.My only other point of contention is that when I asked them to package up my leftovers, they failed to include a whole Kobe beef rib which was untouched on my plate. At over $35 for this entree, this felt like a pretty big rip off for them to not include a third of my entree in the doggy bag. (Of course I didn't discover this until the next morning when I unpacked the bag.)As I said I would go again. But next time I think I'd stick to a more traditional pork rib, and double check that all leftovers are actually in the bag before I leave!
