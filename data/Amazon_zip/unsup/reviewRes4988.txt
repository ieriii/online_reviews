Went here with a friend on Monday night and was surprised at the atmosphere.  I was happy that the food was still great because the loud club music made mew ant to pull my hair out. It was near impossible to hear each other and to carry on a conversation. Because of the food they get 4 stars and my return visit, butI'm hoping it won't be so unpleasant to sit inside.
