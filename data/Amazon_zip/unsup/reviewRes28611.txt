Food get's a 4 star, their delivery time however, makes them lose a star. I understand there are busy nights and times, but on a thursday night? An hour and a half? That gets to be a bit ridiculous! With that said, I do have to add the pizza is yummy, the buttery crust adds a great flavor, and they are pretty generous with the toppings. The restaurant, when we have eaten in, is pretty good and the service is OK.
