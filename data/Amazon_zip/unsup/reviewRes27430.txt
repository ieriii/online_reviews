Obviously, this is not my type of restaurant. I don't enjoy standing awkwardly while waiting on a table because there isn't an area to really stand without bumping into the large "carryout" crowd. Nor do I enjoy running into waitstaff or eating mainly flavorless food. I went with a group of 5+ girlfriends on a Saturday evening. They were geeked about Nuevo Leon being BYOB. This contributes to the extra star given, along with a free (but very small) parking lot nearby. I did appreciate the high energy of the place and the cheap pricing. A friend ordered a red snapper (HUACHINANGO AL MOJO DE AJO - whole fish), which is probably what I should have tried instead of the panela platter. Yet I was going the cheap route, so that's likely why I decided against it. I think I had fries as a side too, which weren't good. I shouldn't have gotten those a Mexican joint either. *shakes head* Yet the seafood menu included a grand total of three items, so the pescatarian options seemed pretty limited. I'm not running back, nor was I running to the bathroom. Meh is what I felt when it was all over, thus a 2-star review.
