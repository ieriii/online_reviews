Perfection. My mission was to find a place close to the Loop for a group of old friends to meet and catch up after years apart. So I was looking for delicious food that could be shared (Tapas!) at a round table in a comfortable place conducive to lively conversation.  This place was exactly that! And it really over-delivered! There were 5 of us and we had the chef's choice menu. $65/person (their PDF menu online says $55/person...apparently the price has gone up and the website hasn't been updated). And it was SO MUCH DELICIOUS FOOD! We were full half way through the courses and thought it was over and they just kept bringing more dishes. Excellent, friendly, helpful, attentive staff at every level (from the greeter to the waiter to the busser to the floor manager). They gave us just the right amount of information without at all ever being intrusive to our conversation and enjoyment. They made us feel VERY comfortable. The atmosphere of the place was perfect, lively, comfortable, casual, elegant. In the end we wanted to have them split the bill equally across 5 credit cards and they didn't bat an eye. Just put it all in the hands of the chef's tasting menu and you'll have a great delicious time.
