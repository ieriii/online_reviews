We had some friends in town from England who were staying downtown and wanted to meet up for lunch. We very rarely head to the Mag Mile area so it's always hard to think of where to meet up. After reading good Yelp reviews, we suggested the Purple Pig. Overall the food was very good. I enjoyed everything I ate. One of our diners did not eat meat (she did eat seafood) and had no problem finding things to eat. The prices are a bit high ($19 for three cheeses!?) but I guess that's to be expected in this neighborhood. We had our 4 month old baby with us, and we were able to snag an outdoor table for 4, which worked out well. We did have to fold the stroller and stash in a different place because the patio is tight. Inside is very loud and all communal tables so not very baby-friendly. Our waitress was very nice and attentive and had good recommendations. I would definitely return if I were in the area.
