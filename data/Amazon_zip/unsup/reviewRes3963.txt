You have GOT to be kidding me. This is the worst fine dining experience I've ever had and I haven't even arrived at the restaurant. In the past 2 weeks, I've called over 50 times only to be rebuffed by their constantly full inbox (ever heard of pushing the rubber button with the word delete under it?), or to be answered and put on hold and listen to loud music, power tools, and kitchen noise then hung up on, or the best is to be told in a crass manner with elementary school vocabulary that I couldn't be heard regardless of which mobile or land line I used and hung up on. I'm not your "dude" nor someone to be blamed when your phone lines, blown eardrums, or loud environs are the issue. Hire a tech, turn down your crap, and attend finishing school and learn some receptionist etiquette. After reading the other reviews regarding cancelled reservations, loud music disrupting what has decent odds at being an above average meal, and similar difficulty at getting reservations, my wife and I are not going to fly 1863 miles to endure this nightmare of an experience. Our hard earned dollars are going to go to Moto, Alinea, Charlie Trotter, or even the disturbing foie gras lollipops at Graham Elliot instead.
