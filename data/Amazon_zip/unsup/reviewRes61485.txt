This is a typical Taco Bell. If you are in the mood for a meal past the time that most places around here close (7-9, weekdays only) this place closes much later than the rest (I think around 1am) and is open on the weekends. I didn't notice the food quality, staff or anything else below what I would expect of a taco bell.
