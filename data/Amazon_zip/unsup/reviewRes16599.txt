I just had Carnivale for appetizers adn liquid courage before a meeting last night. I still think the restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. however I hated the ceviche tasting platter. Like, I HATED it. I felt like if I wanted raw fish, I'd go for sushi.  But I really enjoyed the beef & plantains appetizer. That was yummy and very obviously totally fattening.  The caiparinhas were two thumbs up though. After the second caiparinha, I was slurring. .... a good slur. Nevertheless a slur. :-)
