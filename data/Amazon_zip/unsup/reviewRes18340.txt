My first experience at this place was for a friends birthday dinner. I have to say honestly I was not impressed with the food. There was a group of 25 of us and it cost us each 55 dollars a piece, which seemed a bit much, considering entrees range from 15 to 18 dollars. It probably did not help that most of the dishes that was served to our group were meat based and I'm a vegetarian. So for a salad, a couple slices of bread and a couple spoons of pasta, it was a little pricey for me. But talking to another friend of mine, he did say the food is normally excellent here. That is why I'm giving this place 4 stars. I looked at the menu and there are some awesome sounding dishes on the menu. I would love to come back here and try out some dishes without being in a birthday party dinner setting where the meal was already picked out for you. So I will definitely give this place a second change, and looking at the reviews others have left, I'm sure I would not be disappointed the second time around.
