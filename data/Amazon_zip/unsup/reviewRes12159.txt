We ate here last night. Food was good, but service was mediocre at best. We ordered the shrimp starter and it came out so fast that it was obviously just sitting in the kitchen waiting for a table (come on staff, at least make it look like you prepared it for us!). I had the pistachio encrusted chicken which was pretty darn tasty. Chicken was succulent, and the crust was nice. Docked one star for service, another for not giving us bread--or anything--when we sat down, last star lost for noise (it's loud in there!).
