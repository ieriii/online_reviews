With a Valentine's Day birthday, all I want to do is avoid the crowds and the Hallmark nature of the day. Unfortunately, it's also my birthday, so I'm forced to celebrate it somehow. With this Valentine's Day birthday thing, we've learned to do the whole pink and white heart thing and all that the next day. We decided on Longman & Eagle since we still hadn't visited it since our move. On a busy Tuesday night, we waited 45 minutes at the bar enjoying some Goose Island Green Line pale ale. Waiting was the best thing we did because it was well worth it. Once we were seated, we knew what we wanted to order right away. We informed our server of my nut allergy. She checked with the kitchen to be sure an entree's preparation. Despite the massive crowd, she took the time out to make sure that we'd have a good experience. As an appetizer, we did the pate. Longman & Eagle's pate is seriously the best I've ever had. It's the kind of pate that you dream about for months on end until you get your next fix. For dinner, I had grilled venison with huckleberries, sweet potato gnocchi, and something else extraordinary. I'm not a clean plate club member, but on our Valentine's Day I was. The venison was perfection with every bite. I loved the huckleberries playing off of the venison. Meanwhile, my husband had the burger with Nueske's bacon and cheddar cheese. Basically, I didn't speak much to my husband during our meal because he was savoring each and every bite. He also adored the beef fat fries. We had a great Valentine's Day dinner. I will return to Longman & Eagle any day and everyday to try their amazing entrees and pate. Honestly, I would wait hours and hours just for another taste of that pate again!!
