I've been to Cafe 28 a handful of times for both brunch and dinner. I've had great experiences for both. For brunch, I've only been there with big groups, and they're always able to accomodate us. Dinner is when you'll find the longer waits, and last time I was there, they did not take reservations. However, the waits aren't ridiculous and the food was very good.
