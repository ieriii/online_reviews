Visiting from LA we bumped into Le Colonial while strolling down Rush St. Ended up sitting outside in the cute patio since it was a crisp September day and enjoying a very pleasant lunch. All the dishes we ordered exceeded our expectations. I had never had French-Vietnamese fusion before but loved the marriage of the two and how the flavors of each cuisine complemented the other. With the lure of sitting inside or upstairs in the lounge I think I shall be returning for sure!
