Mystery, intriegue, seduction, a window into the past and I haven't even started talking about the booze yet. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I think it's great. All the drama and anticipation build it up and yet it's so, well, simple. Once you get over the theatrics to get in, just relax and enjoy those your with. It's a pretty stark interior, dimly lit with tall, regal looking chairs. It's speakeasy-ish with a touch of chill, underground lounge. In my couple times there, the drinks range from frigging bollocks to just overall different. My recommendation, try something with egg whites and/or bitters. The texture and flavor respectively, are genius. And they will help showcase what puts the craft into cocktails. I swung between 4 to 5 stars and wasn't sure which way to go. On one hand, I'd love to see them relax a scosh and go for just hip, instead of hip and exclusive...but I'm not sure if that would destroy what they've built up. On the other, from my across the Lake knowledge of Chitown, you have to give them props for what they helped to start. And with that, 5 stars because I'm a bit of a romantic and a sucker for nostalgia.
