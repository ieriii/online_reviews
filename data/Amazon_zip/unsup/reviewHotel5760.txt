My parents got a room here for the weekend, and they had nothing bad to say about the place. You get free parking and free breakfast, but otherwise, a basic motel (no clocks in the rooms, but wake up calls available). It was extremely clean, and everything looked fairly new, so they must have updated the place recently. My mom said it was probably the cleanest motel she's ever stayed in, and for the price, it can't be beat. The total charge came in under $200 for the weekend, and if you get a place anywhere downtown, that's about what you'll be paying for one night, plus parking.
