Eh. It's not bad, but it wasn't as great as I expected. I had the skirt steak with a tarragon butter sauce which was great, but the sides were just ok. People rave about the cheese grits, but I found them to be average, as was the mac and cheese. On the plus side they make excellent lemonades and the service was good. I'll definitely try it again but for now all I can give them is three stars.
