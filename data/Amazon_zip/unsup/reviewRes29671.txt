This used to be THE place for me. I would go here monthly back in 2000 - 2003 when the owners used to close the place for a week during Christmas and a week during another time of the year. I even had a review I wrote about the place printed in the Reader back in 2004. Right about the time they completed their expansion by opening the sports bar next door something happened... The wait staff became less friendly, the neighborhood "vibe" started to fade, and it just wasn't the same anymore. The food was still good but they started nickel and diming you for everything and the wait staff became slow and distracted. We stopped going here and I am nostalgic for the days when it was a great place my then fiance and I would visit monthly or more.
