Their claim to be the "best food in the world" might not make them humble, but it definitely doesn't make them liars either... Their Bloody Mary is one of the best I've ever had, and my date declared their clam chowder to be "orgasmic." The fish is fresh, the menu eclectic and inventive, and the service close to impeccable. Be prepared to wait a bit if you don't have reservations, but have no fear for there is a great bar down the street where you can grab a drink while you wait, and Glenn's will call your cell when your table is ready. Definitely a must. Btw, heading there for the all-you-can-eat crab legs next Tuesday (current mkt price $41.99 pp) and will be sure to update Yelpers on that.
