The room was very spacious; two beds plus a little couch/seat things. And we were able to fit another roll-away mattress. There was an iPad available for you to request housekeeping or bathroom toiletries. Some of the complimentary toiletries were pretty awesome! Such things included women's deodorant, feminine care products, nail polish remover pads (airplane friendly!), nail files, soft contact solution, and others that you'll probably never need. Location was key, staff members were friendly and accommodating, and the hotel was definitely very modern and chic looking. The lounge also provided complimentary continental breakfast for patrons of the executive floor. The breakfast was actually well above a typical continental style; in addition to the regular toast and bagels, it also had a medley of fruit, oatmeal, cereal, and a cappuccino machine! I also love the way the lobby smells like white tea and jasmine upon walking in (which is what the shampoo and soaps smell like too)
