For a time in my life I could have sworn I lived here. It got so the same bellman hailed me a taxi time after time. This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago, for several reasons. Nice gym, though you have to pay. Two bars for your drinking pleasure. A Starbucks-style cafe and a restaurant. Excellent customer service. Great views of the city. An ideal location by the river. Close to Walgreen's and AMC theaters. I've probably stayed here about six times in the last two years and have never been disappointed. Rock on!
