I find it baffling what Glenn's Diner is able to accomplish. Especially in a relatively small setting. They serve excellent breakfast and brunch items, their seafood selection is impressive to say the least, and to top it all off they have perhaps the only cereal bar in existence. Glenn's is a comfortable environment with an aw-inspiring chalkboard menu. When we dined there were all types of people, a large family, some couples, groups of friends, and a crowd of hipsters. Glenn's is a unique place that can appeal to just about anyone. Our group all ordered different items. I had the crabcake eggs benedict. The crabcake itself was delicious, everything together was complete utter harmony. They gave me the hollondaise on the side too which I greatly appreciated since I only like a small amount. My friends omlette and another friends breakfast sandwich were also great (foodie crowd, we share). Their sweet items were tasty too, I think we got their French Toast. I personally didnt have any cereal, but I love the concept. Their OJ was really good too, likely ffresh swqueezed. Glenn's rules, I need to go back and get some seafood becuase they truly know their way around a kitchen.
