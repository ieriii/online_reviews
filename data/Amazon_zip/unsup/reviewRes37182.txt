Here was my night - bus 50 to Foster and Clark after a long Friday at work. A fantastic ale who's name I'll never remember. Mac & Cheese (pretty good). Sandwich (bougie and greasy). And Mussels. MUSSELS. If you like Mussels, get the damn Mussels. I ordered a large appetizer for the table. My girlfriend didn't hear me and ordered a small one for her entree. Finishing both was not a problem. More great beer. Then, a play : TMLMTBGB at http://www.neofuturists. Very close to Hopleaf, funny yet serious, spontaneous, yet preconceived, goofy. Quite goofy. Awesome Friday night. Caveat - the wait can be long at Hopleaf, but they have bar upstairs with plenty of space. Drink for that hour and it'll take 15 minutes.
