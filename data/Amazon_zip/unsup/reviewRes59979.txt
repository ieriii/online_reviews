Amazing destination on Clark street. Wait staff is knowledgable and friendly and the food is pretty amazing. If you have a sweet tooth it is the place for brunch!If you have a taste for some southern flavor (specifically SC and LA) their locally sourced menu will amaze. (Gumbo...Yum!) I personally to make it there at least one a week.
