HOLY DIVER DUDES AND DUDETTES, just get the damn $30 Peking Duck special. Make sure there are 4 of you. There were 2 of us. We came hungry and had leftovers. You get scallions and carrots and sliced duck to make sandwiches, AND duck fried rice AND duck soup! Soooo good. It takes some time so you may want to call ahead or make sure you BYOB some drinks. You can order an appetizer but you'll seriously feel dumb when the courses are served. Friendly service. Casual space, diverse crowd. Parking can blow around here. Make sure you got quarters!
