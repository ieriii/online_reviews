Spectacular service, GREAT food and lengthy selection of brews.  Very accommodative to our table of 4 reservations which they could not seat right away. Took great care of us to show they appreciated our patience and kept us updated and happy with drinks.  Food was spectacular. Pork belly--my fave--was on par with the best from here to Napa Valley.  Would def go again.
