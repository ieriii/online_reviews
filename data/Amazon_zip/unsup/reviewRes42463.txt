Tank is an Argyle institution. Sure it's not aesthetically what I'd call a beautiful place, but in all honesty, you are there to eat! I'm always too busy checking the multitude of options on the menu to care about the decor. So, the food is fabulously fresh and right on with the spices! I seriously burned my soul, but in a good way (I can't resist bogarting all of the jalapenos)! If my nose is running then the heat is just right! The portions are generous, and the service is usually pretty decent! My tip would be to go on a week day, preferably Monday. I love Mondays because I have Argyle practically to myself, and more importantly there isn't a wait at Tank. You can get a table to yourself, although sometimes its fun to sit with randoms, and the bathrooms are definitely safer to use (if you disagree, then go to the Dunkin Donuts a couple of blocks over, but they'll make you buy something)! Overall the pho is amazing and is a must if you are in the Chicago area. And if you live here and haven't visited Tank, what are you waiting for?!
