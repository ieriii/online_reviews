YES, you have to wait for a table. (that's a good thing, it means lots of people are in-the-know. It's worth waiting for). The coffee is great. And I don't drink coffee, often. The food is the best. They take time and really care about what they serve. The common complaints are: 1. the wait time to get in. In my book, that's not a bad thing, and 2. The service. - everyone can have an off day. Get over it. Great place for breakfast.
