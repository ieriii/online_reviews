Let me just say...wow! While visiting a friend in Chicago he took me here for dinner and this place is phenomenal! The service is impeccable, the food orgasmic and the style/layout is...FUN! The Publican has the appearance of an oversized, well organized wooded cafeteria with a bit of a Texas stable feel. There's a large, open dining room connected to the bar with a massive table designed for more communal seating. If you're a prude and want to avoid this experience, (DO NOT!) there are several booths which also have wooden swinging doors. I recommend sitting collectively. My friend and I were able to inspire our two different adjacent neighbors to go outside their comfort zone with their choices, based on what we were eating, ending successfully with much thanks for our interesting palates. We had sooo much food and all, but the octopus, was amazing! With respect to the octopus, we were not expecting what we received but that was due to our own assumptions, no fault of the restaurant at all. My favorite item was the little gem salad. It was such a simple salad but quite possibly the best one I've ever had! The pig's ear was the perfect touch of salt to the creamy, light dressing and left you feeling "prepared" for the next course. My other favorite item was the duck hearts. My first time and much more flavorful and less chewy than chicken hearts. I'm not sure I can really organize myself to write about this restaurant. I will say that I ate about a third of the menu and was beyond satisfied. If you're looking for fine dining and great service in an eclectic environment then look no further.
