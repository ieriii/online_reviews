NOT WORTH THE PATIO! After returning for a second time to experience the ever talked about patio I was extremely disappointed. Not only was I seated one hour after my reservation time, multiple parties who arrived well after I did were seated before my table. This is clearly a place where if you don't know someone expect to be ignored. Our waiter was extremely rude, acting annoyed when he made the frustrating mistake of bringing a glass of wine instead of the bottle I clearly ordered. The cold, unfriendly service made me feel very unwelcome and contributed to the overall negative experience we had. The food is absolutely forgettable- the peaches in my antipasti were rock hard and tasteless (when there is so much great produce in the summer it shouldn't be so hard to create a good dish!). The pork was terrible as the prosciutto was so overcooked it was more like burnt jerky than anything else. Again, dessert was disappointing and not work staying for. And for all those that rave about the patio, yes it is nice to have an outdoor space with some trees, but the experience is ruined when you are crammed in so tight that you can't even move. I am so disappointed as I was looking forward to this meal all summer. You are far better off going to 'A Tavola' nearby. Great patio and the food is infinitely better!
