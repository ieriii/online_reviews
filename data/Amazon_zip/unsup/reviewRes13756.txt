The day's breakfast specials included eggs benedict with crab cakes and english muffin. A completely unexpected combination, but it was truly delicious. Now one of my favorite dishes I'd say. I've had some amazing food here before, so i can't say I was really surprised :) Able to sit outside on a wonderful day, but the inside is great too.
