I haven't been here in a while and loved the updated restaurant and larger addition. Nice place for friends and a date. I came here for a quick catchup with galpals and had some soup and gyozas. My pals had some maki rolls and we enjoyed a nice time here. Byob and good food. Gotta bring my fiance and show him around thai/japanese food!
