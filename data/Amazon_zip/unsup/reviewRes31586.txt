Gluten Free Menu with options! woot. :o) This place gets busy but the staff handles it well and are super friendly if you just smile and make eye contact. Very knowledgeable and they have always very patient with the meat eaters I have dragged in here. Personally I'm a big fan of the Kharma burger and the sweet potato fries. Be sure to save room for dessert or get a vegan "milkshakes" to go as they are so amazing you with forget your own name.
