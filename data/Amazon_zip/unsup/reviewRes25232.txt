Artopolis is my favorite chill place in all of Chicago. Again, reminds me of Greece with the cafe fare and nice stone baked pizzas and ice coffee (frappe) I recommend the spinach pie and the Lasagna when on special (wednesdays) as well as the rustic Greco pizza. Plum tomatoes, olive oil crust, Kasseri, feta and Motzarrela cheeses and a nice crispy herb crust, very good pizza. I love the hummus there as an appetizer along with a Greek Salad and then sharing a pizza with a date. Try thr "Megas Oenos" Red wine with the pizza. Megas Oenos means big one in Greek and it is a big huge red wine with supple tannins and jammy fruit. Makes the cheeses explode in your mouth, great stuff, and an even better finish. This wine has legs a mile long, longer than a 6 foot 2 inch blonde. For dessert, try a frappe, an iced coffee with milk and a medium sweetness. Awesome and addicting. I drink 2 of those every morning before work and my productivity is through the roof. Also, try one of the many delectable desserts and pastries available. to many to mention but there all good. I like the rice pudding there in particular. his is a must try and a great chill place to linger for hours as I do all the time.
