Can I just say I absolutely LOVE this place?! Boyfriend & I have gone here... 2 more times for dinner and 1 more time for brunch. DELISH! DELISH! DELISH! The portions are perfectly sized and you can't eat just one thing... we order 2 apps, 1 large sunshine salad (best salad!!!) & 2 entrees to share :] They had a chocolate bread pudding once and it was one of the most decadent desserts I've ever had (my mouth is drooling now)... get the Uncommon BLT! You can never go wrong with Pork Belly ;] & their fish is soooo fresh and tasty!!! I can't get enough of this place. OH and if you're there for brunch, you can't go wrong with their enchiladas dish with fried eggs (not heavy at all) or a french toast!!! Don't forget to get a chai latte with it ;]
