I ate here a few years ago with friends and will never be back. It was a hole in the wall type place. It was claustrophobic, dark, and depressing. The rolls were mediocre and overpriced. I think I paid $30 for my portion of the bill and was still hungry when I left. We were the only ones there during lunch on a Saturday and received subpar service. I don't get what the hype is all about. I've been to a ton of Sushi places...I think it's more about being "trendy" and going here than the actual restaurant. It wasn't a show stopper, by the looks of the place or the food they served. Save yourself the trek.
