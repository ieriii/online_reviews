i waited for two hours for two hot dogs and a handful of fries, i would have done it all over again five days a week. andouille sausage with deli mustard and grilled onions, duck fat fries, and the hot dog that will haunt me the rest of my life, duck sausage with foie gras and truffle sauce. honestly the highlight of my chicago trip.  as far as service, we didn't realize it was cash only until we got to the front of the line. he had no problem with us hitting up the atm, that was a few blocks away, and insisted that we eat first. class act.
