So here's the thing: we order, they bring our entree, the portions are ridiculously huge, we think there's no way we can finish them, we'll have to take at least half home, but the food is so unbelievably delicious THAT WE COULDN"T STOP EATING!!!!!! Oh, my God!! Just Incredable!! Really a fantastic meal!
