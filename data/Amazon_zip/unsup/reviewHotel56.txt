The whole family stayed here for 4 nights this summer as we moved youngest sister into DePaul. The rooms were clean and well kept during our stay. The building is super old so there's some interesting character to the layouts. The lobby is comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast was standard warm continental. The desk staff was friendly and had maps available for us to take with us when we ventured out to explore. Met my expectations for a budget hotel, nothing stellar but no complaints. The best part obviously is the super convenient location: an easy walk from the train station, an easy walk to the park, zoo, lots of restaurants and shops.
