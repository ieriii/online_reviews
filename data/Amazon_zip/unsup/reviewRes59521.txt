OMG!! If I was having Korean for the first time, this place would have totally ruin my first experience. SERVICE is HORRIBLE!!! We sat for a good 15-20 minutes until someone came to take our order and on top of that, I had to ask for water. Don't sit down resturants generally give you water right away before taking order??  When the lady brought the water, she had her head face toward the floor where you can litterally see the top of her head as she's approaching our table with the tray of water. My friend said maybe it's a culture thing and I didnt think so because I've ate at a lot of Korean places and the first thing you hear when you walk through any korean joint is... "Anyeasayo!" Didn't get that here! The pickled side dishes tasted OLD like they've been sitting out for days. The kimchi radishes are crunchy, these were chewy. Also, the place isn't the most cleanest place either. So that right there tells you what their expectations are. Usually I don't criticize whole in the wall places because BELIEVE ME, i've had some of the best FOOD in whole in the wall places. But definitely look elsewhere for Korean if you're looking for good korean w/ good service.
