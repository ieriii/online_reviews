The first time I went to Le Colonial I wasn't a fan but after going back several times after I decided I liked this place. I love the location and they have very delicious cocktails! The food is different but very tasty. The first time I went there someone at a different table ordered something that smelled awful (some kind of fish maybe?) and that ruined my experience there. The space is a bit cramped but it's kind of intimate and romantic. I'd recommend trying this place, as the food is so different from anything else I've experienced.
