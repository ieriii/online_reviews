Because I work just across the street, there are plenty of days where milk&honey is my breakfast & lunch. They brew Intelligensia coffee, which gets me through too-early weekend morning shifts. And the girls that work inside are wonderful. Try the yogurt parfait with their signature cafe granola or the portabello and goat cheese sandwich (a fall/winter regular).
