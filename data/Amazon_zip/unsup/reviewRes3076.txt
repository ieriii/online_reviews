Hey! Crisp! Me and the lady were out in the neighborhood having some afternoon beers, and she suggested trying out a new korean wings place in the neighborhood. I, always game, agreed. We went to Crisp, conveniently located a half a block from the bar we were at (where we met an entertaining dog that growled at all small wheels--skateboards, rollerblades, rolling suitcases, and nothing else). We got 10 wings, two types, Sassy Seoul and the BBQ, and were surprised that these were full double wings, or 20 "wingettes". Not deterred by our upcoming dinner plans, we ate them all... because they were DELICIOUS. And then we were really full. For a long time. Five stars. Will come back for sure for more wings, and to try the bibimbap.
