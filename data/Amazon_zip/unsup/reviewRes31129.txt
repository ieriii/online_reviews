Each meal I have had here has been absolutely terrific. Brunch, dinner, whatever. They tend to have a great rotation of seasonal items (coming from local farmers and whatnot), which is refreshing to see. They also have a great selection of beers and cocktails if that is more of your thing. The service has generally been terrific and they are very accommodating to any unique requests I've had in the past.
