I've only been here for weekend brunch, but this has quickly become one of my favorite spots in town. I love the decor - very traditional, warm feeling to it. Most importantly, the stuffed french toast is ridiculously good. I can't speak to anything else on the menu because I can't get past ordering the french toast.
