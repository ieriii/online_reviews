Love love love love love love love Spacca Napoli. Spacca offers an enjoyable and unique experience that is well worth the wait! The pizza at Spacca never disappoints - you never run the risk of trying something new and thinking to yourself, Eh, I wish I'd ordered something else. Spacca is so delicious and offers such a warm, unpretentious atmosphere, I would go on a full stomach just to enjoy the company and order something to have for lunch the next day - and I have. If I could, I would give Spacca 10 stars.
