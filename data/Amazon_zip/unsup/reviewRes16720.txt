No, there's no signage outside. Yes, they have several "rules." No, they don't have any flat screens for you to watch the game. Yes, there may be a wait. No, they don't have Grey Goose. Yes, this place is different. Yes, you need to relax. After hearing several mixed reviews of Violet Hour from friends, I had to find out for myself. I showed up with a party of four and we found ourselves waiting in a hallway just inside the front door (don't ask me where the front door is). We couldn't see much because of a large velvet curtain blocking our view from the rest of the hallway. There are several people in front of us and a hostess greets us asking how many our in our party.  "Four." "Four is the magic number." Great, we were able to skip the line because there just so happens to be a table for four open. The whole place is dimly lit. I felt like I just went down the rabbit hole. I'm waiting for our server to ask me if I want the red pill or the blue pill. Instead he brings us the drink menus. If you ever find yourself in the Violet Hour then you must try some of their signature cocktails. I'm not gonna lie, you probably won't enjoy everything on their drink menu...the trick is to find the one for you. I probably sampled half a dozen cocktails. I remember liking the Blackberry Caipirissima. All in all our server was attentive and informative. This place is a great place to engage in conversation with the party you arrived with, as there are not many distractions. Walking around is not really permitted. I liked Violet Hour because of the fact it is not your typical bar. Come here open-minded and enjoy your company.
