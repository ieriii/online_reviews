Yeah, so the bartender was bordering on the side of rude, but I truly feel that the rest of this place totally makes up for it. The rest of it can only be described as marvelous. This is definitely a classy establishment and it's loved by locals as well as the out of towners. I must confess I don't make it out nearly enough as I should but this is one of the better places on the north side to go to for a drink on a weekend.
