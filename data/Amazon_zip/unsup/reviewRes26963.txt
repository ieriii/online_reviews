Pequod's is the result of taking all that is right in the world, baking it in a pizza pan with a caramelized, yeasty crust straight from heaven and having cherubim bless it as it exits the oven and slides down my gullet. If you love pizza the way we serve it up in Chicago, hit this place up. If you don't like it, consider cutting out your tongue because your taste buds have betrayed you.
