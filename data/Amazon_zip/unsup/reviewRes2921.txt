While the experience of eating at TRU is spectacular, the food is really not. After living in the culinary mecca that is San Francisco, eating a meal at TRU only disappointed me, especially since the prices were similar to eating at for instance, my favorite Gary Danko. Luckily, I didn't have to pay for my meal, otherwise I would have been really upset. My main issue with the food was: why were there foam on everything, even the chocolate cake?
