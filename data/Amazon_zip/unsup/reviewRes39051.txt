i highly recommend the garlic and sausage pizza - loaded with garlic and delicious! love the old-school chicago vibe. stopped in on friday and had pasta as well as salad bar. $5 margaritas, awesome service and an accordian player playing tunes from the likes of van morrison, frank sinatra and the beatles. love!
