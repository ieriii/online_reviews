I forgot about you Calo! Its been so long since I lived in your hood! But now that I am back, I shall give you the majority of my pizza eating business....but you HAVE TO DELIVER HOT PIZZA! You gave me cold pizza, hot fries and hot sticks the other day. Tsk tsk...I can be loyal but only to those who are worthy! Don't let it happen again!
