Quick synopsis: Hands down best cocktails I have ever had. Great place for the perfect pre-dinner or post-dinner cocktails, even appropriate for your parents (i did not notice predominantly "hipster" clientele). Definitely not for large groups. Menu cocktails are just as wonderful as those concocted per your preferences. The long version: I was so impressed by this place that I finally made the effort to write a review (note: I also would have also written a review if I was extremely displeased with a place, but fortunately that has not happened yet) Stumbled upon it after parking across the street and noticing the random graffiti and people standing outside. On our way back to the car we stopped by to see what it was, thinking it was a private venue or an art gallery, but no, it was a lounge. I had the intention of finding a nice bar to have a proper Negroni, but being new to the Chicago area I had no clue where to start looking. Although I already had dinner, I was still craving one...and this place was the perfect place. I had the seasonal Negroni, it was pleasant. I was told by our knowledgeable bartender/mixologist they had 15 Piscos on hand, therefore he made me the best Pisco sour I have had to date. I am also a huge fan of bitters, so I was impressed by their selection, and the way they were displayed in brown medicine bottles. It added to the whole feel of being in a different era for a minute, perhaps the 1920's, without the smoke of course. The lack of an overcrowded environment, the simplicity of the place, the attention given to making a cocktail, and the amazing bartenders made it worth every minute. I didn't order any food, seems like fancy bar food, suitable for the drinks I suppose, but the drinks are top notch.
