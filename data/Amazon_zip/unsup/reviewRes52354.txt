If you like deep dish/Chicago style pizza, this is one of several palces you can go. Uno, Gino's East, and Giordano's. It's tough to tell all of them apart. Our experience started with Toasted Raviolis, which were ok. We then were told by our waiter that the pizza to order was the supreme with the wheel of thin sausage patty at the bottom of the pizza. The two girls I was with ended up pulling the patty out as they didn't enjoy it. Waiter was a little katty and complained a little too much.
