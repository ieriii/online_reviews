I expected to be as enthralled as I was years ago, did not happen. Our table was in the middle of the restaurant and I must have been bumped about ten times (primarily by wait staff). Despite the restaurant not even half full, they would not move us. The salmon entree and the shrimp in curry sauce were very good. Underwhelmed by the soft spring rolls. Wine list was impressive. I won't be returning soon.
