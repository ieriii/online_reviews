My friend and i showed up around 7pm on a Tuesday night- super packed but we waited in a heated area for about 15 minutes while they served organic tea. The wait was worth it! The best vegan place ever. The vegan meat (seitan) tastes like real meat. We had the radical vegan and the pesto chicken. Both were delicious. Waitstaff is patient and friendly and will explain the dishes to you. I'll be going back many more times just to sample all the stuff on the menu!
