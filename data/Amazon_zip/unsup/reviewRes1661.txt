These hot dogs owned me. The specialty dogs are so rich and full of flavor I almost couldn't handle it. I ate two bites, and had to take a break. Even the regular dogs are yum. -1 for the long wait (2 hours on a Saturday). +1 for Doug manning the counter (awww you care!) Dang. I just had it yesterday, but I'm already craving it again...
