Honestly, this is one of those places that when someone says "I really like hot dogs" and you ask them what their favorite Hot Dougs sausage is, and they can't answer, you stop trusting them as a friend. Everything is great here. You can go with the standard Chicago dog, which all good chicagoans can appreciate, all the way to a Duck Sausage with Foie Gras Mousse.  I've yet to have a bad meal from Hot Dougs, not have I dined with anyone who had a bad meal.  Some of the Sausages are very heavy, so be prepared, it may seem indulgent to get two sausages, but be prepared for a post-sausage food coma if you do.
