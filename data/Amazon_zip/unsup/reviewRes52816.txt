Finally stopped by and sat on the patio on a cool, October evening. The heaters are nice and I love the atmosphere of the patio. Everyone is very friendly. I've had some cuban food before- I lived in Florida for several years- but I've never been the biggest fan. My experience has been that they enjoy frying stuff to within an inch of its life. Pleasantly, the food was very good!...but expensive for what you get. The only reason I would not give 5 stars is because of the prices. One dish we ordered was off the specialty menu, the garlic shrimp Camarones al Ajillo, and the other was off the regular dinner menu- pollo with onions. I guess I was expecting something to be different between the two plates, since one was specialty... but they were the exact same (the protein was different, obviously). That was a bit disappointing. I mean, I paid extra for shrimp... but that was the only special thing about it. That being said, I enjoyed all the sides- plantains, beans, and rice. I wish we could have sampled some more between the two of us... but next time I suppose. If we both had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day, that might have justified the prices. But there wasn't much leftover. I would return because it was good all around and BYOB, but too expensive to be a regular fixture on my restaurant rotation.
