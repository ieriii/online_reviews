Nice big space that is a great, non-crowded place to grab a small bite or drink on a Saturday night. Jimmy is a great bartender, mixing up whatever your heart desires. Great selection of wines and cheeses. Don't forget to try the flights. Best part is you can take many of the bottles home with you if you find something you like. Great space to take a date!
