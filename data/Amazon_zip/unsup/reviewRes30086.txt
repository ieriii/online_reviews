The Titanic BLT burger that is currently on the menu is awesome. The patty is flavoured with red bell peppers, and it had the right texture balance of moist but chewy. Seitan bacon, french fried onions and BBQ mayo bump up the taste even more. I added vegan mozzarella, but I think it wasn't necessary. As a side I got the flashed greens. They're lightly coated with gingery, garlicky oil - so yummy! While I still eat too much at the Diner, the greens seem to reduce the food-coma feeling more than fries would. We shared a cookie dough/peanut butter vegan milkshake before our burgers came. Just as good as I remember it! I don't think I could finish one on my own anymore; they are pretty rich. We had to wait for a seat for a little bit, but there is now a tent in the back patio. No more crowding in the doorway or sitting on the bench outside. Our server was friendly and helpful; I'm glad he recommended the burger!
