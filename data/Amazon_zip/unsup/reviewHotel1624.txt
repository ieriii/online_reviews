I stayed here last week when I was in town to see a couple of shows. The first thing I noticed upon my arrival was the professionalism of the staff. I was very impressed with their helpful attitudes. Next, I ordered room service since I was crunched for time and found it to be enjoyable...no complaints. I liked the room I stayed in and did not find it to be as small as I expected after reading other reviews. It was certainly larger and, dare I say nicer, than the room I stayed in at the Hard Rock Hotel during my only other visit to Chicago. The bathroom was huge and nicely decorated with a shower and tub and two vanities. I did not have a problem with the elevators unlike other reviewers. In fact, there was one waiting for me on several occasions. The only things I saw as lacking was there was no refrigerator in the room and the bar in the lobby is lame compared to the one at Hard Rock. Other than that, I'd much rather stay at Hotel 71 on my next visit to Chicago. It doesn't have the "cool" factor that the Hard Rock has but in many aspects, I found it to be a better hotel.
