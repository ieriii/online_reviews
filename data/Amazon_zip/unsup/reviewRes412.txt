We enjoyed a fine 12 course experience at Alinea. I'd say the wine pairings were quite wonderfully well done.  We did have three courses where we were not at all wowed by the food and that really surprised me. I will recall my past experience at Moto and say that I did not have any course that I found to be lackluster. For the money, that should absolutely be the case. Kudos to the staff who were watchful, never intrusive and completely informative on the food experiences and the wine pairings. We also appreciated the small details of our coats and car were already waiting for us by the time we reached the lobby to depart.  The atmosphere was austere as one might expect. Our table was so large that my date and I had difficulty communicating without shouting, which I found to be a bummer as it was a very quiet place.
