Boo you Brazzaz!!!! My boyfriend took me to Brazzaz this past Friday for restaurant week. We had a reservation at 8:30pm and we were running a little late so we called to let them know we would be 15 minutes late. The host looked up our reservation, changed the time and said it was all set. We arrived close to 8:50 and somehow during the 20 extra minutes it took to get there, they lost our reservation. We were told they would bump us up on the waiting list and it would only be a 10-15 minute wait for the two of us. I was fine with that so we decided to wait... 40 minutes later as we watched almost everyone that came in after us get seated we were starving and grumpy. My boyfriend went up (at now 9:40) to ask what the hold up was. They thought we were a group of four.. You would think with five hostess' things would go smoother than this!! Finally, we were seated... in the worst seat possible. We sat right next to the stairs and with me sitting on the inside, barely having any room to breathe (much less, eat), and my boyfriend getting shoved and smacked by every waiter, gaucho, and busboy running by. But we were still gracious and just decided to enjoy the rest of the evening. We ate and the asado was good (nothing to rave about), but I gotta say the mushroom risotto was pretty fantastic. Not that you would pay that much just to get some dang risotto.. It was the highlight of my evening. Now the bill comes.. After making a reservation for restaurant week (which they lost) and telling the waiter earlier in the evening we were there for RW we were still overcharged! In a nut shell, my visit here was utterly disappointing..
