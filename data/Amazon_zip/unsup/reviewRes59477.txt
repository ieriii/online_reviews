My family loves LaVilla!We discovered it years ago and have had just about every major family celebration there since. Wedding anniversary, baby showers, graduations, Super Bowl parties, you name it. Plus we try to get there at least once a week.Saturday - Spinach Egg Drop soup! Yummy!Chris, Jose and Gwen along with all the staff are wonderful. They make you feel like you are going home for a meal.Portions? HUGE! Plan on taking home a whole extra meal from your leftovers.I really haven't had their pizza. But try the Chicken Parm or the Breaded Pork Chops.Love La Villa!
