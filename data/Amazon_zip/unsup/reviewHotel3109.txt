Somebody pass me some Grey Goose Vodka or Remy Martin VSOP. I need a cognac to chill is this lobby because it so laxed and trendy . I have stayed here about 4 times . And I don't have anything negative to say about it . The rooms remind me of my own bedroom but the beds are much fluffier and cozy ....it's like sleeping on a cloud! The IPod dock was the best because I never leave home without the music. Loved the shower which was like raindrops.....sexxxy- Basically the whole setting makes you want to get close with the one you love to love which is why me and my hunny are repeat offenders ....actually going this month
