Generally I like to give new places some time to work out the kinks before checking them out. Bad Apple still seems to be working out those kinks. First things first, yes they have copious amounts of micro/small craft beers. Most of which are great. Pricey, but strong and really good. The food wasn't as exciting. We had the cheese curd appetizer thing and I can see how people would love it. I mean it's cheese, fries and gravy and this is Chicago. But they were nothing to make me want to come back to get. Same with my slow burn burger. It was slow to arrive, but I didn't get much burn. Burger was cooked medium rare, which was awesome for me. The fries were really crisp, but in a cold, over cooked way. My wife and her friend had a slight snafu with their order, they wanted the texas burger with the pulled pork. They got the pig 'n pint sandwich. My wife thought she said the burger with the pulled pork, the waitress said she ordered the pulled pork sandwich. So I'm not sure who's to blame here, my wife for not being clear, or the waitress for not double checking that she wanted the burger with pulled pork or the pork sandwich. The waitress offered no apology and was pretty blase about the situation, but we weren't looking to make a big deal out of it. I guess I was hoping for a "my bad" from the waitress because that really would have gone a really long way. It was just one of those things that kinda of rubbed me the wrong way. But they both enjoyed the pig 'n pint sandwich. In the end the place was ok. So I'll be back for another beer or 4, but I'll probably ask a friend to bring up a burger and fries from 5 guys and use the money I save on an extra belgian beer.
