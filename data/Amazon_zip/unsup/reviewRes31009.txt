Very good stuff. I usually hate dishes like lobster mash potatoes for obvious reasons, but here it was pretty good. More importantly, they had a lot to prove and succeeded. The steak, the most important element, was really excellent. I don't eat steak enough to really want to stray from the bone-in ribeye.  Here, though, I tried the bone-in KC (which I think the waiter kept calling bone-in NY --- I don't know enough about cow anatomy to know if that makes any sense). Since its on ridiculously hot plates, if you usually go medium rare and lean towards the rarer side, I'd go rare (that's what I did and in the end it was more medium-rare than rare).  Anyways, it was awesome. Some of the best flavor I have had in town. I was able to taste the bone-in ribeye as well which actually lacked a bit of flavor compared to my KC/NY. I would say flavor-wise its comparable to Joe's. If that mean's anything to you I would suggest trying this place. I still prefer the ambiance at Joe's and some of the other spots - this is a bit too dark at Mastro's and the tables for two are ridiculously long (felt like I was really far away from the other side of the table). Service was good. Is there a specific steakhouse server academy these guys all go to? It was what you would expect.
