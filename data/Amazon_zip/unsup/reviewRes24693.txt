My boss brought me and my co-workers lunch from here (yeah, he's pretty cool) on a whim. Free lunch? Don't mind if I do. He brought us an assortment of things, salad, personal pizzas, artopitas, and some cookies. I snagged one of the Mediterranean salads and a small Hawaiian pizza. The veggies in the salad were fresh and the feta was delicious. Being the idiot I am, I assumed the olives were pitted and bit right into a pit, but that's completely my fault. A slight negative was that the salad was heavily dressed to the point that there was a pool of oil at the bottom after I was done. Just a personal preference, but I would have preferred less dressing. The pizza was just okay. You can't really mess up pizza, but it wasn't something to rave about either.  In hindsight I should have probably eaten one of the artopitas instead, it is a Greek restaurant after all, but I was left full and satisfied. It was a free meal after all.
