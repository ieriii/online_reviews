What can i say, Sabatinos is da bomb! As good as it gets for sure and worthy of my very first yelp! Someone said it best on Check Please! that Sabatinos is a hidden gem of chicago. Lost in yesterday's era, this place gives you tons of food for a reasonable price.  I have a huge appetite and this is one of the few places that really satisfies it... for real!  Let me say that if you are able to leave this place without bringing home leftovers, then we should hang out :) Notable mentions: - free pizza bread to start, uhm... what can i say but yum - nice warm loaf of bread as well, gotta have my bread warm, definitely losing a star if that's not the case. And note that i said LOAF, not a few slices... love my bread. - soup and salad comes with all dinners, yeah, gotta have the spinach stracciatella... it is one of the main reasons i go there, sooo good! (note that they don't offer it to you sometimes, but i think this is a test because if you know, then you ask!) - pasta also comes with it... i typically get the mostaccioli, but whatever... think you can get a baked potato as well. - my favorite dish is the Chicken Toscana (sp?), awesome, where do they even get artichoke bottoms???  very very dee-lious - for dessert (if you can make it), can't go wrong with baked alaska (for 2). i think it's like baked ice cream cake with some type of meringue on top that's set on fire at your table side and then put out with a gravy boat of hot chocolate fudge syrup... ok, i'm hungry now!
