DISAPPOINTED! Went to Mastro's in Scottsdale was unbelievable. The Chicago Mastro's really missed on all accounts. The service was just ok and it took a little long to greet up when we sat. The appetizers were the best part of our meal( stuffed mushroom and tuna tartar ) Our waiter just wanted to up sell, really no need to everything is expressive here. Found the bone in Filet just ok, my fish was dry and tasteless (they did take it off our bill) We did get a birthday desert delivered but once again the waiting never came around to see if we wanted coffee or any other deserts. Capital Grill is 100 times better then this Arizona transplant. Really disappointed.
