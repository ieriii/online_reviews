Awful. The server assured us that we ordered two of the best things off the menu (his favorites) but yikes - these dishes were so bad. Salty, dense, heavy - I feel sick just thinking about it. I barely ate any of my plate and decided to take it home as not to waste the leftovers and hopefully doctor it up a little to make it more edible. Opening the dish the next day was no less disturbing. I saw all the fat and oil just sitting there and had to throw it out - so unappealing. I like my pasta more light, fresh, and authentic. I won't be back.
