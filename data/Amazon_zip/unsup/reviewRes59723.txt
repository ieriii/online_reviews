Took my wife here for her birthday dinner, the food was GREAT, but our server was average at best. We each had a house salad to start, I had the filet, she had the petite filet and we split an order of the Au Gratin Potatoes. GREAT filets, very tender and seasoned perfectly.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that our server was very unattentive and seemed very inexperienced. When my wife asked him for a wine pairing with a certain dish, he had no clue.With that said, solid dining experience!!
