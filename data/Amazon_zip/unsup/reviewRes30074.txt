Cute little cafe/restaurant. I came to meet a client here on a Sunday afternoon, and circled the blocks for free street parking...but finally had to pay the meters since the street parking required a permit. (*Note - meters are getting so expensive in the city! It's almost up there with SF's meter prices now!)  I got a vanilla latte (delicious) and my client got a tea. We chatted for about 45 minutes, and when we asked our waiter for the bill, he said it was on the house! Hm...we were so confused. He must have got a glimpse of our confused faces, so turned back around and asked if that was 'okay'? Ha ha. We said yes (tentatively) ...but still decided to tip him a couple bucks.  Cute place. Will have to come back here and try the food given all the good reviews here.
