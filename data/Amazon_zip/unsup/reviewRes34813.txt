I'll preface this by saying that I've only ever ordered delivery from Sushi X...but I've never been disappointed in the quality. The specialty rolls are wonderful, and the fish is perfectly fresh and delicious.  The only drawback is that it's relatively expensive...but I truly believe that with sushi, you get what you pay for, so I'm willing to spend a little extra.
