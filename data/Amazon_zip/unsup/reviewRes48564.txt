My boyfriend and I have been here twice..once for dinner and once for brunch. We loved it!!!! Our most recent visit was for brunch. I had the cabernet poached eggs and he had the deep-fried french toast with a side pork belly bacon. We both pretty much licked our plates clean!  We went to The Publican for dinner last year for Valentine's Day...it was intimate and perfect. Our server was very knowledgeable of and helpful with the menu and concept as it was our first time there. The oysters were amazing and melted in my mouth!!!! We ordered an assortment of menu items (seafood dishes, meat samplings, vegies and of course, pork) and shared everything. Everything was DELICIOUS! I am very pleased to live near this establishment as it is top notch and will be around for awhile!!!!
