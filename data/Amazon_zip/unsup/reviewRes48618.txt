I've been to the Publican several times now and all I can say is - get thee to this ale house now! Every time I've been, the service has been impeccable. Even when I came for the restaurant week special, our server was extremely gracious and gave us a free tasting of 3 beers as we navigated the beer menu - practically uncharted territory for my girlfriend and I. The one thing that must come with every meal - the pork rinds. No joke. I hate pork rinds. But I there's only one place that I'll eat them - at the Publican. Another must is the waffle. Oh my...the waffle is so light and crispy. It's topped with this sweet honey butter and blueberry preserves. I've gotten it at every meal I had at the Publican and have never been disappointed. Brunch has to be my all-time favorite experience at the Publican. They have an excellent tea selection. I can't remember what I got last time, but my waiter basically described it as tasting like...dirt. But in a good way. I think he meant it had very earthy tones - which it did. The bloody mary is so different and so good. You get a small class of a light beer to chase your bloody mary with. Definitely a necessity. All the spices leave your stomach feeling warm and toasty. The artichoke omelette is very good as is the kielbasa. The food is very hearty but they serve you just the right amount. The mussels of course - you can never go wrong with those. I think I could survive Chicago by just eating at Publican, Blackbird, Avec and Big Star. What more could you need?
