mmm, i went to brunch with a group of my MEETin folks, ordered some crawfish omelet thing. ended up getting this strange brown gravy that did not have much creole zest/kick (spice), just bland gravy. two people at my table had cold entrees, in which the braver one, sent the platter back to reheat the dish. the other person was more shy and ate the partially cold dish. in realization, his dish was brought out with the others; yet he was late in ordering (therefore, a reason why the dish was cold). also, there was a strand of short black hair in a bowl of fruit. nonetheless, the small bar seemed nice. i think a nice cup of coffee or a cocktail would better suit this place. although, i hate to be a critical bitch, but this is simply my opinion (and as dennis millers says, "it's just my opinion, i could be wrong").
