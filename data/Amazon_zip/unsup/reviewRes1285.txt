Not much I can add here, except a couple of observations. One from a friend from New York who now lives here. She cannot believe that people line up as they do here and that they act so civil towards one another. I had told her about barging through a line of about 50 people there one day to deliver something to Caliente Doug. She claims in New York I probably would have been attacked or otherwise maimed for that, and that people in line would not be so civil if they were New Yorkers. I hadn't thought of that angle. Even after living and working in New York. My observation about the lines is that I cannot believe that people wait OUTSIDE in 20-degree weather to get in here. I love it dearly, but can guarantee that I would never do that. Back in Oz, where I come from, no-one waits in any lines for anything or anyone. Not cubs, not Apple stores, not rock concerts, nada! Well, maybe if it's just out the door, I would...but not halfway down the block. I am thinking, too, that during our current "economic downturn", foreigners, out-of-towners, and other innocents who drive by Doug's must think it's a Depression bread line, a soup kitchen, or an unemployment office. My other observation is that I am both surprised and impressed by the fact that with all of the hoo-ha and fame surrounding the place, it is still humble Doug who sits there everyday, greets you, and takes your order. I think if I had his culinary success, I would delegate that task. I have to admire him for that.
