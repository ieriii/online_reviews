I had a wonderful first experience at Zed451 and came away pleasantly stuffed. I went with a group of 6. I can't eat dairy and to avoid any complications asked the hostess if I could speak to someone who could go over what I could eat on the menu. Wow! Best dining experience in a long time. I got a private tour of the food from one of the chefs. She pointed out her favorites, which items I shouldn't eat, and even made a few special for me because according to her "I just had to try them." It was really nice and what might have been a stressful eating experience turned into a relaxed, splendid dinner with friends. My friends were jealous because of my special tour of the food! If you have a diet restriction or are even vegetarian, this place is really accommodating. I could have eaten just from the side-bar without having any of the meats/fish brought around (which were also lovely). Everything was yummy. Faves were the pear salad and rabi with sesame oil.
