We were visitors to Chicago and decided to stop in to Revolution Brewery after our visit to Goose Island Brewery and Map Room. Yes, Saturday afternoon turned out to be a bit of a pub crawl.  We grabbed a seat at the bar...service was quick and friendly. We ordered 2 pints and some snacks (bacon fat popcorn and calamari). The popcorn was heavenly. Still thinking about it now. Really loved our visit to Rev. and gladly put it on our "visit again" list when we come back to Chicago.
