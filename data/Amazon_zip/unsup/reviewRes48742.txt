Went here last night with me lady. Food was really good; liked the communal tables. I can see how it wouldn't be the best place for a first date (the people next to use were on what appeared to be a first date and as soon as they left the ENTIRE table talked about them) since you really need to get deep to hear what your date is saying. But at the same time, you're forced to share small plates which is good for dates. Food: Started with the fries with egg (nothing special, they are ff with an egg on top), pork rinds (I don't get it; they don't have much of a flavor other than bacon grease, they are very airy, the dusting on the top was good though), oysters (which were good, but considering there is an open kitchen it doesn't reflect well that the woman shucking the oysters smelled all of them, how fresh are they really??? I've worked in many restaurants dealing with seafood and we were always confident our fish was fresh enough we never had to smell it), the sweetbread (the best thing we got. I don't know exactly what sweetbreads are (or why they are plural, but I suspect there is a correlation)) and the country ribs, which actually weren't ribs and were overcooked. They have an extensive beer menu. I would go again, but there are much better restaurants that are cheaper.
