GROSS! My husband and I ate at Texas de Brazil yesterday and were very disappointed. Thank goodness I had a groupon, otherwise I would be very upset that I paid full price for such a crappy meal. The service was good, but the food was just nasty. The majority of the meat was very dry and salty. We both had upset stomach's after eating the food. There are so many great places to eat in Chicago, please don't waste your time here.
