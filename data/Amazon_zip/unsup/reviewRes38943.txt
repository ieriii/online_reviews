Hands down the best thin crust pizza in Chicago. No doubt about it, and i've eaten pizza from dozens of places in this fine city of ours. The stuffed pizza, well, it pretty much sucks. Stay away from it, and get a thin crust instead. The rest of the food here is mediocre to average at best. I hate to say it, but it's true. I don't really care much, though, because the thin crust pizza is what and why i keep ordering from La Villa, and in that respect they haven't let me down in over 20 years of ordering from them.
