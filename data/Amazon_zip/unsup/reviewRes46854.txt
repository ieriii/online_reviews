I've been to the Wrigleyville location for brunch and I loved it. I visited this location for dinner recently to check it out. The space is much bigger and there's even a small stage area for local musicians to perform.  We got the cauliflower crispy ravioli to start -- I was disappointed it was on the greasy side. For entrees, we ordered the fried chicken and the bacon wrapped meatloaf. I heard the waitress warn another table that the meatloaf came with brussel sprouts. Brussel sprouts have such a bad rap man -- they  are delicious, don't knock 'em till you've tried 'em! Anyway the fried chicken was just okay -- it was moist, but the breading was flavorless. The meatloaf was yummy, the gravy was DELICIOUS. Our service was a little off, it took like 10 minutes for our food to come out, which is like an eternity in restaurant time. Unfortunately, we didn't order the burger this time, but everyone and their moms were ordering it, and it looked sooooo good. I'll be back for that burger.
