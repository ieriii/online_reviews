My partner and I have been going here for years - back when it had all the Red Naugahide Booths!! Now it is a beautiful new restaurant, but Two things have not changed - The FOOD is wonderful - especially their stuffed spinnach pizza. Also - the service and portions are excellent. They always treat their customers right, and they do not skimp. We always have leftovers to take home!! This is my favorite restaurant in Andersonville, and it is consistent!!
