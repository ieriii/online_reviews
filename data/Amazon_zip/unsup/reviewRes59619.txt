I'm a fan of burritos. An even bigger fan of these guys burritos. Just thinking about the juicy seasoned steak complimented by the spicy salsa they give me on the side makes my mouth water. And then I can't stop there. I keep thinking about the mellow guacamole that ties in the crunch of the onions so they work in perfect harmony to provide happy taste buds with what it was looking for. It's cheerful waiters always willing to help and the heaping portion of meat that will forever keep me from ever being a vegetarian and will keep me coming back on a Saturday night when i don't feel like cooking.
