Overall I have heard nothing but great things to say about this place and I went there for the first time over the weekend. I would say that they pretty much live up to there reputation. Only things I can say bad was the food didnt come out all that hot and the menu was somewhat limited. overall pretty solid place that i thought was going to be a lot more expenisve than I thought. Ill be back
