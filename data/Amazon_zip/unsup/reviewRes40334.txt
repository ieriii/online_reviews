longman & eagle is much better in the summer than in the winter. mostly because of the lonnnnnnng wait for a table in the dining room. i love the back outdoor area with the make-shift little bar and the tea lites at each picnic table. it's the perfect ambiance on a summer's night. add some $3 whiskey shots and an old style and i'm a happy camper waiting for my table here! i've only had the burger as an entree (it's good!), and that probably because the two time we've dined here, i've been drinking for over an hour before we sit down and i'm no longer as hungry/excited about the menu. a weird note - the hand soap in the ladies bathroom smells SO GOOD. i'm not kidding. does anyone know what it is???
