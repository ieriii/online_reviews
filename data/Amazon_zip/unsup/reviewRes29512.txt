The entire night was perfect...probably because I was drunk half way into the dinner. The Margaritas there are dangerously non-alcoholic tasting yet will place you half in the bag. If you are worried about the recession this is not the place to go things get pricey quickly. I was told this was the best place in Chicago and I was not let down.
