I have a crush on Rick Bayless. If I had more time, it would probably rise to the level of stalking, but fortunately for RB, I'm pretty busy these days. I love Frontera. In fact, I like it even better than Topolobampo. The food at Topolo is INCREDIBLE, but there is just something off about the combination of Mexican food and white tableclothes. Like eating burritos in that room you were never allowed to go in when you were a kid.  Anyway, Frontera is the opposite. It's casual, unpretentious, fun, the food is amazeballs and its reasonably priced.
