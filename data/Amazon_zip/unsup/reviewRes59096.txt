It's good - not great. I had the eggs benedict which they boast are the best in town but I could have made them better. They weren't bad...just nothing special. My husband had a skillet dish and it was average as well. The service was slow and our waitress never checked back with us once she delivered the food. Skip this place and go to the Bongo Room - amazing food that does not disappoint.
