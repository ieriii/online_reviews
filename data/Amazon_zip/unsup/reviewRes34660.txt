I was very excited to go back to the sultan's market after my 4 year vacay from Chicago! When I walked in I was shocked, not only did it look completly different, it wasn't that hole in the wall closet sized secret that it used to be. I will always be a fan of the sultan! Only thing- cash only- which is to be expected of any quick eat in the city. My favorite is the chicken shawerma sandwich- followed a close second by the falafel. I just wish they would be so stingy with the hot sauce. The two young guys working were wearing a pretty offensive hat considering the mix of family and wicker park usuals. I'm wondering what the sultan will do next!
