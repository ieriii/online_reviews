Pretty good burgers. It's the Kumas that doesn't give you food poisoning. Their pretzel rolls are the best! My girlfriend each got our own burgers. We should have only gotten one because they are so huge. The only negative was the small appetizer. Cheese Curds were a bit soggy. But pretty good burgers and a great beer selection.
