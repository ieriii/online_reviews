Pequod's.....why did it take me soooo long to find you?? Our first date was slightly off when I was told it was the best pizza out there only to be taken by a friend to get the thin crust pizza?! That was then and this is now when I stumbled back in and experienced the REAL deal DEEP dish pizza. Yum....yum!! Can you say carmellized crust.....that's right the crust is consistently and deliciously always carmelized in Pequod's fashion. This is a tough choice as there are many options in the area but my crown goes to Pequod's for the best deep dish za' in all of Chicago. Go for the pizza and stay for the beers!
