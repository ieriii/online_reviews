I woke this morning with an inexplicable and uncontrollable urge for a (French) sandwich jambon fromage. You can't get one of those in Chicago. The Purple Pig is located fantastically close to U Chicago's Gleacher center, and thus makes for a luxurious break between Saturday classes. I did not get French jambon, nor did I find any version of Swiss on the cheese menu, but boy, oh boy! did everything turn out right. I was initially daunted by following a group of 45 conference attendees through the door. No worries. Seat at the bar, delightful bartender, and the best lunch I've had in as long as I can remember.  I ordered Serrano ham and Bucheron. Oh yes, and wine, of course. All paled in comparison to the Bucheron, which was so extraordinary that I was incapable of keeping my eyes open to enjoy it. My eyes closed of their own accord, and I was swept away into the magical kingdom that is French cheese and fresh bread. I don't know what the other bar patrons thought of that, and I do not care. The wines were too expensive, I'm very sorry to say. The $7 glasses of wine were stingy. When I say stingy, I mean disappointingly small.  All things considered, my experience was wonderful. I sidled out of the Purple Pig shining a satisfied smile, and I will be back.
