Can someone please tell me what happened to the music at Fifty/fifty?? The DJ was horrible last Saturday! She would play half a good song, then play 4 or 5 songs NO ONE had ever heard of! She cleared the dance floor repeatedly! Take the hint, your DJ skills suck. She ruined a fun night! The line InnJoy was too long by the time we gave up on 50/50. So disappointed! Note: Go to InnJoy FIRST!
