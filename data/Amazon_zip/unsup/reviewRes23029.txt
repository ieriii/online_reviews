The goods: Food is cheap and generous. I've had the pepito ribeye sandwich multiple times (you find a winner and you stick with it). It's $4.50 and huge at that price. Tastes great with it's grilled onions, bean spread, muenster cheese and lizano sauce. Try the oatmeal shake (with milk if you're up to it), it's like a thick horchata. The chips they serve are salty and sometimes stale...but the salsa verde is mighty nice. also, the atmosphere is lacking...mostly just posters from the costa rican board of tourism.
