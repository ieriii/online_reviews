The boyfriend said "I'm in the mood for a meal that's terrible for me," so I suggested this place. Nothing says unhealthy to me like burgers, fries, and beer, and the menu on the website made this place look like the perfect destination, and boy, was it. I had the Sir Loin burger, a burger complete with steak on top, as well as horseradish herb aioli, and provolone, with the garlic fries. The burger was wonderful, though the steak kept sliding out, and the fries were perfect. (Garlic is my weakness, apparently.) The creole fries were really good too, and not too spicy for a wimp like me. One great thing about this place is the HUGE beer list. We didn't even glance at the bottled list because they had so many interesting options on tap, and some have the option to dry a 1 oz serving for $1! A great way to get a feeling for some of the weirder options. My only real issue with this place was the noise level. The music was pretty loud, especially considering the conversation level was also pretty high. I understand loudness from conversation, but there's no need to crank up the music on top of that. At any rate, I'll be back, but possibly at a less busy time so I don't feel like I'm shouting across the table.
