Whenever I have my bibimbop(buddha bowl) craving I go here. I love their brown rice option for the bowls and they give you a hefty portion of bulgogi(marianted beef). I've also tried their seoul sassy and the plain jane; both really good. Atmosphere is great and lively. One drawback is that it can get pricey...but nevertheless, worth every penny!
