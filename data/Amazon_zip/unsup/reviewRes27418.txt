I need to go back there. I had the "Pollo en Mole" (Chicken in a chocolate/bean based sauce) and it was delicious. This dish was something totally new and tasted like nothing i ever had before.By looking at my friend's plates, I knew i was going back there. They serve chips w/ salsa and a small soup as free appetizers. The horchata there is legit.
