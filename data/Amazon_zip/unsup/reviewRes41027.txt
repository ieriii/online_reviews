When first walking into La Pasadita you notice that the food must take center stage because the atmosphere does not. Fluoresecent lighting and school bus yellow booths aren't my taste, but that's not what you come here for. Amazing menu with some of the biggest and best prepared burritos around. Patient staff who are fast and friendly. Expect a late nite feeding frenzy due to places like Evil Olive being right around the corner . I suggest everything on the menu but the burritos are the real star . Wrapped with your choice of meat(or veggies for the vegetarians out there ) go for the super and they'll wrap it up with guacomole, sour cream and rice. Yum!
