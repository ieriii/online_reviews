Absolutely no complaints - none at all! We started with the Buffalo Frog Legs with whipped Blue cheese (I could bathe in that blue cheese), pork cheeks and bone marrow.  I was not a fan of the bone marrow (two reasons - we give our dog bones that are identical, and the texture) but every plate was licked clean. Luckily, not literally. Wonderful whiskey list, beer list and delicious cocktails! I had the dark and stormy - I could have had 10. For our entrees one person had the burger (melt in your mouth quality), pork belly (so much flavor and world of deliciousness), soft shell crab (i missed the boat on getting a bite!) and I had the beef. So so so so so so good! I highly recommend Longman & Eagle! Can't wait to go back!
