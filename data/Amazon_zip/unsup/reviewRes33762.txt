Sometimes, the best choice is not having to make a choice. With their large and mouth-watering selection of breakfast goodies, I was having a hard time picking just one thing to try. Then, I saw it. The Tour de France. A sampling of the three french toast varieties I was having the hardest time deciding between. Banana nut bread with bananas and peanut butter. Orange bread with strawberries. Lemon poppyseed bread with blueberries and lemon sauce. Oh. My. I'm not a huge breakfast fan, but I want this every day for the rest of my life. The breads themselves were all amazing. The fruit was fresh and flavorful. The sauce was a perfect compliment, and the peanut butter had a hearty, stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth consistency. The consensus of our table of eight was that my decision won - and that's saying a lot considering the other choices included bacon quesadillas, peach cobbler crepes, and strawberry & chocolate chip pancakes among other scrumptious-looking dishes.
