Pancakes, Egg and Meat: and substituted with chocolate strawberry pancake. Supposedly for big eaters but let me say, I demolished that dish. It was delicious. The cool thing is that there's a contemporary feel to the place, while giving you a great diner-like breakfast. I really enjoyed how they let me substitute the pancakes but it wasn't for free. There's a really big line that makes you wonder if it's worth it, breakfast is one of those meals where I feel it's hard to screw it up. Yolk did not disappoint. I loved how the chocolate strawberry pancakes were not too sweet but they had a very good ratio of fruit to pancake so you don't feel overwhelmed.
