Nice atmosphere with oriental rugs on the walls, acoustic tile made from rugs all of which make for a unique environment, but also absorbs sound which, in my mind, is a big giant plus. So many places to eat are so noisy that it is hard to enjoy a conversation, but not the case with Icosium. The coffee is good, and also organic. The menu is excellent with a lot of healthy choices. At first, the prices seem high for a crepe, but when you see what you get: giant crepe filled with delicious healthy ingredients and a bowl of soup, it is priced very reasonably. The people working there are friendly without being imposing and the service is efficient. Basically, I felt comfortable, at ease and the food and coffee was great. Looking forward to going back.
