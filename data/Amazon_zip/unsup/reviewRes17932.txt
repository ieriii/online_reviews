Remember the best sex you ever had? Pillow-clutchingly, lip-bitingly, sweat-pouringly amazing passion that leaves you breathless and satisfied but always wanting more? Caro Mio is your real-life food-so-good-it's-like-sex restaurant. It's like a gang of pasta-and-sauce prostitutes that lures me back to the corner of Wilson and Wolcott for more and more and more. Although they have plenty of non-pasta options, I cannot helped but dive into carb overload here. My first true love was the agnelotti rossini covered in chunks of prosciutto in a cream sauce deliciousness. I was then tempted by the fruit of the gnocchi stuffed with asiago and pesto (a.k.a. gnocchi stuffed with ecstasy). Most recently I have found a new love with their "special" - breaded chicken parmesan baked in mozzrella topped with a meaty bolognese sauce set upon bed of house-made rigatoni! OMG. Seriously. Party in your mouth... party in your tummy... crazy party in your pants! Meat bonanza! If I could trade sex for this chicken parmesan every day, I would*. (Totally kidding. I could never do that to myself. Plus, that would severely piss the S/O off. And me, too.). I wouldn't be surprised if E.L. James's next novel was "50 Shades of Italian" and based it on Caro Mio.  The food here is to die for. No wait ... dying sucks. This food is TO LIVE FOR!  Don't be turned off by the prices - the quality and portion sizes are WELL worth it. The plates range anywhere from $15-$22 (with a few specialty plates higher) but it will easily be 2, maybe even 3, foodgasms. Unless you're hungry like Chris Farley in "Gap Girls"; in that case, 1 1/2.  This is literally one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Chicago, so if you've never had any Italian in you, swipe your v-card and head up to Caro Mio. It'll blow your mind... and... other things.
