Sunda was pretty good. Not completely kick-ass, however. The Kobe Beef sushi (?) was pretty damn good. I had the terriaki chicken for lunch, which wasn't that great. It was what I'd consider to be 'fairly fair.' It was pretty dry and chewy. I like that in a granola bar, but not so much in Chicken. I ordered a mixed green salad, but got a seaweed salad instead. What do I look like? A krill? I don't dine on seaweed. Anyhow, it was a decent experience and the food was ok. It just didn't hit a grand slam of deliciousness.
