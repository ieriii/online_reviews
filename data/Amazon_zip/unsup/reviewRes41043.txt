Huge Fan here! This is a great place to bring a group especially with out of towners, what a great cultural mix of people, one thing is for sure this is not on the typical Chicago Tour guide, unless you are visiting me of course! The Pho is inexpensive, plentiful and diverse! Pages upon pages of wonderful selections! I try and change it up every time, and every time I find a wonderful bowl or plate of comforting flavorful food! Try some of the unusual selections made with parts of the cow you would normally not expect in a bowl, let alone for sale, you will be surprised at how flavorful and delightful they can be, you may even find happiness in a new texture and consistency,... New flavors textures and consistencies are all over this menu, good luck trying to find bad food, I have been more times then I can remember and have yet to be disappointed! Oh and BYOB, yeah I have been Tanked at Tank not gonna lie!
