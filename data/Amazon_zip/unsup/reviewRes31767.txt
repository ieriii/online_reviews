I just love this place. The atmosphere is great, it's fresh and bright. It's a perk me up just walking in. I went there for lunch but had break fats food. The stuffed french toast was incredible. It had just the right hint of cheese and lemon rind that didn't take away from the toast itself. Funny thing is that when I was waiting for my food, I heard the owner say to the chef, " there is something missing from that toast". They are looking out the presentation as well as the content. They threw in some garnish and powered sugar. I had a side of homemade choriso. Not quite bacon is it. But it was just right, not too grease not to overwhelming. They have incredible fresh squeezed fruit juices. I had glass of carrot it was one of the best I have ever had. The chilaquilles weren't bad either, not run of the mill, kind of gritty and rustic. Very original. I highly recommend this place. I can't wait to go back...
