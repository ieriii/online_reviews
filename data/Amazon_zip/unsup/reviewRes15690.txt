yuuuuuuum. i've been here twice. both of which were for a late dinner. both of which were delicious! it's been some time, so i can't exactly tell you what dishes i got.. one was large noodles filled with cheese and spinach and a cheesy creamy sweet-ish sauce on top of it that may have given me a foodgasm.. another was some sort of pasta dish with marinara sauce, huge chunks of italian sausage, chicken, red peppers, and asparagus. which was two full meals for me. i've also had the joy of trying the hawaiin pizza - delightful! the barbeque sauce wasn't over powering, and there was just enough canadian bacon and pineapple to balance each other out. the crust was deliciously crispy. and the spinach artichoke dip - amaaaazing. the wait staff here is not extremely attentive, however if you ask questions they'll give you honest answers.
