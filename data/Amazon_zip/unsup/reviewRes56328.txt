Instead of making this a creative writing assignment, I'm going to make this short and sweet.  I had a craving for Pho and didn't want to hike up to Argyle. The entry at first looks like it's just a hole in the wall, but surprised to find a very cozy dining room to the left.  We were greeted with complimentary ginger tea, great meal and served complimentary fresh fruit and sweet rice cake. The host/owner was sweet and endearing. I will definitely come back!
