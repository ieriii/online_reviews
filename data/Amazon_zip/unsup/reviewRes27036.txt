Theater and performance all around. The wait staff has a look and an attitude. It was enjoyable service- not snobby,but like you are in the clubhouse and in on the inside jokes. The bar serves some amazing bourbons- we took the bartender's suggestions and that was good. The juxtaposition of these big plates with teeny food arranged oh-so artistically is amusing although half way through our ten courses I wanted a huge leg of something mammalian or a nice big pile of veggies. Maybe my natural gluttony was trying to take the night back from my poser-gourmand.  The wine pairings: agreed was one wow (Thackery "Pleiades") and the rest nice. Nice port to finish. Foie GRAS lollipops with pop rocks- well, one must try that oddity, mustn't one? The texture was pleasing to me but others thought it strange. Deconstructed salad yummy, lamb great, and so on and so forth. Fab-o soup. Wanted much more of the desserts.  We were treated to a kitchen tour and loved meeting back of house team. All the cool kids work here. Kitchen smallish and clearly a well-planned and maintained space. Next day: we felt this was truly a fun thing to have done. I say "don't over think it." it mostly works and when it didn't we had fun figuring out why. I liked the way my food looked. I liked my stylized waiters. If you like Top 40 music and equally safe bites, maybe not for you. But if you are fanciful at heart and have some spare dough to toss, this is uniqueness worth imbibing in.
