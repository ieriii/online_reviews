My husband and I ventured here on a Sunday in the late morning and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. I was told its a good idea to make reservations which makes perfect sense however more than half the place was empty so I'm not sure who exactly they were waiting for as it never filled up when we were there. The service is less than mediocre and that's being generous. Both of our coffee cups were empty and we aren't speedy drinkers. That should never happen. I will say though that they have Intellegenstia coffee which is a bonus. It would have been great if it was hot though. I felt like we were forgotten but then I looked around and it appeared like the other tables were as well. When we did see the waitstaff, they were very friendly but that doesn't make up for forgetting about us. The food was OK, not as flavorful as I anticipated from the reviews. My husband ordered the catfish with plantains served over black beans and rice. It wasn't very hot and it wasn't that exciting. I ordered the corn cakes with eggs and avocado served over black beans. It wasn't super hot and lacked any kind of flair. They do start you out with fresh, hot beignets that are rather tasty. I'm sorry to say after that, it's all downhill. We really wanted to love this place but the Chicago competition is tough.
