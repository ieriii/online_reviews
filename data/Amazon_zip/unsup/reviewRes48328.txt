Wow -- this place is fantastic. I went here last week with a marketing industry buddy (Brad "bedouin" B.) and we had the following: - 12 Oysters (never enough -- I could have eaten 25 by myself) -- they were very good! - Pork rinds -- wow really? NEVER had these before -- they were light and crispy and delicious. You totally forget it's pure fat fried in fat. - Potee -- very tender -- I VERY, VERY rarely eat pork -- it was great. - Sweetbreads - I am a very adventurous eater -- so why the fuck not try the thymus glad of a cow? I enjoyed it -- I did not like the texture but the taste was great. -- Cheese plate -- umm...it's cheese. I love cheese. My bones are made from pure cheese. If you do an x-ray of my hands you will find cheese sticks. :) I thought the way the seating was arranged was very interesting -- it made it very fun. I met some awesome people who were sitting next to me! What more could you want! :) Bottom line: this place rocks -- the beer selection is incredible. The food was top notch (even the cow glands -- who'd have thought?!). Go -- enjoy your time -- I look forward to reading your reviews!!
