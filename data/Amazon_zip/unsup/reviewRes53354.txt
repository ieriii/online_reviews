Wow, words can't express how thankful I am that Grant Achatz is living in my side of town, making my experience living in Chicago that much better with his work of art: his food!Alinea is easily one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The service was impeccable, the variety on the menu makes you want to try everything, and the food is flavorful and engaging to the soul! Give it a try, you will definitely go back for a 2nd, 3rd, and so on time! Bon appetite!
