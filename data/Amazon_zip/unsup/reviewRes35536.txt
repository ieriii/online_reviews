I don't think I ever felt so full in my whole life!!! Three of us ordered the Beijing Duck ($30), which comes with carved duck with the usual assortments (scallions, steamed buns) along with unusual (picked daikon radish and carrots); followed by big bowl of duck soup, duck fried rice and sorbet at the end. Also, we ordered one veggie dish (stir fried u choy with garlic... soooo good). The corkage fee was only $3, which the server opened for us, and gave us a plastic water glass to drink our wine. We had plenty of leftovers for next day, which I ate for breakfast (so that I don't waste food), as we already had lunch and a dinner plans. I wish we had at least 2 or 3 more people with us, so that we could have ordered more items off the menu, which all sounded promising. $30 is such a great deal considering the amount of food you get. Also, I enjoyed the duck quite a bit. Nice, crispy skin and succulent meat. The server who curved the duck was sweet. She was talking about her dad being the faster carver than her, and her sister also working there so I assume that her family owns the place. Some reviewers mentioned the restaurant to be dirty but I did not think so (well except maybe the bathroom which had a dirty, plugged up sink... but it's a Chinese restaurant, so to me, the dirty bathroom comes as a default!) I really enjoyed my meals at Sun Wah, actually, a lot more than I expected. Living in Bay Area kinda spoils one, I think. Although my first meal in Chicago was mediocre (ironically at Itto, where I had been previously), I've had great meals so far after that (Hot Doug's, Calumet Fisheries, Sun Wah, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba). Unfortunately, only one more meal to go before having to have to head back. Gotta find a good Thai restaurant now on Yelp.
