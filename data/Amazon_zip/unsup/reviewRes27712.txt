Not a huge fan of Mexican food but this is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The people here are friendly and give great service. Everything I have tried has been delicious and I've never been disappointed. I highly recommend the Guisado de Puerco (Pork stew) or the pork chops....YUM! The only downside is that they don't take credit cards...CASH ONLY...so just make sure you carry some bills with you on your visit. However, they also have an ATM in the restaurant.
