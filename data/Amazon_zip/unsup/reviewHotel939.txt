I mean its a Red Roof Inn- your expectations has got to be really really low already but if you stay here- make sure they are even lower than usual. I'm glad that I was able to stay here for Labor Day weekend for 6 days and only paid a few hundred bucks. My girlfriends and I only there at night to sleep but below are the pros and cons. Pros: - Nice lobby- that needs to transcend to the bedroom- looks like they might be getting there - Free wifi - Cheap - Right across the street from Garret's popcorn - 1 block away from Michigan Avenue and major public transportation - Walking distance to a Dunkin Donuts, 7-11, Corner Bakery, etc. - Able to leave items locked up before checking and after when you have checked out already - A safe, hair dryer, ironing board - Friendly staff Cons: - Excruciatingly small rooms with run down decor and bed spread. Gross - Our 16th floor room had no view whatsoever other than other tall buildings - Super small bathroom- I had to put on makeup with the bigger mirror on the floor lobby - Only 2 elevators and one broke at one point so only one can be used - No full length mirror anywhere :/ - No bathroom in the lobby area Next time I go to Chicago I think it may be worth it to spend a little bit more money to stay at a better place. I'd stay here for something cheaper or free though since the location is spot on. Its right across the street from a Marriot and I'm sure people that stayed there the same amount of time payed 3x as much as we did.
