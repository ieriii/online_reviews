This place feels authentic and could've had the best burritos ever. The salsa is good and the chips were still warm when they came out of the oven. The got a burrito with chicken and steak. They were both in filets then we got to cut them up and place them into our warm flour tortillas. All the food was perfectly prepared, warm, soft, tender and all that other good stuff. We arrived early so the service was great, and the staff all is bi-lingual so we were able to practice spanish too! The chairs are awesome there but the decor could be improved. Overall a great spot especially if your into the latin scene.
