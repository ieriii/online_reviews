SPECIAL sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions- overall, the pizza held it's own even the next day with the bottle not being soggy with all the sauce on top. the crust was a bit hard though, I love crust, but this wasn't that great. But a good spot for all the goodness. We ordered to go, but the staff was very unprofessional, they were just scattered all over the place, like where you would find teenagers working after school and hanging out on their phone half the time while they're working... they wouldn't have gotten better ratings if we dined and had their service I'm sure.
