Great cheeses, wonderful wines, adequate service. We made our own cheese assortment: Australian Persian Feta, Grayson, Morbier, Robiola Langhe, Pecorino, and Parmigiano Reggiano. The Grayson, from Meadow Creek Creamery in Virginia, is a new one for me. It's a nice strong semi-soft cows milk cheese. The Australian Persian Fetta was nice, but I won't go looking for it in a cheese shop.  My wife did a flight of white wines, I did a flight of Spanish reds, then we had a few glasses more of those we liked best (the Chilean Casa Silva Viognier and the Spanish Tempranillo Codice). Very relaxing on a Friday after work. Bin 36 always works for me, whether it's just for wine and cheese or for dinner too, and in spite of the sometimes great, sometimes not, service. A bit more generous servings of cheeses would be welcomed, but I'll keep coming back if only for their broad selection of cheeses.  Hint - If you select your own assortment of cheeses, ask them to bring you the nuts and other accompaniments that come with the standard assortments. For some ridiculous reason, they don't automatically do that, but will, for free, if you ask.
