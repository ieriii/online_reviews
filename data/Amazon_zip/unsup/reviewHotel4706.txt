I agree with others that this is a moden hotel with postage stamp size rooms but with a comfortable bed, very nice shower (though no fan in bathroom) and a very shallow wash basin. Hotel is located a bit off the beaten path, but a short walk away from State Street/Michigan Avenue. I am not as complimentary of the staff, however. The two bartenders had attitude issues. The late night front desk guy appears to be distracted. Agree that walls are paper thin as we had to endure a party next door. Fitness center has modern equipment, but just two treadmills, two eliptical machines, and some free weights.
