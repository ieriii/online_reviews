Ate in Xoco today and had an average experience. I timed my arrival so that I wouldnt have to wait the 40 plus minutes that so many other people would happily wait for Rick Bayless' food. The cashier is strange and kept on asking us to speak up even though I was shouting my order at her. She briefly stopped taking our order to roll her eyes at an inexperienced co-worker who asked a question that met her disapproval. I ordered two drinks that came in tiny little cups, the gucamole and chips (totally overpriced, $4 for something that is costing 70 cent to produce), the Gunthorp Chicken and the Cochinita Pibil which came to $33. The Gunthorp chicken was very plain and my Mexician friends could make better with less fuss. The Cochinita Pibil was tasty and if there wasn't a line I would eat it again. The seating is very compact and they don't do carry out but the food is served very quickly by friendly food runners. Watching the chefs cook the food is good fun and this restaurant will be just as successful as Frontera grill for Rick Bayless. Overall an average restaurant with over priced food but there are so many people showing irrational exuberance towards Rick Bayless' food that there will be always be a line for Xoco.
