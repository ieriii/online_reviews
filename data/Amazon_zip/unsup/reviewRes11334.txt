Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I thought that the beer was far better than the pizza. And I don't mean that in a "I'm from Chicago and I know best" way, either. My pizza doesn't have to be 6 inches thick for me to enjoy it. I just require some flavor. The crust was okay, but the toppings and sauce didn't impress as much as I'd hoped.  However, the spinach/cheese dip appetizer and all of the beers we tried were great. In summation, one star for the appetizer and two stars for the beer!
