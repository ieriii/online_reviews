I call Shenanigans on this place! Gotta agree with Aise W. on this one: "I don't understand the hype and certainly won't be contributing to it." I used to live less then a block away for many years and they have been screwed up from Day One. The only reason I went more than once is that I figured that I must have remembered it wrong and it could not possibly be as bad as I had remembered it. And every visit subsequent I just proved myself right over and over again. They made a pretty good BLT, and the coffee was good, but on balance it was not enough to make me go back after I moved out of the 'hood.  Like almost all the other posters I have got to say that the staff is atrocious. I ain't paying close to $10 for a sandwich with a big side of attitude. You're not all that, my friend. I feel bad for the Mexican guys in the back who are busting their humps while the white girls up front are busy ignoring customers and practicing their affectations.  It made me appreciate dear departed Leo's down the street all the more. The staff might have been a little freaky and stoned, and the place kept irregular hours, but they were what a breakfast place in East Village *should* be.
