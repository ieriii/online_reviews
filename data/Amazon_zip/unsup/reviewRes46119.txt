Inconsistent would be a kind word to describe the experience here. Sometimes you can get your order perfect in a matter of minutes. More often the wait is 15-30 minutes for a sandwich, and the order may not even be right. The food was way below our expectations for a neighborhood cafe. Poor service was the final straw.
