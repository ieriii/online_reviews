Went to the Publican last Thursday for dinner and drinks. The restaurant set up was rather interesting. Communal tables for dining as well as private booths that had doors to get in and out of. First time I've ever seen this. Bathroom was also quite interesting. Theres a communal sink for men and women and six seperate M/W restrooms. Poor tipsy girl tried to follow me into one. Kind of amusing.  Now on to the food and beverages- we enjoyed a nice bottle of pinot noir and since we had just been to the Girl and the Goat for a drink we werent all that hungry. Had the frites topped with the fried egg to start. Yum! We also had the quail and scallops. Both were great and perfectly cooked. Overall, we had a great time. Not sure I will be back though as there are so many places that are similar in the area.
