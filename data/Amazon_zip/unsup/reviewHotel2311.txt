Stayed here this weekend with some friends. Cannot beat the location for Magnificent Mile shopping and dining!  Beautiful large lobby with a bar and a Starbucks. Rooms are small (the usual for this area at an affordable price point of $145 per night) but very clean, beds plush. Great flat screen TV. Bathroom is TINY though, door opens and is within inches of the toilet which is awkward but again, clean with is important. Bath and Body Works ammenities are nice too!
