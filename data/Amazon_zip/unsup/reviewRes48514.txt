A decent site night out, in summary: * BIG beer selection. Plan to spend 10 minutes just picking one * Extroverted seating (aka OTOM, Avec, et al) * LOUD. We were back by the kitchen, probably the quietest of the joint actually. * SLOW. Granted they were new, and I needed the time just to peruse the beer offerings. * SKIMPY. Two bitty bits of blood sausage in the $12 Tripe & Blood Sausage gratin. * GOOD Seafood. Buchot Mussels and Marinated Mackerel were alright. * OUT. Ran out of the Pear dessert we wanted to try (before 8pm) Wife wasn't so impressed, probably will go back with one of the guys (or my dad). Saw the channel 7 food dude there, so a segment is sure to follow.
