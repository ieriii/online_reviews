Yum. I found my Mystic Pizza. I was sort of hoping Julia Roberts would turn the corner and deliver my pizza while she yelled at her sister Kat for wearing her clothes. It has a family feel and its got that old pizzeria date night vibe to it. Its got some great deals. Its near the movie theatre, so why not round out your perfect date night with a pint and a slice. Go to here please. Thank you!
