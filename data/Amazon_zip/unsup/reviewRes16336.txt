I normally limit my reviews to dining. But I'll make an exception for Violet Hour. Pretentious? Absolutely. Pricey? For sure. Unnecessary and annoying line outside? Of course. But where else can you be transported to a scene right out of "A Clockwork Orange?" Where else can you get a brandy concoction with egg white? Or a drink with Chartreuse? Or flaming absinthe? All made with precision by expert "mixologists". Actually, the term surgeon is probably more appropriate. We prefer to sit at the bar to see the masters at work. They use potions, body gyrations, beakers and all sorts of fun stuff. Yes, it's all an extravagant show. But you have to love it. Screw the menu and just tell them the liquors and flavors you like. Guaranteed they'll bring you something ingenious and impossible to replicate. If you go Friday-Sunday, ask for Michael (usually wearing a pink shirt) and order the Anisha Sutra. If you like tequila, you won't be disappointed.
