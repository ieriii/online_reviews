The Violet Hour is my favorite bar. Anywhere. I had a long layover in Chicago once and I made it a point to ride the L into town JUST to get a drink here. These people are serious about their cocktails. The ambiance is lovely and inviting and creates a true feeling of intimacy. It's like being in twilight while sitting in high-backed, Alice in Wonderland chairs. Amazing.
