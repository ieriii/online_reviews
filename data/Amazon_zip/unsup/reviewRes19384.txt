My wife and I were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary by spending the afternoon at the art institute (where we got engaged) and I wanted to get a reservation nearby. A friend made a recommendation for The Gage and it was great! Friday after work crowded bar, but got a table to have a couple drinks before dinner; fun, loud bar. We were seated at our reservation time and our waiter (Steve from London) was great. Nothing better than a professional waiter, who knows the menu and can make strong recommendations. The manager (sorry, didn't get his name) was so accommodating The food was inventive without being pretentious, fresh selections with great options. The Bison tartar was one of the best apps I have ever had! The food, the wine, the vibe, the service - all top notch! Near the end of our great, relaxing evening the proprietor, Billy Lawless came by our table to thank us for spending our anniversary at his restaurant. He picked up champagne and dessert - nice touch. It would have been 5's without that, but I would love to give The Gage 10's! We will be recommending this place to friends and family and planning a return soon!
