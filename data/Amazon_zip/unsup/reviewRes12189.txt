Oh Cafe 28, you're quite the Cupid; you can stick an arrow into me anytime. I've never tasted Cuban and wanted some bad. The set up for the big bang was sweet; gorgeous decor, amazing paintings on the walls for when I shyly looked away, and candles on each table. What a nice touch! Everything's better in dark rooms and candlelight. I got 3 lime/traditional Margs and was pleased they were given to me in tall glasses and strong; I dig robust and big things. I went with the steak comal. Oh, you cunning, little role player! You came on a skillet, all laid out before me, but completely blanketed in some deceptive sauce. It almost resembled a Chinese entree (and I don't have a yen for Chinese) and it was heavy and bland. When I have it heavy, I want it hot, or sweet, or both. Moreover, I prefer my meat naked. If it's good; it doesn't need to be cloaked. The much raved about pistachio chicken was super tender and succulent, magic in my mouth, but I wanted more of the crusty nuts. Especially when one likes more than a mouthful. All in all, a decent first time. I'll do it again, but expect to be more satisfied. (Was this review written by Tobias Fnke? You'll never know.)
