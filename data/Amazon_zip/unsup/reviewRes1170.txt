I did it. I finally met SF sweetheart Liz S., and I had Hot Doug's...on the same day, no less. Liz, daughter and I waited in line about 25 minutes. Once we placed our order, it was less than 5 before the food came. They say standing is better than sitting. They do say that. But the cool thing is you can easily sit and relax. For the wait, they've got a great meal and awesome logistics. -Liz - foie gras dog with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris -Me - cherry and apple pork sausage with sweet curry mustard, goat cheese, and rum-soaked dried berries -Riotous Girl - plainest of dogs, with ketchup. I didn't harass. It really is nothing like I've ever tasted. You should spend time appreciating each little morsel on its own before going in for the perfect bite. The goat cheese and dried cherries were a gorgeous combo. It's the first time sausage was like fine dining. Or whatever. You can chow to your heart's content or two or three if that's how you like it.
