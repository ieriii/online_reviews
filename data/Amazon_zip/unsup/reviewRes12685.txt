We can title this review as "Me no likey". This is also where I will mention that I'm half Cuban and moved here from Miami, so I know Cuban food extremely well. If you happen to be someone unfamiliar with real Cuban food and you try this place for the first time, it's adequate food. But if you are someone who knows Cuban food and are craving something authentic, you will be really disappointed. I didn't think anything tasted like anything I can get down in Miami - and considering the inflated prices - (it was like $4 or $5 for croquetas that cost 50 cents in Miami) I'd expect authenticity. I'd pay even $10 for croquetas if they tasted like the ones I can get in South Florida - but not for imposters! If you want authentic Cuban food, I'd send you to 90 Miles any day.
