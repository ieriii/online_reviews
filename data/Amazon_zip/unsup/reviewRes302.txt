There is not much I can write in this review that has not been previously written. Each course was wildly imaginative and it is evident that Grant Achatz is ingenious for creativity and presentation.  When you leave and later reflect back on the 20+ courses you will realize you went on a full gastronomic trip that stimulated every one of your senses. My experience at Alinea was unlike any other.  The service is top-notch and what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the service to be pompous and pretentious. Most of our servers had a dry sense of humor, which I love, and kept us thoroughly entertained throughout the many courses. I was never made to feel uncomfortable or patronized.  Alinea is something that you should experience at least once if you are able.
