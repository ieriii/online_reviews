really awesome. fine dining is down to an art. a well tuned machine as far as service and presentation went. each course was either well crafted, great tasting, interestingly tasting, and at least just really intriguing. that being said, you are never really bored with any of the courses set before you. this is about the art of food, not about how much you get, its not about one dish or a specialty dish. its pushing the boundaries of what other establishments would call food. do your homework. plan for this experience. eat everything. get the wine pairing. the last thing i wanna say,,,,this is a pretty pricey dinner and one should not try to get this done on the cheap. however, you are almost treated as if you are cherished when you are here. its as if the staff is well aware that the guest parts with a pretty penny to dine here. its nothing heavy so don't worry. you are just treated really well here. its amazing.
