WARNING: DO NOT HAVE THE BISTEC DINNER PLATTER BEFORE GOING OUT! You will burping up what seems to be a years worth of garlic and meat... and really, there's just no way around it. With that said, this place is pretty pleasant. Good prices for more than good portions of food. My friends and I ordered the bistec sandwhiche, the platter, and lechon. Having many Filipino friends, I've had lechon quite a few times. Maybe it's different in the Cuban style, but i was really unimpressed with the lechon. The best part would have to be the skin... and I really didn't see nor taste (in flavor nor texture). The service, although, is outstanding and it's byob! But o'god.... if you have further plans for the rest of the evening/night- stay away from the steak! burp*burp*burp* NO BUENO. (but it is delish!)
