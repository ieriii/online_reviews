The reputation of this place precedes itself--literally, personified by a snake-line embodied by a mass of humans extending down the sidewalk.  I guess Doug must be a happy guy, who knows his limits and isn't impatient to get anywhere? The doors close at 4 p.m. on weekdays, officially leaving this place available only for tourists of sorts during the week, so I'd imagine most locals (and weekenders) are only able to get to this place on saturday. But I don't blame Doug--I mean, closing at four, he must leave the actual place at 5, maybe 6, after cleaning and that, so he just wants a normal 9-5 life while sponsoring the idea of great hot dogs on California. Down to the meatyness of the subject, I had the Elvis, and a cognac infused lamb and pork sausage with spinach and goat cheese. The Elvis was a regular dog I take, $2.50, very delicious, mostly normal, with a big pickle spreading itself on top, and the cognac infused goodness was definitely very tasty. You could taste each ingredient separately but still appreciated the dog as a whole, with the goat cheese chunks finishing off the top. I also enjoyed duck fries, which were different, crunchy and tasty. If anything, this place is worth the visit for the mere experience--once you get in, you're sure to have a place to sit, somehow.  I do need to admit that I need to go there again to be fully satisfied--although tasty, my hot dogs were not large in size, were done in 3-4 bites. They didn't leave me with the impression of magnificence and I wouldn't say they are the best dogs I'll ever taste.  Either way, snake yourself to the line on a good saturday and it's sure to kick off the weekend in a dog way.
