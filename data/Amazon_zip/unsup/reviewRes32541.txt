I'm a fan of this place - it's pricey, but well worth it. The only thing that sucks is the Reserved signs all over the lounge area(which is their designated waiting area). My wife and I ate here last week. At the very beginning we had an 'offering' which was a hummus-type dip with a few deep-fried bread things (had the consistency of thin pork cracklins). For drinks, my wife stuck with water, and I had the Ginger sake drink, I don't remember the name. We had two appetizers - Rock Shrimp which were AMAZING!!! and the Watermelon Eel salad. The eel salad was a few cubes of watermelon topped with eel 'bacon'. It was a new taste, as I had never tried fruit and fish in the same bite.  My wife and I split the beef ribs and they were OHMYGAWD good!!! The meat was soooo soft that we didn't need a knife.. I was able to PULL it off with my chopsticks! Amazing!!!!! For dessert, I had the Ridiculous, and my wife had the Molten Chocolate cake. I can say the Ridiculous was... damn good! it is like a scoop of vanilla ice cream that is dipped in carrot cake batter and deep fried. Very very tasty.  By the way, when you go, ask for Daniel! He took GREAT care of us!
