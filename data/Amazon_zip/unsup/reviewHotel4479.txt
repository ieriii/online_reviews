Loved, loved, loved the Palmer House Hotel. We had stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker for the first three nights of our Chicago trip because that was where my husband's conference was. We had to change hotels when the Hyatt couldn't accommodated a longer stay. This turned out to be such a blessing! The Palmer made the Hyatt look like a grossly overpriced dump. Our one year old son's knees were filthy from crawling on the floors at the 'newly renovated' Hyatt. His knees were pristine while at the historical Palmer. Also, there were five - yes five! - weddings on the Saturday of our stay, so the hotel was very busy. Even with that, we had no noisy neighbors disturb our son's naps or sleep at night. The building is stunning. Our room was huge (which might be because we agreed to take a smoking room, which was fume-free after leaving the window open a while we out exploring the city). And we got a mind-boggling fantastic deal on our room through Priceline.
