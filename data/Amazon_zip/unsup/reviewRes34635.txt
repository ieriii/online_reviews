I first came here the summer I moved to Chicago for grad school and loved it: shawarma, falafel, salad bar, spinach pie, hummus, lentil soup are all the best in Chicago. I've tried many other Middle Eastern places in the city and SM continues to deliver flavor, fresh ingredients, and great service all for super cheap prices. I do like the Wicker Park location better than the LP location but there isn't much in LP that I do like.
