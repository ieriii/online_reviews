If it weren't for the wine flights this place would be teetering on a two star review! I honestly can't say if the food was better my first time because I was halfway through my second wine flight or if the quality of their meat and produce was just better a year ago. Regardless, I was completely and regrettably sober this time around. The salad was completely blah! Cold slices of brie decorated Fresh Express quality "European greens mix" that tasted as though they had been tossed in straight olive oil...seriously, the salad had no taste whatsoever...the big handful of raw walnuts tossed to one side was a great touch... The hanger steak was cooked a pretty accurate medium...unfortunately it was like chewing blah, faintly sweet leather. It was not an enjoyable experience.... I think I will stick to wine and cheese from now on (they do have an impressive selection of cheese!) and skip the entrees, it's way too expensive for the quality of food...
