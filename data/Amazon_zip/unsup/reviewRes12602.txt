1st thing you have to come early especially on the weekends. You know a place is good when it alway packed. 2nd the Mojitos are off the cart GREAT!! I have had a couple of Mojitos and Cafe 28 has the best I ever had. I'll go just for that. They have recently expanded the restaurant so getting a table might be a little bit easier. When you sit down at your table you get free bread with this honey herb butter that I have never had before but really good stuff. I did go with a friend that is a vegetarian so order the veg. Quesadillas starter dish from the dinner menu and easily can be dinner option as well. Also had at one time the Honey Jalapeno Porks Chops and it was melt in your mouth to die for good! I tried many other dishes for here and alway spectacular. Do want to try the brunch sometime. So if your in the area I would make it to Cafe 28. You will be pleasantly surprised
