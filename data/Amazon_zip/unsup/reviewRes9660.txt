Excellent dining experience. Priced at $60 a prie fixe, it was well worth the money. I had the foie gras, lamb, and corn for dessert. Foie gras was top notch, with it's combination of flavors and textures it was a really great way to kick off the meal. Lamb was perfectly cooked with sides that complimented the meat well. And the corn dessert was very unexpected, and very creative way to end the meal.
