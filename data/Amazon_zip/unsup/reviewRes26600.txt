We headed there with a group of 8 and I would say that's the way to go. The food was awesome and with so many of us, we got to try a little of everything. No complaints at all on the good. Although our server had some really good suggestions, our service was a little slow. Other than that, great place to go with a group. The lamb was phenomenal along with both chocolate desserts.
