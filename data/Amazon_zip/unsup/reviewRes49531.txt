OK restaurant week... I'll start your reviews here. Bin 36 was one of our picks for restaurant week this year and all in all I was very pleased. I never expect much in the way of food at a wine bar, so I kept my food choices to a cheese flight for the first course, swordfish for the main dish and the donuts for dessert. The cheese sampler was quite tasty and the swordfish was actually not bad. The desserts was really just so-so. I tried my friend's chicken dish and I have to say it was very mediocre and a little dry. I imagine that most of the other reviews are right on about the food not being too great at this place. The wine however, was fantastic. Lots of tasty flights at decent prices. They sell a lot of their wine but have little cards for all of their bottles - if you do a quick google search, you can actually find them at far better prices than Bin36. I would stop in for some more wine and cheese flights, but not an ideal spot for dinner.
