Sure some people may think it's crazy to wait over an hr in a line that runs down the block for a hot dog. Granted, yes they are just hot dogs, but to me they're not just any dogs. Where else in the city are you going to find a variety of delicious gourmet sausages topped of with an interesting combination of ingredients? Doug was at the front taking orders (as always from what I understand) and fun to talk and joke around with. Service was fast, tables opened up quickly where we didn't have to wait long or wait at all. I went on a Sat and the dogs and duck fat fries were delicious and the rolls were fresh. To me..it was definitely worth the wait (but maybe not on a freezing day).
