I went to Big Jones this year for my birthday brunch. We had reservations, and were 7minutes late, called ahead and it was no problem. (Reservations are recommended, it is small and busy!) We had the beignets. They were good but not great. The powdered sugar got EVERYWHERE. I had coffee and J had orange juice. I also ordered the southern spice which was a nice alternative to a bloody mary (which I just can't stand). D'Aristi Anejo rum, tequila, lime juice, Crystal hot sauce, cane syrup, soda-pretty good, strong and spicy. I had the hominy and egg scramble with black beans, avocado & sour cream. It was very good. I wish there was a little more avocado, and I had to add hot sauce. J had the gumbo, it was great. Just the right texture, good pieces of chicken and sausage. The service good, but just a little slow. I'd go back, it was nice and tasty.
