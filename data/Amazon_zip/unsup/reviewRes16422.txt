I went here for lunch with a group of 14. Carnivale was very accommodating and their staff was very friendly. We shared a variety of appetizers amongst our group: -Guacamole: YUM! -Empanada: Cuban style beef bursting with flavor! ...and I'm not much of a red meat fan! -Shrimp Ceviche: Good, nothing extraordinary.  -Yucatan Chicken Soup: AMAZING! I was speechless after my first spoonful.  As a main entree, I ordered the Shrimp Salad: Laughing Bird shrimp, baby lettuce, green beans, pickled onion, hearts of palm, spiced almonds, passion fruit vinaigrette--such a flavorful combination. I'm not much of a salad person, but boy-oh-boy was this bowl of greens mind blowing. It definitely made my taste buds fall in love. They aguas frescas (fresh fruit drinks) were also very refreshing and crisp. One of the highlights (aside from the food) is the atmosphere. The colors, the music, the decor--all fabulously celebrating Latino cultures. It is a very vibrant and exciting restaurant.
