Delightful! My partner invited me here for our first date. This is a gorgeous Chicago classic that is steeped in history. It's a sexy old speakeasy lounge featuring live jazz. The only downsides I can see are that it gets crowded, the service is a little surly and there is a "no talking" rule while the musicians are performing. This makes for a challenge when you're super excited to be in someone's presence. We lasted less than an hour with some sneaky breathy whispering and giggling, but we were soon too squirrelly and had to remove ourselves for a long walk outside. Perhaps we should return now that we've composed ourselves.
