If you're a black-and-white kind of person, Carnivale is a bit of an assault to your senses. Lucky for me, I'm not! What (to me) looked like an average-size restaurant was actually quite huge, and chock full o' color and personality. We were in town visiting some friends, and they suggested Carnivale for dinner. Added bonus: they had a little coupon or gift card (several, actually) for $10 off the total bill. I was afraid it would get crowded so we made reservations through Open Table, but we got there before the big dinner rush anyways so it was all good. We were seated in an upper balcony area that overlooked the main dining area, which was pretty cool. (And seriously - color EVERYWHERE. Beautiful!) We started with some chips and guacamole. The guac was pretty good, but didn't quite stand up to Frontera's guac which we had just tried at lunch the day before. The chips were a little thicker than most but still nice and crumbly/crunchy. Mojitos were delish - I just wish they were about twice the size! I settled on a skirt steak special with mashed potatoes (and possibly something else that I can't remember) and was absolutely blown away. I don't often clear my plate when I eat out, but I was practically chomping on the dish after this meal. Everyone was happy with their meals, and despite most of us clearing our plates and declaring ourselves stuffed...we still found room for the churros. (Seriously - how can you not?!) My only complaint would be that the bus boy took the sauces away after we finished the churros, even though we were all just licking it off our fingers instead. We did have a pretty pricey bill at the end considering there were only 4 of us, but for drinks, apps, entrees, and dessert on a trip to see old friends it was well worth it!
