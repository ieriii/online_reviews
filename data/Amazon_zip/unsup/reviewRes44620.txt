Chicago Pizza is completely different from New York pizza. Giordano's is not a place for foodies, but does qualify for All-Madden status. It's the kind of place you go to when you have a healthy appetite. The stuffed deep dish pizza is truly wonderful, but you need a large party of people to handle the quantity. Surprisingly the spaghetti and lasagna are also wonderful due to their simple but special marinara sauce. It is amazing how many restaurants do not know how to make marinara sauce! I wish this place had a Times Square branch! Anyway, I have spent many a meal at Giordano's and have never been disappointed! Now there is a statement I do not make often.
