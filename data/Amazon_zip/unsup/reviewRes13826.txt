Went here not too long ago with my aunt for dinner. The ambiance is nice, the food is good and the service is excellent. Even Glenn himself was there helping out and making sure all of the customers were taken care of. They have a wonderful menu unfortunately too good as they were out of everything. So maybe get there a little earlier than normal or try lunch instead. Though for all around quality eats in the neighborhood, ya cant beat it.
