My friends and I learned a valuable lesson in being adventurous here at India House. If you want to try out some new food, sometimes it pays to just order randomly, even if you can't pronounce it. We only knew the basics of Indian cuisine: naan, chicken tikka masala, tandoori. Easy peasy. But for our third dish, we decided to try out something off their specials in the back - their hyderabadi menu. We got the Hyderabadi style chicken biryani, and the mix of rice chicken and spices surpassed everything else on the table - which was tough, because everything else was good too. My friend likened it to the legendary 53rd & 6th chicken platter, which says a lot. Just a couple small gripes - the wait staff was surprisingly useless in helping us in our adventure. "Everything's my favorite" says good things about the menu, but doesn't help out people like us who like Indian food and want to expand their palate. Also, the portions are ridiculously huge. While there is both an "Indian Special" and "Indian Special for Two", those two people I assume must be morbidly obese. The singles version of the Indian Special is perfectly suitable for two people, which I wish I knew before we placed our large order (something else the waiter should've helped us out with).
