I have read and heard about Milk and Honey so many times and was looking forward to going, but my experience was less than stellar. I thought the food was good, but it was definitely not worth going back to deal with the rude wait staff. The place was nearly empty in the middle of the afternoon, but I was sternly spoken to twice about the ordering and seating system. Overall, not worth going back again.
