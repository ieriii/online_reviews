I was really excited to eat at Graham Elliot. Reading the menu, and listening to our waiter explain the dishes, my wife and I wanted to try everything. We decided to order ala carte and share, instead of the the tasting menu, probably a mistake. Our selections included: Beef Carpaccio, Potato Bisque, Bouillabaisse Risotto, Wild Sturgeon, Pork Carnitas. Everything was bland. The best thing I had was a beer. We decided to skip dessert. I have no problem paying for a nice dinner, but after this meal, I felt ripped off. I did like our waiter until I heard him discuss the menu to the table next to us. He offered them the option of ordering from both the tasting menu and the ala carte menu. He told us we had to from one or the other. Even more disappointing, I only heard about the foie gras pops when he told the other table. The restaurant presents it's self as an elite high end establishment, promoting a name chef. Everywhere you look, are his initials. They even sell GE belt buckles. However, when the food is that much of a let down, it's pretentious and cocky. I would much rather go to Sepia or Fontera Grill.
