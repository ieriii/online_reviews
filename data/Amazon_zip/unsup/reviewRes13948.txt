Holy god the cubano sandwich is so delicious you wont even believe your face. This place throws a military coup on your taste buds and totally declares independence from those oppressive flavors you've grown accustomed to. An absolute delight, I went back three days in a row. And the Lechon sandwich is crushingly magnificent too. Shredded pork, plantains, amazing cheese - THE WORKS! This place is a must go if you like amazing food. Thanks Fidel, for forcing these people to swim to america and some how migrate to belmont, clybourn, and western and open this restaurant. The last 60 years were worth it if we get to have amazing food like this. I consider this to be an apology for the Cuban missile crisis. CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS APOLOGY - ACCEPTED
