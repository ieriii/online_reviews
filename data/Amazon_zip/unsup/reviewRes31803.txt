The first thing that came to mind when I was about to write this was, 'damn it!' I was expecting to LOVE Sunda. The kind of love where I bribe my friends into ordering more food with me and we spend hundereds of dollars on wine. Not so much. My friend and I have been around the sushi block many a time. So, when we both gave that look to each other mid-way through the meal, we were both kind of surprised. Can't say that I'm going to be running back here. I was lucky enough to take advantage of the happy hour, but the roll we got was flavorless. It was something with yellowtail, that's right...unmemorable. Dinner was pretty good...but the hype and the prices are what leave me somewhat unfulfilled. I'm willing to give it another try, but someone is picking up the tab next time because I just can't justify the prices when the food is not that good!
