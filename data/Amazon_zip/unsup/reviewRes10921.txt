This place is okay... the pizza is pretty good, but not anything all that unique, compelling or interesting. They have a decent selection of beers though, which is nice... but charge WAY too much for Maker's Mark... which is a sure way to piss me the heck off. Not much for the whole "one-big-huge-room-with-lots-of-tables-that-makes-it-one-of-the-loudest-places-I-have-ever-been-to-thing" -- too many Wicker Park Usurper Alpha-Males dandle their fawnies up in this joint for my taste. A bit of the whole "cheese-dick" complex going on to boot. Nice to go to on a weekend afternoon to watch a football (soccer) match, but on a weekend... I'd rather go to Pequod's and actually get some unique, interesting and hearty pizza. Overall, nothing special to cough at here at Piece.
