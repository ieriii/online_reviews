So... Korean in Lakeview, okay sounds good, wait, its kind of trendy? It's run by a bunch of white people? What the hell is going on here? Let me just say it was all a little confusing for me but god damn that shit is good!! The seoul sassy wings are out of this world as I'm sure plenty of the more food detailed reviews would let you know right off. Perfect mix of sweet and salty and crispy fried goodness but with really quality meaty chicken. The buffalo wings were also good but go with at least a 2:1 ratio of seoul... I can't wait to get back and try the bowls!
