At Tru the friendly professional service, presentation, taste and ambiance combine for a memorable experience. It's the prefect place for a big celebration with your significant other. The problem with upscale restaurants i usually have is a pretentious ambiance that can override an otherwise good experience no matter the quality of the food. This is not so at TRU. Despite a service that is as fancy as you can get there is still a warmth and acceptance that is readily felt. My wife and I came here for our first wedding anniversary and were wowed by the food quality, presentation and service. Our menu came customize with our names and the event we were celebrating - how cool is that. We ordered the 8 course Chef's special which ended up being 11 courses after the extras everyone gets by dining here. My favorites were the soups. One was a pea soup with a sub zero cream center. The other was a duck soup that was made at our table using a sophisticated bunson burner-esque heater. The savory flavor or this soup made it the best I've ever had. I recommend this restaurant for anyone with something epic to celebrate. The $250 per person we spent makes it the most expensive restaurant I've ever dined at so beware the prices can climb.
