The food is ok, the service is rushed and borderline bad. I understand that the place gets crowded and has limited space, but I've been there several times now and have never been welcomed warmly or appreciated. It's like they're herding cattle in that place and they especially don't like people with small children or babies in strollers. I don't have either, but I felt for the moms that came in with strollers or carriers and were basically told there was no room for them in the restaurant. Regarding the food, it's good, but nothing that you can't find at any number of restaurants in the area. Some of their baked goods are delicious and are worth getting for takeout. Dining in is only recommended during their down times, whenever that is exactly, I'm not sure.
