This restaurant is pretty good. I really like the food (Spaghetti allo Scoglio) and they had a couple interesting cocktails. The space is really nice. Smaller, but not cramped with a nice big window to the street and outdoor seating. Service has always been pretty good. And when I was there, I filled out a sheet they had with my name and address, and I've been getting coupons from them ever since. Great deal!
