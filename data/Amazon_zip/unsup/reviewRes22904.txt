Lima beans. Eat the lima beans. And the cold plate appetizer. The grilled calamari is the best I've ever had. We sat at the bar and had dinner and drinks. The server encouraged me to eat the last piece of calamari before she took the plate, so I did. Then she told me good job. Some might find it patronizing; I thought it was adorable. And I know it's a German wine, but they have the best Riesling I've tasted.
