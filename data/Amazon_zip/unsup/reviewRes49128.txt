My go-to date spot in Chicago... and also my go-to girls night out spot. Brian Duncan is a great guy, makes some amazing wines, and does the restaurant scene right. They have tons of wine flights that are so much fun, but the Low Down Dirty Reds: Part Deux is definitely the way to go. Italy, Spain and France are all represented here and I just can't get enough. The Sexy Reds flight is also delicious. Order a cheese plate and you might not ever want to leave the bar to go to your seat, which has happened to me multiple times! The Gorgonzola Ravioli is a standout starter, and the Garlic & Tomato Hummus is also highly recommended. For entrees, the Grilled New York Strip Steak (sauteed rapini, sunchoke puree, chili-garlic butter) and the Wood Grilled Burger are my two favorites. Service has always been way on top of the game and friendly, and I like this place because it's a bit upscale but doesn't feel the least bit uppity.... sometimes that can be a little hard to come by. The interior is gorgeous, the smells coming from the kitchen are an art of their own, and I just can't say enough great things about Bin. In fact, I already have my next reservation set! Go here for a gorgeous evening in a gorgeous city.
