Boy has this place gone downhill, since I first started eating here two years ago. Maybe it was just a off night, but the meal we had there last night was so bad, that the waitress kindly comp'd the bianca nero pizza we ordered and was very apologetic. The inside of the restaurant smelled of burnt bread and every pizza that came out while we were there (8-9 pm) was black on the raised crust edge and both our pies were selectively burnt on the bottom. My mushroom and sausage red pie was so soggy that I couldn't pick up a slice and the mushroom white pie with truffle oil (a former favorite) was greasy, soggy and had such an off taste, we couldn't finish even a slice of it. Perhaps the owner/chef sitting out in the dining room eating and drinking with some guests had something to do with it, that or the oven was at the wrong temperature (not hot enough if I had to guess), but I won't risk it again, there are too many other thin crust pizza palaces that are steady and consistent. And I'm a bit weary of the overpriced juice glasses of wine.
