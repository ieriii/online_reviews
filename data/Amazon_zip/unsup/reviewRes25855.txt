One of these days I will get on yelp to write a bad review but its definitely not going to be today. Peqods Pizza is the BEST. That's all there is to it. The caramelized crust is unbelievable, the service is friendly, and I looove their toppings. I'm not usually a big sausage person when it comes to pizza but theirs is amazing. Hands down best deep dish in the pizza, nuff said.
