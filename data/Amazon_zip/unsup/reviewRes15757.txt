This place was highly recommended by the concierge at our hotel (Blackstone Renaissance Chicago). So, maybe our expectations were too high. I don't think I would return to this restaurant. If you want real Mexican food, I wouldn't recommend this place. I like the set up and the different colors of the restaurant, but their food is just so-so.
