I'm somewhat of a gastropub junkie, and as such, Gilt Bar has been on my list of Restaurants to enjoy for a considerable period of time. I finally made the trip last night, and am so glad I did. I started with an excellent Sazerac, made with non-Templeton rye (not that Templeton is bad, it's just somewhat ubiquitous and a change of pace is nice) and absinthe. Judging by my experience, the food is essentially perfect; the menu advertises "small plates", but this actually means "reasonably portioned entrees". Bone marrow is perfectly seasoned, piping hot, and accompanied by a uniquely not-sweet caramelized onion topping. The escarole salad is perhaps my personal highlight; bitter greens, pickled persimmons, and shaved Manchego are a match made in heaven. The seared pork belly entree, served with green lentils, is an absolute treat; the meat is melt-in-your mouth tender and succulently rich, and the lentils provided a perfect counterpoint. Fries are thick-cut, which is a nice change of pace for gastropub fries, and are served with impossibly garlicky aioli. We capped the meal with one scoop (which wound up being 2 scoops) of housemade pistachio ice cream, which was frozen to perfection and not cloyingly sweet. The food was awesome enough to earn Gilt Bar a perfect rating regardless of the pricing, but even more impressively, this did not break the bank by any stretch of the imagination, especially considering the caliber of food. We were particularly hedonistic on this occasion, but you can eat multiple courses here for $30 if you so desire and leave perfectly sated. All in all, Gilt Bar is a notch above the other (largely excellent) gastropubs I have sampled in Chicago. I seriously think this is my new favorite restaurant in the city. I'll be back, and back, and back!
