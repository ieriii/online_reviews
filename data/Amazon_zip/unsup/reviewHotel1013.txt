I reserved a block of rooms for my wedding here. Loal Porter was my contact and was very helpful anytime I had a question and was prompt with emails. The hotel itself was very nice. Staff was friendly, the lobby and rooms were always spotless and you can't beat its location. The complimentary breakfast on each floor is a nice touch too. I highly recommend staying at the Amalfi.
