Whoa! What a surprise - amid the grunge of the neighborhood there's a spectacular find in the kitchen! What an excellent menu - such creativity and variety. I look forward to returning. The Maine Scallops, Braised Oxtail, Black Truffle Gnocchi were possibly the best scallop dish I've ever had. The Gruyere Donuts were enough for 4 people - very heavy but that was the goal. The menu is full of intrigue, challenge, and accomplishment. Definitely a place for serious eaters at fairly reasonable prices.
