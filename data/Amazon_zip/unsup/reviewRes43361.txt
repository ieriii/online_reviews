Two words: huevos rancheros. Only served on weekends, but they are soooo good. The casserole dish they come in is huge and my friends and I could barely finish our food. The day we were there, it looked like everyone was ordering the huevos which tells you just how good they are. I would come back and wait in the long line every weekend for these.  I've been here just two other times (why oh why since I live nearby). Once I got the pancakes of the day which had fruit and granola on top. Tasty! The pancake selection usually sounds really good, but those damn huevos are so tempting. The other time I came in here was just stopping by and I grabbed a chocolate chip muffin. I was kind of disappointed in the baked good as it was way too dense and I felt full after barely getting through half of it. Another disappointment - the mimosas. After paying $6, where was the champagne? This place is almost always crowded, but the food is good and well-priced. Just don't get the mimosas or bloody marys. Not impressive.
