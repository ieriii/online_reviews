Went here when this place first opened when it had a DELI counter in the front room! Talk about overhaul and getting crazy better. When I had the mushroom soup here (Deli counter days) I knew I found something good. I've been here 4 times...every single time I leave feeling satisfied, a bit lighter in the wallet, and stuffed. Service is impeccable, BYOB is such a nice change for a resaurant like this, and the food is just amazing. Went here for New Year's Eve 2008 - We've already made plans to go for NYE 2011!!!! Be prepared to lay down some dough, but it's worth every penny.
