Food is okay. However, the service is horrible. Got there mid-afternoon when it was not busy. Still, waited for over 20 minutes for the dish. Ordered Roasted Duck on Rice. However, waiter came back with Roasted Pork on Rice. When I told him I ordered duck, not pork, he just said w/o even being remotely apologetic: "Why don't you just take pork instead?" Well, if I wanted pork, wouldn't I have ordered that in the first place? So, if you are up for a surprise (not a necessarily a nice one), go try Sun Wah.
