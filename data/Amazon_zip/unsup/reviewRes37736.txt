3.5 stars. Review is strictly for food. Many patrons will rave about the beer selection. Went twice: 1st time, the brisket was outstanding. Easily the best in Chicago, smoky, tender, moist, served with course grained mustard. Yum. 2nd time, went in a bigger group, I raved about the brisket and it was brutal. Was barely brisket. Tasted like corned beef, was dry and hard to pull apart. Other items: -- CBJ (Cashew Butter and Jelly) sandwich is pretty good (4 stars) -- Duck pastrami sandwich was excellent (5 star) -- The mussels, which were highly recommended by a lot of people were subpar (2 star)
