I don't want to say anything bad about Alliance because I feel I might be doing something wrong because of all the great reviews I've read but I was soooooooo disappointed in my cupcake! I got the chocolate mocha and the frosting had this weird texture but the mocha flavor was really good and the cupcake itself wasnt too bad, a little on the dry side though. I also bought a white chocolate blondie which was also disappointing. I don't know, like I said I don't want to say anything too bad about this place because I really want to like it. I will try it again except this time maybe if I go a little earlier in the day I'll get something a bit more fresh.
