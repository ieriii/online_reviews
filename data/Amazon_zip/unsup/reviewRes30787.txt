I love Nana! I have dined here several times for brunch, and the space is comfortable and airy. Their concept of "local, organic, sustainable and seasonal products," means that parts of their menu changes with the seasons. However, lucky for me, many of my favorite items on their menu stay put all year round. Their coffee is bottomless and guzzle-worthy. I've eaten the dijon-mustard bacon a few times and it has been both a mouth-watering delicious, out-of-this-world perfect 10, and a merely mouth-watering delicious 9. I generally dine during the week for brunch -- and when I dine on the weekends, I usually arrive before the brunch rush. I've never had to wait for a table, but have been there as the late brunchers arrive. Our servers have never made us feel rushed during these times -- a consideration not to be ignored when you're at a popular spot like Nana. Favorites include the aforementioned dijon-mustard bacon, Poblano-cheddar grits, the baked Chilaquiles and anything containing duck or pulled pork. They also used to serve up a corn-oat waffle with fresh berries and lemon cream -- it was a welcome change for me, as it was gluten-free, and I am gluten-free. Kind of a match made in heaven. Hopefully they'll serve this again when the seasons change? (fingers crossed). One problem - a few times we dined last summer, there were an excessive number of flies buzzing inside of the restaurant -- In the winter, it's been much less of a problem. I haven't tried this place for dinner yet -- but it's on the list!
