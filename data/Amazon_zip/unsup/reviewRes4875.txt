Ok, I don't really eat much pig (I'm veg) or wear much purple (random fact). But this restaurant is a solid 4 stars. Not amazing enough to be a fiver, but not plain jane enough for a 3. Ambiance: relaxed, classy, romantic. Food: great for the most part (the eggplant parmesan balls were delish, and the NUTELLA PANINI was BOMB. Can't go wrong with nutella + bananas! HIGHLY recommend this dessert!) Price: Very reasonable. For 3 dishes (which are small bee tee dubs, definitely get a few to share) plus 1 dessert, ~$40 total inc. tip. So $20/person between the two of us, which is very reasonable for gourmet quality food. I am definitely coming back---as in I'll be there again in a few days LOL. #fatass
