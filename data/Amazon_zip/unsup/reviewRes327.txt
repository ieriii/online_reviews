It's been said before, and it will be said again, dinner at Alinea was the best dining experience of my life. While I didn't love everything I put in my mouth, every dish was a culinary adventure that I will not soon forget. The atmosphere at Alinea is simple and calming, but dare I say, the best part about Alinea was the absolutely impeccable service by the friendly, charming, down to earth waiters.  There are neither enough stars nor enough dollar signs to describe Alinea, and anyone who has the opportunity to indulge themselves here should. Thanks Mom!
