The Purple Pig is a great Spanish bistro with great energy, good wine lists and good cuisine. The interior is tight, with long communal tables but well worth it to feel informal and get into the accidental conversation with others. The service was attentive and the pace of the courses were done well. Overall, a good restaurant.
