Glenn's is fantastic. And conveniently located right underneath the Brown Line stop. And pretty cheap all things considered. Your aren't going to find this fresh of seafood so lovingly prepared for less. Tips: - Don't be afraid to try out different meals each time you come.  - If they are encrusted a fish in a sugary cereal, just order it.
