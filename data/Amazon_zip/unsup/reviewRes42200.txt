I contacted Gilt Bar and spoke to one of the managers, Allison, about the tip being added to my credit card receipt - after I wrote "cash" on the tip line, wrote the total in myself, and signed it. She agreed to refund my overcharge and apologized, but really didn't think anything untoward was going on. I respectfully disagree; I think anytime someone changes a gratuity to a charge receipt after it's been signed and without the customer's approval or knowledge is sketchy (especially because I DID leave a tip). I worked in restaurants in college and people would get fired for doing that. Allison chalked it up to an honest mistake and said that "her" employees would never do anything like that on purpose. Maybe so, but that and the fact that the my cocktail arrived with piece of glass the size of my thumbnail missing from the rim leads me to believe that, at a minimum they're careless, or worse, that they think they can add gratuities and people won't or don't check. In either case, I'm now left with a bad taste in my mouth. Too bad, because I really liked Gilt Bar (as evidenced by my original review) and now I'm not sure if I'll return.
