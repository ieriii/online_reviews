I had a fabulous experience with Alliance pretty much up until the guy who boxed my cake broke the "30" on the top of it. I wasn't thrilled however; I wanted to try it before I decided what my general review was going to be. Had the cake been dry, I most definitely would have only given the bakery 3 stars because despite that, it was a work of art. I was happily surprised when I actually got to try it; it was a true culinary delight! The cake was so moist and flavorful. I had chocolate with vanilla buttercream on the base layer and red velvet on the top. The red velvet wasn't anything special without cream cheese icing, but it was still better than some others I've had. I definitely recommend Alliance for special occasion pastries or just any day pastries.
