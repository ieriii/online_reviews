For me this place is just ok. For an appetizer I had the french onion soup which was pretty good. The pretzel breadsticks in the bread bowl were tasty, but in order to make them edible I had to scrape off a lot of the salt. I had the bone in filet which was ok, like everyone else said I don't necessarily think it was worth what I paid for it. For a side I had the lobster mashed potatoes which were actually a decent value and were pretty good. Our service was also fine, but there was nothing there that really wowed me. Overall, I probably won't be back unless I'm with someone who really wants to go there.
