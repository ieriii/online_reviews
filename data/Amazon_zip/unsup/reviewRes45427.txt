Great food, atmosphere, drinks, music! The curry fries are soooo yummy, even if you don't like curry. I recommend it as a snack at the bar. I ate the corned beef and cabbage. Yum! The lamb was also tasty. Service is impeccable! We left early... before the fun began.  The front of the place has beautiful bar and seating for diners. The "library" with a fireplace is first-come, first-serve and is a wonderful place to have a drink. At the very end is another bar with taller tables and stools. This area gets "happening" later on. The music is a mix of everything fun!
