I'm not a vegetarian but enjoy endless food options, both meatful and meat-free. A veg friend was in from out of town and was excited to try this place. And so...we dined. Love the atmosphere. Eclectic meets urban meets rocker meets 'I'm my own person, bitch!' I appreciate that. Also, the server was lovely. Now...food. The queso dip was ok. I probably wouldn't order it again. Not because it was bad, but because it was just meh. I was hungry and ate it but could do without it. The shining star was the black bean burger. Here's the description: BLACK BEAN BURGER 8.99 Homemade burger, melted cheeze, lettuce, tomato, onion & creole mustard on a toasted harvest roll.Add giardinera+.50 Add avocado+1.00 Sweet holy mother, it was sooooo tasty. The sauce was awesome, the consistency of the burger was awesome, and the onions/tomatoes/lettuce were all so fresh -- awesome! I enjoyed this immensely and would definitely come back for it. Yum. PS -- You're able to get this burger with soy cheese or with dairy cheese. I picked dairy because I love me a good dairy-gasm. Drool.
