Hands down the best deep dish! It's not as deep as Giordano's, but everything else makes up for it. The sauce is amazing. I asked extra sauce on the side- yes, it's that's good! The crust has texture. Not sure if it has corn mill. The ambiance is awesome! You can write on the wall, too. I loved this place so much, I even bought a shirt!! The locals recommend this place!
