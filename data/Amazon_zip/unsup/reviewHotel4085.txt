I got a sweet deal on Priceline for this hotel - it cost me the same to stay here as it would have if I'd stayed at the lowest priced hotel in the standard travel websites. My friends had similar experience, too. It's totally worth it if you get the priceline amount so bid low and pick that geographic area. It was fairly central for me for work so not a bad experience at all. They put me in a suite that really was great and comfy, albeit a tad small.  Any hotel that charges for internet access in this day is a little lame in my book though -- especially considering what it normally costs to stay here.
