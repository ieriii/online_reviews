A definite guilty pleasure. Like someone wrote earlier, it is Korean food for white people. The Seoul Sassy wings are embarrassing to order, but tasty as all get out. Crispy wings covered in scallions, soy, ginger, and garlic. I suggest getting the 10 piece and enjoying the leftovers the next day. This place is an easy take out joint and is well priced. A top choice.
