Couldn't wait for this place to open and I am happy it is here, but after dining three times I have to admit I expected more based on all the hype.Wait time for a table has been normal, but the wait time between courses can sometimes get annoyingly pronounced. Some of the dishes are literally a few bites (like the less than average ravioli pasta with foam - skip it) but then you will sometimes wait for 20 minutes for the next few bites. Maybe they sell more drinks that way?The pub food options are solid in general, but the more adventerous options usually end up being misses, the exception being sweetbreads, but then again I love sweetbreads! Go with a small group and order more than you think you should eat and it works out pretty well. Will be a frequent diner based on location really, it's close to my best friend's new place.
