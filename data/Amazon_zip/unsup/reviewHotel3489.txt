went to this hotel tonight to hang out with some out of town family. they got a small suite, 2 rooms, king sized bed, flat screen tv, beautiful furniture. the room was amazing. heard it was about $200 a night. great location off of michigan avenue. not really any parking besides the $30 parking garages on the block. not sure what the other rooms are like. but room 1601 is quite nice!
