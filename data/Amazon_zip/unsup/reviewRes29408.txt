In an attempt to please a vegetarian ex-girlfriend, I finally made the sacrifice to try out Chicago Diner a couple years back, and I'm definitely glad I did. Not really really my scene, per say, but the food is too good to pass up. Some of the menu's highlights are the reuben, sweet potato quesadillas, gyros, bbq "bacon" cheeseburger, taco salad, and the vegan chocolate chip cookie dough milkshake (not a soy milk fan and somehow loved this thing). The only gripe I have is that the vegan cheese kinda lacks in the whole taste and consistency department. Also, be prepared to wait a bit, the place is always packed!
