Amazing pizza and beer .. I had a hefeweizen here in August, my first real beer in Chicago, and it could be the best hefeweizen I've ever had. They have tons of other delicious beers, too. Pizza is quite delicious. Service is usually good. Atmosphere is better than most, but not a huge fan of the 284 televisions going all at once. Seriously, Chicago, Don't people talk to each other anymore?  What i don't get is how they let like 10-15 tables sit empty cause they are "reserved" when there are 20 or so people standing around and wait is like an hour.
