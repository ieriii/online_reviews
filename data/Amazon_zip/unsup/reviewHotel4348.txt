Do you like small, confined areas? I have a deep appreciation for the Palmer House for its historical significance, but not for the insignificance of the size of the rooms. The interior of this hotel is something to truly marvel at. The rooms are small, so get ready to get packed in if you are staying here or plan on spending your time outside of your room. The hotel is in close proximity to most everything downtown, so you will not have trouble getting around. I'd suggest stopping for a drink at Potter's or dinner at Lockwood restaurant, but not actually staying at the hotel.
