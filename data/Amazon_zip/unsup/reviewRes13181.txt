I love this place despite that in the colder months when the outdoor seating is dismantled it's difficult to get through the door. They have tons of fish specials on the chalkboards. Admittedly I've never come for straight up seafood, but I heard that the fish is the reason to really go. I've only been to Glenn's for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast at Glenn's is nothing fancy. Don't expect anything mind blowing, just decent regular American breakfast food. Note the wall-o-cereal over by the bar. I've heard of restaurants that serve only cereal, but at Glenn's it seems to be a nice option for people who are too lazy to pour their own bowl at home. For lunch the food is great. I always start out with the clam chowder. Note that it contains bacon, so it's not completely seafood, but it's creamy and served in a cup. I've had the grilled cheese and tomato, the BLT and the spinach salad. Can't go wrong with any of those. One surprise was the potato pancake. I'm not a big potato pancake guy, but they threw one on my plate anyway, and before I could protest I was already stuffing it in my face.
