Con: 2 hour wait Pro: "Encased meats" completely made up for it. Con: A little pricey for their "specials" Pro: Completely worth it. Doug himself greets you and takes your order so it's pretty neat to chat a little with him. We were really looking forward to the duck fat fries but it was forgettable, but we took it with a grain of salt because it was towards the end of the day (they close at 4pm) so the duck fat flavors may already have been soaked up earlier. I LOVED the catalina dog with the saffron rouille (where you can see each strand of fine red saffron). The Hot Doug's BLT was pretty good with the avocado mayo because the "encased meat" was an entire tube of bacon. Yes, a whole sausage filled with bacon meat. My friend got the foie gras dog and it was very heavy and creamy. Definitely delicious but I think the saffron rouille dog really took over my palate. Try going early right before they start serving. If you go any later than I say, 2:30-3pm on a weekend (as in friday and saturday), you probably won't be able to make it through the door.
