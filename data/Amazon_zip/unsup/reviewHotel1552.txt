Won't be coming back here. They did not have the king size non smoking room available like the reservation (made months in advance and) stated they would honor. However, they did have "lake view" rooms available that fit that description if I wanted to pay for an upgrade. Our choices were a king size in a fully smoking floor. Who has fully smoking floors these days? Or a room with two smaller beds. They did not offer up to check if a king non smoking would be available the following day or two either. Lights out and a clogged bath tub in our room as well. Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. I'm positive that there are many hotels in the area that have similar deals which are much nicer and have better customer service.
