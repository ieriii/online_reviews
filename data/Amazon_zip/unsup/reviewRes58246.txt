The top 5 best encased meats (from a restaurant) that I have ever had have all come from Hot Doug's. The Andoullie Sausage (The Salma Hayek) is, hands down, the best encased meat I have ever had anywhere in the world. I highly recommend Hot Doug's as one of those places you have to take your out of town friends who come in for a visit. As for the long lines, meh, people wait longer outside night clubs for an experience that cannot possibly compare to fries cooked in rendered duck fat (available only on Fri. and Sat.).============================Ladies and Gentlemen: It's a hot dog shop, let's not act like it's a shrine to mankind. Indeed, the specialty dogs are pretty novel. It's great that you get a choice between steamed and grilled. The veggie dog is also pretty darn good. Although, the neon green relish is probably carcinogenic. I'll admit that Hot Doug's is probably the best hotdog shop in the Avondale area. Might be the only one too. I know Chicagoans are known for their love of encased meats but, let's not get carried away.Philistine! Heretic! :-D
