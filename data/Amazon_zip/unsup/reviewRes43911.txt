M&H is a neighborhood gem. I have been there so many times I can't count, and due to laziness on my part, sometimes 2 meals a day. I highly recommend their granola/yogurt. oatmeal, OJ, BLT, salads in the case, pretty much any special salad or soup they have, the list of my faves would be too long. Someone else mentioned their soggy pickles, they are soggy, loaded with garlic, and fantastic! It's not a place to get Vlasic, they're fresh, and I believe homemade. Anyway, love this place. If I could change one thing, I would never stand in line and okay 2 things, secondly, I could bring my dog in, but the latter is a Chicago law, however they are very dog friendly :)
