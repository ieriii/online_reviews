I'd like to say first that the employees here are sosososo nice. Genuinely so. I've eaten the steak sandwich at both here and El Cubanito, the top rated Cuban sandwich places on Yelp, and I have to say that I much preferred El Cubanito's. HOWEVER. 90 Miles has seating indoors and outside. They also have a wider selection of items on the menu. ANDD side dishes. Yes, they have side dishes. Besides the steak sandwich, I tried the fried yucca, which was delicious when the garlic mojo was poured over it. I also had an empanada... Not sure what kind, since I ordered the goat cheese but definitely did not receive a goat cheese empanada. It was okay, not particularly memorable, but definitely not bad. I have trouble choosing between 3 and 4 stars. I want to give it 3, but then I think of how nice they are and how their sandwich really was not bad. So I'll be generous and go with the 4. Next time I come here, I'm going to try a different sandwich, though.
