I really enjoyed this sushi restaurant! Great atmosphere and service. I went with one other person on a Thurs at 8:30pm--we were told ten min and only waited five. Fantastic hamachi-- fresh, flavorful, and generous cut. The Wakamono and Oedipus rolls were unique and exciting, again with fresh ingredients, and were not overpowered with too much sauce. The presentation was appealing and also space saving (the tables in this place are tiny). A (small) bottle of sparkling sake set us back $10, but it was a very nice compliment to the meal. They lose points for the over zealous water filling busers-- we had a pitcher of water on the table so there's no need to attack my glass every 3min while its still 3/4 full. It's also a pretty pricey restaurant, which I could see for some of the items, but every item on the menu is at least $8. I recommend this place because of quality, but get ready to spend a pretty penny.
