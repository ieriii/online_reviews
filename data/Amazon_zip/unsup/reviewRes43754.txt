We visit Chicago annually to celebrate New Year's Eve and our anniversary. Dining at a restaurant the caliber of Kinzie Chop House is maybe a once or twice per year experience for us. After our experience last year, we were astonished that owner, Ms Susan Frasca, took time to read our review and personally respond. She seemed as let down as were with our 25th anniversary Kinzie Chop House experience. With Ms Frasca's apparent dedication to customer satisfaction as excellent as it is rare we decided to celebrate our 26th at Kinzie Chop House and it turned out to be the stuff culinary dreams are made of! We're pretty much lost in a wine list this extensive so Burton made several recommendations based on our preferences then informed us it was half-price bottle night! Yay! After some deliberation and debate, we started with the cheese tray appetizer -- a brilliant selection of cheeses, fresh fruit, and toast points. We savored each of the cheeses but our favorite with the goat cheese rolled in fresh herbs and lightly grilled. My dinner was one of the very best I've ever eaten -- jumbo shrimp generously stuffed with real crab meat, filet medallions, gorgonzola mashed potatoes, braised spinach. The artfully arranged plate was ringed with a delectable lobster sauce that complimented everything else. Wow... Laurie's steak was perfectly grilled, flavorful, and everything she had hoped it would be! Thankfully I turned out to be everything she hoped I would be! After dinner, Burton surprised us with a piece of cheesecake with rum sauce and "Happy Anniversary" spelled out in raspberry sauce. We were absolutely delighted and giggled like little kids! Thank you for this dining experience, Ms Frasca. As advertised, it was exceptional in every way. C'ya next year...
