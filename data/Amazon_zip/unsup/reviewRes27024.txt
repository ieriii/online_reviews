Both my dining companion and I agreed that Graham Elliot was the worst restaurant experience we've had in recent memory -- an irony given its pomp and prices.  We walked in on a cold weekday night because we were in the area and the restaurant looked half-empty. The hostess flatly said they were booked but we could, like, sit in the bar. She couldn't summon the energy to walk us there, though. What followed was an entire evening of inexcusably terrible service: - Even though it was slow, we sat for 15 minutes before our too-cool-for-school waiter greeted us flippantly and took drink orders. (We think he thought he was special b/c he was wearing skinny jeans and Converses. We didn't have the heart to tell him so was every other 20-something urbanite across the country.) - We sat for another 15 min before our drinks even arrived. - We then waited 20 min before our waiter returned to take food orders. We were dumbfounded at this point. We couldn't even enjoy conversation b/c we had to yell to hear each other over Radiohead wailing through the speakers. - We were never thanked for coming in, apologized to for the many delays, or simply told to have a nice evening. The food and marriage of flavors were gratifying but not worth the prices ($35 for small entrees), and they were ruined by the nasty service. We could've been treated better at nearby Ed Debevic's. It seemed to us that Graham Elliot can't decide on an identity. It's one part insouciant hipster, other part establishment snob who disdains customers like my friend, a fashion exec albeit with a non-starched style of dress. Either way, pretension without excellence is intolerable. Grow up boys.
