I love their window displays!! They're crazy cool and unique. I've only really gone there for coffee on the weekends, but their coffee is bomb. Not to mention the cute guys who work there! Their bakery items always look really good. Alliance would probably be the first place I'd go if I needed some grab some desserts. I've tried some of their cookies and cupcakes, and they have always been outstanding. Very cute bakery.
