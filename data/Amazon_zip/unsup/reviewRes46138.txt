It is defenitely an upscale Cheese Cake Factory, they had a great menu. The staff and our waiter were really great and attentive. I ordered a roasted chicken with potatoes and vegetables. The chicken was amazingly cooked and very juicy inside. Delicious!!! I'll defenitely come here next time i'm in town. Didn't have to wait to long either, even though it was a Saturday night and most restaurants nearby had waiting times of an hour or more. It took about 20-30 mins to be seated. Great place!
