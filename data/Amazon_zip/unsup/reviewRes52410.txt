This is the first time I had Brazilian BBQ and I really enjoyed the experience. The meat was really good, as was the salad bar, and grilled pineapple as everyone previously has said. Cool ambiance too. I would have given another star, but we went here for my husband's birthday and I told our server thinking that they would bring something out and surprise him and our group. Another server came by with a dessert cart, and we all said no...and I was confused because I thought they would bring something out. So our original server came back, and said "no desserts? and then looked at my husband and said, "not even for your birthday?" (ruining the surprise). So then I thought, oh ok, they're going to bring him something and let him pick, that's nice. So he picked a chocolate mousse, and they brought it out with a candle and the plate said Happy Birthday in chocolate on it which was all fine. But then, the bill came--and there it was! $10.00! I had no idea we would get charged for it! I've eaten at a lot of nice places and never experienced that--I thought it was kind of tacky, and I wish that had been disclosed before, it wasn't a huge deal, but I thought it was really tacky to charge us for it. We would have been happy with any old dessert--we were going more for the surprise factor. Also, one of the servers (not ours) he was standing some feet away, close enough for me to hear and he pointed at our table and a few others around us and told another one of the servers, "birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday" somewhat in an annoyed tone.
