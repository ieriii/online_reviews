We had such high hopes for this restaurant! Everyone claimed it to be superior to our favorite local place, Indian Garden - "Eek! Methinks not." While the menu offers a wonderful selection, the waitstaff was rude and the food was mediocre at best. I ordered my typical tryout Chicken Palak and found it to taste like Fleming's Creamed Spinach instead of the usual and aromatically spiced dish I've come to expect. Serving sizes were huge, but when the food is bland, who wants leftovers!? I would NOT recommend this restaurant. Head across Michigan Avenue for a warm welcome and sumptuously spiced food at The Indian Garden!
