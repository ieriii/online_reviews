Nice place to stay. It is conveniently located by the metro. The building it is in is a bit of a logistical nightmare though. There isn't easy access to the other side of the building. My husband and I stayed for 2 nights and 3 days and had no issues with the hotel. They could use some more cable channels, but we didn't really watch that much tv. I would recommend this hotel.
