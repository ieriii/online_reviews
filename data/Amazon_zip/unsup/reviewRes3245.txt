We had the free scout mob deal, which was an insanely large amount of food considering it was free. I thought the wings were tasty with very interesting flavor combos, huge pieces and nice and crispy. The fries were ok, not bad but not great either. All in all a good experience but their regular prices are crazy high for chicken and the cashier was less than friendly. I will go back and try their bowls though, they looked promising!
