I want to get the negative out of the way, and this only may pertain to me, but its the price. It's high per sandwich, but you do get what you pay for. Now, the fun part! Celebrity chef Rick Bayless' XOCO is loco good food. Located on the corner in a narrow location, there's usually always a line during eating hours. For two reasons, one the food is great, second because they only let you order and pay when there's an actual seat for you to sit in. I imagine the winter scares away some, but the summer is definitely busy every day. The menu is a large selection of Mexican styled sandwiches, soups and more. Everything included are jazzed up ingredients, fresh for that day, combined together in fits of joy. I ordered the rib sandwich with pickled jalapenos and it did the trip. Along with chips and the sauce on the side, each bite told a story. I paired it with a Sophie beer and it was the perfect companion. There's something for everyone, vegetarian to meat eaters. Even picky eaters and kids will be able to find something. They serve authentic hot chocolate, which I look forward to trying when it gets cooler out. It was a wonderful treat, especially because my wedding was the next day. It was a perfect "last meal", but I'm going to take my lady there asap. Delicious!
