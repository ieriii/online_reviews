Stayed here last weekend and found every aspect of Hotel Burnham to be great. The room was clean and comfortable. The people at the front desk were genuinely nice and very helpful. They printed out tickets to the cubs game for me, gave out an umbrella when it rained, helped us with a voucher for Atwoods. The staff was excellent. I felt like we got a great deal on the 2 night stay especially for everything that was included - as part of a promotion we received $50 to use at Atwoods and a free continental breakfast on Labor Day as Atwoods wasn't open. We took advantage of the wine hour 1 of the days and that was nice. The location is excellent. There is a lot to do within walking distance and if the places you are going are a bit farther away there are several options for hopping on the L. Very convenient for getting to/from Midway airport as well. Would definitely stay here again.
