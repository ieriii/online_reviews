As I walked in, I saw a sign on the wall for a chicken breast milk shake (I think it was called the Gizzard Blizzard). Haha, uhm really? Anyways, I barely looked at the menu and decided on the $19.99 combo deal. This came with a whole fried chicken, in 2 different sauces, with 2 sides, and 2 drinks. Pretty sweet deal. The chicken had a nice crunch, which stayed crispy while covered in sauce, and the chicken was juicy. The Seoul Sassy sauce was sweet and ginger-garlicky. It's not your typical Korean wing sauce, but it was still tasty. The Crisp BBQ sauce was good with a nice kick. The fries weren't anything special, but the fried mushrooms were great.  They also have chicken strips as well as varioius Korean style rice bowls. I love me some Korean fried chicken and Crisp definitely satisified. I still wonder if that Gizzard Blizzard was for real.
