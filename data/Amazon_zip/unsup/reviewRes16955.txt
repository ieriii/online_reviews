I absolutely loved this place. Recently visited for the first time and loved that we did not have to wait long to be seated. I was looking for something light so I ordered their empanadas de pollo with rice and beans. It was surprisingly filling and delish! The main dining area had superb lighting, high ceilings, but tacky and clashing decor. I didn't think that was very reflective of Latin American culture, but otherwise lovely restaurant. I hear they have live music on the other side which was dimly lit and near a small bar. I saw several large groups so it appears to be accomodating to parties, but I can attest to a chic cocktail sip with girlfriends. I would defintiely go back for their empanadas!
