I really like this place. I had a wrap here a year or two ago and was obsessed, tried to recreate it at home and it was not as good. Every time I've tried to go back it's super busy but last night me and my husband went and had a great experience. It's kind of cramped in there, so you're lucky if you get a booth along the wall. However, it's a cozy diner atmosphere. They have a good little beer list. I had the black bean burger with avocado and dairy cheese (sorry vegans, but don't even pretend that fake cheese compares to the real thing!) and my date had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. He's normally a meat eater and loved it. We both had sweet potato fries and they were excellent. Even though it was busy our waitress was very attentive to us. I wish they would open another one in a not as trendy, congested area of the city. We'll be back!
