I came here for lunch and was really looking forward to it as many of my friends have raved about this place. My first impression was great-we were greeted by friendly staff and was seated right away- it probably helps that this was on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. I ordered the cauliflower/lentils/raita vegetarian dish while my dining companion ordered the crabs benedict. My dish wasn't exactly what I expected, but good nonetheless. The cauliflower was spiced to taste exactly like a common Indian cauliflower dish, so much so that I thought I was eating my mom's cooking. I thought it could have been cooked a little more, the vegetable was a little too crunchy in consistency. The cauliflower sat on a bed of lentils which were cooked to perfection, and this was topped with a raita sauce which, once again, reminded me of some pretty common Indian fare. My friend's crab benedict, on the other hand, was awesome. The old bay seasoning added a nice kick and the crab itself was very tasty and substantial. I definitely had food envy. Our waitress, Chyna, was great. She was very enthusiastic about the food and was attentive without being overbearing. I think this was a good place to try especially for lunch as the wait time and prices were much more reasonable. The food was good but not mind-blowing, so I don't know that I'd cough up the dough for dinner. I'm not a carnivore though so take this with a grain of salt.
