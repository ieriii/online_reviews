I really wanted to love this place - there's just something about it, from the chalkboard listing the specials, the wall o' cereal, the bubbly waitress, and cozy seating. But....meh. My crabcake benedict was hit and miss. The crabcake was great - big chunks of crab and very little filler. But the eggs were overcooked. Yes, I did ask for poached hard. I always do and they've always been great at other places. But these were so overpoached I basically had warm hard-boiled eggs. The potato pancake served with was good and the hollandaise sauce was okay, but nothing special. The service was really scattered. I wanted to like her, but she didn't do the greatest job. My husband ordered the blue cheese burger medium rare. The server agreed rarer was better...yet when his blue cheese STEAK (topped with cold diced tomatos - huh?) arrived, it was practcally well done. She offered to fix the mix up but we'd already waited awhile so he just ate it, and she charged us for the burger. He aslo asked for a refill on his iced tea and waited a long time to get it. When our server came back he reminded her and she said "Oh I left it on the counter. I did that to another table too". Umm, okay. According to their sign they have the "best food in the world". Based on my experience, I'd disagree. The dinner menu was intriguing, very fish based, leaning towards the breaded, fried, crusted and pretzeled (except for a seared ahi topped with hollandaise - what's that about?). I might eventually make my way back to try dinner, but I'm in no rush.
