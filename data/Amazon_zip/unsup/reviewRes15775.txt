This place is kinda like Cheers for me. I have only been here maybe 6 times...but ever since the first time I walked in the door they remember you! They may not always get your name right, but they recognize that you have been in before and always strike up a nice conversation!!  The food is excellent and the menu has quite a wide range of things that good, old school Italian restaurants should have...lots of pastas, funky and traditional, seafood options galore, pizzas, plus the normal meat options. I can't say enough good things. I had the Pasta with Pesto sauce and chicken and shrimp...and OMG was it good!!!!!!! the portion sizes for pasta are huge, so you can easily get like 2-3 meals out of one entree, and it makes for some great leftovers. The atmosphere is super cute....slightly romantic. Makes for a great date place, a place to take your family or a good of group of friends. There is also a bar area with seating and they have TV's with sports on so that side of the restaurant is pretty chill, the other (dining) side is very relaxed with low-lighting, softly lit with candles everywhere and booths and tables for seating. There is also a room next door that can be rented for private parties and I think it has it's own bar area as well.  Go here for a great, reasonably priced dinner!! You won't regret it!
