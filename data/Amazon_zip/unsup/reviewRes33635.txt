The falafel is simply a must. My brother who is avid of meat and potatoes even thoroughly enjoys the falafel sandwich which indeed says a lot as he's the pickiest amongst those I eat with.  The food is more than well worth the mine even after the price hike.  I enjoy being outside when they have their patio open during the warmer seasons because the environment is wonderful.
