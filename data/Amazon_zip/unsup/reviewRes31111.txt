I went into this place by accident thinking it was just another diner. I started browsing the menu and saw a lot of quotes around "bacon" and misspelled words like "chiken", then it hit me. I got the "Chiken Parmeasean" and it tasted a lot like Chicken.  Service is great at this place and the prices are reasonable.
