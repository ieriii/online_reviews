So i was very intrigued with the interest in the restaurant, always a line around the block on weekends. Till i went and waited all day to get a hot dog? Wasnt that amazing, was just a hot dog...there are other restaurants like this in chicago-without the long line-tastes the same...While it was good, and service was great...i dont understand the hype...i was expecting something greater.
