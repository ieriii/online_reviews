This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. As a vegan, I can order virtually anything on the menu. The food is great and reasonably priced and the desserts are amazing. My favorites are the new eggplant Parmesan and the "chikin Caesar salad". My favorite thing about this place is the cozy atmosphere & eating on the patio in the summer.
