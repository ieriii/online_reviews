I was in chicago on a conference and everyone from california said I HAD to try the deep dish pizza at ginos east. Thankfully we were staying in downtown and ginos east was about 5 mins walk. I bought the small vegge deep dish pizza. I have to say for a first timer, the crust is WOW! Price was about $20 but a small will easily fill 2 people, might even fill 3. The service was good for the take out. Parking, not sure either. I walked over. Needless to say I'm on a lookout for a deep dish pizza placehere in LA. Any ideas?
