We had a party of six and decided to give this place a try as it always seemed busy - BIG mistake - this was some of the worst Chinese food we had in a while (all six of us felt the same way). Service was terrible in the beginning (the restaurant was still fairly empty at this point) and after several requests for more water and rice, we tried to voice our dissatisfaction with the service, which with 6 people was an automatic 15 percent tip added to the bill. Everyone we tried to talk to claimed not to understand English or even Cantonese, including the hostess. Each person just said they did not understand and point to someone else. How can you provide service not speaking English or even Cantonese which is the main dialect in Chinatown. Service aside, onto the food... We had ordered several bowls of hot and sour soup and none of us could finish it since it was so horrible, with too much vinegar and soy to the point of the soup almost being black in color. The pot stickers were too doughy and the steamed dumplings were totally dried out - we would have preferred frozen ones from the grocery store. The meat dishes did not have a lot of meat, especially for the price they were charging, was tasteless except for some heat and everything was swimming in oil. We could have had a much better tasting meal in any other restaurant in Chinatown with some seafood courses and for less money. I'm a foodie and many of my friends ask me for restaurant choices and I could never ever recommend this place to anyone except to recommend to avoid it.
