I had high hopes for this place when I saw all of the efforts going into the renovation. The concept is great, the decor is great, the vibe is even great, however the food just didn't do anything for me. I found it incredibly bland and uninspired. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. Irazu down the street has a similar concept but unlike 90 miles their food delivers.
