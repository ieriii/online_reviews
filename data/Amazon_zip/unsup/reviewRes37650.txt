If you like spending a ton of money on exotic beers from around the world,...then go to the Map Room. If you like great prices on the same high quality beers and deilsh food, then come to the HopLeaf Bar in Andersonville. Cashew Butter, fig Jam, Morbier cheese on grilled sourdough.  If you go to eat here you MUST order it.  Not to mention it comes with Stilton mac and cheese AND housemade chips? Seriously? For $10? Awesome. Good service but then again we were there on a Friday night and it was incredibly busy. 20 minute wait isn't bad for 11 pm at night. We went upstairs and had a couple beers while waiting for our table. Also had the Duck Rueben sandwhich which was also really good and not too overly greasy for duck.  And that came with good fries too.
