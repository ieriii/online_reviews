The rib-eye's were excellent in terms of temperature (med rare), preparation, and taste. Of the steakhouses in Chicago, this one has the most extensive options in terms of steaks. The remaining sides (lobster mashed potatoes, vegetables ) were all standard steakhouse fare. Their signature dessert, the butter cake, was way too sweet; under cooked in the center, and overdone on the edges. I didn't get past two forks of that stuff. The rest of the place/experience is pretty much of a nightmare and forgettable. The 2 of us were seated at a table for 6; we couldn't hear the waitperson above all the noise; and we could barely see the menu or each other. The lighting is awful. I guess someone thought the low lighting might be romantic or interesting. It's neither given general design and layout of the place - it's just stupid. More pretentious than anything else. Why anyone would try to have dinner in the bar area is beyond me. With the live band, high ceilings, and slick surfaces, the place is loud and I do mean LOUD! It's impossible to have a conversation without shouting - that includes the dining room where we were seated. Service by the waitperson was adequate and I found the maitre d smug and self-important. With any luck, she'll be looking for a new job soon. Overall, this is a place people think they're supposed to like just because it's an expensive steak. It's a showcase for loud, obnoxious, and overbearing people pretending to have a good time. It's unlikely I'll return.
