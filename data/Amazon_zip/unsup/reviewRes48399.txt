What can I say about The Publican that hasn't been gushed about already?? For starters: -The beet salad with a mountain of ricotta and salt was amazing. -Frites with sunny side up eggs would be amazing for a hungover brunch. -Beer list is amazing. My fiance said he was in the mood for something "belgian and hoppy" and our waiter rose to the challenge by bringing us an off-menu selection and letting us sample a few options. -The stack of postcards on the host stand was a fun way to remember the dinner -Some awesome people-watching. A table near the street will let you check out the comings and goings at Lumen, especially interesting if there's a Jersey Shore party there that night. -Plenty of free street parking around the corner. -Call ahead and see if you can get one of the booths with swinging doors for your party of 4.
