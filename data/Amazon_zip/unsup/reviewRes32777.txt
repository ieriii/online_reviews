I have been coming to the Chicago Diner since 2004 and I have to say it is my favorite restaurant in the whole wide world. It is where a vegan or vegetarian can really splurge and it always make me happy. Try the "Dagwood" if you like fake meat and the nachos appetizer. I also feel at home when I visit the Chicago Diner! Best restaurant in Chicago!
