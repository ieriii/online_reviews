If you are ever in the Windy City and have a craving for pho, Tank noodle is the place to go. This is hands down one of the best Pho places I've ever been to. The price is also very affordable. Also, If you are coming with a group bigger than 6, try to make reservations. The place is usually packed when I go there.
