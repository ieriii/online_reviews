This is a late review, as the meal I am referring to took place a year ago. But, I cannot say enough about how wonderful Irazu is. I had my last birthday party here, with a total of about 10 people. Knowing how small the restaurant is and the fact that we would have to wait did not deter me from wanting to eat here. The food is THAT good.  Being vegan, I look forward to the vegan tacos and soy oatmeal shakes, but most of my friends and family are meat-eating and they too raved about the meal. The waiter was a riot, super sweet and funny. I was proud to bring my suburban friends and family to this place. When we first walked in, they all kind of looked at me like "what is this small, out of the way place you dragged us to?" Upon leaving, all I heard was "I am having MY birthday here!" I've also ordered take out on occasion and again....top-notch food. Customer service is big in my book as well, and I have never had a bad experience with anyone at this place. Great job Irazu!
