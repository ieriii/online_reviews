I was finally able to try this place after hearing excellent things about it from my other friends; let's just say I didn't know what I was missing out on!I recently moved into the area and was looking for some good Vietnamese food to satiate my craving. I previously ventured around the Argyle area, but once I tried Simply It's food, the restaurants in Argyle became very mediocre in comparison!The service here is great--attentive and friendly (especially the owner!). Upon entering, the owner jumped out of his seat to greet and seat us. My water glass was never too empty and empty plates were never on the table for too long. The atmosphere was cozy and warm, which definitely helped me get over the Chicago chill.The food itself was delicious. I split a bowl of the beef noodle soup (pho bo?) with my friend just to warm ourselves up. As far as my pho experiences go, I'd say this one definitely ranks around the top of my list. For my own entree, I had the Simply It's Beef. The tender cubes of meat and the fresh salad served on top of it went well together. I never like my meat too dry, so the marination was perfect for this dish. My friend ordered the Coconut Mango Beef entree, recommended by our waitress, and loved it! It was served in an actual coconut! How neat is that?Well, needless to say, I will definitely be coming back to this place and will be bringing many more friends!
