Completely rude doorman pretty much ruined it for me on my first visit. Subsequent visits have been fine, as I was with all *white* people. All of that said, the place itself if great..the history, the music, the expensive drinks. I recommend going to see Patricia Barber or the Catalano group. Pass on the "jam night" if you are slightly musically educated or picky. Go early to get a seat. Street parking is difficult and can be sketchy. Take the red line.
