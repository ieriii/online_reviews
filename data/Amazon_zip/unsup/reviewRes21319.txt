Truly the best "dawg" I've ever had! This place is truly incredible.. very simple cool drive-in. The service is classic and no frills.. but that's not why you come. You come for the delicious super juicy hot dog with a perfect bite. The snap of the dawg is incredible and its spiced just right. I mean even the green tomato is worth taking your time on. Only thing I wish could be tastier would be the fries but this place still deserves 5 stars if I could I would give 6!
