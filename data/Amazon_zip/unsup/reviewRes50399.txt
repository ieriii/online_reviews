My friend decided to have a 30th Birthday Brunch, so went here for some daytime drinking and eggs... I saw the brunch menu and saw "breakfast lasagna" heck yeah... layers of thinly sliced potatoes, bacon and cheese topped with two eggs over easy... amazing. The only thing I could've asked for is some kind of sauce on the dish... obviously ketchup would've been fine, but figure something a little fancier since it was just a little too dry. Besides that the Bulls game 1 of the playoffs was on and they had l think 9 screens out there... the staff were extremely nice and the drinks were extremely good... got a couple of bloody marys and they instantly got a thumbs up for serving it with bacon. Speaking of bacon, they are crazy about it, unfortunately my wife, who's a vegetarian had a side of hashbrowns... with bacon. They probably should give just a heads up as that's not a usual for hasbrowns. Also, if you really want to indulge... try the french toast sliders... so so good.
