Like others have said, the entire wicker park/Logan Square/Avondale world was present on Saturday night. My friend is crafty and we quickly got two seats at the bar. We tried most of the beers and they were all about average. Nothing blew us away and nothing made us weep at wasted cash. We'd already had dinner so we were just noshing but we had some excellent bruschetta (the duck was good but I wonder if a different type of cheese might have been better) there was one with beets on it. Which was by far my favorite. The bread pudding was good. It was a good introduction to bread pudding for a friend who'd never had it before.
