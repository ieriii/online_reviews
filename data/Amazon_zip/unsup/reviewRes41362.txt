blech times 7... trying to cash in the groupon's before the big move, my friend and i dined at bonsoiree on a sweltering (both outside and inside the restaurant) day. beautifully plated (i'd love to play in their china cabinet!) but the food just did not match. EVERYthing was salty and just too pretentious. every other word out of our server's mouth was foreign. my friend and i just felt like they were trying too hard.  excellent service, however. i like how each server added their own personal touch to their descriptions explaining how they like to eat it, etc. it's a nice, casual (but WARM) atmosphere for a somewhat upscale restaurant. be careful not to drive past it - look for the 2728 on the awning, not for the restaurant name.
