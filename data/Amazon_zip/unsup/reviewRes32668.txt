What to say...oh sooo much. This is for first time trials to an Ethiopian restaurant, like my experience. So let me dig into it (literally). First things first, the lunch buffet is no longer existing, BUT they do have the lunch specials. There is no sheet that mentions it, it's only word of mouth so listen closely and ask you waiter(ess). For $7.95 you choose 3 different clumps of thick pasty "stews" that include beef or vegetables, as mild or spicy. We had the beef Michetabish that had a nice flavor. It will come out on a round platter with Injera and a separate side of Injera (a large circular flatbread of a 20 inch diameter made of sourdough fermented with teff flour--see photos from demera for an example I included). Not only is it used to serve the food on but also comes to scoop up the food with (you won't find silverware anywhere around and use should use your right hand as custom says). I could go on and on poetically describing the Injera but the unique consistency is of a soft rubbery "makeshift utensil" like a children's play goo and looks like carpet padding with all the little holes. That's the best I can do. The taste has a sour hint to it too, hence the sourdough base. Lastly, the portions are very large, even the lunch specials! We tried the Chicken and Vegetable Sambussa appetizer which were delicious dough triangles stuffed with what it names. The Ethiopian tea was tasty with a cinnamon after taste (unfortunately, I noticed that it was brewed with teabags instead of loose leaf, but still good). The servers are from Ethiopia along with all the decorations and music. The waitresses are very nice and smiley, and they try their best to explain the items on the menu. At the same time, they leisurely assist you and you will often have to call them over if you need anything. Quite an experience, enjoyable I must admit.
