its pretty frat-boy/sportsbar type of crowd on the weekend, and the wait is extremely long, but during the week its easy to grab a table and eat delicious pizza! The pizza stands out in a good way, from most pizza in the city...definately worth a try! I love that they have cheeseless pizza as an option, since i dont eat cheese.
