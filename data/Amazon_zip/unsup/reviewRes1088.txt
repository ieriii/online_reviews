Most definitely worth the wait here. Come here @ 10am and presumably the line wil be shorter but the place does a really good job at getting people in and out and getting you seated. Now off to the dogs! Menu is very expansive and you can get everything from a $1.50 regular chicago dog to an expensive and quality $8 dog. And yes, the fries in duck fat are phenomenal. I highly recommend checking out Hot Doug's for some hot doug action
