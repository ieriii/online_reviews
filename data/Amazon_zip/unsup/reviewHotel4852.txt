Just stayed there this past weekend. The architecture was beautiful and the lobby was nice. That's where my positives about this hotel end. The majority of the staff was extremely rude. While checking in, I had one of the hotel porters nearly run me over while muttering "damn" under his breath.The room was tiny but that was to be expected seeing as the hotel has been around since 1893. I had to request a room change because the room smelled of mold and mildew and it appeared someone had dropped an iron onto the floor and left it for too long because there was still an imprint of the iron on the carpet. Our second room smelled better, but there were chips on the bathroom door. There was no fitted sheet on our bed. Just a top sheet covering the mattress and then oddly, a top sheet atop the comforter. I'm not sure if the housekeeping staff is so lazy that they can't make a bed properly or what. I noticed that there were several functions going on while staying there and it made me wonder; why if they make money on renting out rooms/dining halls for conventions or weddings etc. that they can't manage simple renovations? They can afford an automated self check in/check out machine but can't replace carpet or repair a bathroom door?? The woman at Expedia and the hotels website led me to believe the hotel was nicer than it actually was. Luckily the rooms were inexpensive but if I were to return to Chicago, this is one hotel I'd avoid. I'd rather spend more money than stay here again.
