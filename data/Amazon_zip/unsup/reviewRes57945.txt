This is the worst restaurant ever. I cant even call it a restaurant. I was there a couple of times, and there were new waitresses each time. And none of them could understand English, so it was very difficult for us to make orders. It got even worse when the owner showed up. He tried to be a funny guy, but just looked stupid. He was blaming waitresses for his own mistakes. I felt sorry for a girl when he started to yell at her in a kitchen, but we still could hear everything. No wonder girls don't stay there for a long time, no one can work for this jerk. The American cuisine was OK, but Romanian food could be better. After 10 pm a few more customers came. I figured out they were friends with the owner, cause he sat with them at the table. Soon guys were drunk and started to behave inappropriately, but nobody said a word to them. We left as soon as possible. I will never go back to that place and I don't recommend it for the others.
