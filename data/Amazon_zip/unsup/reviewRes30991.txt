I would live in this diner if it were legal. Awesome food. Awesome service. Sometimes the wait is long but it's totally worth it. My fiance and i are vegan and this place makes it so easy to eat whatever we want. The staff are totally helpful and know exactly how every dish is prepared, unlike other restaurants where the staff could care less what they feed you.
