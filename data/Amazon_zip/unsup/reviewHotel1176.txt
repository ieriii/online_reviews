Location is centrally located making it easy to walk to most places. Staff was incredibly helpful and nice. For the price and the FREE parking I am very happy with our stay. We had a king deluxe room which was very clean and spacious. It was nice having the mini fridge, living area, and two tvs. There are two negatives for me. The bed was very hard (I checked to make sure it was actually a mattress. Also even with the air on full blast it was quite hot at times (outside temps were high 50s to low 60s). The concierge was very helpful, front desk was courteous, parking attendants were so friendly. This is one of the best staffs I have encountered!
