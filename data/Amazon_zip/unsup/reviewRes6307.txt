Visited: 4/2/2011 I came here for a double-date at my friend's suggestion and left quite pleased. We arrived for an early dinner around 5:00 p.m. and were seated promptly, right before the place started to get busy. It's a tapas-esque restaurant, so the meals are naturally long and the patron throughput slow. This is admittedly a little fancier of a restaurant than I usually frequent - I'm very much a steak and potatoes man - but our server was extremely helpful with all the questions we had. The four of us split a bottle of red wine and shared orders of ricotta with honey comb, bruschetta, seared hearts of palm in lemon and pork belly with apple mostarda. For the main course I had a rigatoni and sausage plate and my girlfriend had a basil and mozzarella pizza. Everything was delicious and fresh and aside from the cost - close to $160 with tax and tip for the four of us - I have no complaints. The portions are small, but the taste is big.
