Alliance Bakery confuses me. Its exterior is old school while the goods and fancy cakes are modern and cool. Is it a hipster bakery run by hipsters? Seriously, I walked in here for my first Wicker Park Stitch and Bitch and didn't know what to make of the place. The delicious treats are classic while the staff is throughly hipster. I got the usual hipster glare as I walked in. Thanks for staring me down in your ugly, oversize ironic glasses and flannel t-shirt. After reviewing the cases, I chose a key lime bar for my treat and a chai tea as beverage. The key lime bar was alright, frankly nothing special and memorable. It was almost too sweet and too tart. I knit at the adjacent cafe space which felt hipster-ish. It had a lot of old furniture trying to give off that cool, ironic vibe with very non hipster artwork lining the walls. The cafe's decor and space confused me just as much as the bakery. Alliance as a bakery is alright. I'm not sure if it's a classic bakery with tasty goods or if it's trying way too hard to be cool like the other bakeries in Chicago.
