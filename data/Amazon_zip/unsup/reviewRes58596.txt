This place has it all..... awesome beer list selection, unique drafts on tap, family friendly, nice decor, great prices!!! This is my new go to place for burgers and beer when guests in from out-of-town, I want to take my mom to lunch or just grab a late night burger and beer. Pretzel roll bun is a must, they cook the burger perfect, when you say rare, it is still rare and pink on the inside. Warm goat cheese great starter or the cheese curds! Burgers I suggest, the Texan with onion rings the size of your head on top of pulled pork and the burger in under there somewhere with the Texas toast!!! If they have the lamb meat burger (its a special usually) order that, melts in your mouth! This is a great place, try it out!!
