I was going to give Frontera Grill three stars but opted to go with the Yelp "Meh. I've experienced better" because I actually used the term "Meh" before I was able to Yelp it....anyhoo.... I'm a big fan of Seven on State for weekday lunches and have always skipped the Frontera Grill stand so that I could experience the real deal first. Meh. Silly gripe: too many chips and not enough salsa. I'd love to comment on the flavor of the salsa but whilst sharing the teeeeeeny tiiiiiiiiny bowls with a friend, there just wasn't enough to get a good heaping chipful and really taste them. Meh. (Oh, and speaking of tiny bowls, the bar mix on the table? Seriously? Only a child's fingers could navigate that without making a mess. I felt like Gulliver.) The tacos I ordered were fine but it was all forgettable. I've had better tacos for less than $15. Much much less. Meh. Long and short - I'd just go to the Seven on State Frontera Grill if I want "classier" Mexican without the markup. Meh.
