I split my time between Chicago and Phoenix for work and no matter what part of town my meetings are in, I stay at The Westin Michigan Ave. The location is ideal for walking to shops, restaurants and bars. The staff is always overly friendly and really helpful. I always ask for an upgrade upon check in and get one about 75% of the time!!
