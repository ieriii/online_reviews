My Boyfriend and I came here last weekend for the 4th of July events held in Chicago. Our stay was average, despite reading the reviews, it was not that bad, we were only there to sleep and rest. They're were strikers outside but that didnt change my mind. I had a "do not disturb" tag outside our room and someone knocked on the door at 130 am on a saturday night, they asked if we needed new blankets.. I thought that was rude. Other than that. everything good. The hauntings.. The closet door slighlty openedmoments after I closed it. The phone rang once at 8 in the morning which woke us up. It was weird but it didnt scare me. Other reviews said, the elevators took long. It didnt for me.It had a 13th floor, thats weird.
