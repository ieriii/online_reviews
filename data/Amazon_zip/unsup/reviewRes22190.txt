CASH ONLY. Same Superdawg tradition and quality as the original. Superior Chicago style dog, albeit not the absolute traditional for purists. Please dont ask for ketchup! (or at least just put it on yourself when no one is looking, it will be on your window tray for the fries!) Shakes are good, but I have to say Meatheads in Glenview has the best shake in Chicagoland. Still, food here is solid, albeit a little pricey if you want a good Chicago Drive in experience. YAY for the characters on the roof at location number 2, makes me feel like I am at an overhauled shiny version of the original.
