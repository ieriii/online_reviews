We've been to this restaurant twice now. The atmosphere is crowded, colorful and noisy which is perfect. Our first experience was quite good and we very impressed. The Guacamole was wonderful as well as the refried beans. The Pollo Ranchero is half a chicken and very tender and juicy. The homemade chips are crisp and nice. The guacamole disapointed on our second trip, but our entrees were excellent. This is a family friendly atmosphere with authentic Mexican food in the heart of Pilsen. We definitely recommend it, especially because of the price, free parking and BYOB!
