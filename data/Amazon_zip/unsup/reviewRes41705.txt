How I love Tank. Whenever my parents come into town we always have to make a stop and get some of their great pho. Ive had the number 86 i think. The rice noodles with seasoned beef along with a sweet tangy sauce is my new all time favorite. Their pho is good but Ive had better. But if ever I need to fill my noodle craving Tank is the place. Also their prices are beyond reasonable for their serving. Summer rolls are yummy!!!
