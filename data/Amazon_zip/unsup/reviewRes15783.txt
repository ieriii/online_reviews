I asked her, "Wait, where you going?" Being stumped by the lack of any formal exterior besides a somewhat greyish-blue door handle, I grabbed her hand and strolled on into an underworld of some swank cartoon. Violet Hour reminds me of Pep Le Pew. The type of place most agree is laden with a scent of pretentiousness and an aggressive odor that says "I'm trying too hard." Poor little skunk. It just wants to be loved. Despite the turnoffs, this violet holds true to form - it has an elusive fragrance you can't seem to get enough of because they do some important things very, very well. Cocktails are expensive so prep for dropping $10-20 on your poison of choice. Though the price is high, you'll probably see why after a few sips. No watered down booze here. They come nice and solid. Most good things are in this life--furniture, biceps, butts, vehicles, hearts, and then there's . . .you get the point. The ambiance and intimate space gives you and your better half a place to coexist while still feeling part of the apparent secret society thanks to the arrangement and open style of the seating apparatuses (so-called "Wonderland chairs") which give it this back-and-forth play. Two things done very well at the cost of high prices and waiting lines. I encountered an attentive and talkative waitress so the reviews of snobby service won't be coming from these lips. If you'll drop some cash and take someone who's company you adore, Violet Hour won't be so vaudevillian and standoffish. In fact, you'll probably feel a romantic attachment to the place. I know I did. That or the booze was just that damn good.
