You take your health into your hands by eating here. I have found bugs in my food 2 of the 3 times I have eaten here (my 2nd and 3rd visit - just felt it was a fluke to have it happen the first and thought I would give it another try) On the 3rd visit, aside from bug noodles, I was sitting where I could see into the kitchen through the swinging doors and saw a rodent running across the floor. They like to post a sign that states "CLOSED FOR VACATION" everytime the health department closes them down. Good luck if you go here.
