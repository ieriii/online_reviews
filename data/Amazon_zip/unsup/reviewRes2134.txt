Whats not to love about a great hot dog? I have only been once, but I left wanting to go back again! I went with a friend and we wanted to try a couple, so ended up getting 3 to share. We ended up choosing the foie gras dog, the Chicago style dog, and a special they had, tomato basil. All were absolutely wonderful! The fries were standard, I really would love to try the duck fat fries, but those are only available on Fridays and Saturdays. Fun and affordable experience overall!
