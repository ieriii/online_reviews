I normally do not bother writing reviews for places with 500+ reviews, what value could I possibly add? However, this place is very exceptional and worth reviewing. Lao Sze is fairly casual inside, with a combination of 4 seat tables (did not appear to be two people options) and larger banquet style tables. Paper table cloths, wooden take-out style chopsticks and with a Chinese version of Kylie Minogue pop playing in the background. The place gets really hectic so I would recommend booking or getting in early. Crowd is very mixed with a large number of 20-30 year old Chinese, some older couples and larger tables featuring groups of friends. Probably not the best place for a date. There is a sense of urgency in this place and no time to linger. For the food. Yup, we can confirm no Peking duck with hoisin, it is a Szechuan restaurant and that is why we were here. The menu is a little out of control and daunting. We ran with the dried chili chicken in the chefs specialties which was super hot and had great warmth (could not get through all the dried chili). Along with crispy eggplant with ground pork (it has 1 chili rating) and it was nice to get some contrast and relief from the chili and hot spice onslaught - quite delicious, though do not expect much pork. The dishes were served with some house chilled cabbage and chili which was also has a really nice strong spicy flavor. Service really good, fast, friendly and our Chinese waiter had some great banter with our English/Chinese translations. My tips: take plenty of tissues and be prepared for a couple of extra beers to wash away the spice.
