i say goddamn! when it comes to sushi rolls, indie does 'em all the best. philly, dragon, spider, etc., etc., etc. yum, yum, yum. i have a hard time not getting sushi when we go here. but i love it when my friends order thai cuz then i get to sample it. :) and lo and behold, indie makes my favorite sushi AND my favorite thai. in all the land. just a few days after our delightful, relaxed, family-style nye dinner (which included an abundance of appetizers, wine, sushi, thai, AND desserts, all for the low-low price of $35 pp), i was having some serious cravings. give me an exact repeat of that entire meal, please. i can now add the following to the list of the best things i have ever eaten: chicken satay basil chicken drunken noodles panang curry dragon ball z dessert (battered & fried ball of green tea ice cream with raspberry stuff drizzled on top) and of course we had the usual crab rangoon and variety of sushi rolls, which were as succulent as ever. swoon.
