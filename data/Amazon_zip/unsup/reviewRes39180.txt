3.5. Someone spent a lot of time thinking through this place. Both the drinks and the food are interesting and compelling. Decor is very cool but a little cramped. Reminds me of a place where Indiana Jones would go to eat. If we were not trying to make a movie, I could see myself wanting to stay there for many hours. I find it very pricey, the drinks in particular. Even the taste portions of the whiskey were around 5-10 and up. Not cool. I recognize they are nicely aged/quality product but I felt less than generous in their pricing. The food is rich and tasty gastropub fare. Our french fries were overly salty and we have salty palates. The cheeseburger was exactly what I hoped except the cheese was just too heavy/rich and drowned out the flavor of the meat a bit. I still ate the entire burger as well as the remainder of my wife's food. Our server was nice but slightly clueless. Guessing it was her first week.
