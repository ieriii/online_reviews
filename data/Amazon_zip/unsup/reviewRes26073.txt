This is the only deep dish in Chicago I crave and here's why. 1) It's unique, no more throwing away the crust I guarantee you! 2) They deliver, and if you go to their establishment wait times (to get a table and to get your pizza are not ridiculous as the other more well known deep dish pizza places. 3) Their sauce. To me that is 2nd in importance to the crust, and Pequods has a zesty, slightly sweet sauce that is much more memorable than the other more well known deep dish pizza places.  4) Their toppings are fresh and of high quality, no generic sausage and fresh veggies etc. 5) Not so overpowering that you feel like you can't move around after you have a few slices. Doesnt weigh a ton like the other places.
