I went here for a birthday few days ago, and I thought it was nice. What really bothered me was the pretensious staff. I know it's a part- French restaurant in the Near-North side, but do they have to act like how French restaurants are on the silver screen? I was a litte early and waited by the bar, but the maitre d' started to ask me 20 questions, and I walked out and waited outside. I went back in to use the men's room and he started up again with his rude inquiries: "What party"....Me: "Sir, as I said before, they haven't arrived...." They arrived, and then he became nice. The place is nice, albeit on the dark side, and the slow-tempo lounge techno whatever-it-was was far to loud to hold a conversation. We all agreed we were in competition with everyone else in there. The food looked and tasted good, but it I feel this place can't be part-haute cuisine, part-club at the same time. Either they crank up the music and kill the gourmet, or do the opposite.
