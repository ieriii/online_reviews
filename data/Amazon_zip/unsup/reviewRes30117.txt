I went to a special event here about 2 weeks ago, and I gotta say, it's a great place to be!. the hor'deurves were plentiful and feeling, hell I had already had dinner there!. The women were very sociable, so guys, if you out looking to meet women, you'll want to be here, while sipping on some great cocktails.
