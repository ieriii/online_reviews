Total Rip-off. Spent $70 w/tip on brunch (no booze) for two adults and two kids. Must have been a problem in the kitchen because tables that were seated 30 minutes after us were served before us. Half of our food was cold. My skillet was literally eight bites of food for $12 dollars. Less than a1/4 cup of potatoes and chorizo under two eggs. A tiny omelet with a pancake and a soggy bit of lettuce salad on the side was $15 dollars (my eleven year old was still hungry after eating it..and she is a small girl). The waitress asked if we wanted a pancake instead of toast for a couple of bucks more. Since when is a couple of bucks 3 dollars? Couple means 2 where I'm from. Got the heel of a piece of banana bread for 4 bucks.Got to the car and saw that a server had spilled maple syrup all over my daughter's jacket. Never again.
