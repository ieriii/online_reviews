Spicy food and I are best friends and I especially love Szechuwan cuisine having had the true thing in China. This is as close as it gets in Chicago but I can't give it all five starts because its not as authentic given it has to appeal to an American audience. The Ma Po Tofu is a revelation as is the little treasures chicken and I dream about the white pepper in everything. This is a solid bet when you want a little zing in your life. Don't expect good service or decor, just great food.
