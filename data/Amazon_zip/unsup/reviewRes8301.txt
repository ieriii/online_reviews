brazillian steakhouse. endless yumminesss. their salad bar is amazing. try the brazillian soda + Caipirinha. the side dishes alone are to die for. i love the sweet plantans and the bread. even their tiramisu was perfection. the service was phenomenal. i dont think i've ever been served so royally before. after you come here- service everywhere else sucks. a bit on the higher end of dining- but totally worth it. indulge yourself. now :) if dinner is too expensive- go for lunch, its a lil pocket friendlier. my girlfriend and i just discovered that there is a location in beverly hills, cali, and we are dying to try it out to see if it cant match up to this one.
