Popped over here a week ago for a bite to eat on route from Meze (could not dine here as a event was going on). Fortunately the Meze valet clued us in that reservations are needed and he called in for us (last minute) to get a table. Service was very good, however, quite slow. Despite the lag in time from when our ordered was received the quality of food was quite good as well the friendliness of the staff. Yes def try this spot, but its not a place to eat and run, its a hang out to sit and chat, cocktail and linger.
