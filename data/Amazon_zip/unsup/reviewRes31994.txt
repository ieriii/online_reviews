I've been here three or four times and have enjoyed every meal. Several times the restaurant was super-busy and the servers were having a hard time keeping up with the orders, but it wasn't slow enough to make for a bad dining experience. I've ordered the vegetarian messob platter several times, which is a sampler of six veggie items that are served communal style with injera bread. We basically chose our six things from the menu at random, and everything was great--very flavorful, and each of the dishes had its own unique taste. The platter that is meant for two people was plenty for four, so I think it's a great value for the price. This place is great for vegetarians (and from the menu, it appears that it's great for meat-eaters as well, though I wouldn't know). Be warned that you shouldn't go here if it's busy and you're in a hurry. Oh, and one last important thing! The waiter told us that injera bread is a great stomach-insulator and hangover-preventer before a heavy night of drinking. Just sayin'.
