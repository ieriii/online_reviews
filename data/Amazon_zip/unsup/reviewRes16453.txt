There are two types of people when it comes to this place, those that will LOVE it and those who will never return. I LOVE IT. The only bar I've been to that has strick rules, which is actually a very laughable list describing those who will never return. To go here, you go for an experience, not just a drink. The mood is unlike any bar in the area, dark, mysterious, romantic. It's playful with the music, the large curtains and beautiful marble bar. The highback chairs in front block your view of anyone fully, just legs, occasional arms and glances are seen. The back's open lounge has a similar feel despite the difference in layout. Here, candles provide the only light and break up the arrangement of patrons. The drinks are works of art. They are complex concoctions, broken up by choice of liquor. Each spirit has around 5-7 drinks, which change due to the seasons. The presentation is beautiful in color, flavor, sent, and performance (orange zest flames to create a perfume for the first sip). I've been going here since it first opened and it wasn't too hard to get in, now it's a little more difficult. The line can get long, people find their ways in, and tourists occasionally go to complain. Once in, you forget all that, and start to have a unique night out.
