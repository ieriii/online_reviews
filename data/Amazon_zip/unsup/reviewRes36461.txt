I'm pretty sure this where I had a quick breakfast on my way out of Chicago off Halsted...  We had two slices of Spinach Pie and some crazy good Baked Custard dessert surrounded with flaky Phyllo dough, topped with caramelized honey, and powdered sugar.... We shared the dessert, and it's a good thing because it was SO decadent!!!
