I have eaten here twice...in one week. I'm not Cuban and I'm not from Miami so I can't vouch for the authenticity of the food, but I can tell you the food at 90 miles is delicious! I definitely recommend the Guajirito- a little messy with the steak on the plantains, but who cares? It's sooo good. I also enjoyed the ropa vieja as well, and sampled my husband's Lechon sandwich which is roasted pork. The sandwiches are a generous size, but if you go for a side try the yuca frita or tostones instead of regular old fries. You won't be disappointed. And all the sandwiches are under 7 bucks- what a bargain!
