My husband dragged me to this place and I did not want to go. I had been there years ago and remembered the carpet and the old school atmosphere, not my thing. But, they got rid of the carpet and it seems less oppressive now...still very very old school but this time it was actually kind of ok, like that is just their theme. I ordered the broiled snapper and it was hands down the best fish I had ever had. I could not believe how good it was. I am now a fan of this little old fashioned place and I am normally a trendy place person. The service is old-school friendly and I even liked the wine. So I am now a convert.
