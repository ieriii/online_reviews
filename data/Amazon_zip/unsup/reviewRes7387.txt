I have come to Sapori several times now. Usually, it is on Monday night, overstuffing myself at Sapori before going to a neighboring bar to watch Monday Night Football. They have a gluttonous food special on Mondays. For they bring you a sushi like check list where you get to check off 2 appetizers (something with cheese, please), 2 soups, 3 entres (something stuffed, something savory, and something creamy please) and a dessert. All of this tasty goodness for just over $20 bucks.  The cuisine here at Sapori is solid, Italian-American fare. Their food is good, simple and unpretentious. Their service is good and very welcoming. As an extra bonus, they have a very nice outdoor seating.  In all honesty, I am a little overly harsh in critiquing Italian restaurants. As I find Italian food very easy, albeit very time consuming, to cook. As a result, an Italian restaurant needs to either make better food than I can at home, or have great atmosphere/service. I think Sapori's is as good as I can make at home or better and the welcoming service makes this place worth coming to. I would say never do this for 99% for restaurants out there, but sign up for their mailing list. The discounts they mail you are actually worth receiving (like 25% off your entire meal or even free meals.) Also, the chef here does a good job of making the emails seem personal and not mass marketing, (even though they are clearly mass mailing.)
