There's a good reason why Tru consistently rates as one of the top restaurants in Chicago and has for years. My wife and I ate here for our first anniversary. And the experience was amazing, even if a little bit jarring (we had spent the summer working in underserved communities but were given a large gift certificate for Tru... so decided to go). Food: The subtlety of the flavors was wonderful. We went with a tasting, which started with an octopus carpaccio. Understandably, for my Midwestern wife, this was a bit unusual. But she ate and enjoyed it. The caviar staircase offered some very tasty experiences. And the food overall was just top notch - as were the desert options from the desert cart they bring around. Their presentation was dramatic yet elegant and simple. I think you can see that from the pictures that have been uploaded here. We were very impressed with the colors used in each dish. Service: Probably the thing that stands out even more than the food was the service. We were treated like royalty... even to the point of it being a little disconcerting. We had brought a camera... and they had a special pillow for cameras. When my wife told me she had to use the restroom and she had looked up and put her napkin down, the waiter was right there and pulled the table out for her and told her where to go. (Creepy? Maybe. But amazingly attentive).  Ambiance: The dining environment wad unexpectedly bright. Coming into the entrance, it was dark and dim. But once into the dining area, the room was bright, with lots of glass or crystal. It felt clean and light. Perhaps that is part of the experience... stepping into a bright area after entering though a darker lobby. Summary: Overall we had an amazing experience here. It is out of our natural price range. But because of the gift we received to come here, we were able to enjoy it thoroughly. If we had expendable income, we would go back, no question.
