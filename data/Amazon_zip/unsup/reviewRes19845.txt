I can't really say much else that hasn't been said. This place exceeded my expectations. The "Pepito" braised short rib torta was simple yet phenomenal. The seafood caldo was nothing short of knee buckling. The churros con "Extra" chocolate were better than what i've had in Spain. To top it off, Rick made our sandwiches, himself! I can't wait to sneak down here in the dead of winter on Wednesday night and have another phenomenal meal.
