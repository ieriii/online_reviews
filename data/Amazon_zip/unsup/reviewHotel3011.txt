3 separate stays here. I am a fan! Check in: I actually am a fan of the subtle vanilla/botanical scent that welcomes you when you walk into a starwood hotel. The staff are friendly and they do recognize the fact that you have stayed with them before. They always have room rates which includes valet parking ($53/night with in/out privileges) and 2 free drinks at the lobby bar (and it's not just well drinks. They do include top shelf). Room: Very clean. There is a day-bed looking furniture for lounging. The desk area isn't my favorite as it's not quite functional.. but if I was travelling for pleasure, it wouldn't matter much to me. They do offer 500 SPG points for foregoing daily cleaning service. Internet costs $. Also- there is an open panel between the bedroom and the bathroom. You can get your privacy by closing the wooden shutters. It's visual proof, but not soundproof. If you're there with someone you're not too comfortable with, you might want to look for another hotel. Business center: it's called "wired"... It costs $$ just to sign onto a computer. Printing service also costs $$... Not ideal... Lobby bar: staff is okay. About $14 for johnnie walker black, plus $2 for ice! I find it ridiculous... but thanks to my free drink vouchers, I only had to pay gratuity. Lobby restaurant: Limited menu with small plates. Scallops are EXCELLENT! a little salty, but wonderful... And the truffle fries are to die for. Coffee: there is a small coffee station in the lobby every morning. Nothing too spectacular... But there is a starbucks a block away from the hotel. Call down to valet to get the car, walk down to get coffee and you'll be good to go by the time you get back.
