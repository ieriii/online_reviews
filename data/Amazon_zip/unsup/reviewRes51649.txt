For my 60th review, I thought I would review the restaurant where I spent my first Valentine's date...and many evenings thereafter. Garcia's has awesome margaritas and burritos, but my favorite thing there is there nachos. Each chip is carefully ornamented with individual toppings, and you can tell the freshness by how crisp the chips still are. Mmm! I haven't gotten too adventurous with Garcia's because I am stuck in the burrito/nacho rut, but I know my Valentine's date got the chimichanga and ordered it for weeks afterwards, so that must be tasty too (even though it looks intense). These burritos are large, so go hungry!
