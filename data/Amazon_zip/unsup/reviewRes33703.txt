The wait is long. The place is loud. The food is nothing special (ie. nothing to return for in the future), even though the menu has a lot of variety and the dishes sound delicious. Our waiter was inattentive, did his best to ignore us and made it seem like anything he did (such as bring us the check long after our plates and mugs were cleared) was a huge favor. I have not met a more disinterested person serving food than this guy. If you do go to Yolk, I hope you won't be served by this guy.
