I wanted to hate it, because it's a chain. I wanted to hate it because there are a hundred things on the menu and I always think that means that you are doing nothing particularly well. However, the quality of the food was fantastic, the ingredients were fresh and everything everyone had at our table was delicious. It ain't exotic, it ain't gourmet, but damn, it's yummy.
