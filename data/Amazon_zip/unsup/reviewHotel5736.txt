The place looks good... but you don't get much for its 5 star price. If you are an easy spender, most likely you won't read this site. This is for the frugal travelers. Been to a few Crowne Plazas over the west coast. There are big space here for conferences. Good for them. But you won't get much here comparing to other Crowne Plaza. No pool and no gym. No mircowave or fridge in the whole building. If you want to heat up your food, you may pay a fee to the independent restaurant in the hotel. There is complimentary gym pass with very vague description even when I ask. I will let you experience this yourself to decide if it's worth the hassle and attitude. So travelers, if it is not for a conference, I won't stay here. There are better hotel out there for the price with more free amenities.
