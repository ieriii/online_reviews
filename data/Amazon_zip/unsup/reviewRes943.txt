Not sure why this place has so much hype & such a long line. It's good, but it's also just a hotdog...i didn't think it tasted any more spectacular than any other specialized hot dog joint. Not worth standing in line for 30-45 minutes (random Monday). Ordered 2 hotdogs for myself (1 special & 1 regular chicago-style dog): 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ($9): 2 stars. This sounded good...so good that almost the entire group ordered this as one of the two dogs to eat. I was not a fan, & neither was the rest of my group. It was way too rich (& I normally like rich). But I felt like it wasn't that flavorful..just creamy, fatty, & slightly bland. 2) Chicago-Style Hot Dog ($2): 4 stars. I liked this $2 dog better than my $9 special dog. I had it with "everything" topping & dog deep fried & grilled. "Simple", yet flavorful & tasty...can't really go wrong w/ your typical dog. 3) Had a bite of my friend's rattlesnake dog (daily special)...ok this "dog" was AMAZING (5 stars for this one). It was topped with dried fried onions & was bursting w/ flavor. I couldn't tell it was rattlesnake over any other meat, b/c it tasted just like any other hot dog, but it was the toppings and sauces that made the delish flavor. ORDER this if it's available. Sides: Unfortunately, no duck-fat fries on week days. We ordered an order of regular fries to share. They were good, but nothing special. Just your typical thick-cut steak fries.
