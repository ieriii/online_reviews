I wish I could say the food was good. I wish I could say the food was bad.  But I can't really say anything about the food because I didn't get to eat it... We were having a get together of about 40+ people (less adults than kids) and needed somewhere to all have dinner. My friend reserved a party room here, and it was going to be all you can eat for $16 per person. Kinda steep, but that's fine. But when some of the people couldn't make it, they said that they would need to charge the rest of us adults (16 of us) more money to make up the difference. Um, how about no.  So they lost hundreds of dollars to save a few bucks because we went elsewhere. Nice choice, Gino's...
