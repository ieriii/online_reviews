food was delicious, from the appetizers (brussels sprout salad) to the entrees (chilean sea bass, adobo pork belly) to the dessert (the Ridiculous). the flavors from each of the entrees works very well together, and they were reasonably large portions. the Ridiculous dessert was huge (two of us couldn't finish it), but it is definitely worth trying.
