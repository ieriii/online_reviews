Had reservations for 7:30 and informed the restaurant ahead of time that we were going to order the Peking Duck feast. Arrived and was seated promtly, ordered the fried scallops and Peking duck. Our fried scallops arrived within minutes and were breaded and small. I would do without appetizers or just stick to egg rolls. After watching the six top table next to us depart and see another six top reseated and then receive their orders, including the Peking Duck feast, ahead of our table, I knew there was a service issue. I stopped the woman who had taken our orders and asked when we would be served. She told us she forgot to put our order in, gave us the slightest apology, and disappeared. This is after almost an hour of waiting around watching others get served. The Peking duck itself, is decent, but somewhat greasy, the rice is fine, but the soup probably needs more time to simmer and might be better hotter. All in all, this establishment did not make any attempt or offer anything to us for there lack of service. I felt duped and ripped off and that they are only concerned with profit and not the dining experience.
