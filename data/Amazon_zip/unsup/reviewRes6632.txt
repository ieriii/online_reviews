Q looks fancy from the outside so I was pleasantly surprised when the inside was open and more relaxed- a large photo of a country road was hanging near our table, very fitting. The food is very good- you get hearty portions at a fair price. I enjoyed mixing and matching with the 3 different sauces. The brisket and pulled pork were my favorite. The chicken and baby back ribs weren't anything extraordinary. For dessert we had cobbler at that was awesome; definitely save room for dessert!
