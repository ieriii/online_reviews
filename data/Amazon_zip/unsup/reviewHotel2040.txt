Don't be dissuaded by the 'Holiday Inn' label - this is an upscale hotel (or upscale enough for most travelers' needs) with a mid-range price tag, with clean, comfortable, well-appointed rooms and free WiFi in a great location in Chicago's River North neighborhood. I help host an event (the Chicago(ish) Tweetup) twice a year and the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is our go-to hotel for a variety of reasons: The sales staff is wonderful and always happy and quick to accommodate us, and they even work to find rooms at the group rate for last-minute travelers. The staff at the front desk and concierge are also friendly and willing to assist guests with their needs; I've yet to encounter a rude staff member in my five visits to this location. The rates are reasonable, and their block/AAA/Priority Club rates are often even better (call often to check on AAA rates, as they change from week to week, often going lower the closer to your arrival date). The location is fantastic, with views of the Chicago River and the city's lovely, gritty architecture, whether buildings or bridges. Thanks to the Brown Line Merchandise Mart El stop, it's possible to reach the hotel via public transportation from either major Chicago airport and avoid car rental and parking fees altogether, though check the hours for the Brown Line, as it does not run all night. The Cityscape Lounge is pricey and the service is on the slower side, but it's ideal for a cocktail hour kickoff and the bar food is pretty good. (The view from the lounge is incredible.) The lobby is comfortable and perfect for a larger gathering to congregate, with comfy couches/tuffets and outlets for charging smartphones/tablets. I realize there are higher-end and more affordable places to stay in a city of this size, but the price, service, cleanliness, and sweet location make this hotel the best-kept secret in Chicago.
