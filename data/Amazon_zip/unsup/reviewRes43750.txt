Tried going to Xoco w/ my friend on a Monday = fail. But then we remembered that this place is pretty close by and there was a winter specials thing going on - 3 courses/$20. I got the chophouse salad, salmon, and rum cheesecake. My friend got the Caesar salad, beef tenderloins and the chocolate cake. I thought her entre was the better of the two as the meat was juicy and tender (though the mustard sauce for the salmon was not bad) and the cheesecake was the best part of the meal (you must get it if you come.. I thought it was much better than the chocolate cake, which the waiter recommended..) As my friend and I were eating our salads, the hostess came over and asked, "Are your salads tasting alright?" with a concerned look on her face. At first I thought there was an issue with it, but then I realized that she was just being overly friendly. And then the same thing happened with our entrees: "Is your food still tasting alright?" I like good service, but please phrase your questions in a better way! And don't stare at me from the front of the restaurant as I eat--I get self-conscious. However, her vigilance did cause her to notice as my friend was blotting at her scarf, and she quickly brought over some tonic water... so I guess that's good.. If I were to return, I'd want to come for happy hour -- I think it's like $3 apps or something...
