More of a 3.5 than a 3... I wanted to fall madly in love with this place, but most everything was just a bit above average. Started off with the Poutine. You can never go wrong with poutine. The gravy was excellent. It tasted like there was stout of some sort cooked into it to make it extra gravy-licious. And cheese curds never miss. For the main course, I ordered the Edmund Fig-Gerald, the boyfriend ordered the Slow Burn. He liked his burger better than I liked mine. My burger, though it sounded super promising on the menu, just tasted like charred meat. I ordered it cooked medium, and it was super, super charred on the outside, and the middle was completely pink. The boyfriend also ordered his medium, and he said it was way too raw. So the cooking of the meat was inconsistent at best.  The homemade ketchup is too fruity (yes, I know tomato is a fruit, but I don't want my ketchup reminding me of lumpy fruit snacks). We ordered the truffle oil fries, and they didn't taste like anything but fries. Meh.  The saving grace of the night was the Thai One On, the best drink ever. It is on the beer cocktail menu, and you will not be let down. I also got a Prickly Pear (or something similarly named), and that wasn't nearly as good. I'll be sticking to the Thai One On.  Service was above average, but it didn't knock our socks off. The waitress was nice and fairly prompt. The busboy/barback kept being interrupted all night by guys asking where the men's restroom was located. He handled it well, though. The boyfriend and I do want to try Bad Apple again. I'll hope that with a proper Thai One On buzz that the burgers taste as good as they sound on the menu.
