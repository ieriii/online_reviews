If you think you don't like grits, you are probably mistaken. Wishbone has amazing cheese grits- better than what I've had in Texas or Georgia. And much better than the sad, watery, bad-Cream-of-Wheat grits that causes most people to think they hate grits. I'd pick Wishbone's cheese grits over polenta any day. Yummers. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge brunch enthusiast. In fact, I say the phrase, "Brunch food can only get so good," often enough that my friends probably are on the verge of never inviting me for brunch again. And for the most part, I believe it; I believe that there is a ceiling to how good an omelet or French toast or an egg-bacon-home fries combo plate can possibly get. But Wishbone blows me away - I'd sooner have brunch there than dinner at most other restaurants. If you go on a day when they've got the special Brisket Hash, get it. Or the day when they have the spinach, avocado, and Swiss cheese omelet, get it. Everything I've ever tasted at that place has been swoon worthy, and for me, swooning pretty much never happens at brunch.  They've got the whole package-- funky, casual decor with lots of interesting things to look at, friendly servers in cool t-shirts, and good prices for insane portions. Make no mistake- this is brunch mecca, even for a non-believer.
