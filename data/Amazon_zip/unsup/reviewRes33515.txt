I have always tried falafels with the hope that I would like them (cause they're healthy and really fun to say =) )and sadly never have... until Sultan's market. In general, the falafels I've had have always been non-flavorful and really dry and crumbly. Sultan's were so moist and seasoned so well! I'm love my meat so I was skeptical that a little pita sandwich would fill me up so i ordered the lentil soup and a bread fattia thing and I was absolutely stuffed after my falafel and half the soup. The soup is delish, I've never been a fan of pureed soups that dont have chunks of veggies or meat in them, but the lentil soup was so tasty that you dont miss the texture. the bread thing was also good, though it was kind of hard and hard to chew (it was almost closing time so i'm assuming it was sitting out for awhile).  I will definitely try some of the other items off their menu sometime soon. Food- Great Service- very very friendly and helpful if you're a newbie to the restaurant price- cheap if you dont go overboard like I did ;) parking- may be a lil hard to find street parking unless you go on off hours, close to blue line though
