GO ON TUES OR THURSDAY, bottom line. it's half price margaritas on these days. the staff is extremely friendly, the food is actually really good and inexpensive, and the margaritas are not bad for the price. the margaritas are not fancy and if you know your tequila, i don't recommend them. however if you want a strong, powerful, and cheap margarita... go here on a tuesday or thursday! the burritos are great and so are the salads... in the summer they have a nice backdoor patio as well, i suggest going there. the winter time fills up on tuesday and thursday, just a warning. check this place out
