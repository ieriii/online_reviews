Walked in at 8:30 on a Wednesday. Couldn't believe how bustling it still was. That bodes well for the establishment, but with the choice of tables being either communal style or two-tops placed very close to one another, it was a louder than I would have preferred for a weekday dinner. Loved the Calamari (very different from what you would expect with a calamari appetizer) and the Pork Shoulder was out of this world! The Beets & Goat Cheese were good but didn't blow me away, and The Pigs Ears were a little lack-luster. The dishes that did impress did so greatly, and those that didn't still weren't anything to rag on.  I plan to be back to try several other menu items.
