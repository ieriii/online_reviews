As many other reviewers pointed out, this place is eerily similar to the Cheesecake Factory, both in atmosphere and quality/variety of food. All things considering, both places serve decent fare for a decent affordable price. Considering the location, Grand Lux is extremely affordable. However, I would classify Grand Lux as a tourist trap. What? how can it be a tourist trap if the food is decent and the prices are right? BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED SON! This place is basically a Cheesecake Factory under a different name. So ask yourself- why are you coming into the heart of Chicago, a city renown for its amazing food, and eating at the Cheesecake Factory?? That's the trap, and I think it's pretty sneaky to deprive tourists of great food more representative of Chicago. Go home and eat at your local Cheesecake Factory! Heck, I would recommend Portillo's over Grand Lux to tourists. I'm still giving this place 3 stars because it does serve decent food at decent prices. If you're from the area already and looking for a nice place to eat and don't mind being unimpressed with the food, Grand Lux is still a fabulouse choice.
