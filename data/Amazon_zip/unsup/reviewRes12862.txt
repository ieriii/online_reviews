This place is worth it especially if you sign up for their wedding anniversary and birthday deals. My husband and i went here for our wedding anniversary to get a buy one get one free meal! the two best things about this place: Cheap good wine and excellent service when we went there on a weekday. They offer wine specials by the bottle - great chilean and argentinean wines for $30! When a meat was served that wasn't cooked exactly to my liking, someone was always there to ask for a new cut of meat. their waiters are polite, helpful, and attentive. Other things: atmosphere is hip, and the food was pretty good. (i do think perhaps Fogo de chao has juicier cuts of meat with balanced flavor but I still had a very good overall experience here.
