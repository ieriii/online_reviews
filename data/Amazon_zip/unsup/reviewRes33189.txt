Does the thought of visiting Transylvania give you the warm and fuzzies all over? I'm thinking probably not. Personally, I think of the Gothic novel 'Dracula' by Bram Stoker. The chillingly mysterious Black Sea. Remote castles. And of course, fly-by-night vampires. But we're not visiting Transylvania, kids. We're going to Little Bucharest. A friend of mine threw a party here several weeks ago that included gypsy punk rock meets Eastern European brass outfit, Black Bear Combo. Did you know they painted the White House black on Halloween? Well, not literally, but with their sound. So of course I had to check out the event. Little Bucharest has this wonderfully accessible, old-world charm about it. Really, you feel like you're in this old maison in Europe, complete with thickly-accented servers and vintage styling. There's a wide selection of beer, wine and cocktails available but yet they're also BYO! Props for that. They transformed the dining room into a stage perfectly set for getting your Balkan dance on. Loud + unbridled fun, craziness, laughter, dancing... yes, we had it all that night. I also tried the food-- we shared a plate of sliced, cured meats and the warm crepes with strawberry sauce. Of course you'll find goulash, stuffed cabbage and the Romani's version of cevapcici (mititei) make the menu. Well-done and well-priced! Hopefully my friend throws another party here... yet again, do I really need an excuse to come back? Absolutely not! Shine on, Little Bucharest, you are a gem.
