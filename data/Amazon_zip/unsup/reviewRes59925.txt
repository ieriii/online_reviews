This is JUST an ordinary bakery. A little bit overpricey for what they are doing. I have recently ordered a cake. Well, was very.... disappointed. Instead of exciting funny chemistry cake I saw a childish silly decorated round piece of "art" with all ugly colors on it that you can imagine in the world. To much frosting =(( yeaaak! , dry and NOT CHOCOLATE AT ALL! I will never order something from this place again and will not recommend it to anyone. Avoid at any cost! Try to experience something else and save money, time and nerves! :((
