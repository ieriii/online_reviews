Several hundred wonderful selections, many with pictures. Communal round tables with every condiment you could ask for. Our Pork Egg Rolls were delicious (so was the accompanying sweet fish sauce), the #40 Noodle Soup with Beef was good quality and super cheap, and the #190 Spicy Chicken was fresh, consistent, and the vegetables were like they were straight from the market. Quick service, water glass stayed full. The place was packed. We'll be back. I can't wait to try some of the more "exotic" specials.
