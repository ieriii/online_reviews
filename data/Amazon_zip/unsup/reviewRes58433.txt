Loved this place. Always friendly service with great food.Went to meet friends for the all you can eat crab night. Doctors appt. went long and I arrived late. I was told I would not be allowed to order anything because of their strict reservation policy. With anything I said all they would say is we can't. Not to play the pity card but as someone who has been in the service industry for 20 years if I was talking to someone in a cast boot with IV tubes coming out of their arm with an obvious pump hooked up to them I might let them order a salad.There is a big difference between we can't and we won't
