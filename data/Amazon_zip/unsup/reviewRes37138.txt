fox and obel is like any other specialty food store. the stuff that's hard to find anywhere else is definitely worth getting and the stuff that fits in with their aesthetic but can easily be found anywhere else is highly overpriced. it's a business model that makes sense, but disappoints me. i picked up lavender white chocolate toffee, a bottle of soda, gelato, gnocchi, a bag of chips, duck rillettes, and a liver mousse. this small bounty came to just over fifty dollars. with my groupon, i was more than happy to make the purchase. but i don't think i'd come here for my regular groceries. the produce selection was paltry and just not that good-looking in general. and bulk foods and dry goods were also not terribly reasonably priced, though the selection looked very tasty. i'd probably come back to get the pates (both d'artagnan) again and maybe try another weird soda or something from the bakery, but with how inconvenient it is from my house (and also what a nightmare parking in this area is), it'll probably be a while.
