Came here for a quick, cheap lunch and left satisfied. I ordered a pork sandwich, which came out close enough to my absolute favorite place for Vietnamese sandwiches in my hometown. The boyfriend, however, went out on a limb (sort of), and got something really cool that I'm just impressed Tank serves. It was like a make-your-own Vietnamese spring roll. You get these thin, plastic-like sheets of spring roll skins, and when you dip them in hot water, they soften. He had a plate of meat and assorted fresh herbs and veggies to wrap. I definitely stole more than my share of his dish, too. I don't think it cost too much, and is kind of a fun, healthy-feeling lunch item.
