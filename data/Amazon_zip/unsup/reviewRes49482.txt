I'm not a steak girl, so when my running group chose this restaurant for our monthly soire, I immediately visited their website to ensure they had some kind of seafood option. And they did. Phew. Crisis averted. I ended up ordering the combination with calamari and shrimp, with yuca, potato and fried plantain. It was absolutely delicious, all of it. I preferred the calamari, so I think if I come back here, I'd stick with that. OR, I just might order the skirt steak... Because, although I have an aversion to red meat, I can't help but try it whenever my friends order it. I'm always curious to see if I might like it someday. So I tried the skirt steak (their specialty), and it was actually really good! Nice and tender, medium rare, yummy yummy. It's also a bit thinner than a big ol' slab of meat, which may be another reason why it appealed to me. Anyway, it was delish, and I would recommend anyone who especially loves steak, try this. It is BYOB for wine only, so that really helps save some money in the end. It is a reasonably priced restaurant though. I paid $20 for my combination, as did everyone else, and I left sufficiently full and satisfied. I would definitely come back. The service was very friendly, they take reservations, not too far from my house, and also a great place for groups.
