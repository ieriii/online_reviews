I stayed here for 3 nights for a work conference, from Sunday to Wednesday. My room was quite nice. Large 42" plasma and welcome center terminal, although the room itself was a bit small. The gym and pool are on the 8th floor, and the first 3 floors are mostly conference rooms. This place was absolutely packed with conference attendees while I was there, since there were 3-4 other large ones. Entire hotel has 1500 rooms. Wifi is ridiculously expensive, but luckily our company covered it. Parking is also ridiculously expensive (about $50/night), so you're better off parking in one of the many garages nearby. Food during the conference was pretty good, as was service.
