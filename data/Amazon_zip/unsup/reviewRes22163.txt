First of all the location isn't prime. Weiner's Circle (and even Hot Doug's) are much more accessible than this place. Now that we have that out of the way... The exterior / theme of this place may be charming and all that jazz (which I'm sure is what draws in a lot more people than it would without the 'happening 50's aesthetic') but unfortunately the food doesn't hold a candle to the pleasing visuals of Superdawg Drive-In. The Superfries ain't so super.. in fact, when I got them, they were stuffed in a small box next to my hot dog (meaning relish was dripping all over them, etc.. not my ideal order of fries). The fries that weren't covered in relish were almost gummy... basically too "tough" to be considered fries.  My hot dog was okay except for the fact that there was one little wedge of GREEN tomato stuffed in the corner of the box (I'm assuming it was meant to be placed on top of my dog?) It was a wedge.. not even sliced how it should be to fit on top of a hot dog. And green? Are you kidding me? I confused the thing with a pickle for a split second. Weirdness. My boyfriend ordered a the Whooperburger or something.. with cheese. Basically a cheeseburger. He asked for them to put lettuce and tomato on it, or to put it on the side .... they said they didn't have any for burgers! Once again -- are you kidding me? They seemed to have enough tomato for the hot dogs.. couldn't they make a customer happy and spare some for a burger? Oh wait.. that's right.. they weren't cut in the right shape to begin with.. a tomato wedge just wouldn't have worked on a burger, now would it? And what kind of burger place doesn't have lettuce for their patron's burgers, etc.?  To top off my meal I had a chocolate malt. Decent I guess.. but I've had better at DQ and BK. Guess I won't be hitting up "SD" again anytime soon..
