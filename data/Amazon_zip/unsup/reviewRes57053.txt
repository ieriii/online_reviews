If you're pizza and beer lover, this is the place to go! They have an amazing thin crust pizza, you can have it red (with tomato sauce) or white (without tomato sauce) and, if you are a big believer in RED pizza ONLY, give the white one a try! You will not be disappointed! And, on top of it all, this place is very affordable! We were a group of 7 girlfriends, we ordered salad, 2 large pizzas, and a alcoholic drink each, and we paid $ 20 each (including tip and taxes). Pretty awesome (plus, couple of girlfriends got to take some leftover for their husbands). The only minus was that we had to wait for 45 minutes for a table, we wanted to make a reservation but I think they said we can only reserve for 10 + people. So, bottom line, good food, inexpensive, great beer selection and atmosphere.
