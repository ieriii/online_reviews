We picked a chicken dish, a lamb dish, and a vegetable. The chicken was overcooked, so was dry even in its sauce. The lamb was a disappointment because it was ground up, hard, dry, and slightly resembling an owl pellet. Maybe this was just a bad order on our part but we didn't enjoy it much. After a few bites of each we just found ourselves not wanting to eat the rest, which isn't typical of our past Indian food outings. We were seated right in front of the kitchen but it took 30 minutes to track down someone to let us pay -- we already had our go-to bag waiting. Overall the ambiance was nice, but the prices are outrageous at $17 per dish. This won't be our go-to place.
