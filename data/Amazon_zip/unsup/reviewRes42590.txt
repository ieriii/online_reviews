After listening to Dean Richards on WGN rave about this place for months, maybe years, we made a special trek to the big city to check it out.  The first disappointment - we blew right by the place (Old Dean failed to mention it is tiny little storefront in a tiny little strip mall off of a very busy street).  After a turn around - no small thing in the big city - we found a spot to park, pulled in and just looked at each other, kind of shocked that after all the marketing flap, this little joint was, well, the place we were to find pizza Nirvana.  We walked in like we were like two teenagers giddy over getting our first beer - (the moment just before you pop the bottle open - goofy with beer lust and feeling that you just pulled one over on the beer police - the moment just before you take a swig and realize - WHAT THE ??? it aint't all that!). Unsure of what to order, we asked the unkempt gent behind the counter what was fresh, both got slices of pepperoni... sat down, bit into them, looked at each other... and waited.... waited for the ... something...singing......bright lights......pizza bliss....... it never came. The pizza was good, it was deep dish, it was fresh. Just like at a bazillion other pizza joints in Chicago. I just don't get the hubub about this place. If you live in the neighborhood, it may be your favorite joint. If you are new to Chicago and pizza, you may feel it is the best you ever tasted. If you are new to pizza joints that sell by the slice, you may think this is a revelation.  I ain't buying any of it.  This is a decent, neighborhood pizza joint that is convenient if you live in that neighborhood or are visiting friends there. I give it that. It is just not worthy of traveling across the city to experience. Check out your own neighborhood - chances are you can find pizza just as good, closer to the crib.
