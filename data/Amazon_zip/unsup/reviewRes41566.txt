I called on Saturday morning to make reservation, was told that the place was booked till 8pm and I dont need reservation after 8:30pm. I make reservation for 8:30pm. We got there around 8:20pm, checkin and were told the wait was about 20 mins..... WE WAITED FOR ALMOST AN HOUR!! TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE The steak was very good and decor was nice -- I would expect that for the price we paid
