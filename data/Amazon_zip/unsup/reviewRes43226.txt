One of my first experiences eating Chicago Deep Dish was at Gino's East and it totally turned me off from eating deep dish. I gave deep dish another try with AoP and have to say I enjoyed it a lot more. I'm still not a fan of deep dish, but if for some reason I'm looking for deep dish, I would come here over Gino's and Giordano's. I just loved the buttery crust and how inexpensive it was.
