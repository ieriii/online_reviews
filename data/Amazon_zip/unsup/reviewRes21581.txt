I'm mad at myself for only going now, in my 23rd year. This Chicago landmark's reputation is well-deserved - the hot dogs are thick and smothered in toppings, the fries are perfectly cooked, and everything else tastes just like the 1950's (I assume), although relish on a hamburger is not to my taste. All of the greasy/sugary sides are worth every calorie. There are better Chicago-style hot dogs out there, but very few, and the classic drive-in feel (which isn't faked; according to Wikipedia, Superdawg is "one of the few original drive-in restaurants left in the United States") is worth the drive out to what feels like the middle of nowhere.
