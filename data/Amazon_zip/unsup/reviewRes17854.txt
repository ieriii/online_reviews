The goods: A beer menu that you will not believe, extremely creative food menu, very cool vibe, usually awesome funk and soul playing in the background, helpful and friendly waitstaff, did I mention the beer menu?!! The bads: none really, I was disappointed they didn't have a specific New Belgium beer that I wanted to try on there huge beer menu, but that's about it. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars? It's 280 miles from my house! The verdict: This place is awesome. I make a point to visit this joint everytime I'm in town. I wish there was a place in the Detroit area that came even close.
