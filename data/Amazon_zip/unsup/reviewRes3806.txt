I'm from L.A. and Korean fried chicken is very popular there. I heard of this place through my friends and decided to check it out. It beats the best places in L.A.! The sauce is what makes it the best. The food stayed good until I got home. The skin stayed crispy. Price was reasonable, in L.A. it would cost about $35 for one order and I had to wait an hour. The service was excellent! Talk to the owners! They were great!
