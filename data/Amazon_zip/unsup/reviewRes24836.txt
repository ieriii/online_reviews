For the record, I want to come back here. For the record, I want to go on a date here! I only came to Artopolis for dessert (see my Athena review as to why) and was pleased. I was with a group of friends and we all decided to get different desserts and rank them from best to worst. The winner was the pear tart, second place was the lemon tart (which I ordered, because it had a big "L" on it!), third place was the white chocolate mousse with raspberry glaze, fourth was (I think) the bread pudding, and fifth was the chocolate mousse. This was, by the way, an extremely difficult ranking to decide. Artopolis offers such a beautiful display of pastries, mini cakes, tarts, etc. that it's almost a shame to even pick one dessert over the other! They also have artopitas, sandwiches, soups and salads that sound enticing as well. I also love the layout of the place. It looks so inviting from the outside and the split level inside reminds me of an ice cream parlor I went to in San Diego.
