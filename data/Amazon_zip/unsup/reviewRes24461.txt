I love this place. Went last night with a group of friends and has a blase. First of all its so cute and romantic inside. There was a man playing music in the front and you could hear it all over the restaurant. Defiantly a plus. They also have complimentary coat check. The table ordered two bottles of the house Merlot which was a nice red that was pretty inexpensive. I ordered the steak, shrimp and scallops. Since it was my first time I was a tad bit nervous but it was a great meal. The starter salad is delicious and the perfect size. The cheese fondue was amazing as well. When we ran out of bread and fruit, our waiter brought out some more within seconds. The main meal was amazing as well. My only complaint was that I got 2 pieces of shrimp. Other than that everything was pretty reasonable. The dipping sauces add lots of flavors as well. The dessert fondue was amazing. And once again when we ran out of fruit and cake our waiter quickly brought us more. I cannot wait to come back to Geja's and just signed up for their mailing list.
