Had a party of 9 here the night before my wedding. A bit of a weird dinner as the parents were meeting each other for the first time...but never mind that. The first thing you notice is the enormous menu. Seafood, pasta, steaks, veal, you name it; Sabatino's has it. And not only that, most entrees come with soup, salad, AND a side of pasta. Quite the refreshing change from having to choose from one or the other!  I had the red snapper and it was cooked perfectly. The minestrone was fairly good, and the salad was...a salad. The side of mostaccoli was good too. I sampled a bit of other peoples' dishes, including my now-wife's veal with artichoke (outstanding) and my brother's enormous seafood pasta (very good). The minus one star was mostly for the waitress. While she was definitely knowledgeable and such and she managed a large party fairly well, her voice was a bit grating and something else just rubbed me the wrong way about her in general. If you like old-school italian food with gigantic portions, Sabatino's is hard to beat.
