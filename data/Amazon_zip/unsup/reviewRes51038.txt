The cheese grits are delicious. I have only been there for breakfast on a Friday and a Sunday morning. There are a lot of gluten free options since it is southern food-- beans or corn. The bean cakes are pretty good with mango salsa. Don't bother with the breakfast burrito. It is mediocre. My brother had the mango pancakes and LOVED them.
