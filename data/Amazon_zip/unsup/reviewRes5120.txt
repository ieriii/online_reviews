Purple Pig, I love you. No, really. This was one of the best meals I've had. I should also say, we stopped in during Restaurant Week hoping to get away with not dropping a ton. We ended up just going with the normal menu--totally reasonable! Win. My girlfriends and I trotted in on a rainy Sunday--packed, but luckily the wait was only a few minutes. The space is tiny, and they don't accept reservations. Aaaand they're running with that whole communal table trend. Not that I hate people, but the place settings were just too close. So close, in fact, the gentleman sitting next to me felt so near and dear to me that he picked up my iced tea bottle to observe and then order one of his own. Um, I'm all for social boundaries. 3 feet, please. Anyhow, our waitress helped us gauge just how much food to order--which of course, we ladies doubled--ha! To list the delectables, we got the seared tuna with lima beans, beets with whipped feta, eggplant smear, cucumber smear, salami panini, prosciutto balls and fried olives. Phew! Oh, and a selection of cheeses. Every single thing was mouthwatering, and the slices of bread were like pillows of heaven. But the best, best, best part? Fried brioche, of course! We have to give props to our awesome waitress for steering us to this bad boy. It's basically a giant donut filled with melted ricotta and chocolate sauce covered in powdered sugar. The sounds that were coming from our table were indecent. Ah-may-zing! I will definitely go back. In fact, the problem may be that I go bad too often...oh whelp!
