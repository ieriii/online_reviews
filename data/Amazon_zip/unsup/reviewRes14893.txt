A little surprised at the location of this place, we were taken aback by the full menu. Guessing our surprise, we were immediatly assisted with choosing the perfect lunch...and it was. Yum. Tiny little place that looks like it should have a drive up window, too cozy inside for my taste, but a cute outdoor area makes it tolerable. Too bad I can't enjoy my cuban in the winter time.
