Had a little business meeting in the lounge this morning. It's huge and a tad confusing as it was not attached to the bakery(seprate doors). Great coffee, a really good cranberry walnut bar, and free wifi. Had no idea it was this popular after seeing all the reviews. Will have to come back for more baked treats.
