When another reviewer wrote: "OMG have I died and went to skirt steak heaven" they were right on! Mind you I'm not a "meat" eater but that all changed when I stepped foot into this place. Everything was delicious! I highly recommend the Patacn Pisao (a plantain appetizer) and the Picada Colombiana plate, which serves 2. It has a combination of the most popular Colombian food: Entraa skirt steak, rib-eye steak, pork loin, and chicken breast all grilled, homemade chorizo, pork ribs, arepa, crunchy green plantain, fried sweet plantain, yuca and potato. Yummy! I can't wait to go back!
