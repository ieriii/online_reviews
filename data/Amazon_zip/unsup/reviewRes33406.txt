Best. Falafel. Ever. The lentil soup here is pretty good too. And everything is so cheap! Cash only. I usually frequent the smaller location on Clark, which accepts credit cards, so I didn't know. Luckily the girl at the register didn't mind when I had to leave for a second to grab $0.61 from my car so I could pay for my order.
