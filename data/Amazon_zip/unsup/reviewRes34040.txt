I've been going to Yolk for some time now, even before all the hype, and I've always been a fan. The decor is hip and fun and the atmosphere very cheery.  I'm personally a fan of the freshly squeezed strawberry-orange juice and the breakfast scrambler. The food is very good, not like those less than standard breakfast places (IHOP, Old Country Buffet, etc) which I personally despise. The wait staff is genuinely helpful and always receive big tips from me. Overall I am a huge fan of Yolk.
