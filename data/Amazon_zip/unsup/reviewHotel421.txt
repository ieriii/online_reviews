A group of us from Iowa stayed here for our Hawk Game @ Soldier Field (which was perfect) and had no idea what to expect. Being we were not familiar with Chicago and the price for the room was too good to be true (compared to most in the area). After reading some of the reviews we were a little nervous. We arrived hours before check in hoping to find parking which was very limited (due to the event) but we lucked out in the parking lot which thankfully was FREE!! Check in went great and the room was as expected. I am not sure why some of the reviews complained about that- you pay for what you get? If you want luxury and high class you pay for it right? I thought the staff was great...they helped us with directions and check out was super easy. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Again!  GO Hawks!
