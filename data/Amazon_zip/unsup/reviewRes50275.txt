Went here with a friend and loved it! The decor was simple yet cute and we sat by the window allowing for people watching and sunshine. First we had a drink at the bar, a very tasty bloody mary while we waited for our table. We had a very knowledgeable waiter who was friendly and offered descriptive suggestions about what to order. My friend had the shrimp and grits before but we figured we'd try something new. We split the andouille sausage and crayfish omelet with grits (delicious) and the ham eggs benedict.  Presentation was elegant and the portions perfect.  After the beignets there was no room for desert but I would go back there again next time I'm in the windy city! Bravo Big Jones for creating a New Orleans style dining experience at reasonable prices.
