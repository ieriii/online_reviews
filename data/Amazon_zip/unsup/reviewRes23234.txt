Icosium, I love you. But the crepe I had the other day was seriously and ridiculously sub par. The greens were soggy (as well as damp, wilted, tangled, and not good), the ingredients were not delicately layered so that each flavor was separate and delicious and there were raisins in a crepe that did not call for raisins. Since you are my favorite restaurant in Chicago, I will be assuming this was a fluke. But I'm severely disappointed.
