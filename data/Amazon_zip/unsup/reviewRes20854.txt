Yes I am going to go ahead and give Coast 5 stars. This was as they say AS Good As It Gets.... We walked in on a Friday evening and this place was packed,, that's always a good sign.. the cherry blossom trees on the wall and the modern decor very nice....The freshest fish in Chicago with mouth watering rolls. Can you say spicy they got 5 different kinds of spicy and yes we had to order them all each bite felt like a sinfully delicious treat.. and our waiter was so attentive never once had to do the "Ahem, excuse me"... I highly recommend this place it is also BYOB so bring a bottle of your choice preferably a white wine to compliment the fish and enjoy your experience..
