Brazzaz = meat galore! I've been to Brazzaz and the ritual was amazing! Texas de Brazil you should be ashamed of yourself! Their salad bar has a variety of pasta, fruits, etc. Our waiter was very nice and prompt. All the meats had so much flavor and soul, and the shrimps are to die for. I am pretty sure I stayed for about two days. I recommend this place for dinner for two or even a family (not with little kids).
