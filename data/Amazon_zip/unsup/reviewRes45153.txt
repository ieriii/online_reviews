In a word - amazing! I went on a romantic date and it couldn't have been better. We went on Friday night at 7:30 and the place was full but we made reservations so we had a table waiting. The seating is a bit crowded but we managed to get a table in the corner so it was very intimate and private. The food: we started with an amuse bouche. No explanation was given, it just appeared shortly after we sat down so I still have no idea what it was except that it was delicious, and a perfect preview of the great food to come. We started with the grilled octopus and the tuna bruschetta, both very good. The bruschetta had a great tartness to it and the bread was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. For an entree I had one of the pasta specials with homemade over-sized bowtie pasta and veal. After the two appetizers I just got the small portion which was the perfect amount. So good. My date had the orecchiette and lamb sausage which he said had the just the right amount of spice to it. The service: Our waiter was perfect. Equal parts charming, attentive and helpful without being overbearing or pushy. My date and I were so busy talking that we took awhile to order and did it in parts. Despite being quite busy, our server never rushed us or made us feel bad for lingering over our meal, and he was quick to bring us new cocktails while we were deciding. All in all, a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back.
