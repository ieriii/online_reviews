For some silly reason that I don't even know, I have never been to Cheesecake Factory. Want to, it's just never happened. So when a lunch buddy suggested Grand Luxe for lunch, I was all over it. The host stand on the ground level, then a second one on the second floor is a little confusing; maybe that's necessary when the place is busy. Decor is a busy art deco/turn of the century bordello, which I actually like a lot. If I could give stars for service alone, Yolanda would get all five stars. So pleasant and cheerful, attentive but not overbearing, and so knowledgeable. I do have to say that the menu is a little too long and the special required too much explanation. Not Yolanda's fault; she just had too much that she had to talk about. Now let's talk about food. There were other tables but the restaurant was not even half full, so the food came out a little slowly for a lunch shift. But was it delicious, and OMG the portion size! My friend had a delicious cedar plank salmon, beautifully presented with piped mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables that I couldn't wait to swipe off his plate. I had a ginormous Manhattan salad with tuna that was everything I love in a salad--a million different ingredients, flavors, colors and textures and just enough dressing so that you know it's there. Dessert--you're going to have to save space for that--was key lime pie and chocolate layer cake. This was real, proper key lime pie and you wouldn't even believe this thick, rich slab of chocolate heaven. Accept the proffered ice cream to contrast its denseness. I left with the remains of my salad and that wonderful cake--which took me THREE sittings to finish and told Yolanda, "Now I know my dinner will be fabulous too." And it was.
