Oh no, this place is dangerous. I just signed a lease on an apartment a few blocks from here and decided to drop in for lunch to check out the local fare. I am guessing I will be eating here at least four times a week for the first few months of my living in the village. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a plantain served on it.... DELICIOUS! Make sure to throw a little hot sauce on it, too. Whatever hot sauce they have in the unlabeled plastic bottles is perfection. My girlfriend had the steak sandwich and it was to die for, also. Definitely a must try! The only downside is that there is hardly any room at all. There are maybe a dozen bar stools, so either grab it and go or come in during a down time so you don't have to be cramped or wait to sit down.
