If you go here, you have to get the Chicago deep dish. You aren't really experiencing Giordano's if you get a hand tossed pizza here. Also, the spinach artichoke dip is incredible. One small pizza deep dish was enough for me and my sister after the spin dip. You gotta know you will have to wait probably an hour or more if you go there for dinner. If you are 21, you can knock a few back in the bar section while you wait for your table. It's also really close to the Chicago Conrad hotel. We just walked there and it took about 4 or 5 minutes.
