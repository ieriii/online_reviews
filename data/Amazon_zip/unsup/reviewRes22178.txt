HIYA!! I'm only adding my feedback because I can't believe Superdawg's total rating is not five stars! This place is a gem of our fair city. One of the last drive-in eateries there is. I frequently have dreams of juicy Superdawgs, lovingly caressed by a steamy poppy seed bun, nestled on a bed of crispy crinkle fries.  And have you ever had a Whoopskidawg???? Tell me about it! A little box of heaven (if heaven were high-cholesterol comfort food). To all of you that gave this gloriousness anything less than five stars, I ask you: what is wrong with you???
