Never had Ethiopian food before, so was looking forward to my first time. I have to admit, every time I'm up in this area, it's usually dark and very late, and my focus is entirely on the Green Mill. So I should not have been surprised that Demera was directly across the street from the GM and I'd never noticed it before. I found service here a bit slow and impersonal. Our server was not great at answering questions and certainly wasn't what I'd call "friendly"--but she wasn't a bitch either. As far as the food goes, I'm not sure if I'm just not into Ethiopian food, I ordered the wrong thing, or Demera doesn't offer the best example of the cuisine. But I wasn't too fond of the extraordinarily bland beef dish that I ordered (uh, we ordered by number, so I really don't remember what these plates were called). My pal I's salmon dish was better, but it gave off a hint of that unmistakable fishiness that I sometimes find issue with when eating salmon. I couldn't help but wonder if the fish was either old or of poor quality. As chopped up and highly spiced a fate as it was led to, any sub-par fish would easily be well-masked with this preparation. Still, it wasn't terrible. My fave was suzanne s.'s cabbage and carrots dish--not pretty, but fresh and lovely tasting. The accompanying condiments (chickpeas, some spicy red stuff and collard greens) were also a nice touch--really enhanced the flavors of our main dishes. The space was comfortable enough, nothing fancy, but clean. I think I would try another Ethiopian joint or two before coming back here, just to build some frame of reference.
