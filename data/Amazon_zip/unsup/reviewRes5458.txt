I am really surprised at the good reviews this has received. I arrived at the restaurant with my girlfriend on a Sunday afternoon. We casually strolled in as we happened to be in the area. Our waitress came by shortly after we sat down, and asked us if we wanted some wine. We did not. After this point I think we waited about 20 minutes for our waitress to show up again. No luck, so we asked another waiter who was attending the tables on either side of us (but not us for some reason) to please get the attention of our waitress if he sees her. He scoffed and said "I will just take you order". We gave him our order, and again another 30 minutes for our food to come out while the tables on either side of us were being served and attended. I honestly don't remember the food that I had except the MIlk Braised Pork Shoulder. It was ridiculously salty and looked like something I would be served in an airplane (the mashed potatoes under the pork shoulder in a small square pan). After a disappointing wait, for a disappointing meal, our table never got cleared. Again we saw tables directly next to us getting cleared, but we had to get someone's attention again just to have our table cleared. My family is from the caribbean and grew up eating pork. For a place that pays homage to pork, it does a truly miserable job. There are plenty of better restaurants worth your time and money. However, if you like to be treated like garbage, and eat sub-par pork dishes this is the place for you. Although if thats the case, I would probably still recommend Dick's Last resort over Purple Pig.
