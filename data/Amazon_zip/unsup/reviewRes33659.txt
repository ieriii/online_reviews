Very cheap and good eats! Nice little place to go for some falafel... they do have some other choices as well, but the falafel seems to be their staple. The rice is great. The hummus is okay to me, but I'm not a monster hummus fan. If you eat meat (most patrons that go here seem not to be) then the lamb dishes are excellent. Good amount of seating, and the environment is really nice and pleasant. Very quick service. Go Sultans!
