I love this place! Yes I know that there are better Kalbi places in Chicago and yes this place can get busy and you have to wait but I dont care, I love this place. Ive been coming here for years and it always brings a smile to my face. Good Kalbi, large portions and a friendly setting. They give you so much food you usually have to rearrange everything on the table to make it all fit. Add to the fact that the place is 24 hours, a great lunch or late night Soo-icide is always just a short drive away. The only thing I dont like is the tiny parking lot. I wont even think about parking in the lot unless its late at night for fear of having my car dinged.
