Oh, Gino's. You took our deep dish virginity and now we can never go back. We had such a good experience, heightened by our fantastic server, Doug. Can you believe he actually entertained a mother who wanted him to set a place setting and serve a piece to her daughter's American Doll? Yeishta. He's an actor, he just went to Kenya to photograph orphanages, he skydives... Don't worry your pretty little self: we weren't bothered by him -- we loved his personality. And all after a DOUBLE shift!  Three tips to enjoying your time at Gino's. 1) Be prepared for a wait, but also be prepared for 45-hour wait on the deep dish. Takes a long time to bake those puppies. We had the bacon cheeseburger pizza. Friggen great. 2) Bring white out or finger nail polish. You'll see why. 3) Have a bottle of Pepto in your hotel room for the next morning. Just in case. ;)  All in all, we'd go back just to see if we could have Doug again.
