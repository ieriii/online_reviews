What can I say that hasn't already been said? Everything I have tasted at this restaurant has been exceptional. The kind of food where every bite is followed by "Holy s%$@, I can't believe it tastes that good." I went there for dinner and didn't even have to wait. The ordering system is a little strange, but it worked out well and we got a table immediately. Get the spicy drinking chocolate. You won't regret it.
