Ordered for take out over the past weekend. Got the roast duck, roast pork, and a couple other dishes. It was as good as everyone else raves it is. We didn't get the buns though as the pictures show. I'm assuming its because we ordered take out. Was still good nonetheless and I'll be ordering from here in the future.
