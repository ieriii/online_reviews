After reading the reviews online my roommate and I decided to check this place out even though it had a few bad reviews mixed in there.I'm so glad we did! This place was great. My roommate and I agreed that it is one of the best we've been for Mexican in the city so far. Very sizable portions and reasonably priced too! We both ate for under 15 dollars total with a sack of leftovers to take home! My food was not greasy at all and my roommate really seemed to enjoy her food as well. The service was ok too, no problems there. I think the chips and salsa were great, chips were hot and fresh. And the salsa was really good and not too spicy.There is no doubt I will be back and next time I will try one of their Margaritas! Ole!
