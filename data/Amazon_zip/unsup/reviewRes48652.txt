To say that I have been eagerly anticipating the day that I would dine at Publican is an understatement! However, I have conquered and feel slightly disappointed.... I went here on a Friday night, around 8:30 pm and this place was packed! We were seated at a cozy two top and could not wait to try one of their many (many, many, many) different types of beers. To start with, our server was not helpful - I had explained that this was our first time there and asked for suggestions. Nope, not a hint, nada. So a go at it on our own.... Half a dozen oysters (very good) although the vinegar was not my cup of tea, next the imfamous pork rinds - really folks, this is like pork flavored rice cakes, the pickles came next (oh sorry, our server said pickles, not pickled veggies - oops, 2 star deduction due to awful service. The entrees we tried were the pork belly (this alone is a 5 star rating) it was perfect! I had asked our server whether to go with the sweetbreads or the sausage, she said "sweetbreads are yucky and she doesn't like the texture"....ok, with that said, ummm, we'll try the sausage. That was as helpful as she got for the whole night. For the money and hype - it fell short of meeting my expectations but if you go - you must have the pork belly!
