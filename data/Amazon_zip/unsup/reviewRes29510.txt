Opart Thai is the definitely the best Thai I've had in Chicago. I live in Lincoln Park so it's a bit far for somebody without a car, but I will happily schlep up to lincoln square for a meal here. I always order the same thing - Pad Thai. I know it's boring & a staple, but I love it and am sticking too it. As an App, I always get the Peanut Sauce Spring Rolls to start and they are phenomenal as well. If you are scared of tofu, don't shy away - it is marinated in some sort of magical peanuty/cinnamony secret sauce. My date always get the Rama Broccoli, which has also gotten great reviews (hint: anything with their peanut sauce will be delicious!)
