This place is one of the most overrated/hyped hot dog places out there. When the parents were in town for their first trip to Chicago my father had suggested it (on his CH list) since we already north. After spending hte extra 30 minutes in traffic (rookie mistake on my part) we were excited by the old school drive up feel. When the hot dogs arrived, my NY born and raised family even asked, "where are all the fixins like sport peppers?" After flying back home my dad said he managed to pick up a hot dog at the airport that was far superior...I repeat: A HOT DOG AT THE AIRPORT IS BETTER Bottomline: For us it was a huge flop, especially if making the drive out from the city solely for this purpose. Value: Again, pretty much any hot dog stand in the city will be the same and/or better and/or cheaper
