The food is outstanding. I would have given the restaurant 5 stars except sometimes the service is not so great. I eat here a lot and have never had a bad meal. The Ropa Vieja is my favorite meal, but you can't go wrong with the sandwiches either. I recommend coming in the warm weather and sitting on the patio! But, the service can be slow. I've also experienced problems on the weekend when the staff tries to move me out the door quickly. One Saturday night I ordered a coffee and they brought it in a to go cup! So but for the service, this would be a 5 star review.
