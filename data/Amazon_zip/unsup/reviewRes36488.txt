What can I say about this place? I am a breakfast junkie & try as many places possible in the city. What keeps me coming back to Meli is their quality of food. Whether your palette gravitates toward sweet/savory, you will find a dish you'll enjoy. Omelettes are excellent & well portioned, especially served with baby reds. Fantastic crepes,stuffed french toast & pancakes. Amazing honey butter & marmalades that accompany the yummy toast. Lavazza coffee they serve in unlimited quantities is GREAT. Service is ok, but it doesn't deter me from returning. Street parking is hit or miss & try to avoid peak hours. I've discovered anytime before 9:30am on the weekends have resulted in zero wait time for 2 people. Give it a try.
