I was under impressed. I thought that the omelette I got was okay, but not great. And I also thought the potatoes were kind of gross, but that could be because I do not like dill. It seemed a little overpriced to me. The service was great though, and everyone was very friendly. I also had no interest in the overly sweet items, but if that is your thing, you may love this place.
