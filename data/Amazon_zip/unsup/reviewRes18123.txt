Great beer list, great staff, great ambiance and AMAZING burgers. Though towards the end of our meal, they were telling people that they were running low on burgers. What? How can you sell out of one of the main things you're known for? Nonetheless, this is hands-down one of my new favorite spots in the city. We enjoyed sitting up at the bar and watching all of the action. I had the El Chupacabra - two thumbs up. This isn't a frilly or necessary trendy place - but it has everything I need in a new favorite spot..
