It's touristy but when you're having a big group with varying tastes, there's enough selection to cater to everyone. The wait's not that long since the place is huge/ But man... the bathrooms are nasty. Maybe because it was a weekend, but this happened before too, where women were waiting in a line because there was no TP in all but a few stalls.  I like their freshbaked pecan chocolate chip cookies.
