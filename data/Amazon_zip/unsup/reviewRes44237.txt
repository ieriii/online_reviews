The sushi has more or less exceeded my expectations of any sushi one could expect in the Midwest. That said, I've had some bad rolls on certain nights. But overall, a good place to silence that sushi craving, and probably one of the better I've been to in town. Drinks at the attached bar are awesome, albeit a bit pricey ($10 and up). I had a ginger martini that had me wanting more....these bartenders know what they're doing. The jalepeno miso is unique and fantastic (and cheap). The edamame is presented in a creative way and is pretty good.  The service has sometimes been terrible. They can be rude. It seems like they've developed an attitude about their success, and that they are doing you a favor by letting you enter their restaurant..... it seems sort of hit or miss, and maybe a lot of the problems are actually caused by the BYOB as people tend to get pretty sloppy....on more than one occasion I've seen them toss drunks from the place (which I was actually pretty thankful about). But hey, who doesn't want to wash down some raw fish with booze?
