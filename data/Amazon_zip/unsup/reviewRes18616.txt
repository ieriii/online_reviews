The food here was pretty good, the drinks were amazing, and the atmosphere was pretty great. So why the three stars you ask? The lack of service we received. Our server was uninterested in us, and just lacked any personality. She was slow with bringing us drink refills, and was just not very friendly. I will probably go back for the cheese curds (amazing), and give this place another shot. Hopefully, the service is much better the next time around.
