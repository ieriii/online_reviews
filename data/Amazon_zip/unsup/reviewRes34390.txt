I ventured down to this Yolk location due to it's proximity to the auto show. This was my second trip to a Yolk overall but my first time to this location. I chose one of their skillets with a side of fresh fruit. The fruit was extremely delicious with an assortment of grapes, melon and pineapple. This paired extremely well with my skillet of turkey sausage, cheese and spinach. Overall, the food was exceptional and came out fast even though the place was packed on a Sunday morning. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a quality breakfast and doesn't mind a little bit of a wait. Even if you have to wait, you can grab some of their fresh coffee to drink in the waiting area.
