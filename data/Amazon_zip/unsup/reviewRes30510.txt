Loved it. Finally checked this one off the list after hearing about it from lots of people and seeing it on Check Please and DDD. The place is super cute with nice artwork and a comfy vibe. Service is efficient and friendly. Looking at the menu, I wanted everything. Like everything sounded so flipping good, and I'm seeing stuff being served to other tables that looks so damn good. They have a nice drink list and I got some microbrew weiss beer, and BF an Arnold Palmer (made with homemade lemonade). BF and I both decided to get the Sunday Supper. The relish tray came out first and what a nice relish tray it was! A pile of organic veggies - okra, arugula salad, olives, spicy peanuts, tomatoes, apples, some pickled red thing that was super fibrous and hard to chew (my least fav, haha), and I forget what else. Super tasty and fresh. Ok, so then this big plate with chicken, mac & cheese, biscuits comes out. Also, a plate with more veggies and salad. I must say I didn't even eat any veggies as I was devouring the most delicious chicken with the best crispy crust, and the yummy biscuit, and the mac & cheese which had truffle flavor (which I really do not love, but it is slowly growing on me). This is some seriously good chow. So I'm stuffed at this point and there is still dessert coming with dinner. There are 3 choices and BF and I both opt for the chocolate cake thingy with buttercream and raspberry gelato and fruit. I have no idea what the fruit was...looked like little grapes the size of peas (but they weren't grapes, I don't think), and little white mulberry looking things. Anyway, it was a fun little dessert that was thoroughly enjoyed. So yeah, I need to go back here a bunch of times, which will not be hard to do since they also have breakfast, brunch, and lunch. Can't wait, yum!
