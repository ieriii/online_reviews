I guess because there are cereal boxes lining the back wall as you peer in the window, it never occurred to me that this would be such a fantastic place for fresh fish! They have TONS of fish choices. This is not a place to get a gourmet meal and be wowed by how creative the dishes are, but it is a no-frills place to get a delicious meal. Everything comes with potatoes, and fresh veggies. A good balance of everything you need on one plate.  They have a wall with a chalkboard menu with over a dozen fish choices. They also have a lot of steak choices, but I did not try them. I will have to go back with a steak expert to get the true story. They have a decent wine list and some tasty sounding cocktails. There was a table next to us that brought a bottle of wine, so they must have a minimal corkage fee.  The decor is nothing to write home about, but it has a great "around-the-corner" feel. A place that is going to spend more money on the quality of their food than they are on some fancy napkins or mood lighting. Definitely a new regular in my book.  Such a great find. My next visit will involve breakfast, though, since it sounds like that is something else I might be missing out on!
