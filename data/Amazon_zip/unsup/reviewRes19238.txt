Went here for dinner this week, officially my second time to Xoco. I was shocked and amazed to see Rick Bayless himself on the line. I never thought he would be at Xoco during dinnertime because I figured he would be at Frontera or Topolobampo. But nope! There he was, tasting and talking with the guys there. It was pretty awesome! Anyways, I'm not very adventurous I suppose because I got the mushroom torta which I got last time. It's just amazing, overflowing with mushrooms, with perfectly paired flavors. I did try a new hot chocolate however, the Aztec Hot Chocolate this time. It was divine! So rich, creamy, and chocolatey. I just can't get enough of their hot chocolate! It is still hands down the best hot chocolate I've ever had.. I just love Xoco, love Rick Bayless, and can't wait to go back again!
