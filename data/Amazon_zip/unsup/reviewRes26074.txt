I had the tasting menu and enthusiatically admit that I tried all three flavors of sangria. I enjoyed them all. The tasting menu was neverending with a good variety for all of us to enjoy (there were 4 of us). The smoked meats - delicious (especially the beef). I loved the pimentos de padron...simple but so good. I also enjoyed the complimentary tomato bread although it was a bit garlicky. Nice lounge-like atmosphere. I knew when I walked in and heard the latest & greated Portishead album playing that it was going to be a good dining experience :)
