So I had to try this place after hearing so much about it. Ordered the "crack chicken", salt and pepper shrimp, yi huan pork (shredded pork) and the garlic string bean. The chicken lived up to the hype as well as the other dishes. It's a little bit pricier than the other joints in Chinatown I frequent - Triple Crown, Happy Chef and Lee Wing Wah. The quality is a notch higher and I din't leave with dry mouth and a headache due to too much msg. My wife detected some but says it wasn't too much.  I also took 1 star off due to difficulty in communicating with the staff. I had a question about one of the items on the menu and I just gave up because it was too frustrating.
