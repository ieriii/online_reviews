Typical American fare. I don't really understand why people rave about the salad bar here. Maybe I'm coming at the wrong time? I've eaten at far nicer, far bigger salad bars than the one here. Did I not say the secret word? Should I have tapped on walls for a revolving doorway to salad bar nirvana? I had a burger here that was cooked just to my liking and tasted pretty darn good. I didn't like being seated between a large wood column and the kitchen/staff corridor, but the place is bumpin' and beggars can't be choosers. Back to the salad bar for a minute, please? Yes, well, it looked really messy as well. I know it's hard to keep a salad bar clean but it just didn't look appetizing at all. Will I come back? Yes. Will I seek out a salad bar? No. There's just a ton of other choices on the menu that look great and probably taste awesome too.
