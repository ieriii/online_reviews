Stopped in with two co-workers for lunch on Thursday around 11:20. There were about six people in line in front of us, but we got through and snagged a table in less than 10 minutes. I like that they have a hostess person to seat you and bring your food, but, not realizing this is how things are run, I neglected to tip at the register. I guess I'll know for next time. I had the only vegetarian torta on the menu, the Woodland Mushroom. It was good, but not mind-blowing. One of my dining companions got the Ahogada, a pork torta in a tomato broth. That did look mind-blowing, and he confirmed that yes, it was delicious. Oh, well. Would be nice if the veggie option was just as good, but alas. The homemade churros, on the other hand, blew me away. Super moist and chewy, eons better than the crap they serve at the Sox games (naturally). The chocolate cookie was also spectacular. I can't wait to try black bean caldo and the housemade hot chocolate...
