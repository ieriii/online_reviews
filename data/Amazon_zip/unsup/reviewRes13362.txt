I actually wanted to give a 3.5 star review, because I was happy, but not 4 star happy (if that makes sense). My fianc and I came here because he had seen this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (damn you Guy Fieri), and he wanted to give it a try. We went on a early Sunday afternoon to see what the wait was. They said 20 minutes, so we went back outside to join the other drifters patiently waiting for their numbers to be called. 15 minutes later, they called our number (a plus for them). I am a complete breakfast food snob, and so I judge restaurants harshly based on their breakfast/brunch menu. Bacon, eggs and pancakes all the way. The eggs were light, fluffy and perfectly scrambled, and the bacon was crisp and perfect. My fianc ordered the cioppino and the crab cakes (since Glenn's is known for their seafood selection). The cioppino was superb, the crab cakes were...interesting. There were were almost like coleslaw crab cakes, which was a unique twist, but not one I enjoyed, and I love my crab cakes. Overall, I will be coming back if only to sample the awesome-looking dish that this table of guys ordered. Literally, their waiter brought it out, and the smell was wafting over to us like a Pepe Le Pew. And the seafood list looks quite impressive, and they have barramundi on their menu (best fish to eat EVER)!
