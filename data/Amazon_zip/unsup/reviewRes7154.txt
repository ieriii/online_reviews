My family and I came here for brunch yesterday. We went right when it opened because we have a 1 and 2 year old. The staff was very friendly and my kids were saying hello to everyone there. It surprises me however that it says "no" for kid friendly. Could be misleading to someone who hasn't been there, has kids and wants to go. Anyhow the food was delicious and my kids ate a lot! Which for anyone with small children knows it could be a serious challenge to find something that they will eat and allow you to eat your meal at the same time. I wish I remember our waiters name. He was super nice and really seemed to be genuinely happy to help us enjoy. And just happy to be working there. Love this place. Can't wait to come back!!!!!!!
