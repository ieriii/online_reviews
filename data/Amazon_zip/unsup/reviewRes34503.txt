The food at Sultan's Market is slightly better than average, but since it's located right behind my apartment I find myself going there for dinner about two times per week. Just recently they raised their prices and have become really strict with their menu. I'm no longer able to add hummus/ hot sauce/ a crushed falafel ball to a small rice plate. I was totally willing to pay a little extra, but they refused, which made no sense at all. I thought that they'd maybe have a little more respect for someone that's been constantly eating their average falafels for the past 3 years. I'll probably boycott it for a while.
