I've been to the restaurant twice and I put this restaurant to be on the same level as Japonais. Both are trendy, asian fusion, good food, and expensive. You don't come here if you are looking for a budget dinner, or to find prices that are "reasonable". This is a splurge and indulge type of place. The portions vary in the entrees and like all restaurants, I'm sure some dishes will be hit and miss. Though, I haven't hit a miss yet. My favorites are the longrib, baked seafood dynamite sushi roll, and pork belly. I haven't had the sashimi here yet, so I can't say if they are fresh or not. The restaurant's decor seems fancy, but you don't feel forced to dress up. I've come here twice dressed casually for dinner and never felt out of place. Instead of bread, they serve a small salad on the house. I feel like there's so much on the menu that its best to eat family style so you can sample everything. I would say if you are a carnivore, like my bf, this is an awesome restaurant since most dishes are just all meat on the plate. I can't wait to go back!
