I couldn't figure out why an encased meats joint with one hell of a line was a "must try" while I was in Chicago, until I saw their menu! It was actually impossible to choose just one. We decided on the turducken sausage with champagne pate, bacon sauce and blue cheese and the shrimp and pork sausage with remoulade and goat cheese- & cheese fries. I have never been so excited in my life for lunch! I ate in silence, MMMMing in extasy at every bite. Next time I must try the fois gras dog! As I walked to the bathroom, my girlfriend muttered "take your phone" "UH to the bathroom? Why?," I said. "Trust me, you'll want to take a photo," she said. Sadly, she was right. OK Chicago, you win the dog-race, but we NY'ers still own pizza!
