When we arrived at Little Bucharest, we encountered a small group of people dancing; learning tango. Unexpected, but welcomed. Inside, a fairly large room was virtually empty of patrons. Hmm. It was 8:30 and reminded us of exactly what you might find in Buenos Aires. i.e. people dancing tango and no patrons at such an ungodly early hour.  We were seated quickly by an obviously new and nervous new waitress. She opened our wine (it's BYOB, but with a full bar). Soon the owner materialized to show the waitress how to encourage us to order appetizers. We settled (four of us) on a sampler plate of sliced cured meats, cheese, etc. It was good. I remember that they served bread that was very welcomed. For dinner, we ordered: Sausage stuffed chicken thigh, grilled Romanian sausages, cabbage stuffed with beef, pork and rice, and braised short rib goulash. Everyone enjoyed their entree, but the goulash was really the best I've ever had. I don't recall what we had for desert. Ambiance: During dinner, more patrons began arriving and several guys began moving tables out of the center of the restaurant. Soon, the place was brimming with people having dinner and dancing tango (!). By now it was 10:00 or so. Truly, we felt like we were in Buenos Aires. It was great. I imagine that without all this excitement, it's a lot quieter. If they could keep this atmosphere nightly, I think they would be packed. The service was okay, in spite of a new waitress. The owner stepped in often to help her. C thinks he was overdoing it, but the other side of the coin may have left us neglected. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food. I give the owner a high five for being BYOB in spite of having a full bar. I simply despise restaurants that either will not allow you to BYOB or say they have a corkage fee of $20. We don't always go BYOB, but that sets the stage for me. If I know of their policy, I won't go. It's a matter of principle. I don't like overt greed.
