Since we're Greek, we're critical of Greek restaurants - and found Greek Islands to be very good but not outstanding. We got a table for 6 immediately at 7 pm on a Friday night. (It's a huge place, they do not take reservations, and the service moves along fairly quickly, so I don't imagine you have to wait long for a table to open up.) Appetizers - Saganaki, calamari, stuffed grape leaves and horiatiki salad (tomato, cuke, feta, onions) were all excellent. Pasticio - very good Gyro platters - a ton of shaved gyro meat served with a small plate of tzaziki sauce and only ONE pita for making a sandwich. We had to ask for more pitas - rather than the waiter offering more. If you order some appetizers and then want a gyro, split the order -- it's plenty for 2 people. While we enjoyed it, I'd try someplace next time, just to see if there's better.
