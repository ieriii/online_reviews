This is great place to hang out. The lounge side is comfortable and the dine in side is just as comfortable. The seafood is always fresh and everything that I've tried on the menu tastes good. There are a few dishes that are better elsewhere but I always try to stop here at least once when I'm in Chicago. The buffet they have on weekends is also pretty good (and a good value) and their raspberry mojitos are the best.
