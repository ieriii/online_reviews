Well the meal started off ok, good salsa's, fresh chips. A super yummy complimentary appetizer of this pork stew with beans and a tortilla....then downhill from there. The service was slow but they were busy and really I wasn't in a hurry so thats ok. But the most disturbing thing....chedder cheese is used in the cheese enchiladas and nachos, not chihuahua. That is the kind of bush-league thing i would expect in a Mexican restaurant in bumblefoo Ohio, not in Chicago! And the food (ordered combination plate) clearly sat under a warming lamp for awhile. You can totally tell this by the pictures that are posted.  Looks very dry. The beans were very very greasy. Refried beans granted are fried, but these glistened and had a flavor of old grease. I am part Mexican and I know authentic mexican food, this was a mesh of really greasy gross food and some good dishes, so its all in what you order. I would avoid the combo and go with a more traditional mexican meal like the pork stew or carne asada. The prices are good. But I can go to any burrito joint (La Pasadita, Taco Burrito King) and get the same prices, but with better food.
