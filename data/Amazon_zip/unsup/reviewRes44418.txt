I just recently read that I have what they call a Type 3 sugar addiction. I will drive to the ends of the earth if that is where the sweets are, so I am on a constant look -out for bakeries, cafes, candy stores, or any place where I can get sweets:) I was actually looking for a different bakery when I saw this place by accident. Boy, am I glad I stopped in! They have the BEST almond croissants!!! I have been back for more since then....
