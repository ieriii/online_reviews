Loved this place....so did all of Chicago the night I popped by. I stood in line just to get take out. Was it worth it? YES! Rock Bayless' take on Mexican street food is spot on. There is a buzz about this place and excitement. I ordered the Chicken Milanese torta, homemade ground hot chocolate and a churro. They give you a large bag of chips and guac on the side, too. Food was delicious. It was so busy the night I visited that when my number was up, I left hurriedly and headed out into the windy, cold streets of Chicago with a wonderful chocolate to warm me up. I would've rated this place 5 stars, but when I returned back to my room to indulge, the churro was missing. Bummer!
