Amazing! Awesome! The best brunch that I've ever had!!! (and that says a lot being that I live in NYC, where brunch is everywhere!) I was mesmerized from the start just by the menu, and the dishes walking past me to other customers! I ordered the BLT Benedict, and my husband ordered the two eggs with apple chicken sausage, hasbrowns, AND an order of the banana toffee pancakes! It was all DELICIOUS! My benedict had thick slices of bacon, spinach, perfectly poached eggs on an english muffin and the best herbed hollandaise sauce ever! The hasbrowns were very tasty as well. I am a big fan of eggs benedict, and this was by far the best I'd ever had. The pancakes tasted like moist pieces of cake! Not too much toffee, and it was drizzled with a white sauce. MMMMM! I could eat here everyday! There is a bit of a wait, so don't expect to be seated right away. I will be back every time I visit Chicago!
