I don't know if it was an off day, but boy were we disappointed with the encased meats. Chicago dog (grilled): dry (how does it get dry?) and tasteless. All I could taste were the condiments...Beef fail. Chili dog: all I remember was that it was very salty. Foie Gras dog: the best of the three, not bad but too salty and not very savory. I'll stick to non-encased foie gras. :(
