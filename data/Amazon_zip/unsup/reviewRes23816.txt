So I have been here twice now and first off I have to say the oatmeal shake is AMAZING! I would have it every day if I could. The food, however, is just meh. Not bad, but nothing fantastic. The first time I had some sort of sandwhich, and just recently I had the potato tacos and my friends had the shrimp pallela and empanadas. My tacos were super dry and the waiter brought out the wrong sides. The refried beans were pretty delicious. My friends said their food was good, but I didn't taste it. Overall, good if you want a low key place to grab dinner, but nothing fantastic....well, except for those amazing oatmeal shakes.
