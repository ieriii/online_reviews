OK its all pretty much been said before so I will be brief. Decor - Awesome. Service - Top Drawer Food - From the spigot of God's own Brita filter. I got - Artisanal Cheese Plate - Savory and amazing. The couple next to us ordered this after looking at ours. My 6 year old was here also and she dug on the soft French cheese harder than BP did during that whole gulf disaster? remember that? Why does nobody care about that anymore? I swear I had like 50 friends all telling me "Dude, don't go to BP, they stick broomsticks into baby ducks and break em off. Then they cover them in oil." Wild Boar Sloppy Joe - WOW. I liked this better than 95% of the burgers I have ever had in my life. It was complex and awesome. Highly recommended. Seared Tombo Tuna - Just like sushi, only less chance of getting salmonella. The black garlic aoili and peas worked marvelously together but the crown jewel was the gnocci, succulent and exquisite. Dessert was the real boner inducing attention grabber. Our server recommended it after we were torn. Good choice Kortland. Gruyere Donuts with Whipped Goat Cheese and Parmesan and some kind of syrup - I seriously think a little pee came out when I took my first bite. I can't even describe this one, you really have to go get it for yourself. To sum up; worth the hype, tuck your boner into your sweatpants and head over. Also, not expensive.
