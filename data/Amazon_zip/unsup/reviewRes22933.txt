I hadn't been to Irazu in forever so I decided to place an order for delivery tonight. Speaking to the man on the phone was a pleasant experience. He was really efficient and friendly, and hilariously, when I asked if I could pay with my card, he informed me they were cash only but OFFERED to take a PERSONAL check when the food arrived. HA HA! Hilariously good customer service. I felt weird so i went to the ATM :) The rice, beans, plantains, and salad were really wonderful. I ordered the potato tacos, which (in case you expect an open face taco) are just a fried tortilla with potato. Tasted great for a plain dish. I ordered an oatmeal shake, which tasted wonderful but was not as thick as anticipated. I think it melted during delivery. Had I known I could drink it like milk, I would have had it with my meal instead of waiting for desert. The next day, leftovers are just as good.
