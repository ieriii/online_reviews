Ok, so, for the first time I wish I could give half stars. The food deserves a four, but the overall experience, probably less. I mean, 4 stars is pretty big in my opinion. Ok, enough of that, onward with the review... They have good beer selection, which came in handy since even though they told us we would be waiting 30 mins for our table we didn't get seated for more like an hour and 15 mins. Needless to say, I was a little unhappy about that. Seriously, learn how to manage the front of your house. If you think it's going to be 30 mins, tell them it'll be 45, because nobody ever complains about getting seated too soon. And if you tell them 30 mins then when it hits 45 mins maybe you are just going to have to seat a group of two at a table that could seat 4 instead of continuing to skip over them for the bigger groups. It's not rocket science. But, they picked up the beers that we got at dinner, so I feel like I can't complain about it too much. And gave them the 4 stars anyway. We started with some cheese curds, which were yummy. Then I got the Frenchie (burger with spinach, brie, truffle and frizzled onions) and the guy I was with got the Big Texan (burger with pretzel bun, onion rings, pulled pork, bbq). Both burgers were very good. Real good meat, cooked right, fresh ingredients, yummy. He got regular fries and I got truffle fries and both were tasty, with the truffle fries being particularly indulgent. So the food was good.Real good. I would say my burger was comparable to Kuma's in quality though Bad Apple doesn't't have as many fun choices. And I love me some fun toppings. All in all, I'd go back. Especially when I'm hungry and don't want the Kuma's wait. Assuming I don't have such a long wait the next time.
