I came here last night with my dinner club and I am having a difficult time deciding on a rating. CONS- service was slow and lackluster. There were plates, bowls, and glasses that were empty all over the table that no one seemed to want to remove. I was never able to get my water refilled. When the grill started to smoke A LOT due to the marinade, no one came over to change the grill for us. This smoking went on for a good 5-7 minutes, I really thought we were going to set off the fire alarms. PROS- the squid was tasty, the marinade was a bit spicy but nothing to extreme...thank God. The selection of sides is overwhelming, but in a good way. The seaweed was perfectly salty, the potatoes were flavorful, the green salad had a nice dressing on it. You must try a little bit of every side.....I think it is really part of the experience dining out at a Korean restaurant. BE CERTAIN TO ORDER THE SEAFOOD PANCAKE!! I myself love seafood, but even those friends who don't usually partake in the bounty of the sea loved the pancake. A must try! SO I will settle on 2 stars, because although I loved the seafood pancake and the squid, I was quite disgruntled with the service when the grill practically smoked out the entire restaurant for 10 minutes.
