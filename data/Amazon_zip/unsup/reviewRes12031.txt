The pizza here is pretty damn good. It's not quite 100% NY style, but that only serves to make it better in my eyes. The restaurant itself has a very open/spacious feel. I have been unfortunate enough to have shown up here on two separate occasions to be blasted with overly-loud karaoke. Not fun. Piece also has it's own beer - which is great (and worth a visit for).
