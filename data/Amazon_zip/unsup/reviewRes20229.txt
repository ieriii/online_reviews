The churros were great. The smaller size (width-wise) made for just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and chewiness on the inside. I liked the large sugar crystals and the specks of chocolate. I've actually had "authentic" churros at a churreria in Mexico City called El Morro and thought Xoco's churro was way better! My friend Sherri and my bf both did not like Xoco's churro. My bf said a Costco churro tasted better and Sherri said Disneyland's is better. Just giving different views. The ham empanada was amazing. The right amount of crust and filling. The breakfast torta with the chorizo was a little bland. Needed more flavor. The chorizo itself was really good. We got the almenzadro hot chocolate and it was thick and tasty. Unique because of the almond flavor. I can see why some people wont like it. Overall, I'm glad we went and I would love to try their lunch tortas.
