My shell pasta dish with asparagus and a cream sauce was pretty good. I would say 4 stars for my food. However, this place is INSANELY loud and crowded! The loudest Italian restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're wanting a romantic Italian dinner, or if you have poor hearing. If you have solid hearing, unlike me, go right on ahead!
