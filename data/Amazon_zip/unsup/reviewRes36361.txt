Meli Cafe is simply awesome! I've been here on several occasions and each time I'm amazed by the breakfast here. It helps that they have an extensive list of breakfast items as well as delicious juices. From eggs benedict, to omelets and to french toast or pancakes (esp those sinfully delicious chocolate pancakes!), never once was I disappointed by the food. Though I must say, their level of service fluctuates. Moreover, expect to wait in line for about an hour if you come after 10am. This place is always packed! But for the love of good food, waiting for a while is a small price to pay.
