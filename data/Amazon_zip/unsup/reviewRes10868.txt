I've been to The Bongo Room three times. The first time, I stupidly ordered a build-your-own omelette (I don't really like eggs) with broccoli, spinach and muenster in it. I don't know what I was thinking. Needless to say, I didn't love it. But that was on me! The next two times I went it, it was amazeballs.  SO amazeballs, in fact, that I ordered the same thing both times. Their peppercorn beef sandwich with white cheddar and horseradish aioli is INSANE. It's delicious, and it comes with your choice of home fries OR salad as a side. I love when salad is offered as a standard side. The ambience is laid back, and the staff is friendly. Fair warning, though, this place is ALWAYS busy. There is almost always a wait, especially for brunch. The only reason I'm giving The Bongo Room 4 stars instead of 5 is their prices are a leeeeettle bit steep. Everything is good, but I still wince just a bit when I pay the check.
