Ive been living down the street from Alliance for around 10 years now and I've watched it change hands many times. I keep giving it another chance hopeing to relive the glory days of the late 90's. I stopped in their last night to grab a sandwich on my way to work. The male barista was so chatty fast and amped up I was wondering if he had to much coffee or mabye to much speed. My caprise sandwich was just ok, a bit to much bread and not enough filling. What grossed me out was seeing the male Barista behind the counter barefoot! then watching him walk outside into the seating area and back into the kitchen BAREFOOT! GROSS!
