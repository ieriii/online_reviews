Yum! Foods of all sorts all made vegetarian/vegan...but you wouldn't know it! A great choice for a mixed group of both meat-eaters and vegans. Having just eaten a gigantic burger in anticipation of days without meat (my vegan sister was visiting), I found myself splitting some amazing gnocchi with my boyfriend and wishing I'd skipped the giant lunch...and its not often that I wish I didn't recently eat a delicious burger either! We also got a pitcher of Margaritas and they were flavorful and strong at the same time. And big! We definitely wobbled out of there... but I'd be happy to come back and have an actual full meal there sometime very soon!
