We stopped here on a Friday night, and boy were we glad we did. We started with the chicken soup, which had a great broth and lots of cilantro, but the chicken was a little tough. We each had a savory crepe, with my husband having the Chicago crepe with avocado, muenster cheese, and various other yummies, and I had the Roma crepe with tomatoes, capers, mozzarella, and balsamic vinaigrette.  Both were awesome. But the real highlight was the dessert crepe- strawberries, nutella, and pistachio ice cream. FANTASTIC. Service was quick and courteous (though the bathroom was questionable) , and I would definitely come back.
