I went there last Thursday night with 3 other girlfriends for the first time. The place is not that big and the tables are kind of close together but it didn't bother us at all. We started off with seaweed salad, edamame and spicy miso soup....yes they have spicy miso soup which is basically their regular miso soup with slices of jalapeno to give it just the right kick. We ordered a bunch of different rolls to share..my favorite maki roll was the Po Boy..please try it! The volcano and white dragon were really good too. I also had the BEST fatty hamachi nigiri......their fish is so fresh! Aside from the really good sushi, it's BYOB! I recommend you check it out if you haven't already.
