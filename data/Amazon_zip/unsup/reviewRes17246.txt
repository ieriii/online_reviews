Pricey yes but worth every penny if you just want a classy place to have a few drinks. After you've had a drink or two off the menu get the bartenders to surprise you with their own concoctions. Give them a type of liquor and some mixers you like and they'll really impress you. My two favorites: Blackberry Smash and Neptune's Wrath. The latter contains absinthe and they ended up lighting two glasses and pouring the flaming absinthe back and forth for effect. Goblet of Fire indeed...
