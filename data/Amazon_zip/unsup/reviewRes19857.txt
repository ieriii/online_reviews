With all the hype and all the press for popular R. Bayless. I had to try this place out. First of all we had to wait in line 15 minutes to order Torta (sandwich)......cut me a break!!!  This is a cafeteria style restaurant and open kitchen atmosphere. After we ordered we were directed another busy location to wait again 5 minutes for a table, finally we were politely seated at a communal table in which I hate sharing tables. We tried talking to each other but even if I wore a hearing aid and cranked it up I wouldn't be able to hear myself speak. Finally the meal came out 25 minute minutes later.  I was expecting a much better sandwich then I ordered. The bread was good, the spiciness of this sandwich and the amount of salt could of killed you!!! We had the chips and salsa, the chips taste like you buy them in the supermarket. All in all 2 sandwiches ( which were the cheapest on the menu) chips and salsa $3.00 and one beer $4.50 total $28.00. I would highly recommend Cafecito for a Cuban sandwich.
