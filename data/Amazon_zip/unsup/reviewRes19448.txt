Chicago is blessed with great food but sometimes good food takes a little bit of time. When you hit up a Chicago hot spot like Hot Doug's, Kuma's Corner and Xoco you are going to wait it is just that simple. Some people think they are too good to wait in line. If you are one of these people, don't come to Xoco. You are much too important to wait in line. You are extremely busy and just waiting in line will aggravate you and the people who have to wait in line with you. You will be so frustrated by the wait in line that you won't think the food is any good. Just stay away. I went to Xoco last week on the day that Rick Bayless tweeted it was the busiest day Xoco had seen. We waited about 25 minutes outside and about 25 minutes inside. I went with my good friend Johnny B who had been several times before. While this is counter service, expect to wait about 15 minutes after you order for your food to arrive; in order to pass the time, order some chips and guac to start. We both had the Ahodaga Torta: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. You can order the tomato broth mild, medium or hot. I went with hot and it really spiced up the sandwich although it was hard to eat the tomato broth independent of the sandwich. We ended with an order of churros. When I first heard from Johnny B that we were ordering churros I immediately thought of sitting at US Cellular watching a White Sox game and eating a greasy churro. The churros at Xoco were fried perfectly and coated with the right amount of sugar. If you can check your attitude before you come to wait in line, Xoco is worth the wait. It will be the best Mexican food you have eaten.
