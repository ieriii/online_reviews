I read the yelp reviews. I saw the pictures. I had to go. My roomie and I had been drooling over the thought of chocolate and syrup for breakfast for far too long, so on a slow weekday we decided to finally try Bongo Room out. Since it was pretty early on a weekday, we were seated right away, and as an added bonus we were seated next to an awkward one night stand that wouldn't end...yay people watching! I had the red velvet pancakes and the lady had the tomatillo salsa scramble. The pancakes were soooo good! Moist (gross word) red velvet pancakes with a warm vanilla bean sauce over them, it was like dessert for breakfast. The salsa scramble was really good too, but honestly, with that many chocolatey deliciousness on the menu I couldn't justify ordering eggs. I couldn't eat here all the time, the food is way too rich, but for every once in a while it's amazing
