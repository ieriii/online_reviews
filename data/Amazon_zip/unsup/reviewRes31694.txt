Finally, a place made for vegetarians. All meals are listed as either organic, gluten-free, vegan, or just vegetarian. This is not to say that every item is incredible but at least I know how it is prepared. Also, for those who do not like the 'fake' meat type of items then this place is not for you. After 20 years of being a vegetarian, I don't really mind because it does offer some creativity (because I am hardly craving meat). Some of those examples should be done away with such as the Buffalo Hot Wings which look and taste like wheat gluten sticks (so, why call them Hot Wings?). Prices are moderate, not cheap but not recession reminders either. Space is at a premium so I have yet to actually dine-in but have settled on carry-out. Wait staff, whether they are yours or not are friendly and helpful without coming off contrived. I recommend the Mushroom Ravioli, Philly Cheese-'Fake,' any of the pastries, and ditto for the shakes! Thank you Chicago Diner for putting forth a good effort in offering vegetarian dining. One
