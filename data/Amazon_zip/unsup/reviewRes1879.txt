Hot Doug's takes a nostalgic entree and creates a unique experience that is only experienced upon eating at Hot Doug's. I've been here multiple times with new guests each time and everyone who I have brought here raves about Hot Doug's. Need I mention Anthony Bourdain filmed here? This place takes the cake.
