I thought Hot Doug's was a real treat on my last visit to the Windy City... worth the hour it took us to get there from our hotel in the loop. I'm already quite the hot dog fan... but HD's take hot dogs to a whole new level!  This semi hole in the wall joint, you wait in line to order at the counter. Unfortunately, there is no menu posted outside for you to peruse while you wait. And if you didn't already know, Chicago could be described as somewhat cold in the winter. Better bundle up while you wait! I got the foie gras dog after reading my fellow Yelpers recs. And the SO got something like garlic pork dog with fruit chutney and manchego (or something scrumptious like that!) Nom Nom Nom! Both were equally delicious! I will say I was pretty jazzed about the duck fat fries... however, they didn't taste any different to me than any other fries. I'm probably gonna be thrown off the Sears Tower for saying that! The place is a bit hectic, so don't go there if you're not in the mood to stand in line, or if you're looking for ambiance, or if you don't want to feel a little rushed! I really wish Doug would get his rear and his sausage down to Dallas stat!
