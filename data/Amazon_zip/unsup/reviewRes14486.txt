Im a huge fan of Cuban sandwiches/dishes and decided to have 90 Miles Cuban Cafe delivered at work. I ordered the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in cajun sauce) dinner with Congri Rice (black beans rice). It normally comes with white rice and black beans but I had it substituted. The meal also comes with maduros (sweet plantains). My dish had just the right seasonings. I've been restricting my salt intake lately and I was afraid it may be too salty but it was just right. I would have to say it was on the oily/greasy side. The dinner plates are $9.95 which isn't horrible, but not a bargain either.  Portions are decent and the food flavorful! I could really use a nap right about now. This comfort food just hits the spot and cravings fulfilled. Last but not least, please try the Salida del Sol iced tea. Not only is it delicious, it's beautiful to look at! It looks like a sunset in a cup. Im definitely returning for more!
