Beer battered cheese curds with homemade buttermilk ranch dipping sauce.  Also the burgers and the fries are pretty good. I like the fries with Old Bay on em. It's no Hamburger Mary's or Kuma's for burgers, yet the beer battered cheese curds with homemade buttermilk ranch dipping sauce are the main reason I go.
