My two supervisors took me to this restaurant as a going away thank you. Since I'm a high school intern. I work during the school year in downtown once a week as a high school program we have. Anyway, it was around noon time and the wait was not long. The place itself is very nice and big. I ordered a chicken lemon sumthing. Not sure exactly what is was called but I know it was chicken and it had lemon in the name. It was pretty good, but after eating it for a while the flavor kind of got nasty. It would be a great dish if it was a small portion, but too much of the flavor made me kind of not like it. I took the rest home and my grandmother ate it. For dessert we ordered the chocolate chip cookes because my supervisors said "YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU BUY THE WARM COOKIES!" they actually were tasty and a bit of a relief after he lemony dish. I would enjoy coming here again, but I will be more careful on picking my dish since there is such an extensive menu.
