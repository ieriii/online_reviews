I stayed with my husband at the HRH last week (May 2007) because the Hilton SCREWED up our reservations, only had smoking rooms, to which I said NO WAY, FIND ME A HOTEL, and everything was booked and finally the only thing left was a junior suite at the HRH.  And frankly, the suites are TRES COOL. Much better I bet than the Hilton Suites (between Chicago and Dearborn I think!) So anyway, HRH is RIGHT on the bridge, very good location. The decor outside is kinda crappy, but as soon as you go in, I feel like Kurt Cobain is gonna come greet us, Sheryl Crow will be singing a tune at the bar, and Bob Dylan will take our reservations. Front desk was TOO attentive, offering us everything from late night munchies to things to do at 12:00 am in Chicago (that's when we finally go the room, thanks to the Hilton....). When we got to the room, it was TRES swanky (there were two suites to a floor, so imagine the size!!!). Amenities were normal to a regular room, although we WERE told about the fiasco regarding the mini bar, so we just opted for not even opening it. Beds were fantastic, bathroom was VERY big for a big city hotel, and all in all, I'd totally return. Very hip. Much fun if you're into music. Very young. Very me.
