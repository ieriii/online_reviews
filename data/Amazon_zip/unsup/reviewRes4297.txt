I went to the Green Mill a few times when I lived in Uptown... loved it! I'm not normally a jazz kind of person, but it just fits here! We got there early to get a seat at the bar and listen to the piano player that was behind the bar. Very cool. And when you throw in the random history about Al Capone and hidden tunnels, you feel like a Rat Packer. Also, it's not widely known, but they own the lot on Magnolia and Lawrence. If you tell the gatekeeper that you're going to the Green Mill, you can park for free. (at least that's how it worked about a year ago) Also, I've heard that the Mexican restaurant on the other side of Crew is great. again... need to check that out.
