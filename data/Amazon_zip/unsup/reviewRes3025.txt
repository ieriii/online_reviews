I agree with some prior reviews. The staff is very professional, very polished, maybe a bit too much, as my wife and I felt a little bit awkward especially at the beginning of the meal. We ordered the 9 course menu. There were a few highlights that I still remember months after the fact: an amazing first course with sturgeon caviar and avocado. Also, a venison that was perfectly cooked and delicious (not part of the normal menu, but they nicely agreed to throw it in there at my request). On the other hand, a few of the plates were only OK (I remember a chicken dish that was mediocre), and the cheese course was disappointing. The sommelier was very nice and recommended some nice half bottles that went well with the food. Overall, I can't complain too much, totally deserving of its 4 stars, but recalling Charlie Trotter and Alinea, I think Tru falls one star short.
