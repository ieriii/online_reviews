Overall, Big Jones offers a pleasant dining experience with extremely clean and well thought out food presentation and a more upscale atmosphere and service than what typically comes to mind when I think of Southern comfort food. While it doesn't maintain the historical Swedish theme of the neighborhood, I feel it integrates quite well into the overall feel Andersonville, and offers some nice window-side seating to observe passers by and the atmosphere outside. We enjoyed the 3-course lunch menu, which at about $20, I consider to be a decent value. I was decidedly stuffed upon leaving, and all 3 of the courses (appetizer/main/dessert) were very generous. I did not get the sense that anything was scaled back from what I may have received had I ordered things a la carte. The fried green tomatoes were yummy; if you like these, though, please do go and try them at Erwin on N Halsted as well. My friend received a lot more dressing / remoulade than I, but the food was beautifully presented on both counts. My gumbo was flavorful and completely filled to the brim of the wide soup bowl. The server recommended the pulled pork sandwich (in part because of what is included on the side), and while I was not able to sample it, I would like to return for that.
