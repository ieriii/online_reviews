I've been here a few times and recently found myself wondering why I don't come here more often. The chicken is delicious. The wings are meaty and every sauce I've ever had here is fantastic. I really want to try the bowls next time I go. So if you are looking for some really tasty chicken with a twist and then you need to go here. Service is fast and friendly and it's BYOB.
