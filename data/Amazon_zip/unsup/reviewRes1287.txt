"There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats', my friend." If I were a woman, I'd have been hatching a scheme to marry Doug a long time ago. That's how good this place is. I just went here today, in fact, for about the 50th time. It is so good, it's sinful. I don't care if I have to wait 45 minutes to get in while standing in the cold, hungover. This place has been featured on numerous cooking shows (national), New York times, other national daily papers. IT IS JUST THAT GOOD! Today I tried the Mint and Garlic Lamb Sausage with Roasted Red Pepper Mayonnaise and Pinna Brigante Sheep's Milk Cheese. Quite a mouthful. It was delicious, as always. And the DUCK FAT FRIES. Unbelievable and you get so many! All this, with a drink, for about $9. Doug is a true gourmet master. Anyone who can work Fois Gras into a hot dog deserves a Nobel prize of some kind.
