I ate here with some co-workers for an early dinner on a Monday night. It was surprisingly full by the time we were leaving around 7:30. The meal was wonderful - I had a great red snapper special, and one of my co-workers raved about the seared ahi tuna. The guacamole and chips appetizer was so-so, but I did appreciate that they kept it on the table throughout our meal instead of taking it away when our entrees came. The desserts we had were AMAZING. Two of us had the blueberry ice cream sandwich, and it was wonderful. The other had the three scoops of ice cream, but requested two of the chocolate scoops - which have the consistency and richness of chocolate mousse more so than ice cream. Divine.
