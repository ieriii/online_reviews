It was hard to pick a sandwich, because they all looked great. I finally settled on the Cubana, which was a terrific mix of textures and flavors, all with just the right amount of heat. Fortunately, the usually long line was short when we arrived, so the wait for an actual table (the other option is a tall stool at a counter) was tolerable, and well worth it. I save 5 stars for the truly amazing, and while Xoco was extremely good, there was a little blot on the experience - my companion's sandwich was just one hot, hot note. But even with only a few days at a time to discover all that Chicago has to offer, this Bostonian would go back.
