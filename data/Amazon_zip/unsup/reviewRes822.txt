My dad wanted to get a Chicago style hot dog since I moved out here 3 years ago. For whatever reason, it has taken this long for us to get our act together and get that darn hot dog. During my parents' most recent visit in April, I sifted through tons of reviews and decided to take them to Hot Doug's, as it appeared to be the leader of the pack. This place absolutely did NOT disappoint! I read that it gets crowded and to be prepared for a wait, so we arrived about 30 minutes after opening. The line was already out the door and starting to form along the side of the building, which appears to be the norm. By the time we got to the counter to order we were hungry and ready to go! I tend to expect big hotspots like this to have a snooty, stuck up way about them - like how some philly cheesesteak places in philly yell at you for asking for ketchup - but Hot Doug's was the opposite. The man taking our order (Doug?) took his time with us first-timers, explaining the menu and how to order exactly what we wanted. He also answered all my dad's questions about the meat. And to top it all off, the three of us were stuffed for a mere $20 bill, which included 3 really tasty root beers. I'm recommending this place to everyone, and will be bringing any first time visitors to the city here!
