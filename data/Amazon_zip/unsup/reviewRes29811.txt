Opart is spacious with dark wood walls and nice Thai art. I went on a weekend night, and the place was packed. The menu was expansive; there were several dishes that I wanted to try. I ordered the fish with red curry; the curry was nothing special and the fish was just fried catfish. The prices are very reasonable, but I just don't understand why this place is so popular.
