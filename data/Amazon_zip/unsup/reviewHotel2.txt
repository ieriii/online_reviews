I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don't know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn't be signing another lease, essentially leaving me "pre-homeless". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I'm quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me "pre-unemployed". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I'm finally choosing my path, I'm hitting bottom. I'm giving up. Shit maybe I'm Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the "Hotel Tokyo". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I'm going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I'll need help, I'll need guidance.
