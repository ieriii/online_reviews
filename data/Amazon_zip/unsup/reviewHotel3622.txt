ugh. love. i've been dreaming of staying at this hotel since i was young, and was so happy when i was treated with a surprise stay. i was reading through other reviews and my review could be a bit biased because we were so spoiled.. we received a complimentary upgrade from a king suite to a presidential suite, and good lord, was our "room" wonderful. this place was literally larger than my apartment and with the most amazing view of LSD and the lake. the bed was incredibly comfortable.. i don't know how describe it other than i felt as though i was sleeping on clouds. we had breakfast in bed and the food was actually quite delicious, exceeding my expectations for room service.  my only complaint is that things are of course a bit outdated (which is fine) but could have been cared for a little more closely - i.e. stains on the couch, etc. however, this was easy to overlook considering the state of the beautiful and a bit over the top suite we were staying in.. yet to try the high tea service, but my friend raves about it. p.s. we googled the princess diana suite, which is where we stayed, and apparently she had stayed in that same suite in the past.
