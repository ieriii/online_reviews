So I have lived a block away from this place for about 2 years and have probably gone here about five times. Although it is convenient it is REALLY overpriced! Who charges $2.00 for basil apparently it is a "premium topping". To me that is just a little ridiculous. Somehow I always end up paying over $20.00 bucks for a pizza and I don't really get anything to fancy. The micro brewed beers are good and I would probably bring someone who has never been but as for a weekly visit I just can't afford it! Also be prepared to deal with a crowd I have yet to be there when you don't have to wait for a seat at the bar.
