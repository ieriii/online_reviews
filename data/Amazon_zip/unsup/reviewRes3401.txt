So, I'm not Korean-Korean, even tho I play one when I want to avoid people, but I do love me some Bi-Bim-Bop. This place was great and a fraction of the cost of other places. We also tried the Seoul Steak Bowl, which had good flavor, but is literally just meat and rice. If you're allergic to veggies, I guess that'd be a safe way to go. My friend also tried the Seoul Sensation burrito, which he said was solid.  We shared the wings, one set with Seoul Sassy (awesome...slightly sweet and sticky) and the Bud's Buffalo Suicide style (not so awesome...basically a sloppy mess of spicy chili sauce and jalapeno's).  Super friendly staff, BYOB (++++) and good quality food.
