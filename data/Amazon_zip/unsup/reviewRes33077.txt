so cheap and delicious, i hope to be back many many times. i got a falafel sandwich and lentil soup and it was great! the falafel was cripsy and then mushy, and deliciously fried. there was a bunch of stuff in my sandwich - some kind of beany wet salad that was a great touch. lentil soup was hot and tasty, not too salty and had no weird flavors. the sandwich was under four dollars and the soup was three for a giant bowl. my only complaint is that i ordered my sandwich spicy, but all the spiciness was concentrated in my first bite and burned my mouth off. i do like that the option is there though. they also have lots of hot sauces around in case you want it even spicier. other complaint is that i wish they had ice for the water. these two are kind of related though. haha. overall a good experience - the people working were friendly and pleasant. oh and be warned that it's cash only.
