Okay so for Labor Day weekend, my family and I visited Chicago for a family function and one thing that I knew I had to do was have a deep dish "Chicago" style pizza! Sooo we decided to order from Giordano's Pizzeria and all I can say is "WOW". Originally from NY, so pizza is a big deal for me and yet, nothing could prepare me for what was about to go down! Unbeknownst to us, was the magnitude of the pizza so we ordered 2 pies to accomodate the large group we had. The pizza pie must have easily weighed in at 3-5lbs and was the true definition of a deep dish. We ordered one sausage and one pepperoni and unfortunately, I could only eat one of the sausage slices. Never before at home the case that I had to use a knife and fork! Absolutely Delicious! With a 'pop' on the side, easily one of the best meals that I had in Chicago! Definitely looking forward to my next visit :)
