First I have to say that I agree with the person below, their NAAN rules!!!! SO GOOD!!!! This was my first time trying Indian food and I was completely satisfied. I started with the Dal Ka Shorba which was a red lentil soup with green peas and rice. Yummy! Then I had the Aloo Gobi which is cauliflower and potatoes with spices, ginger and herbs in a tomato sauce along with palak rice. The combination of flavors was amazing. Very good. For dessert I had the mango kulfi and the kashmiri naan. I have nothing bad to say about this place. The interior design of the place was great. I loved the colors and everything just blended so nicely. I also enjoyed the music. I danced while I waited for my food. Great experience and will definately return.
