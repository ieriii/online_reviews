We blocked off rooms for our wedding guests at the Silversmith. Not only did they give us a great rate (especially considering the location) at $169 per night, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. We assembled our wedding flowers day-of in a conference room they provided for us. Our suites were quite spacious. Our guests couldn't speak more highly of how nice the bellhops were and how centrally located the hotel was. Nothing too fancy here though - TVs are very 1998, no gadgets or extras.
