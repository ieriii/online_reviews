I must say that my experience at Anteprima was in whole a positive experience, however, there was something quintessential missing that forced me to give it only two stars. The food tasted ok enough, but it was nothing special and for the price (and small portions) you walk away paying a lot for something that was good but not phenomenal. Based on the price point you expect more. I will not be going back.
