I will say that these are the best burritos in Chicago (for me, thus far) and that I am totally down for this place any time. I am bummed that they went up in price, but that is how the economy is. I have no money and the cheap places I eat at are getting more expensive. Poo. I love eating here and taking people here. Mexi- Nachos I think they call them Chachos are AWESOME for fatty din din. The Quesadilla is great. MMMMMM I kinda want it right now.
