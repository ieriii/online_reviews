The nigiri/sashimi here was fantastically fresh and perfectly cut! (5 stars for sure!) The specialty rolls here were just okay... really nothing special (3 stars) The hamachi carpaccio appetizer was wonderful. It had hamachi with a small jalapeno slice and lime juice served with a side of mixed greens with balsamic. Recommend it! You get five slices of hamachi. We tried the spicy tuna (pretty good), volcano, some sort of crab roll, and yellowtail avo. None of these were really memorable or remarkable, but they weren't bad. Next time I'll order more sashimi/nigiri and less of the rolls. Horrible parking situation here, but 10 dollar valet available at door.
