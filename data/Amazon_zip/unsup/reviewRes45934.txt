This review is for Sunday brunch. Grand Lux Cafe is the upscale version of Cheesecake Factory (owned by same corporation). I'm not a huge fan of big chains, but you can "game" these types of establishments and make the experience work for you. Follow these steps: 1) Wake your "I'm hung over, lazy, and sleeping in" ass up. 2) Head to Grand Lux before 11am. 3) Request a seat overlooking Michigan Ave. Grand Lux has grand views for people watching. 4) Order the $7.99 breakfast: two eggs any style, crispy golden hash browns, choice of either bacon or sausage links, and toast. The sausage links are good and you get 4 pieces! 5) Order Bloody Mary's or Mimosas. 6) Now, you can drag your lazy sleepy ass back to bed or go shopping. Not bad for $20.
