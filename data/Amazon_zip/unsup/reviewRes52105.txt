Is this really as good as Chicago deep dish style pizza gets? I didn't see anything special at all about the pizza. It tasted like frozen pizza dough crust with lots of cornmeal, Hunts tomato sauce (a TON of sauce) and not the best quality cheese. Good to experience once but I'm picky with pizza as I'm from NYC. But someone please do message me and let me know where to find REALLY good Chicago style pizza on my trip there next week?
