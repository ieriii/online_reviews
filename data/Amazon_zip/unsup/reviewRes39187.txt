This is your old school Korean bbq restaurants that is almost extinct now. It's small, not very clean, charcoal grills, and is open late, so you know it's going to be good.  As a Korean, I already know my service is going to be weak especially in these kinds of places because the waitresses are not trying to be nice and polite and be all happy-go-lucky. Naw, Korean women as I know, when they're pissed and upset, they'll let you know. So you should never expect great service here, but that shouldn't ruin your experience.  As an old school Korean restaurant, you know what they should be great at. Kalbi, your jiggaes, mmul neng myuns, and of course, their unbelievable array of ban chan that comes at you like a massive force. I've never seen so much from a Korean restaurant, and usually, I like a few ban chan, but here, they give you a solid amount that is actually edible.  Prices are a little high but it's okay considering it's one of the few and only places that does kalbi right. CHARCOAL!!! Anyways, if you're feeling for some late night classic Korean food, this is your place.
