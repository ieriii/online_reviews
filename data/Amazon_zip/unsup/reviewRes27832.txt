this place kinda rules. i've been here once for dine-in (thanks to e. for introducing me!) and once i ordered a pizza for carryout. both times the deep dish pizza was excellent. i'm not a huge fan of deep dish...usually 3 or 4 is good enough for a year for me, but pequod's has changed my mind. i really like how it's not 90% cheese like most other deep dish, and this will sound silly but, the pepperoni is crispy. YES. limp pepperoni just doesn't do it for me. aside from that, the atmosphere was fun and relaxing, the service was great and the price was reasonable too. just like when i get ready to eat at pequod's, i'm saving room (to give them more stars!) just in case a closer one opens up or is a bit more accessible.
