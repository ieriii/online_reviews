In a town filled with Mexican restaurants, why Garcia's? Well, frankly because it's a block from me and open late. All of the food here is solid and slightly on the bland side. Stand-outs are the chicken burrito. Dissapointments? The vegetarian burrito is a waste of money (bland, gross) and they only offer beans of the refried variety. When you're drunkenly ordering a burrito, do yourself a favor and call ahead, otherwise you'll find yourself sliding off the wall as you wait twenty-five minutes for your food. And if it's not late and you're not drunk? Walk another block down to Los Nopales for some GREAT Mexican food.
