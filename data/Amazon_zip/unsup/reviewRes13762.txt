Truth is Glenn's really only deserves two stars for the food, but I am giving them three stars because of their fantastic wait staff. I made two trips to Glenn's, one for breakfast and the other for dinner. I ordered french toast for breakfast which I generally love, however there was this unpleasant and unidentifiable flavor lurking in the background. I was excited by the description and the creme anglaise but was disappointed with the taste of the dish. Then for dinner my friend and I ordered the halibut and the mahi mahi. The halibut was cooked well and the blue cheese sauce with horseradish was a nice accompaniment. However, the mahi mahi wasn't cooked long enough, it had retained water and I am assuming it may have not been defrosted long enough. Sadly the best thing we ordered was the brownie pie which is made by Hoosier Mama Pie Company.
