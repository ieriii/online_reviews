This place is by far my favorite in Chicago. I went with a friend for a celebration dinner. We shared the crawfish appetizer and literally ended up fork-fighting over it. Their grits are like nothing I have ever tasted, so perfect and creamy. I went about a month ago and have gone at least 3 times now. I had the violet sweet tea the last time I went and all the girls at my table ended up getting one too it was so yummy. Service is wonderful,place is nicely decorated, easy to find. I can not rave enough about it.
