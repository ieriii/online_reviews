As long as you call ahead for a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, you shouldn't have a problem getting in. They have the best salad bar, and the brunch on the weekends is awesome. Their burgers are huge and amazing, and they have a pretty decent selection of beers at the bar. Love the vintage decor and 70's music always on! Their staff is laid back and super nice, they've never messed up my order and our family has been coming back for years. Try one of their shakes!
