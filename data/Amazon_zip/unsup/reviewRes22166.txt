Nothing like a nice walk on a crisp fall evening followed by delicious Greek food. I've been to Greek Islands more times than I can count and every time I walk out satisfied and very full. This night was particularly busy, requiring a 40 minute wait, but there were spots at the bar to saddle up and have a drink before dinner. My dinner date and I shared the souvlaki, pasticio, and moussaka. The runaway favorite was the moussaka, closely followed by the pasticio. Both were very rich with all the ingredients being very distinguishable. The sides of Greek potatoes and rice were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The souvlaki was a little disappointing as it was quite dry, but still had great flavor. We were stuffed and had plenty left for leftovers. Service, as always, was fast and with a smile. The host calling me by my Greek name took me off guard, but it was pretty funny nonetheless. Free valet is great for those who drive, but it's a nice short walk from the Loop.
