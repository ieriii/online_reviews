My idea of heaven - listening to the Cure on my iPod, while buying unlimited pairs of shoes at Nordstrom and eating the Shrimp Toast from Opart......this is how I hope to spend my days in another life. I LOVE Thai food - it is nirvana for my taste buds - and I love Opart. We have been going to Opart for years and though they have gotten rather expensive ($35-$40 for delivery for 2 entrees and 2 appetizers is pricey!), I continue to need my Opart fix a few times per month. Noteworthy menu items in addition to the shrimp toast: Fresh spring rolls All the fried rices Chicken basil - magnificient! and of course the ubiquitous pad thai - nice and moist! Ahhhh...... Musaman curry - scrumptious! My partner is saying "the soup! Don't forget the SOUPS!"  Okay, okay! I never order the soups though I have tasted them and they ARE great. It is just that to me, soup is a nice food concept but a waste of time - when I am hungry, give me STARCH and MEAT and VEGGIES - not broth with all of the above floating around in it. :) My partner loves all of Opart's soups from the Tom Yum Kai (Thai hot and sour w/ chicken) to the tofu soup to Tom Ka Kai (hot and sour coconut milk soup with lemon grass and lime juice). Also they make great Thai iced tea and coffee!
