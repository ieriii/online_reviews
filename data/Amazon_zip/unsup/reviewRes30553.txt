Alright Nana. I've thought about you. Didn't hurt you made my breakfast sandwich perfect last weekend. Grits could have been less al dente. I want to straighten something out. I never left you. I always loved you. As with any great romance, expectations are a terrible thing. I just need to love you for you. Can't wait for our next dinner again, our first after a while, where I will try to remember that you are a neighborhood institution in the making and there's many more blessed years ahead together. Thank you for investing in where you live, even if it's tough love sometimes. We've been through some tough meals, but I know you've still got so much more to give. Buen provecho mi amore.
