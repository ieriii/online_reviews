This place is pretty awesome and I've taken friends here on 2 occasions first being attracted to this place because of it's affiliation next door to Wangs Bar which with it's red dark moody lighting, perfect for having a drink before dinner and then walking into right door way which is Wakamono. The service was pretty great just not stellar which is the only reason I rated it 4 stars but that could be because while we were finishing up I noticed the girls were watching our table too closely which was distracting. I'm sure they didn't mean any harm but it does make people feel like you are rushing them to finish soon. I know the standard is to clean clean and take away once each item is done but should be done so more vaguely rather than soo obvious.
