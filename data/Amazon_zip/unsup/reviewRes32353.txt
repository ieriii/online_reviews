In short I am in love. The staff here is so warm and open that I cannot wait to see them again. I ate here on Thanksgiving day, and it was packed. The restaurant was a madhouse,but every order came out timely and correct. Even during this the entire staff made everyone feel welcome.  The squash soup is not to be missed. The cheesecake is amazing, and vegan of course.
