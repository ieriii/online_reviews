The vegetarian burger was delicious and my friend loved her meal as well. I've been going here since my grade school days, and the food and service has gotten much better! The portions are also bigger and the menu has been updated. It's priced well and in a great part of town, though you may have trouble finding parking. As for the decor, I thought it was cute, but a bit folksy. Still, all in all, not a bad place for dinner!
