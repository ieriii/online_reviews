4.5 stars. Really, Yelp? Only 3.5 stars for Yolk? This place brings it hard. Just take a look at the ARMY of short order cooks pumping out perfectly cooked breakfast food that not only tastes great, but looks great too. Plus, with the level of quality this place delivers consistently it certainly doesn't break the bank. I was thrilled to live a block away. Everything I've ever gotten here, and this is a lot of stuff off their extensive menu has delivered. I have brought many friends and family here, and it has always gone over well.  Bananas Foster crepes? Red velvet cake french toast? Huge portions, not so good the next day, but delicious. Breakfast sandwich? Sure throw some pesto on there while your at it... practically perfection. Every egg dish I've ever had there... perfectly prepared. Fresh squeezed orange juice and ripe, delicious fruit scattered over everything. I'm sorry people.... get with the program on this one. I respectfully disagree. Oh, go at the right time. You WILL be waiting on Saturday and Sunday for brunch. Don't hold it against them for being great.
