I am not sure why this place has such good reviews because it was nothing exciting and quite pricey for what you get. My date and I could easily come up with ways to make every dish we tried better and more than anything the food was bland and boring. The restaurant is tiny and they pack you in so I didn't find it that cozy or comfortable. They do open up a patio in the summer, so that could be nice? The butternut squash was boring and lackluster, the brussel sprouts were minuscule (why would they break they up instead of frying them whole?), trader joes has better whipped feta/cucumber dips, the bread tasted like freezer burn, and the bean dish we got was also bland. All in all, not worth the $$.
