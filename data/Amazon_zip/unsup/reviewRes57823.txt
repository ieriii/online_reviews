AMAZING!! Fantastic food, wonderful service and a great atmosphere. The menu is very diverse and has something for everyone.I had the Nanadict which was fantastic, a great twist on the traditional eggs Benedict. My girlfriend had the Chilequilles, she loved it! Even the sides were amazing, the potatoes and scrambled eggs were good enough to be the main course.The atmosphere in restaurant was very friendly and the staff did everything in their power to insure our meal was a success.The pricing was right on par and we only waited a few moments to be seated at 11:30 on a Saturday.I will recommend Nana to all my friends.
