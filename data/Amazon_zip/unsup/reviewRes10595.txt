Yummy! We started out with a Piece microbrew "Dark Bier" and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was nothing bitter about this brew and it even had a sweet aftertaste. After two beers I felt like I wasn't going to be able to eat any pizza. It is incredibly filling. The pizza is great! We had the white pizza with spinach added to it and it was so good. The pizza frightened me a bit when it first came out, only because there was so much of it. The slices are long and one is enough to fill you up. I loved the thinner crust and the fact that the pizza had a lot of flavor. I didn't miss the sauce a bit! The establishment itself is pretty cool. The ceilings are high with wooden beams and there are skylights to give it a nice ambience. There are interesting pieces of artwork on the wall and it's overall a pleasant place to hang out, drink beer, and have fun. We will be back.
