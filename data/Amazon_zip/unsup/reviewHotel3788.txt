I come to Chgo about 1x/month on business, and stayed here for the first time just this week. Net-net, here's what you'll get: ROOM: 3 stars overall. Bathrooms (5 stars) are awesome, with terrific lighting, big mirrors, huge rain shower w/ lots of water pressure and nice amenities. Beds (2 stars) are WAY too softy-plushie, no support, bad pillows and overall not nearly as comfy as the Westin. If you have a bad back or just o/w prefer a firmer mattress, do not stay here, you'll be miserable. Lighting in room (2 stars) is extremely dim, and you have to turn on/off like 5 lamps individually to get maybe 2 candles' worth of lumens. Windows (5 stars) are beautiful though, completely floor-to-ceiling so you have a great view of the city. SERVICE: 5 stars. Valets remembered my name every time I entered/exited the hotel and addressed me as such, welcoming back and forth by name. They were prompt and courteous and overall some of the best I've experienced in any travels, anywhere. RESTAURANT: 5 stars (I only had bfasts there). Solid menu selection that includes organic foods (yay!), fast servce, courteous and professional by all, from hostess to busser to server. They understand the business traveler. FITNESS CENTER: 4 stars. I'm waffling b/w 3-4 but I'll give 'em 4. See my photos of this place, esp since the hotel website itself doesn't showcase it. Enough stuff to get a workout in, two overly fancy, overly fussy machines, but it's new and clean and has big windows and iPod plug ins. Couple quick tips: Ask for a higher floor even-numbered room and you'll get a nice view looking East (towards the lake). Whole Foods is 1/2 block around the corner on Huron, so you'll have a terrific healthy food option within spitting distance!
