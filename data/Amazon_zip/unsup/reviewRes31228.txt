Let me start by saying that this isnt a typical steakhouse review. This is a review for the seafood featured at the restaurant. My wife and I are seafood lovers and often go to steakhouses for their premium seafood selection. On the menu, the restaurants seafood options looked mouth watering. Unfortunately, it stopped there. For appetizers, we got the scallops and the tuna tartar. The scallops were doused in a very heavy cream sauce that all but runied my appetite for the main course. The tuna tartar was a tower of tuna, guac and some kind of crust base that did not make the sum better than the parts. For entrees we got the most expensive options of the menu - the sea bass and the special big eye tuna. The sea bass did not taste fresh and did not even come close to the flaky buttery fish I am used to, the big eye tuna was fantastic in quality but the flavor was unfortuantely killed by the overpowering asian seasoning. Sides were decent. All in all, not enough bang for my buck. I will not repeat.
