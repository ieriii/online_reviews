The suburban crowd apparently did not take to this concept so why is it in the city? The decor is cozy and modern chalet-esque but the food, drinks are service do not live up to the location and appearance. The staff are borderline polite (it's apparently a cool place to be so I guess you are "lucky" to get in!), the food although not bad is just average and the only redeeming factor is the roof terrace (again, it can be tough to get up there if you don't arrive early). This is not a place that I recommend at all. Perhaps the downtown location's fate will closely follow that of the suburban location.
