Vietnamese restaurant in Lincoln park served by Filipinos, cooked by Mexican while playing Spanish acoustics in the background. LOL. Okay, that was a joke so please don't take it the wrong way. But I think most of that is actually true! My boys and I had a random dinner here because it was the across the street from the local bar we were at. It totally hit the spot. The owner was so nice, he gave us free lemonade. We were literally the only customers in the restaurant. We didn't bring anything, but it's BYOB there! At the end of the day, we had a great time. Pho was on target. Service was humble and sweet. Fresh oranges for dessert. Way to end it!
