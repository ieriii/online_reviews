Been eating at Calo since before I could walk (back when they had a bowling alley!) Best thin crust pizza in Chgo, and also the best next day pizza. Can't remember having a bad meal there, had my 8th grade and high school graduation dinners there. A true neighborhood icon. The only possibly bad thing is I think the cannoli s are either made and then frozen or bought frozen. Small thing.
