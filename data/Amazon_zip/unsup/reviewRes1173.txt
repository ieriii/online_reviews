1pm Thursday, 7 minute wait. -Apple Pork Sausage w/mustard curry and melted gouda -the Dog (Chicago Dog) I just have good Hot Doug's Karma with low wait times. I really would like to see the standard Doug menu posted at least in the breezeway or outside so one can drool and peruse while waiting in line! I get heart palpitations trying to decide quickly between the Star of the Day (today was a Chipotle and Cilantro chicken sausage w/Mole) and all of the other Greatest Doug Hits!
