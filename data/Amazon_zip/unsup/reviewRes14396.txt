My brother LOVES crab and one day he forwarded me the link to Glenn's diner and asked if I wanted to check it out. My first thought was, what? all you can eat crab legs at a diner? Random but hey it sounds good. Looking at Glenn's diner from the outside, you would never picture it to be the home of a restaurant whose menu consist mostly of seafood entrees- I mean it is called Glenn's diner after all, but you are not going to find any omelettes here!  I was pleasantly surprised with Glenn's Diner. First and most importantly, their service is excellent and first class. Glenn's diner is a fairly small venue and if you are here on Tuesdays for the all you can eat crab legs, you better make a reservation. My brother and I did not know this so when we first arrived, they told my brother it was going to be at least a 20 minute wait. So we totally fine with that, but they were very apologetic for our wait and even comped an appetizer for us. The second time we came here, we came with a table of 5 and we made reservations, but since we still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, the manager made sure to comp our drinks AND she made sure that our crab legs arrived right when we are seated. The crab leg all you can eat deal is awesome, but I have to warn you in that the sodium content in these crab legs are very high. The corn and the cob that comes with the meal is crisp, sweet, and buttery, it almost made me wish they had an all you can eat corn deal too. Each time we were there, our waiter or waitress checked in with us frequently and always made sure that a new hot crab leg was brought to your plate right after you finished your old one!  I am already looking forward to the next all you can eat crab leg meal! Their other entrees also looked yummy too!
