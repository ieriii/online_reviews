I have known about the Chicago diner for a while now (as any well rounded hipster/gayster should!) and finally had the chance to stop it. My best friend had recently became a vegan and I wanted to get dinner with last night. I suggested the Chicago diner so she would have alot of options to choose from (I am not a vegan but vegan friendly). We called prior to see if it was BYOB seeing as we'd never been there before. After some confusion the woman who answered the phone informed me that "we can only bring wine", thats all she said. So we treked to Binny's and bought a nice organic cabernet and headed over. After a fifteen minute wait we were seated only to discover on the menu that they do sell wine and beer (which the waitress didnt feel necessary to mention) and that in order to drink our own wine we had to pay ten dollars (not a big issue at all but it would of been considerate for her to mention this when I had called). Regardless we forked over the ten dollars and setteled for our own wine. We had both ordered the portabello wrap - mine with spicey black beans and hers with vegan mac and cheez. The wrap was AMAZING, The spicy beans were just what they said--- quite spicy. she wasnt horribly impressed with her mac and cheez especially since a friend had told her it was her favorite dish. The waitress was rather whiney but nice and quite attentive. The food (minus the mac and cheeze) was very very good. My only issue was the lack of information provided by the waitress who had answered our initial query. Perhaps I'll alter this when I eat there again and try a new dish. Regardless I do reccomend it.
