I was entirely underwhelmed by Mercat. After having been to great tapas restaurants in Chicago, Vegas, New York, etc. I was expecting to be floored - not so much. First, it serves some of the smallest tapas I have ever seen. And thats saying something. My bf and I have found that when food arrives at our table and our first thought is - wtf that tiny thing is $40????! - we're probably not going to like it. Wish we could have known that prior to going. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates (mine had a pit it in it), the "house bread," (a overly citrusy version of bruschetta), the patatas bravas (not spicy AT ALL), some fish on the grill I forget, and the lamb in curry (which was passable). We tried the dish that the chef apparently made when he was on Iron Chef - he won the 2009-2010 season - which was a beef flatbread. All I can say is that he must have been in the bottom three that night. I recommend Caf Ba-Ba-Reba (northside), Caf Iberico, or Tapas de Valencia (south loop). Two stars for great service and a beautiful atmosphere. If you go - go later around 7:30 or 8.
