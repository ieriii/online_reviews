HUGE hotel. 3 bars, 2 restaurants, a coffee shop and gift shop. Plus lots more that I never got to see. The service: Friendly and efficient. Got upgraded to a suite at no cost. Wifi was free after signing up for the gold passport (free to sign up). Cabs constantly coming and going at the bequest of the guys out front. The room: roomy suite, very clean and a comfortable bed. Strangely the bed was a murphy bed and at first I was a little concerned about comfort but it was perfect. Great view from the 27th floor. Could hear people coming in and out of their rooms but never heard any voices, etc. Showers had excellent water pressure. The food: Got drinks at Big Bar (Not too impressed), dinner and drinks at the Irish pub (service was excellent, food so-so). Starbucks at the coffee shop was $$$ but didn't expect much different. Breakfast buffet came with our room price otherwise I'd never go there ($25 a person for the buffet). However food was good and service was amazing.
