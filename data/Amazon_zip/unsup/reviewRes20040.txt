BYOB, which is always good. Odd however - they told us 3 times on the phone about the policy of only 1 bottle of wine, sake, or 6 pack of beer per couple. Several other couples had wine and beer... a clear violation of policy that was so important it had to be said three times, and repeated on arrival. Not sure how you get in the special exception club, but whatever! Place was very crowded. We had a 9 PM reservation, and arrived 15 minutes early. They stated, we can seat you in 10 minutes. Wonderful!!! Finally, 25 minutes later - at 10 after we get seated... No where to sit and wait. Had to stand, and there were tons of people.  Obviously very popular restaurant. The food was very average. Pricing average. Two of us ate for about $65. Sushi portions small.  Nothing very special about this place. Just a regular good sushi joint.
