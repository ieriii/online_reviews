As half the battle here is simply getting a return phone call from Michael, my March '09 visit has to been seen as a major success...suppose it helps, too, that the meal itself was, if nothing else, entirely fascinating. That it was only slightly memorable seems irrelevant, no? I must say I found it ironic that most of the successful dishes of the night were really nouvelle concepts--see the quail egg ravioli, sunchoke soup--whose sheer conceit was richness; they seemed to contradict the whole vibe and ethos of the place. Having said that, I loved the sweetbreads/parsnip custard dessert that I presume is universally loathed: it's such a bold deconstruction of dessert in general and cracker jacks (!) specifically. I might suggest waiting until the late spring to book; the menu should be more exciting with the arrival of fresh produce. Then again, at the going rate--they are underbooking and still had 10 no-shows the night I was there--I don't see how even this place, bizarre economics and all, can last, so you may want to stick close to the ringer.
