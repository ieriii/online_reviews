Amazing Dogs! Vesuvial, and satisfying garlic belches all the way home had me leaning my head out the window to avoid asphixiating the other passengers...and I loved every gaseous bit of it. These guys do great stuff. On a trip to Chicago that featured a few ell-known, downtown fine dining establishments, Doug's was the culinary standout of our visit. The garlic pork sausage with horseradish and cheese, and the traditoinal Chicago dog, duck fries, and a neon green soda of some sort made for a most memorable lunch.  This will become a regular stop on our visits to Chicago, and in spite of pleadings to the contrary, I will continue to consume the garlic-pork concoction.
