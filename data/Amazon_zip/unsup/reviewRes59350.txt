LIke many others, we've loved F&O since moving to Streeterville in 2003. However, In the last few years it has declined in so many ways. Sorry to see it folding.   Today's experience:  We've bought French jambon madrange (ham) regularly for years. But this spring, each time we've gotten it (at the deli) it has been of inferior quality compared to prior years. Today it had hard spots (sign of poor quality), odd coloring, open spaces(large holes), and was shredded/stretched along the edges -- as if the meat slicer was sticky, gummy, not cleaned, and had stretched it. We always ask to have it cut thicker, not shaved, so we do notice these changes. I think if you accept their pre-shaved stuff you won't notice these defects in quality (they hope?). This pricey ham should be "gourmet" quality, and for years it was. Not now.   Worst example of F&O's current attitude: hot dog buns are 4 for $2.99, but they only had 2, so charged $1.99, not $1.50. Bakery explained that it's policy to charge more when they don't have four in the bag (these are pre-bagged items, not sold individually). Nice way to treat any customer, especially a neighborhood regular. We have many other great choices of places to shop and other places seem to care more than F&O does these days. No meunster cheese, no baby swiss, on and on. Never know what they won't have in stock so cannot plan a menu.    Suggest people pay close attention to sell by dates, opened items, and to see if the meat and cheese slicers are clean. Inspect with care.
