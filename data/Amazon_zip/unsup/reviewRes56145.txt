I agree with Scott A.'s review. Good food, but not good service. I live in the neighborhood and had been wanting to try this place for so long. I walked in on a Sunday morning and it wasn't very crowded. After being seated at a table it took about 10 minutes before anyone even came over to see if I wanted any coffee or a water. After ordering my coffee (which was good!), it took another 15 minutes before someone came back to take my food order. I ordered the eggs, ricotta cheese and merguez crepe which was really good, but they were a little skimpy on the potatoes and fruit. After I finished it took another long while before I finally received my check. What I thought would be a quick bite to eat on a Sunday morning since it wasn't very crowded, ended up taking about 45 minutes.
