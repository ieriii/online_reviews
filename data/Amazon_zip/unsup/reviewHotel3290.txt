Carrie M.'s response to my review on 3/2/12 indicated that the Hard Rock Hotel wanted an opportunity to "rectify the situation" and suggested I send an e-mail with additional info. I did so and have not received any response in 3 weeks. I can only conclude that her offer was a face-saving exercise to provide the appearance of responsiveness to Yelp users. Nice customer service -- making a bad situation worse.
