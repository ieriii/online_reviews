Cozy, good music, food is excellent. Coffee here was weak, but our brunch was really good. The stuffed french toast is epic. Service is quick, seating for two seems to never be a major issue. They won't seat you unless your entire party is there, though, which is how we were seated within 15 minutes (lots of people trying to sneak their names in). I love that policy.
