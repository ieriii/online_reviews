I have to say I think Pequod's is a little over-rated. The caramelized crust is excellent, but it's only on the edges of the pizza. The rest of the crust is too dry and pales in comparison to other great deep dishes in the city. It's certainly edible and if I lived down the street I'd be happy to pick up a pie and bring it home, but it's hardly a pizza destination restaurant.
