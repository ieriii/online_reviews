My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our night out in the city to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary a few weeks ago and had a great experience!! Check-in at the hotel was easy and smooth. When we got up to our room we were SHOCKED to discover we had been upgraded to a penthouse from a regular king room (lucky break for a couple celebrating their anniversary!) The room was bright, clean, and well furnished. It is clear that the hotel will be in need of renovations within the next few years but it was still a lovely room and for the price, it was more than was expected. Our only complaint would be that our neighbords were playing their music VERY loudly in the middle of the night and we could hear it almost clear as day. However, we called the front desk and security had handled the situation within 10 minutes. Overall, good experience and would stay here again.
