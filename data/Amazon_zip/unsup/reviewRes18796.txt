This is our new favorite neighborhood bar! Their burgers are top notch. They have so many different styles/toppings. My favorite is the Frenchie which comes with brie cheese, spinach, truffle and frizzled red onions. YUM!!!!!! Get it on the pretzel bun too. And the fries are amazing. Fresh cut, thick, and salty; it doesn't get any better than that. I am also huge fan of the fried cheese curds. It's a fun place to go for a drink at the bar too. They also have shuffleboard in the back room. Check it out!
