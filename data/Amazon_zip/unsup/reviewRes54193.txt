Wow, what a find! I always drive by this place and always see a line out the door, so I figured, what the heck, why not check it out.First the negatives: The wait is long. The place is BYOB which I love, but there is no place to have a drink while you wait despite the many signs that say no drinking while you wait.  When we were finally sat, we asked for some glasses for our wine, and they brought us these 32 oz plastic cups...We asked for wine glasses or smaller glassware, but they said they didn't have any. This place really needs to get some glasses. Ok, thats it for the negatives.Now for the positives, the server was super nice. We started with empanadas. We mixed and matched some beef ones, some sweet potato ones and some chicken ones. These were bomb, especially the sweet potato ones...those melt in your mouth! Next time, I will probably eat a plate of ten of those and nothing else! I got the chicken burrito, which was OK. It probably would have been amazing if I hadn't just finished eating empanadas. Will definately be back!
