Love the decor!! I've had tea here with a client of mine who just happened to stay here on her business trips. I absolutely Love this hotel. I've been here so much I believe the Service Staff are getting to know me personally (they know that I love black current Tea or just classic V/T's for coctails) .. The decor is really nice and the service is fantastic! ..
