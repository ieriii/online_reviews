We went to Publican with two friends who frequent the place quite a bit. I must say that everything was wonderful...even the food I don't normally enjoy (smoked salmon, in a hash) or have never tried (oysters). Our waiter did an excellent job pairing beers with our courses. My only complaint would be the noise level, but it's a big, open, wooden space, so what can you expect? Also, the portions were really small for the prices, but the quality definitely justified the price tag. We're returning Sunday for their beer dinner...can't wait!
