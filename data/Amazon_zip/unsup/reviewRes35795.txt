My co-workers and I regularly hit Shaw's after work on Thursday nights. We sit on the bar side and have a great time ordering martinis and more and more delicious seafood as the evening wears on. Shaw's led me to a love of oysters and that was a heroic feat. My only complaint? Why have a jazz band playing if the managers are going to repeatedly tell them to play/sing quieter? I understand the whole deal with lessening the noise for the patrons on the other side of the restaurants but it seems silly to have a band and then tell them to play at conversation level. Otherwise Shaw's is A+ to me!
