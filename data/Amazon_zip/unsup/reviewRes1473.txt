OMG this place is absolutely ridiculous. It took us 2 hours to walk/bus/metro it here, then we waited 50 minutes in line, but it was ACTUALLY worth it to eat these sausages. We got the Uber Garlic Pork Sausage (chipotle dijonnaise, vintage cheddar cheese and roasted garlic cloves) and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris). Obviously not the most healthy choices for mid-afternoon meal, but hey. The flavors were perfect. The textures were wonderful. Doug was a sweet happy man. It was a ridiculously decadent and flavorful meal, except it was not a duck fat fries day.... PS they have really weird hours. But they can do whatever they want, they're Hot Doug's.
