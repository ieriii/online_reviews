I've been to Icosium a few times now. I love their coffee and that the water comes with a sprig of mint. The crepes are pretty good (not perfect to me, as I like thinner crepes) with great fillings. The servers are friendly but sometimes it takes a little work to get your order in. The only time it's bothered me was on a hot day when I had to go up to the register and request water after waiting for ten minutes. Other than that you just get the sense the waiters will come when they know you're ready, and again they're very friendly once they do come around. Overall great, though if you expect lots of attention from your server maybe avoid peak hours.
