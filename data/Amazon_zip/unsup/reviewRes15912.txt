The older I get the harder it is to have a good time. You get too persnickety, too particular about everything. Too jaded. And then we stopped at Calo's late on a Thursday afternoon.  Everything was perfect. No Sinatra but everything else was all right. A big leather booth, dim lighting made us both look good, soft music, an attentive server, yummy appetizers and a delicious dinner.  What else can a body ask for?
