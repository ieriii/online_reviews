Our experience can be summed up in one word... Alejandro. His hospitality and warmth made the trip worth while. He even mentioned his wonderful daughters during our dinner, and we felt as if we were part of his family when we left. We will be back for sure, not just for Alejandro, but for the food and the margaritas. We had two pitchers of margaritas, one was Jamaican Flower, and the other was a mango strawberry mix, I think both were amazing, and got us a little drunk. The food was top notch, had the guacamole and chips for an appeitizer. If you get a chance to go, make sure you go to a table where Alejandro is waiting on you.
