The service at Fox and Obel is terrible. One employee at the bakery section always pretends to be busy so she does not have to slice my bread. The customer service counter has rude employees who don't listen to what the issue is. They seem to like to talk amongst themselves rather than work. One cashier is out of tune to what is happening. She can hold up the line for 1 customer while others wait and has no sense of time. BTW, the sushi is fake. And the prepared food section is essentially high priced left-overs.
