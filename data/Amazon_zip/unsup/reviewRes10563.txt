I wanted to love this place and guess what? I DO! I really do! Initially I was a bit skeptical about going to Piece, all I could think about was the Real World and I wanted NO part in that S**t show. No way No how! I got over it and checked out Piece and boy am I glad I did. I went to Piece for a going away party a few years back so you know we had to check out the beer. I ordered the Golden Arm, hands down the best beer I have ever had. I don't know what made it great as I don't know too much about beer but I know good when I taste it...and it was mmm mmmm good. After tasting the beer I couldn't care less about the pizza...that is, until I tasted it. Yeah BUDDY! Another hit! My favorite pizza is the red Pizza topped with Mushrooms, garlic and sausage. Let's not forget about the less conventional white pizza; also amazing. The crust is perfectly made and the fresh ingredients complement each other. I suggest trying both a red and white pizza, worth every penny. Everyone knows that Pizza and Beer go together but Piece does it much better than most. Hand crafted brew along with hand crafted pizza...who could ask for anything more. Now, with all that said...this place is always packed. Don't expect to come in and sit right down. Instead, expect to enjoy a couple of beers and good conversation while waiting for your table. But believe me when I say...Piece is well worth the wait.
