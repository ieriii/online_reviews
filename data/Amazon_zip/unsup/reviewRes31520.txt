2 Stars for being a vegetarian diner. 1 additional star for the food. I didn't eat there so I don't know much about the atmosphere and staff. From what I could tell, it seemed prety cozy, and the wait staff were prety attentive to those who were seated. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger with sweet potato fries on the side. I'm a sucker for sweet potato anything. The fries were great! The burger, on the other hand, was average. I wasn't feeling the rice patty too much. It seemed quite flavorless. The vegetarian burger at RJ Grunts is much better!
