After multiple times visiting here, I just don't understand what all the hype is over this place. There are plenty of other Mexican joints in the City and in Pilsen that have better food. I wasn't impressed with their complimentary soup, nachos were greasy, and my combination platter was thrown together and allowed me to use my imagination to determine what the items were. The service was rushed and then took forever to get a bill which I totally understand (they were packed). I don't care for my appetizer coming before the lunch and I basically would much rather try a different Mexican place. This restaurant has a huge following but I don't understand why?
