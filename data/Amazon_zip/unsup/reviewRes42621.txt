There is a food category in my mind that is filled with over the top goodness. I'm talking about items that you know you shouldn't eat very often for health reasons... rich and luxurious... overly fatty and oozing with 200% flavor... sinfully irresistible. I ended up tapping into this category twice in one night a when I ate at Gilt Bar. I definitely could not resist getting roasted bone marrow on toast. So flavorful, so fatty, so tasty. The marrow just melts in your mouth. The bone marrow here did not disappoint. It was mouthwateringly good. We also ended up getting a steak that was on special. A nice big fatty piece of ribeye. Wet aged about 20~25 days and bursting with flavor. It definitely hit the spot. The serving size is plentiful so don't order too much. Chef Brendan Sodikoff has done a really good job with this gastropub.
