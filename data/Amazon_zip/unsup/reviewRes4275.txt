I came here back in January with a group of 8, not knowing how this place works. I didn't know it was normal to share your table with strangers and I did not know you should get there early if you want to get a decent seat for a huge party. Sad to say, we wound up leaving after being there for 10 minutes On Friday a good friend thought it would be a good idea to check it out. We hopped on the red line and it let us off, right by the club. It was about 7:30 when we arrived and there was pretty good seating available. We paid the $12 cover and ordered some not too expensive drinks (great makers & coke here). We were treated to the sounds of the Victor Goines Quartet: Victor Goins (sax), Dana Hall (drums), Melina Rosenburg (bass) and Brian Cohen (piano). They provided us with some of the best jazz tunes I have ever heard. This place is truly legendary. This place has been around forever and Alphonse Capone was once a frequent visitor here. I love the bright marquee at the entrance and made sure I took a pic in front of it. Very classy 1930's feel on the inside and they tell you to shut off your cell phone and be quiet while the band is playing. This is a great place and a must do for all Chicagoans that love jazz as well as visitors/tourists.
