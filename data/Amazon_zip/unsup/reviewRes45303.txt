I've been here twice. The first time I was seated at the small table near the door and forgotten about. We left furious at the horrific service. For some reason I went back with a different group of people, and Wilde succeeded in redeeming itself and more! The burger and fries were good. The onion rings looked amazing, and my friend gave good reviews of the pot pie. The beer list is very large, and most importantly--our waitress was very good.
