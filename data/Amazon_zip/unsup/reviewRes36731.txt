The servers were sweet and quick... I ordered a BLT Benedict from the daily specials menu, it came with a side of potatoes and pineapple. The potatoes were prepared and seasoned well and the pineapple was fresh; however the BLT Benedict was insulting. It did not have the traditional hollandaise sauce, instead they put store bought salsa on it - gross! The baby greens were soggy, one of the pouched eggs was over cooked, the bread was stale and there was no seasoning at all so it was bland. I think its awesome to take risks with food and do things that are not traditional but this time it was fail.
