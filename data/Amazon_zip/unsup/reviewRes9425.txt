Surprisingly easy to get a table on a Fri nite (granted it was 9p already), Le Colonial, while a mini-chain (NY, SF), manages to convincingly transport you to a distant time where you might believe you are in high society Vietnam. The staff are dressed in traditional Vietnamese garb, although the uniforms looked a bit small on some people. We were promptly seated on the balcony...as I looked around, the crowd looked distinctly (but uniformly) Viagra-esque, not that surprisingly considering the proximity to Division St. The reputation for being romantic wasn't lost on me...lots of candlelight and flowery ornaments were everywhere. When I looked at the menu, I was somewhat surprised. Having not been here since a company event many years ago, most entrees were priced in the low-high 20s, not completely astronomical. It was only a mini dinner though. My companion enjoyed the soup/appetizer portioned pho, although there was definitely too much rice noodle in it for such a small bowl. My entry, the sauteed diced filet mignon was excellent for what it was. I have to agree with Meredith B, the desserts menu was pretty boring, considering the rest of the menu was Vietnamese fusion with heavy French influences. As far as drinks go, I got a complaint about a lack of champagne options...and when my bill came I was caught a bit unawares of the NY+ premium pricing on my Macallan 12: 17 bucks! That aside, Le Colonial is a pretty good place for a date, will have to return at a later date to consume a full meal here.
