This hotel used to be the Radisson, which I avoided. Completely remodeled, rebranded, and opened under the name Avenue Hotel, the rooms are luxurious and modern. The upper floor suites have beautiful views of Lake Michigan and the location cannot be beat. I travel and stay frequently in downtown Chicago and this is my first pick of hotels I stay in the area due to higher-end comfort and services at reasonable prices.
