As a frequent visitor to Chicago, I have passed by Gino's many times and seen long lines at its doors. Regardless of the weather, there are always people lined up to eat at Gino's.  One night, my girlfriend and I decided to try it to see what the fuss was about. We came after 9:30 on a Saturday and there was no wait.  I was so glad we tried Gino's deep dish!  Our server that evening was very attentive and friendly. We ordered a combo platter as an appetizer, to eat while waiting 45 minutes for our pizza. After my first bite of the Supreme pizza, I kind of wished that we didn't order an appetizer so we could have more room for pizza. The Supreme was extremely flavorful, and cheesy! I had left over pizza the next day and it was almost as good as it was fresh out of the oven!   The only other Chicago deep dish I have tried is Lou Malnati's, and Gino's was a lot more memorable. I cannot wait for my next trip to Chicago to eat at Gino's again.
