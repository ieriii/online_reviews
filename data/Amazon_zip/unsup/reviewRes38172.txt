I like beer. I like beer a lot. Strike that. I love beer. It can be as complex as any wine and get you messed up all the same. I met friends here for a drink, what happened was I fell in love. When I saw the tap list, time stood still, my mouth became dry, my eyes widen and I couldn't think straight. I finally decided to ease into this experience with an Anchor Steam. Then I tried a Brother Thelonious. Then I noticed that I was just looking at their tap list, they have an amazing list of over 200+ beers from Europe and micro brews. Not only that, they have an amazing food selection, (but the only thing I ate was a pom frite, so I don't want to comment on that until I really eat there), and the atmosphere is a little smokey, but for the beer selection I can suffer until 2008!
