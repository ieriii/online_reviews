Saturday after an outing with the girls, we decided to try to get into Frontera Grill since it was 10:30p. I had been wanting to go to Frontera Grill for the longest but refused to wait in such long lines to get in since they don't take reservations. Luckily, they seated us ...we were thrilled since we Love Rick Bayless. Pros/Cons: Pros - Loved the atmosphere and the wait staff. Very knowledgeable and friendly. Cons: Quantity and Price. Going into this place, I knew that the price would be a little steep but assumed that for the price I would leave with a full belly. Boy was I wrong!!! I got the Tacos el Carbon with Steak. It was very flavorful but the meat was barely enough for 2 tacos. It seems as though it was more onions than meat. They served the tacos with a big bowl of beans and a side of guacamole. Both the guacamole and beans were good but for $17.50...I wanted more meat in my tacos. I found myself eating the beans which is something that I never do because I was still hungry. Very disappointing! I might give it a try again knowing that I would probably have to stop somewhere else to get full or come when I'm not really all that hungry.
