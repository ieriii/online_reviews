I knew I wanted some good Chicago-style pizza while I was out in the windy city, and I'm glad I found it at Giordano's. It was exactly what I hoped it would be, and I enjoyed every bite of it. Their thin crust was pretty good, too! I wish their pepperoni had been better. It was fine, it just wasn't anything special. This isn't a place to go to for the atmosphere, so don't be disappointed. What is disappointing is how cold this place is! It's Chicago- half of the joy of going anywhere in the winter is that it'll be heated. If not half of the joy, then maybe more like three quarters. I almost put my coat back on! And the service is a little slow- yeah, they tell you the pies take a while, but there was no note on the menu that it would take almost just as long for us to find someone to get us our check. Anyway, but the point is the next time I'm out in Chicago and really craving some deep-dish pizza, I will definitely keep Giordano's on the list of places to go.
