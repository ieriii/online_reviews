The two best things about Cafe 28-It's proximity to the Irving Park Brown Line stop and they have great Mojitos. I guess I'll have to try their brunch. I went to Cafe 28 for dinner recently and was not very impressed. We had the green tamale appetizer, I had the Cuban style chicken and my date had the Cuban roasted pork. One word to describe the meal: bland. I actually had to salt some of it (I hate to have to do that in restaurants) and once you took off the only-partially crispy chicken skin, the breast was DRY and had NO Cuban flavors whatsoever. It was served with a garlic sauce that was very mild and thin. The beans and rice were gummy too. Bright spots of the dinner was the complimentary bread and (spiced) butter and the plantains. The service was...ok. It was a little slow. I ordered a refill on my drink and was finished with the rest of my meal before it came. :-/ I might come back to try their brunch but otherwise...I'll go elsewhere.
