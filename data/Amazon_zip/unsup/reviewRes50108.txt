I must say, I prefer the hipster joints in Wicker Park over the sporty/douchy crowd. The food here is a different story. At $11, the Hell burger is a bit pricey but well worth it. Spicy cheese, fresh jalapenos and a vicious habanero salsa make this sandwich hotter than Ana Ivanovic. The waffle fries were crispy and fresh. Great service here: the bartender even offered me a much needed free glass of milk to neutralize the heat still lingering in my mouth.
