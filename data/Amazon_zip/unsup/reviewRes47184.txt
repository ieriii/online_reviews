Apparently Lockdown Bar is known for their burgers. Unfortunately, I did not order one. Otherwise I might have had a better experience.  I found the no-separate checks policy to be unduly restrictive.  The restrooms are surprisingly small.  The waitress was friendly, but she forgot my water when I was REALLY thirsty after a game of basketball. It's not her fault I was thirsty, but I was frustrated nonetheless.  The reuben sandwich was HUGE, but it was also a bit expensive ($12). The meat was succulent and seasoned well, but it was bit tough for sandwich meat.  The mac & cheese side was delicious. They sprinkle shredded cheese over the thick cheese sauce. The sauce itself has an assortment of herbs & spices mixed in. They charge extra, however, for the mac & cheese side ($2) which surprised me when the bill came. I might have overlooked that fact on the menu so read carefully before ordering.
