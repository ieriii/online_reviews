The only reason this restaurant even warrants two stars for me, is the food was fine. Let me just say that a poorly trained, unfriendly wait staff can truly ruin a dining experience. We waited at our table for ten minutes before a waitress came to the table and asked, did anyone take your order? I told her no, and that we'd never been there before. She left...no, can I answer some questions for you...Boy, we were apparentley putting her out by our mere presence. When asked how the bone marrow was prepared, the answer received (while one of our three waitresses rolled her eyes) was in the oven....(pause)...melted ...REALLY?? My daughter asked waitress # 3 how long the bone marrow is roasted for....she seemed to storm off, come back, and answered 10 minutes. Hmmmm. By the way, they have some informative food glossaries handing over the communal tables, but don't ask to see a copy at your table...there are no copies, (and I got the distinct impression that I was stupid to ask)....I could go on and on, but I'm getting too aggravated!!! I DO want to mention that the bus staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.
