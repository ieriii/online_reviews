Went back here to crave my sushi needs! Ordered the following... 1. White Scorpian - YUMMY!!! It's pricey at $14 a roll, but it's def. the most tasty roll we ate tonight. 2. Spicy sake - ehh.. wasn't spicy at all, plus small pieces of salmon inside. 3. Crazy chicago - once again ehhh.. nothing special. Has cucumber, salmon, and tuna; but once placed in your mouth, nothing stands out. 4. Monte Carlo - The white fish, which didn't seem to be cut correctly (it was big chunks vs. nice tender slices) was kinda hard. Plus the salmon piece inside was tiny! For the price ($12), I would not get again. 5. 2 orders of Sake sashimi - good, big, and nicely cut. Total bill with tip was around $65 for two people. Unfortunately, this is the best place between 4800 N to 5800 N compared to Agami and dib.
