We visited Opart Thai House last Sunday. The food took a while to arrive, but we appreciated that the cook believed us when we asked for a spicy preparation. The Kuay Tiew Kee Mao (with tofu) was pretty good, but there was too much nearly-raw cabbage for our taste. The Peanut Sauce Lover (also with tofu) was outstanding! The Thai Iced Coffee was average.
