While heading to have breakfast at Meli on a weekend morning it was decided we would skip the line and head for the bakery across the street.  It was a very wise decision!  After trying most of the breakfast items i have decided my favorite is the greek yogurt with fruit and honey (before i gave up meat it was the red pepper, ham, egg and cheese pie). For lunch you can not go wrong with the salads! I have never had dinner here, but would assume the fare is delightful.  No matter what you eat make sure you save room for dessert!!!! Don't tell anyone, but I am pretty sure I have tried each and every one of their sinful desserts! Just last night I had the opera cake, which is now in my top 3 favorites! The other 2 best desserts (in my opinion) are the Symphony and Valhrona cakes. Obviously, I am a fan of chocolate but they also have an assortment of fruit filled pastries, cookies, baklava and much more! I also frequent this place to substitute my daily cup o joe for a frappe! (make sure you have a bite to eat or you will get the shakes from this caffeine buzz!) Oh and they sell WINE IN A CAN!!!! Next time I go on a picnic, i am stopping here for bread, wine and cookies!!!
