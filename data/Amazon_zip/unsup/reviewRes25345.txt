Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago is a tough call because they are all very good. There are two things I'd like to highlight about this place. The crust and the speed of the pizza coming out to the table. Some of the competition take an hour and my pizza did not feel like it took this long.  The sauce might not be a rich tomato based say like Uno's, but overall I think this might be my new favorite overall. I still have Gino's and Lou malnati's to try. I would definitely come back to enjoy again!
