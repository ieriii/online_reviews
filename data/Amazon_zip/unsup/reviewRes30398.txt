I came here on a weekend vacation to Chicago last Thanksgiving, while visiting a friend. Both being long-time vegans, we stopped here for dinner on my first night in town. During a rough time in my life earlier that summer, to cheer me up and have a good talk, one of my best gals from Ann Arbor (where I lived at the time) had taken me to Whole Foods for lattes and vegan cheesecake that happened to be made by the Chicago Diner. So I'd had a little experience with their awesomeness. The place is cool. It definitely has a diner atmosphere, but in a more upscale way. And I dig upscale diners, so it worked out well. I ordered a "Chicken Caesar" wrap (which was actually a wrap made with lettuce, seitan, and a house-made vegan Caesar dressing). It was pretty decent as far as wraps go, although it was a little dry and our waitress never stopped back before dropping off the check, so I never had the opportunity to ask for more dressing. Apart from that minor bummer, though, it was an overall good experience and if I'm ever back in Chicago, this spot is totally on my list of spots to grab a bite to eat.
