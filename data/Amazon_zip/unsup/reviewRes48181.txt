Weird, I wrote a review, but it disappeared. I'll keep it short. This place is pronounced Publican like Republican, not like Pubic Bone. Oysters awesome. Waiter gave great recommendations for everything. 'Homemade' Lambic beer was way too sour, almost undrinkable - he tried to warn me. Sweetbreads and brains had a similar flavor/texture - preferred the sweetbreads. Pork rinds great - esp for sharing. Really should've tried more of the pork dishes - like belly and other.
