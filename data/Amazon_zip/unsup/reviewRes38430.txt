If you're looking for good food and pint in a warm pub atmosphere, head on down to the Hopleaf. Although they boast a wide variety of Belgium beers on tap, they also have all the local favs -- including Bell's. The husband and I sampled way too much of the menu and walked away feeling that the moules & frites stole the show (fries: crispy -- mussels: sop up the broth with the bread!). If only I LIVED in Chicago so I could frequent this joint.
