4.5 stars. Not as blown away from these sausages as everyone else is, but I liked the creativity and the variety of options that you can get here. The duck sausages, pork sausages, and the regular hot dogs here are all top notch. Some of the pairings work better than others, but of course, much of the food is based on your own taste. I thought the fries here were very good, and thus, rounding up to 5 stars. Doug is a very friendly guy and usually taking orders at the counter. Cash only folks.
