Whenever I've been the service has been just fine. Maybe other reviewers have been unlucky. I always order the Icosium crepe. It's always delicious and I love the soup they give you to start. My only complaint is that you don't get very much food. $10 for 1 crepe that isn't stocked full makes me only come here once in a while. My husband and I usually have to order a dessert crepe too and we are usually still a little hungry. Maybe we are just pigs :) It's a bit pricey for 1 crepe and I have found that I can make just as good of a crepe at home and can eat as many as I want! That's the reason I only go there once or twice a year! Still delish though!
