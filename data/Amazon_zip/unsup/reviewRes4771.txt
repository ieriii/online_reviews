Not my cup of tea. My friend and I stumbled into this place while celebrating St. Patty day in the city. Although it was busy, we didn't have to wait long to be seated. The seating arrangement is somewhat awkward since you could be seating at the same table with people you don't know. With all the hype and ratings, I had high expectation for this place. However, the food was rather disappointing. We ordered Pig's Ear (it tasted like thinly onion ring and a bit too greasy); Bone Marrow (I'm a big fan of bone marrow and I wasn't impressed. It tasted like nothing); Slider (this was decent dish), Pork Shoulder (this was tender and had lots of flavor, but the sauce was too heavy for me). After the meal, I seriously felt so gross. The food is not bad but it wasn't great. Maybe I tried the wrong dishes???
