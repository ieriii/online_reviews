Haters, please note: 1. This is a huge restaurant located on Michigan Avenue. It will always, always be full of tourists. 2. This is the sister restaurant to Cheesecake Factory, so expect the same exact kind of food. The menu is enormous, the food is good not great, the prices are a little high but the portions are HUGE. Split some entrees or order only appetizers, and you'll have a completely reasonable bill. I personally enjoyed the Stacked Chicken Quesadilla (huge and delicious!), the Duck Potstickers (unique and tasty), and the classic New Orleans Beignets (think warm, gooey fried dough with three really yummy sauces). And the views of Michigan Avenue can't be beat! This is a fun tourist-y place to visit every once in awhile.
