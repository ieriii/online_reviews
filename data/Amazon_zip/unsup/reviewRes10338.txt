I've noticed several reviews here are for the restaurant, "Piece", whereas "Piece Out" is their carry-out/delivery section. Obviously there is an overlap in that the food is relatively the same, but pay attention, please. For the sake of organization on yelp. I picked up a pizza to share. Yes, I walked into the wrong door for pick up and a server corrected me to go next door. That's why you have to pay attention. "Piece Out" is for delivery and pick-up. Anyway, the pizza was the Red style, all spinach, half sausage. The customer service was 5 star, but the pizza only 3 stars. Unfortunately, this doesn't average to 4 stars, because taste of food carries more weight in my book. Salty and chewy. Have you ever craved something salty and chewy? In the rare event that you do, go to Piece/Piece Out. It was so disappointing because the pizza looked great, the spinach was still bright green and fresh, and smelled irresistible in my car, but in my mouth..way to salty for way too many chews. Like a salty gummy bear. On the plus side, it wasn't too greasy. I bet you next time I watch my sodium intake I'll crave this pizza after one week. I just want to chew on a lot of salt in my mouth. I don't know, I tend to not give up on people so I will probably try their specialty New Haven pizza at some point, but if I'm going to eat unhealthfully, it better be good.
