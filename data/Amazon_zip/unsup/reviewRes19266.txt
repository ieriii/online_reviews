Have been to The Gage twice now - once for lunch and once for a company-wide dinner - and both instances were fantastic. Last night's meal consisted of many appetizers (the plump and juicy mussels, spicy scotch egg, melt-in-your-mouth caramelized lobster with quinoa, seared fair haven scallops, and Michigan-farmed braised goat) and a smattering of entrees - from the lamb to the tuna to the fish and chips to the halibut. Wine (a cabernet sauv from Napa) paired nicely with our various mains; Green Line pale ale won over the Brits; and dessert - beignets, beignets, beignets - capped off a lovely meal. Will be back - and maybe next time we'll finish our Gage tour with brunch.
