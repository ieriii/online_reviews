After living in Chicago for almost seven years, I finally finally made it to Hot Doug's. I think I am rating it five stars just because it is just as good as everyone says! I went with three other friends. I would suggest going with this many people because it means you can try more different types! We ordered the following: Duck sausage and foie gras - my fav! they really are generous with the foie gras and if that is not rich enough, they top it off with a little creamy sauce...YUM! Smoked crayfish and pork sausage - I know it doesn't sound that good, but this was suprisingly delicious! It was my second fav, it comes topped with a generous topping of goat cheese, and the combination of flavors will wow you!! I was actually least excited to try this one, and it turned out being one of the best ones!! Smoked Portuguese Linguica - a little spicy, comes with some yummy sauce, you can't go wrong with this one either if you are looking for a sausage with a spicy and different flavor Ginger spiked rabbit sausage - wasn't gamey at all, not sure if it is was because it was ginger spiked but it just tasted kinda weird to me, one bite was enough for this one. Chicken and spinach sausage - sounds boring but it was really good! Can't go wrong with this one either. And the polish and chili dogs were your run of the mill hot dogs, still tasty but definitely overshadowed by the other crazy flavors! And we got THREE orders of duck fat fries. Not sure if it was because I knew they were fried in duck fat but they seem extra good to me, slightly crispy on the outside, a little mushy on the inside. I even ate a lot of them without ketchup!
