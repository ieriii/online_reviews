When I read the reviews of this place before it opened I wanted to write a 1 star since it took an extended amount of time to open and to counter the fluff reviews that should have not been allowed... Well opening day came, it was packed but all the staff was really friendly and they handled the crowd quite well. I have been back numerous times and have always been pretty happy. As far as the food goes, it is pretty good. The burgers I have tried are good, but the workingman burger is great. The fish and chips I thought were blah. The beef stew was overly sweet and did not really taste much like beef. Mussels in ale are very good. Beers have always been good. The only thing that irks me here is the "workingman" theme... I workingman burger and beer will set you back about 17$ plus tip at lunch time which is a bit pricey. They should offer it at $10 or something for a lunch special. I am glad they opened, and will continue to spend money here.
