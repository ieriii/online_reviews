I dream about this place. Yeah, I'm trying to get back on a business trip to Chicago just so I can go back to this restaurant. I went with a group of colleagues. We had soup, appetizers, wine, entrees, dessert and then euphoria! Yes, it is a bit pricey but it is an upscale dining experience. The acoustics were our only complaint here. When the tables are filled, the noise level is uncomfortably too much but the food is incredibly worth it! Go early and dine on the covered upper patio. It looked so charming that I wish I hadn't been with such a large crowd. The service was great and did I mention the food?? Try the soup!!!! I'll be back!!!
