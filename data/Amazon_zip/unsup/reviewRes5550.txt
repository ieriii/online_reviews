This was a fun restaurant to go to on Michigan Ave, right next to the Nordstrom Mall. We showed up a little before 8pm, and ended up waiting an hour or so for a table. We didn't mind because we weren't in a rush, and were able to pass some of the time easily shopping at Nordstrom and also hanging out for a drink at their outside waiting area, which overlooks Illinois St. We got a table outside and had a very friendly waiter named Patrick who made the experience even more enjoyable with a knowledgable take on both the menu and wines. Had the Lingua Agrodolce (husband enjoyed it - it was a little "rich" for me), and a selection of 3 cheeses - podda (standout), delice de bourgogne, quadrello di bufala to star tout. The other small plates we enjoyed were: fried pig's ear,pig's tails with balsamic, broccoli, sweetbreads, and the sicilian iris as the dessert. Also enjoyed a quartino of Plavac Mali Tomic anda Bertagnolli Moscato. Reasonable, casual/romantic dinner for 2 for about $100.
