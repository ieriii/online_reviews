This place has so many fans and so many reviews, I almost wondered what I could add that was new. But given that this is a Szechuan restaurant among a majoity of Cantonese places, it's worth pointing out a couple of things about this particular dining experience that's distinctive from many others in Chinatown. Also, while there are a lot of hot and spicy items on the menu, and you're in heaven if that's what thrills ya, there are also a fair number of non-spicy items, so more sensitive palates need not fear. Nor do vegetarians have to struggle to find what's doable for them. Here are a few of my veggie-friendly and non-flammable favorites: --the peanut and pressed tofu appetizer--little cubes of smoked, pressed tofu (very firm) tossed with peanuts, scallions, a little chili and sesame oils. addictive. --the vegetarian "chicken" appetizer--rolls made with dried, reconstitued tofu "skin" with mushrooms rolled into them, sliced on the bias and served cold. tasty and refresing. --pea pod greens sauteed with garlic or another green like Chinese broccoli sauteed with garlic or with oyster sauce.  I like that they have beer to go with all that spicy, salty food. My one gripe is that often the food is overly salty. Sometimes the wait is outrageous, but when their upstairs annex is open, that tends to relieve some of the congestion.
