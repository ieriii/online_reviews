The only thing you should get if you go to Giordanos is the stuffed pizza. You can find better thin crust, but the stuffed is amazing. They put a layer of sauce on top of the pizza which makes it pretty tasty. This location is nice because its near michigan ave but its not too crowded. Great place for people who work near Millenium Park.
