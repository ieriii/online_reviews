Ugh, it's a chain but... If stuck on Michigan Avenue it's a safe bet. It's a spin off of The Cheesecake factory, the portions are just HUGE. The food doesn't really have any soul. The prices are elevated for what you are getting but their desserts are really good, stick to the coffee and cakes get a proper lunch elsewhere...
