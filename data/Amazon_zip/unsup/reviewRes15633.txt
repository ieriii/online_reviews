I've lived in Andersonville for over a year now and have heard so many people heaping praise on Calo that I decided it was finally time to check it out. Went on a Saturday night and made the mistake of not making a reservation, so we waited an hour. The bar was packed, so I just got a drink and we hovered wherever we could find room. It was a little claustrophobic, but I guess that's to be expected. To start, the bread was freaking fantastic. I'm not one to rave about a bread basket, but this was probably one of the best bread baskets I have ever encountered. Warm, fluffy focaccia bread, deliciously seasoned white crusty bread, and a huge mountain of salty whipped butter. Yum. That was worth the wait alone. We got the mussels as an appetizer, which were to die for. I've just started eating mussels, but they were amazing by even general food standards, and my boyfriend (the mussel expert) loved them. Huge amounts of meat with tons of garlic and wine cream sauce. I got some sort of chicken piccata-like item that was on special. Chicken piccata is probably one of my favorite Italian dishes, and this was a good one. The chicken was thicker than most piccata dishes have it, but it was soft and juicy and my knife ran through it like butter. Boyfriend had the gnocchi with asiago and goat cheese, which he said was great. One other reason I liked this place: the service was impeccable. The hostesses were friendly despite the overwhelming crowds, our server was always there for anything we needed and made sure to check in with us any time he passed by, and water was refilled quickly. This was really great to see in a crowded restaurant in Chicago on a Saturday night, where poor service is so common anymore. It was a little pricey, but for the portion sizes and quality of the food, I think it's just about worth it. I'm so glad I finally tried this place.
