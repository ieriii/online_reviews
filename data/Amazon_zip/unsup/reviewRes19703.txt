I typically avoid all areas "tourist" in this fine city, and I consider The Gage to be located at the Mecca of tourism, so one would think I'd hate it. But, one would be wrong. First, I have to say I'm really, really impressed with the decor of The Gage... it's classy & clean, yet it still has that great pub feel. Any place that has such beautiful bathrooms is high on my list. If the potties are that pretty, you know you're good to go. The food is excellent, and I'm very partial to the fish & chips here. It feels wrong to order anything else. A top-notch beer selection is also a good thing, and OH the desserts. Get one of each. You won't be disappointed. For the location, I find the prices to be spot-on, and you definitely get your dollar's worth.
