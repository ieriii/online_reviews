I finally made it into Nana this past weekend with my GF. I was hoping this place would offer a good selection of breakfast food with a healthy twist and I can report Nana delivered. I had the baked chilaquiles with black beans and 2 eggs easy up and it was very tasty. The green sauce had just the right amount of heat and I really like the "baked" take on the dish. I heard some complaints regarding the higher prices but I disagree. Other places like Polo Cafe and Stages have pricepoints that are similar. The only thing that seemed greatly overpriced was the OJ. However, it was freshly squeezed so I guess you gotta pay for that. The atmosphere was great for a breakfast type place. Lively crowd, good lighting, clean, etc. I particularly like the minimalist approach with the bare brick walls, simple place settings, and white seats. The staff was excellent. Our waiter was pleasant, complimented us on our choice, came back to the table to check on us and the food. All in all a good experience and can't wait to go back.
