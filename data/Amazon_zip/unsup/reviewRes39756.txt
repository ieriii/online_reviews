If the band The Decemberists opened a restaurant, this would be it. The aesthetic of the place is sort of Early Chicago, meets Logan Square Hipster. Okay let's break it down: The scene: restaurant in front, bar in back, Inn on top...Just like in the olden days : )....The ceiling is fascinating. Beautiful old woods all melded together. My date caught me staring at the ceiling many times. He wasn't even boring! The bathrooms are adorable. JR Watkins soap...Nice touch... The food: We kept it simple...Kobe burger with OMG bacon and OMG cheddar and Wild Boar Sloppy Joes. It was food to savor. Seriously, I hit the table with joy and scared the waiter standing next to me. : ) The full menu food is like Old School American fused with modern cuisine. I can't wait to try more! The cost: For Chicago? Pretty cheap for farm raised everything. Pretty damn cheap actually...Oh joy! I love this place.
