Lots of things I loved, and a few things I didn't but overall I would stay here again Pros -staff is very nice -great location/decent price for where it's at -free wireless -ihome and large flatscreen tv that allowed me to hook up my mini dvd player -comfortable bed -mini fridge rental was $20 and I stayed a week so not bad Cons-I'm just picky and sometimes lazy so these won't bother most -very few tv channels -elevators take way to long since it's 40 floors -no vending machines and the nearest place to get a soda or snack is 5 blocks away at the 7/11 -non smoking hotel so Smokers beware -food deliveries can't delivery to your room, so you'll have to meet them at the lobby which is just annoying since the elevators take so long
