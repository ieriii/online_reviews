I went here with my fiance for our anniversary. I was really excited as I had heard and seen great things about the chef. We were not disappointed! The service was fantastic, and the food was phenomenal. The truffle oil popcorn was wonderful, and even though we didn't try the tasting menu, we did get five things off the small, but specific menu. Everything was elegant, and quite delicious. I had the Alaskan Halibut and my fiance had the steak. He said it was the best steak he eaten in the city, especially liking the BBQ/Rootbeer sauce. I loved the sauce and couscous in addition to the fish. Overall, our mutual favorite was the soup of the week, a corn chowder that was out-of-this-world! The chocolate dessert was also amazing. Overall, a wonderful night. Hope to go back soon!
