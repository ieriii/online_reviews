This place is rude and has the most horrible service I have ever seen. At several hundred dollars a night, I shouldn't be accosted by their impressively trained 'security' staff. This very unpleasant fat woman that was working there yelled at me and followed me around for a good 20 minutes. Even though I was all 'you know, i'm like paying to stay here and just trying to get to my room" she was all "oh what room are you staying in what room are you in who you be who you be blah blah blah" It wasn't even late, it was like 9:00.  Management is not helpful and unresponsive. This place SUCKS. Stay at the Drake.... P.S. The bar is fantastic... everyone's nice in there!
