We went for the price fix deal on the menu ($39.95) where you can choose from four starters, an entree, a side and a desert of flan and tropical fruit. They offer to let you choose any other dessert on the menu for an additional $2.00 I started with a dirty martini w/ blue cheese olives. It was excellent!! Just dirty enough, well shaken, cold and most importantly - filled to the rim! I had the petite (6 oz) filet w/shrimp medium rare and a house salad. My companion and I chose the mashed potato's and sauteed mushrooms as sides. The filet was delivered on a HOT plate in a sizzling pool of butter. Let's be honest - butter makes everything better. There are 4 avg sized grilled shrimp atop the filet. The steak was very tender and flavorful. My only complaint is a tough sinewy string that ran through the steak which grossed me out a little. I'm not a big meat eater in general. That aside I think the steaks here are probably the tastiest I have ever eaten. The sides were ample portions to share and deelish. I love the mashed potatoes - they taste like there is a hint of sour cream. They are creamy and served H-O-T. As a matter of fact everything that should be hot is hot and everything that should be cold is cold. May seem small but it's noticeable in a good way. We opted to skip dessert as we were both full. We wanted to order a Grappa as an appertif was on the menu and they didn't have it. But the waiter brought us another brand that wasn't up to par. We sent it back and he was very courteous about it. It is a typical steakhouse ambiance with lots of wood, white linen table cloths and low lighting. We struck gold and scored one of the booths which are very comfortable and feel very private. The service all around was excellent. The manager visited our table several times to check on us, our water glasses were always full, the waiter was very amiable. It was a good experience and I would definitely go back.
