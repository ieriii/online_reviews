I give this place 2 stars for 2 reasons. Majority of the time I get a chi town burrito it falls apart an becomes a mess because it was so poor wrapped. I stopped getting that because it was too hard to eat. Secondly, they got rid of their lunch specials. This place is just too overpriced otherwise.
