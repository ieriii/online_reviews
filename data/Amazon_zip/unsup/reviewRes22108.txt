I went here on Saturday night with a group of 7 friends. I called two weeks before we went, and the hostess told me that they do not take reservations, but they could put our name down because we had a large group. She told us we would probably have to wait around 15-20 minutes, but they had us marked down. I called the afternoon before we went to confirm, and they told me the same thing. When we arrived, the place was PACKED. They said we would have to wait around 20 minutes to 50 minutes. We ended up waiting over an hour. I felt like I was very misinformed over the phone, and we would have went somewhere else if we knew we would have waited that long. They made it seem like "putting our name down" would make a difference, but it does not at all. However, the food is very good. We really enjoyed the saganaki, avgolemono soup, and different chicken dishes. The trio of spreads was tasty as well. We enjoyed it more with pita bread (that you have to ask for) than the bread they put on the table. The waiter was nice and friendly. I will definitely go back during the week with a smaller party.
