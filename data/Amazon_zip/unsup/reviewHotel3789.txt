Ignore the service whiners. We were treated like kings in every area: bell hops, front desk clerks (you get to sit down and relax as you are checking in), wait staff, concierge, bartenders....etc. But that wasn't even the highlight....our room was freaking amazing (ask for room 1716). Awesome corner room with spectacular views and ceiling to floor windows. If you are a fan of contemporary boutique hotels, you will have a difficult time finding better options in Chicago.
