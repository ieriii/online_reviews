If I were a queen and this was my palace I'd be royally pissed! It's not palatial and it's not fancy; however, it does make a mean burrito. We selected Mayan Palace for dinner because it met our three requirements: (1) Mexican food and margaritas, (2) close to where we were meeting our friends post-dinner, (3) accepts reservations. As an added bonus they offer http://restaurant.com certificates too. When I arrived, late as usual, my friends had already ordered a pitcher of margaritas to get the party started. I was a little disappointed that they settled on strawberry margaritas, I prefer regular ones on the rocks but I was pleasantly surprised by my first sip. Most times the flavored margaritas come off as syrupy spiked Slupree-like drinks, but these were fantastic they weren't syrupy tasting or artificially oversweet at all. My one complaint is that we had some trouble understanding our waiter and vice versa. In his book No + No = Yes; when the guacamole we told him we didn't like or want arrived at our table he quickly and graciously whisked it away no questions asked. I was also a bit put off by him repeatedly trying to charm/push us into ordering another pitcher or another round after declining and explaining we were running late to meet friends elsewhere - enough! He was good at making sure we had chips, salsa and water throughout our meal, despite telling us the same lame joke three times during said meal. I ordered the Veggie Burrito Suizo dinner topped with salsa verde and it did not disappoint. The salsa has a little kick to it and complimented my burrito nicely. I swapped the pinto beans for black beans, which were quite tasty. My friends got the quesadilla and the enchiladas and had nothing, but good things to say about their dishes. Bottom line: I'd definitely come back here the food was good and the prices were reasonable. It's always nice to find more tasty dining options in the hood!
