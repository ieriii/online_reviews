It's an okay restaurant, but nothing special - I was definitely expecting more from this team. Potato croquettes were fairly bland, the coppa was very disappointing, and the only hit of the meal was the pork saltimboca but even that was too salty and had room for improvement. The wine choices and service at the bar were good but I definitely have no need for a return visit based on the food.
