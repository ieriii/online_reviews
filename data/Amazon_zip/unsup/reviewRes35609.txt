I am not, repeat, not a seafood lover. Van de Camp's fish fillets are about as daring as I get but I have to say this about Shaw's, the Jumbo Shrimp and Fish & Chips I had at 2 seperate occasions were peerless. They were cooked to perfection and delicious. If you are a seafood lover, you gotta check this place out!
