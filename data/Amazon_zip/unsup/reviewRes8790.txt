This place is pretty decent if you want Middle Eastern food and somewhat of an upscale experience. Waits here can get pretty long so be forewarned. Anything here that has meat is pretty darn tasty. The best thing about this place is any of their meat. The rice I think is kind of bland. I'm normally not a huge fan of rice to begin with so it has to have the tumeric or saffron or it's unpalatable in my opinion. Service here is usually decent, although slow depending on how busy it is. They do try and do a good job on moving people along when there is a wait. It is pretty pricey, which drops it down a star or two, but if you want upscale Middle Eastern, I'd try here or Kan Zaman.
