Today was my first time at much-talked-about Chicago Diner. I've been vegan for a few weeks and, with the weather so nice, I wasn't in the mood to sit home and cook, so I moseyed on down to the diner for a bite. Now what have we here? Creamy, scrumptious, and luscious sweet potato pancakes? Vegan sour cream and melted vegan cheese and sweet potatoes, oh my. It was pure heaven. I would have added guac, but that was $2 extra, but, in retrospect, it might've been overkill. As a first Chicago Diner meal, I was impressed. I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Mmmm...and is that a vegan chocolate milkshake I spy? Yes, indeedy, it is! And they prettied it up, too! They seemed to have squirted chocolate syrup into the parfait cup, dumped in the shake, and sprinkled vegan chocolate chips on top. Heaven! A+++! I plan to try the peanut butter and chocolate one next time (but that might not be awhile, as I need to whittle my waistline a few inches, boo). The only thing I didn't like was the fact I had to wait in the vestibule. With so many people coming in and out, I felt like I was standing in the way. The waiters were extremely friendly, though. It didn't hurt that my waiter was a good-looking fella. Now I know where to take my brother the next time he comes to town (he's not a vegetarian or vegan by any stretch of the imagination, but he'll gobble a good veggie meal just the same). Comet Cafe in Milwaukee, eat your heart out.
