My husband and I stayed here the night we eloped and got married. We stayed in a realllly high up room that overlooked the water. It was pretty rad that we could see an up close and personal view of the fireworks at the Navy Pier at night, but overall we were fairly unimpressed by the room itself. Sure it was nice, but we got charged quite a bit extra for a room with a "view" and the window was tiny tiny tiny. I just feel like if you're charging for a view that it should be a helluva view . Biggest pet peeve: So we get here the night we got married after we had already previously arrived to settle in, and our room is hotter than dammit at 10pm when we had definitely left the AC running. We call the front desk and tell them about it, and we were just sitting there in our fancy clothes waiting for someone to come up to fix it because we didn't want to be in the shower...or uh, consummating when they got there. So we waited 30 minutes, then 45. After 3 angry phone calls to the front desk, a very friendly serviceman arrives to fix the filter on our A/C. He then proceeds to explain what the problem was. He was nice and we were appreciative, but man, I just got married. I don't care what the problem was, just get out of my room so I can get busy. And of course, we never got any compensation or apology for the annoyance. But I'm still married, so I guess it didn't turn out to be too big of a deal, haha. Overall, the location is what would make this place worth it. Other than that, save your pennies and stay elsewhere.
