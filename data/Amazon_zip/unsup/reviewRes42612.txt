In Chicago for business and found Gilt Bar. Had a great meal of whitefish and garlic mashed potatoes. My friend had a 1/2 chicken that was completely deboned and served flat. It was so juicy and tender that we didn't even try the sauce it was served with. Both meals were delicious. Highly recommend Gilt Bar.
