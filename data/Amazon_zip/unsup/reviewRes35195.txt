Just like everyone else I went here for the Peking Duck and it did not disappoint! I'm a sucker for the daikon in white vinegar that comes with it though they charge you extra if you order more of it just fyi. The garlic eggplant was also good and the congee had bits of ginger in it -always a good call. It can get busy from what I've heard so make sure you make a reservation (don't forget to tell them ahead of time how many ducks you want!).
