This is a fine establishment that has a wide variety of Latin-infused cuisine - although the options are limited and the menu is pricey. I came here budget hunting because I had a Groupon (basically gave me half-off). With four friends, we tried three different entrees and some appetizers. The fish was very delicious and nicely cooked. Huge filet sitting in a yellow saffron sauce. Although it was quite nice, it was more influenced of American cuisine than Latin. The porkchops were very nice and tender. Although the porkchop did not remind me of Cuban cuisine, the rice and beans (aka "arroz de moros") was superb and quite possibly the best in Chicago. However, this was just a few spoonfuls... so make it last.  The appetizer to get is the Coconut Shrimp - WOW! Fantastic. You'll be wanting more. Overall, I was turned off by the HIGH prices and lack of consistent Latin-influences. The food was good, but not the most memorable (except the great coconut shrimp appetizer). It was a nice experience and we all had a great time.... but my wallet is surely lighter. :-) Cheers!
