Just got done eating here on a saturday night and it was a perfect evening out for my girlfriend and I. We did not have to wait long for a table and the byob policy is absolutely wonderful. Our waiter was attentive without being pushy, he really allowed us to settle in and drink a little wine before making our decisions on an entree. I had osso buco and she had fettucine alfredo and both plates were full almost to overflowing. The osso bucco was tender and delicious, I enjoyed every bite. Then we got to dessert, which was a giant slab of very tasty teramisu which we couldn't even finish. Overall I loved the fact that they do not rush you to make decisions or finish your meal and really allow the customer to savor the atmosphere and meal. We will definitely be back
