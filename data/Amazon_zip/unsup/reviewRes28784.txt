I would eat Thai food every day if I could. Went here a few months back with my favorite dining companion, my dad. He and I pretty much always want to order the same things, so going out to dinner with him ensures that I get to sample at least two different things I have my eye on. Plus he always treats :) On this particular occasion, we were both having a hard time deciding on an appetizer, so we decided to order 4 appetizers (reserve judgment please) and split an entree. We had the tiger cry, crab rangoon, mee krob, and pot stickers. All were very solid selections, with the tiger cry probably being my favorite. The crab rangoon were good, but did not beat the crab rangoon at Indie Cafe (currently the best crab rangoon I've ever had). The mee krob was not really at all what we were expecting - I don't know why because it pretty much came out exactly like the menu description. The deep fried skinny rice noodles were covered in some kind of sticky sweet "sauce" that was mostly absorbed into the noodles, as there was no visible sauce on the plate. It wasn't bad, in fact in a weird way, I think I really liked it. The pot stickers were some of the best I've had in recent memory. We split the peanut lover's chicken for our entree, which while incredibly tasty, did not have quite as much sauce on it as I would have liked. I'm a big sauce person. So much so that I often order food based on the sauce, with the protein either secondary or a total after thought. I would have preferred some extra sauce to sop up with my rice. But overall, a really good dish.  If this weren't so far away from my current west loop abode, I'd frequent here a lot more often. I wish there was an Opart in my 'hood...le sigh.
