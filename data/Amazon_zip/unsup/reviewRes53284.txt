Don't understand why we keep going back.Waiter eavesdrops and joins our conversation.Ugh. Hangs around , hovering which makes me uncomfortable. Food occasionally tastes good but mostly this is all about presentation, so bring your camera (no flash allowed) The dessert was not tasty. White chocolate spheres explode with bad tasting not sure whats inside. Hard to find a well priced wine that is not over-the-hill so we ordered two that were undrinkable. No one said anything but no one drank it either. One doesn't want to spoil the evening by making negative remarks. Especially with that hovering waiter.The last time I was there we had the wine paring menu and those wines were REALLY bad, many hungarian or other weird, cheap ethnic offerings.... Insulting. The night before we had been to RL which NEVER disappoints. I have been going there regularly for four years.Alinea ,at best is weird and quirky . Out of 16 courses, most were OKAY , all were dramatically presented and fun but it's novelty stuff. Some too much trouble to get through the suggested ritual. Hope I never have to go back.
