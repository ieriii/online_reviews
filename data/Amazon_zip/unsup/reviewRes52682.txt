Awesome concept !Waiters come up to your table and offer you differenet cute of meats from their giant skewars ...when youve had enough you flip over a wooden disk with red and green on each side to let them know if youd like more or if you need a break .The price fix meal also includes a big salad bar as well with many great selections .They also serve lunch which is a better value if you can make it in a little earlier ..
