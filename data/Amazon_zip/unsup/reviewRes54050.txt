Violet hour is one of my favorite places in the city. Both times I have been was on as Sunday, so it wasn't too crowded. This is the type of place where you HAVE to sit at the bar. It's part of the experience to watch your cocktail come to life. The drinks here are some of the best I've ever had! Sit with Henry, he's great!
