Oh dear God can this place whip up a margarita and burrito or what!? I LOVE THIS PLACE! I was first introduced to Mayan Palace in summer of 2007 and I've been returning (with friends and loved onces) since. It's a hit! I am a frozen margarita girl and they will mix flavors for me. I'm a sucker for strawberry/bananna and they always make it for me. Oh God they are delicious! I could drink 100 of them if not for the alcohol causing me to pass out in my burrito! The food... oh the food. Enchalidas.... burritos... even their salsa... YUM!  It's family owned and they literally trip over their tongues to make sure you are well taken care of.  Once I got up to go to the ladies room and the owner of the place accidently bumped my shoulder. I hardly noticed as the place was packed. He was so apologetic he hugged me and sent over a free round of margaritas! Where else would they do that?  I've said it before and I'll say it again- my FAVORITE Mexican food in the city!
