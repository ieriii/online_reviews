This is the most happening place to get Pizza in Chicago. Absolutely delicious pizza with loads of non-standard toppings. They brew their own beers and most are very good. This is a perfect place to bring a large group and talk over a massive pie! My only complaint is that it is so popular you may have a serious wait for a table. Luckily, you can wait at the bar.
