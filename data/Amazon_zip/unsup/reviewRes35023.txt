Had a wonderful dinner here during my trip to Chicago. Large place. Informative waitress. I had the Halibut. Wish they had sea bass. The menu is apparently fresh and updated daily. My friends got the crab legs which were $$$ and they could hardly finish it. The lobster bisque was yummy. Also, we ate the buffalo shrimp which was very spicy. We pretty much enjoyed our meal here. It's not a cheap place but they have good options. Really nice decor as well. Next time I wish I can try the oysters but sadly I can't have it all.
