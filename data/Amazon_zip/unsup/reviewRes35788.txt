I have zero complaints about this place! It's sooooo good! Service is amazing and so are the food and drinks:) I actually had Sushi as I had been craving it non-stop for a good 2 weeks and my companions had the grouper and the salmon, each of which was equally delicious! We had to wait a little bit for our table(reservations were at 8) and the bartender noticed this as we had already had one drink and gave us another for free. You can't beat that in my book. Everyone on staff was extremely pleasant and the manager even stopped by to see how our dinner was! I will for sure come back to have yet another tasty feast...hopefully soon!:)
