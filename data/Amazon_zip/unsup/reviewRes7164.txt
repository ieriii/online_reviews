I've noticed throughout my entire life that pretty much nothing bad ever happens to me on Tuesdays... so it was a good thing I decided to take a friend to Sapori on a Tuesday because we needed all the "terrific Tuesday" help in my "terrific Tuesday" bank.  Some of the highlights of the dinner conversation were the Eurpoean financial crisis, Greece bailout, Imperialism, and a comparison of a certain someone to an Asian Carp.... so you can imagine that there was a TON of time to talk. Luckily there was an ample supply of bread to munch on while we waited for our various dishes to arrive. I must say the food quality of Sapori was a solid "A"... esspecially for the price. The Milk and Honey ribs are not exactly the best in Chicago, but they are unique in flavor, texture, and garnish (there were carrot strings served with the ribs). Unfortunatley the restaurant had run out of our first three menu selections. Part of me wants to think that due to my history of good fortunes on Tuesdays throughout my life the restaurant may have helped me avoid finding out about a food allergy the hard way or some other opposit-of-ironic happening. However, I don't think that my craving to try the dishes that were unavailable the night I dined at Sapori will bring me back very soon.  Some of the other downers of the experience were that the outdoor table I requested at the point of reservation was not available and the arrival experience was less than dramatic. Things seemed a bit disorganized before we were seated. So if you're heading to Sapori... focus on the food and B.Y.O.P.
