I dined here last night with a couple friends and had a blast!  We all had a difficult time locating it since its hidden inside an unassuming office building....go through the revolving doors up the stairs past the security guard on your left down the hallway and through the door. Voila! Super small space with limited amount of tables, open kitchen for all to see, so we opted for the bar with the best view. Great wine list and super helpful bartender who eagerly let us sip and taste multiple wines before committing, multiple times. The food menu has many different choices with nothing over $17, and that's just one item. The majority of the tapas is $7-$9! Score. What was even better is that the size of the tapas was bigger than a pea!! Yeah!! Standouts: whipped feta with cucumber, shaved brussels sprouts with pecorino, milk fed braised pork shoulder, charred green onions. Not that amazing but still good: rapini with whipped ricotta, pork fried almonds, fried pigs tail with fried kale....I was hoping for a little more flavor to be going on in that dish. It just tasted, well, fried. Easy on the wallet, good food, great wine list, friendly service, cute atmosphere= makes you think you're somewhere else other than downtown...and that, I like!
