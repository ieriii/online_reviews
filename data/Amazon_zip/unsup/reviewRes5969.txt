Last weekend was my first visit to the Wildfire downtown. I've been to the one in Lincolnshire before and have always enjoyed myself. This Wildfire I didn't enjoy as much, just because it was so crowded.....there was a 2 hour wait for a table, so we ended up sitting at the bar. Eating at the bar was not a good experience, there were people all around us and it was hard to be comfortable. Every five minutes someone was on the side of me, hollering out their drink orders in my ear. We were there fairly early (about 5PM) but I guess on a Saturday that is the start of the dinner/cocktail hour crowd. Also the service was OK.... Outside of that, the food was really good. I had the Saturday special, NY Sirloin and crusted shrimp with fresh garlic spinach....the shrimp were too DIE for..... As always, being the chocolate lover that I am, I had to have a piece of the chocolate cake with the whipped cream, and that piece of chocolate that they stick in the top, that tastes like a high priced Nestle' Crunch!!!!! LUV IT, LUV IT, LUV IT!!!!
