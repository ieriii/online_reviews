For what we paid, I'm a fan (MAJOR haircut with P----line). Tiny room (again, see above and also an older property), but very nice - the couch against the windows (which open!) was a neat touch. Great view of the lake that really made it special. Down side(s): the light blocking shades...didn't. Bed was a little uncomfortable. Internet situation just irks me; if I didn't have my handy dandy aircard, I'd be torqued. Food was okay though it was a United Nations-esque exercise to explain what "Please send me hot chocolate with Kahlua" meant. Positives: front staff trained well; they were a pleasure. Massive Starbucks in the lobby - a good launching pad. Location, location, location - we were right in the middle of everything. Neat building.
