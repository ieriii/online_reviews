Excellent! Great guacamole, steak tacos, the chicken soup is amazing. It's basically great authentic Mexican style food. I never had anything nearly as good the several times I went to Costa Rica. The only thing I would ask is for their tacos to be more consistently made. One day their were large chopped chunks of carne asada steak, another day it was almost shredded style beef (which we were told depended on the chef working on the particular day). The place is def a comeback though. 4+ stars for a simple no thrills byob joint.
