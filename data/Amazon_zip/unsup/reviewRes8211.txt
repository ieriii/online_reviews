Fogo de Chao is THE BEST. My husband is a vegetarian and this is his favorite restaurant in the city...he lives at the salad bar! We've been there at least 20 times in the past few years and we can't get enough of this place. A capirihina (premium or regular) is a MUST. Here's an insider's tip: If you like black beans and rice you have to request it. (it's free). Otherwise you'll only get the standard sides: garlic and cheese mashed potatoes, fried polenta, plantains, cheese rolls. Another tip: Make sure you request any meats that you want to try b/c some meats don't always come out on the floor. In essence, GREAT food, GREAT drinks, and GREAT service...worth every penny. If dinner is too pricey for you then go during the week for lunch...same food, same service at a lower price. LOVE the prompt service too.
