I know this is a must-do in Chicago but it didn't live up to the hype as far as I'm concerned. Maybe I just like my back home NY style pizza but I do think I can insist that anyone should stop by here for Chicago style pizza if they're in the area. I didn't like the crust - it was hard and had the texture of an apple pie crust instead of a crispy pizza crust. I thought the sauce lacked some taste but approve of the exaggerated stuffed toppings - sausage and pep flying over the place over melted cheese, nice.
