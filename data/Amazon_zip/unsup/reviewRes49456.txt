Bin36 is great in concept, but in this instance has not been executed very well. The wine menu is pretty good, and affordable with the selection of flights. The food is pretty good, for what it is, and not over priced. However, the servers were very unattractive, the space is very spread out and uncomfortable, subsequently the crowd isn't to be desired.  I really wish someone could pull off a restaurant like Bin36, with all the wine for sale by the bottle to take home, a bar, good enough food, but actually have a great atmosphere.  I wouldn't tell someone not to come here, but I also wouldn't ever recommend Bin36.
