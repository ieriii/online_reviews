I can't say that I've ever been to this place sober but in my drunken opinion, it's A-OK! I mean when you want to soak up all the $8 drinks you've just had in Wicker Park, this is definitely a place to do it. From what I remember, they are pretty veggie-friendly. Unless I was that drunk and ate something that I thought was a vegetable. Oh no, damn...now I'm worried..
