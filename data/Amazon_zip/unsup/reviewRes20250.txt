Love Love Love the churro. Hands-down the best thing I've had in Chicago thus far. The churro is perfectly moist and crunchy sprinkled with a generous portion of sugar and chocolate. I also ordered the soft serve vanilla ice cream (the ice cream has the little bean specks so you know it's legit) to accompany my churro. To die for. My methodology for eating this churro was dip it in the ice cream and then dip it into the sugar/chocolate mix that had previously fallen off. mmm. I would seriously come back here just to eat the churro. When you dine in, you can specify when you will be eating the churro so they can bring it fresh to you rather than having the churro sit while you finish the rest of your meal. I also had the Ahbogada torta which has pork and accompanied with a savory spicy tomato broth to dip your sandwich into. The bread was fresh and you could definitely taste that it came from a woodburning oven. We also had the chips and guacamole. The chips were made fresh and were served hot. The guacamole was perfectly seasoned and had lots of yummy cilantro to cleanse the palate and cut some of the richness of the other food. Definitely coming back here. My only complaint was that I wanted soup and it wasn't 3:00 yet :( so they weren't serving it yet.
