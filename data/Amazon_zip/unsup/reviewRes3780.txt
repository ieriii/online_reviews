What more can I say about this place..... They have THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS I have ever had in my life! And this statement comes from a huge huge fan of chicken wings. I have tried chicken wings in many places with many flavors, but NOTHING beats Chicken Wings from Crisp with its Seoul Sassy. Simply delicious AND addicting. I MUST go there once a week at least. Slurpppp..
