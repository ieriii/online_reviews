I hated this place. My bf and I meant our friends here for brunch since they made reservations here. At first walking in it was dead downstairs walked up the spiral/grand staircase and wad greeted by a hostess and sat at our table. The restaurant seemed to share the bathroom with starbucks and the hotel attached to it. Then our waiter was an older gentleman and he was a bit rude not sure if he was having a bad morning but he wasnt very attentive. Also the food was way over salted I kept drinking my water by the time we were done eating I was so bloated with water weight I felt sick.
