OH MY Korean BBQ!!! San Soo Gab San is hands down Chicago's best Korean BBQ. You better be hungry when you walk into to this place. My usual order is the Bulkoki and the Spicy Baby Octopus...always full of flavor...always fresh. And as for the eighty million small plates that they cover your table with...always fabulous and fun discover all sorts of new things. Their variety of kimchis are great. Now...as for the service. Not quite what I would call hospitable, but they leave you alone for the most part...so I'm ok with that. One thing I find here is that you need to act like you know what you are doing otherwise they will start cooking your food for you...quite aggressively might I add.  If I'm at a dining establishment where part of your experience is to grill your own food, I want to be grilling my own food.  Overall a great experience and always fun to bring new people who have never had it before. It's open until like 4 in morning or something, so thats always a bonus.
