Being of Indian descent, I have had a wide range of Indian food at restaurants all over the Chicagoland area. The best chef is my mom, but that's obviously for another review... India House is relatively small, and does not have a lot of seating. As a result, Friday and Saturday nights are often a tight squeeze, so reservations ahead of time are definitely recommended. It's a good spot to hit for the lunch buffet, which has a lot of choice.  Taste-wise, it's not the best in the area, but it definitely takes care of the palate when you're having a craving. Decor-wise, it's got a nice, classy feel to it, with dim lighting and dark fabrics, and accessories for authenticity, like tablas and other indian items sitting in the window. One thing to note, though - I wouldn't recommend going there if you're planning on going out afterwards... the strong scent of Indian food will linger in your clothes for awhile.
