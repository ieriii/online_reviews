This is by far my favorite steakhouse in the city. Yeah I know it's a chain, there actually was one down the street from me when I lived in Connecticut, but I'm not a snob - good food is good food. I've been to lots of great steakhouses in the city: Morton's, Smith&Wollensky, you name it, but Ruth Chris remains my guilty pleasure. And yes, I know they douse everything with butter, and that may be part of the reason why it tastes so good, who knows. I usually get the petit filet with mashed potatoes, and they have a great deal for lunch - you can get both plus dessert (also very tasty) for $22.
