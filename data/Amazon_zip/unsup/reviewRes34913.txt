Always consistently good! We always get delivery or take-out from Sushi X and they never disappoint. For some reason my boyfriend and I are creatures of habit and always end up getting the Red Dragon, Alaska, and Spider Rolls. Watch out for the Red Dragon because does it not only have spicy tuna on top, but they also include some pieces of sliced jalapeos in the roll! The only compliant I has is that I wish they offer nigiri pieces, but the rolls are satisfying enough when the craving hits. We have been here for dinner before, but I wouldn't recommend it unless u enjoying eating with techno music playing loudly in the background and Japanese anime playing on the wall. The interior is also painted black (same as the outside). I just don't think the combination of all 3 makes it very conducive to eating... Overall, great for carry-out/delivery, not so good for dining in.
