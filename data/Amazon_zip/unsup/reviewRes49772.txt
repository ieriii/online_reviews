You know, when you think of a wine bar this is not what comes to mind. The lighting is high, the booths are big, and the wine is inexpensive. But this was exactly what our party of 7 mostly inexperienced wine drinkers who wanted to talk (and hear eachother) wanted. Decent flights, good cheese. Not much else to be said.
