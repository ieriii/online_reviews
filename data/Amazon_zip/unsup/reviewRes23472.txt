Food Good! Service No so Good. I've never seen in my 20 years in the hospitality industry people move as slow, with out the ability to mufti-task - I actually watched the Bus/water boy get comfy and take a lean - Buddy if you have time to lean, you can refill water/tea and coffee. The crepes were very good - but it was over shadowed by slow/poor service.
