I have been going to Indie for about two years now and see myself coming back again and again for the good food and equally good service. Consistency of the menu items were shaky the first few times I dined there, but it has increased tremendously in the past year. The maki and nigiri mated with the excellent miso soup and crab rangoon as starters will leave you with a serious case of Happy-Belly for the evening. :) On the Thai side, the fried rice and noodle dishes always leave a smile on my face. Definitely good options for carry out. But these are just my opinions. Go out and try it personally. Enjoy the selections and ... above all... have fun.
