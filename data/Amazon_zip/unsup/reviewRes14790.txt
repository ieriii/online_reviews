This is the best Italian restaurant in Chicago. Hands Down. From the very first impression you get of this place, it is above and beyond. Free Valet! There is a lounge piano next to the bar as soon as you walk in. The host will greet you in a tux. Fresh cheese bread with a marinara sauce is put on your table as soon as you sit down. The menu is extensive. Can't find anything you like, don't worry. They are willing to make you anything you want, even if it is not in the menu. The prices are on the inexpensive side. Not to mention, the helpings are huge. No way will you leave hungry. Bartenders are great. Try a Dirty Martini. The wait staff is incredible. This place seriously reminds me of a scene from Goodfellas. Service is their first priority and they aim to please. Try it. You will not be disappointed.
