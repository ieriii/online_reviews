Pretentious and stuck up. I nearly threw down with two guys in there. But we had fun laughing at all the bleached blondes and cougars in this place. It doesn't really fit into the vibe of Wicker Park, but that's probably the fun of it. The drinks are nothing special and the decor and layout of the place feels like the townhouse I used to live in back in Niles...odd...but nothing to write home about. The music was faded into the background...I think I heard Nelly playing...
