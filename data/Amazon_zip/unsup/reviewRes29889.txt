Easily the most diverse, interesting, friendly eateries in Chicago. I've gone with everyone from long-term vegans to meat and potatoes guys and I haven't had anyone not leave happy and intrigued. The last few times I've been I've ordered the same thing - the Dagwood has been a savior since it's twice the size of an normal even American sandwich and I always seem to be on a tighter budget than planned. The staff is really friendly too! Although I don't think I've seen the same face twice after going there for a few years now.
