I've been going here or ordering from here for delivery for 20+ years. Great Neighborhood Italian cuisine, steaks, chops, pastas! right in the heart of Andersonville, recent upgrade of decor, parking lot across the street, late hours, nice bar and good service. Two people should split a 16" thin crust, bacon, garlic and double pineapple to-die-for pizza. 18" to 20" will feed three or four hungries. This is an unusual but delicious pizza that only can be really appreciated when you're burnt out on cheese and Italian sausage after eating 3 pizzas a week. You won't go wrong here but its a neighborhood place, not some snooty downtown joint.
