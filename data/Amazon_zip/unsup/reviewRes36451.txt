We woke up nice and earlier and decided we were going to brunch. With who should we go? John and Ashley. Where should we go? Meli. That was easy. If a breakfast joint has corned beef hash I order it. The Emerald Isle Skillet touted house made corned beef hash with potatoes, eggs, and swiss cheese. Game on! The skillet was a light on the corned beef hash, but overall the dish was yummy and overall portion was large. Audrey had the Portobello and Swiss omelet which she enjoyed. Ashley had the pancake flight. Is everybody doing a pancake flight now? She didn't eat very much of it, but I think she liked it. John had the Modern Benedict which he also enjoyed. To wash down my skillet I ordered a large fresh squeezed orange juice which was delicious. Ashley had the Strawberry Banana smoothie which was a bit on the sweet side. The space is warm, clean, and like most every brunch place in Chicago packed to the brim with hungry folks. The service was quick and friendly. Meli has a huge menu with options for just about everybody and is right down the street from me. Having said that I will most likely be back. 1 Smoothie 1 Large OJ 1 Earl Grey 1 Pancake Flight 1 Modern Benedict 1 Portobello & Swiss Omelet 1 Emerald Isle Skillet ------------------------------------------ $60.00
