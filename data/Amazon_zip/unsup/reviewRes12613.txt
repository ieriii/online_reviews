Cafe 28 is a solid 3-star experience with glimmers of 4-stars. The service was outstanding. We were seated at a table in it's own little section and our server couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. I just feel that the food misses the mark. Some items are outstanding and others not so much. I love the green tamale appetizer and my skirt steak was really good but the sides just OK.
