Had dinner at this place on my first trip to Chicago. Great food and atmosphere. A fairly young 20's and 30's crowd. Reminds me of some trendy restaurants in the meat packing district in NY. I'm always wary of these so-called "asian fusion" restaurant, due to the lack of real fusion involved and high prices. However, Sunda does the concept fairly well. The lobster and wagyu rolls were above average. Tasty but not over the top. I chose the ridiculous for dessert. It was...well, ridiculous. Recommend.
