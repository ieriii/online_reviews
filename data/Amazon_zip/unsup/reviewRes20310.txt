Spectacular, and with a little menge a trois wine, it's BYOB and this one fits perfectly with the menu... excellent date place, and great for people watching/discussing, since the seats are close together... not very secluded seating so don't expect privacy. But awesome food. this is the kind of place to make a sushi lover out of someone afraid to try it.
