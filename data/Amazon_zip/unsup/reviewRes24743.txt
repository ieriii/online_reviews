The Groupon for Geja's Cafe gave me the excuse to finally try this place out. I had heard this place was nice, but a little $$$, so the deal was too good too pass up! Fondue dining sounded fun to me, but BF wasn't too enthusiastic, so I decided to bring a visiting friend on a romantic girls date instead, haha! Our waitress and the assistants/bussers were great! Our server was great about explaining how fondue courses worked, what our many options were, answered our questions well, and paced our courses appropriately so we could take our time enjoying our food and also get nice little breaks for our bellies to get ready for the next course. It was fun to get to cook with our little skewers, but since it's so dark in there (REALLY DARK) we were afraid our meat choices would turn out undercooked! We did a cheese fondue to start, veggies with lobster and beef tenderloin for the main event, and the chocolate dessert to finish the night. While the overall experience was nice, and the both of us girls were full when we left, the food itself is nothing to write home about. Basically some veggies and meat choices you get to cook in oil and dip in sauces. I would have liked more choices of things to dip in the chocolate for dessert as well. Plus, you smell a little like gruyere when you get home, lol. Overall, fun for a night out with girlfriends, great service, ok food, not sure if it justifies the price. But I had a good time. I might go back if I had another Groupon, but I think I'll try the other fondue places I've seen other Yelpers mention.
