Magnifico! I am from WI and have only been there once, in Jan 2008. I will be going back this Saturday and very much looking forward to it. Here are the restaurant's weaknesses: none. The food was very good. The decor/ambiance is spectacular. Drinks, esp. mojitos are great. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for in food quality and atmosphere. In fact I was so impressed by the interior and decor, I think Ayn Rand would agree that it represents the grandeur of man.
