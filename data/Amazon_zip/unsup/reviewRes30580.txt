I've always had a generally good experience here and enjoyed the food. They've had their bad days but what was I supposed to do, there aren't many options in this city. Well now there is Native Foods. And soon there with be THREE Native Foods. There you can get generous portions of fresh food that doesn't leave you feeling weighed down when you're done. But back to Diner. I went a couple of days ago because I wanted to change it up and needless to say, it was a mistake. I ordered the Monte Cristo and it was a legit bummer. The food was plated sloppily and when I bit in to the sandwich, there was nothing there! There was ONE piece of seitan ham and when the sandwich was cut in half, that one piece didn't make it to both halves. I don't even want to talk about the 'art' on display. Horrible photos of farm animals that look like a failed ASPCA ad. It would be cool if Diner just got it together and worked hard to improve the quality of their food. I don't WANT to have less veggie options in this already barren city but if you're not going to show up to play, just go home.
