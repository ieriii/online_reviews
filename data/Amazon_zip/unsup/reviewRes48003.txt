I was really surprised to learn that The Publican has been around for four years. It's been on my list for a couple and I am bummed that I did not venture here until last night. Service was stellar - we had a waiter who had been working there since, I think, 2009, and he was very personable and very attentive (even bringing additional yummy shots of beer which complemented our food). The food was really good - enough veggie and fish selections for those of us not so into the meat. And the dessert (bread pudding) was yummy. The decor is kind of minimalist rustic. Overall, this is a terrific place and I highly recommend. Also, good for business dinners---they do have booths in addition to the communal tables. I was certainly relieved to see THOSE - not so into the communal thing especially when it's a business dinner. Or really ever.
