What can I say that hasn't been said before? Probably nothing so I'll keep this short. I love The Violet Hour. I love it for special occasion drinks, for late afternoon drinks, and for late night drinks; I'm always up for going there. Its a great place to bring friends from out of town or to relax after a hectic day. The cocktails are inventive and almost all are delicious. The atmosphere is sexy and seductive; curtains and candle lit tables surround the semi private tables that hold people in the seemingly most important and thrilling conversations of their lives. Everything is better at The Violet Hour. Your drink is delightful, your companion looks hotter, your bad day is no more, the conversation flows on and on and on.... The Violet Hour casts a spell on you...just be careful because the cocktails are potent. Only a couple should do.
