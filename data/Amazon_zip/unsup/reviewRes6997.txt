Two tries, still unsure of this place. I like the concept, but have mixed experience with the place. First time went with the Pulled Pork sandwich, second time with Kobe chopped brisket. The good: Choices of beef, pork, chicken and fish - so everybody is happy (except those weirdo grass eater friends....) The not so bad: ate majority of it without any extra sauces as they did not appeal to me (most sauces do not). Would like to see more options and healthier sides- sweet potato chips/fries would go well with q'ing! Maybe a lighter cole slaw option- you don't need heavy mayo or excessive vinegar to make a good slaw (remember the BBQ joint on North Sheffield? They had the best cole slaw anywhere, light and flavorful- (healthy, too!) The ugly - Portion size? Really need to reconsider larger portions my friends..........Terrific concept, execution is a little weak and inconsistent. Gotta work harder, please!
