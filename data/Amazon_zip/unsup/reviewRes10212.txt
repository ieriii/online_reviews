The best thing about this place is the patio - as everyone has said, it is lovely, with lots of foliage and trees and herbs, more upscale outdoor furniture than you typically see for outdoor restaurant seating. It is really transformative - you feel like you are in Italy and this is the only reason for the 3 stars.  Really - this should be 2.5 stars. Also, wine list is good, we had a nice bottle for a very reasonable price. Seemed like there were a ton of new waitstaff. Noone waited on us until, after about 10 minutes, we flagged someone down. She very honestly told us she was 'in training' and had been employed there for all of an hour. But she had worked as a waitress at Timo and to her credit, she waited on us and did a fine job.  Food was very so so. Fried calamari - not so great. No sauce came with the calamari, then they brought steaming hot marinara when we asked for sauce. My husband got the roast chicken which was very bony, not very meaty, and so tasteless that he sent it back. He got the veal ragu over ribbon pasta instead which arrived very quickly. But honestly - tasted a lot like chef boyardee. I got the gnocchi with mushrooms. I liked the mushrooms quite a bit, but the gnocchi was very bland. It is made of spinach and ricotta (not potato) and is larger than typical gnocchi so you have to cut it up. It tastes like - nothing. Like they took wonder bread and converted it into my dinner. Because the atmosphere is so pleasant, we will try again. But we will not order anything we have tried thus far. The food needs some serious improvement.
