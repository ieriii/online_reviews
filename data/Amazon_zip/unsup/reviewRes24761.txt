This restaurant is a cross between a full service restaurant, a bakery, and a winery. It has all of the necessary ingredients for musing. Compared to the fast food style food in the area, this is a breath of fresh air. It reminds me more of a European cafe, allowing you to relax and enjoy yourself with a glass of wine or a fancy espresso. Also, I regularly would stop in to grab a nice olive loaf or some type of fancy pastry for just a few dollars.
