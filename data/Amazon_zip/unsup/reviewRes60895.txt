I have been to Zed just a few times but generally only for drinks after work. As anyone that has had Brazilian Style before, cautiously, I have almost avoided the main courses in the main dining area. Well, let me tell you, aside from great smaller orders/desserts ordered from the bar, I love the decor and style of the venue, and after tasting the Harvest Bar, I must rave about it! They have always had friendly staff and are not pretentious like some of the rooftop scenes can be Downtown Chicago. Perfect for after work or a meeting; sometimes I've heard it can get crowded but I have never had a problem. If you are Hungry...try the Harvest Bar....bring a doggie bag because they will have to Roll you out of here!
