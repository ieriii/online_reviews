I haven't been to Wishbone in years, but last night my former roommate and I went for her birthday. We used to go when we lived together and were jonsing. Pros: still has great sweet potatoes. Okays: I remember the Hoppin Jacks being more flavorful. Cons: Is it just me, or did you used to get corn muffins as a welcome bread? We got chips and salsa last night and went "what the what?!" Then when we ordered what we thought was the corn muffins we got one giant corn... pancake? It was ok, just not what we expected. Good price for the food (especially the vegetarian options) and, while it's not as good as my memory serves me, I'll try it again when I want some southern cooking.
