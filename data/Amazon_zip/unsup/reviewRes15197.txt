There is something other worldly about Violet Hour. I opened the hidden door and felt like Alice, who had just stumbled upon a magical place. A tall curtain & a well dressed man greeted us. We walked through the curtains to see a beautiful sight. A room with dramatic tall backed chairs, lowly lit with tall curtains separating each room, chandeliers, tea candles at every table. There is a whimsy about the Violet Hour. There is something familiar, yet mysterious about it all. It wasn't at all pretentious. It felt easy & welcoming & I didn't want to leave! Juliet & Romeo: I substituted Hendricks Gin for Beefeater, Rose Water & Mint & Cucumber. A must must try. It is so absolutely well rounded in flavor that I'm certain I'll be dreaming of it for years to come. Pims Cup Variation #5 : Blackberry, Ginger, Apricot Liqueur, Lemon & Pims #1. This one had a nice range of fruity & sweet but was a bit too girly froofy for me to order again. Seasonal Sezerac : Rye, apricot liqueur, absinthe & Peychaud's bitters. An exceptional cocktail that I highly recommend trying. I don't even know how to categorize the taste profile. It's smooth & not too sweet, not too anything. Just a whole lot of RIGHT. The Violet hour uses large square column like ice cubes in their cocktails. This I think lends to the insistence on making most well crafted cocktails. You aren't going to get a cup of ice with a touch of alcohol here. The ice, being more block-like kept the drink cool while not watering down the concoction. I like this attention to detail. This is a one of a kind place. You won't drink these drinks or feel this way anywhere else. If only Chicago were my town, Violet Hour, you you would be my Muse. You put me under some sort of spell and I am glad you did...till next time!
