I haven't been to Le Colonial in years but had the chance to stop by here and grab dinner with a friend the other night. I wonder what kept me away for so long? Located in a vintage rowhouse, Le Colonial immediately transports you back to 1920's southeast Asia. With its uniquely tiled floors, louvered shutters, ceiling fans, rattan furniture and lush potted plants and banana trees- this place removes you from the day to day and transports you to a bit of fantasy. There are even photos on the walls of 1920 Saigon (I asked!) to add to the fantasy of actually being in a different time.  If you can- try to sit upstairs- the large mahogany bar, oriental rugs and overstuffed sofas in the lounge add to the intimacy of the place. But the real winner here is the food. While French Vietnamese fare sounds odd to me (I love French food yet real Vietnamese food leaves me a bit cold) the food is very good. Do what we did and order a variety of things to share. We started with the crab meat soup with herbs and asparagus (delicious) marinated tuna with tomato, cilantro and cucumber (my favorite) and the grilled shrimp wrapped around sugar cane. Very good. Next for the entrees- we had the sea bass with cellophane noodles and vegetables, the rack of lamb, and as a side the fried rice with shrimp and vegetables. Way too much food but all of it was delicious. The service was attentive without being pushy and there was never a pause to answer our every question. As for cocktails- I stuck with my tried and true dirty martini but my friend had a "saketini" (in fact he had several!) and he declared his the overall winner- I am still undecided about that but both were good! Go for the atmosphere, stay for the food. If you are looking for a fantasy evening without ever leaving the city- then Le Colonial is for you. And if you want to work off some of that food? Le Passage is right next door!
