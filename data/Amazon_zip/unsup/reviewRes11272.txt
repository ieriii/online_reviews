Wow this place was amazing and totally worth the wait. We went with 11 people so we had to wait at least a hour. BUT they let you order coffee at the bar and hey I am much more of a happy camper if you let me have a cup of coffee while I wait. The options here are plentiful but not overwhelming which is great because it is hard enough to decide as is. I would go with several people and get different dishes so each person can have a taste of everyone's dish. The portions are so huge here that it is hard just to eat one thing by yourself! Here is what I liked the best. Chocolate Tower French Toast  My friend got this and it was huge! Definitely a decadent dish - very chocolately! White chocolate berry Cheesecake Pancakes  This was simply amazing! Three large pancakes with a white creamy sauce on top - wasn't too cheesecakey and it was light enough that it wasn't over whelming. Crab Egg Benedict This was awesome, it was made with real crab meat and tasted amazing - very elegant dish...if you can call a benedict dish elegant :)
