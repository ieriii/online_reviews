To those complaining about the lack of seating/long line: You're right; there is a lack of seating, and a long line. But you guys are annoying. Listen up: This is a RICK BAYLESS RESTAURANT (ie super hyped-up, and for good reason) at ridiculously low prices for what you get...and, it's inspired by Mexican STREET FOOD (ie you're not even supposed to dine-in). See the dine-in option as a luxury, not a given. If you wait it out, guaranteed you'll get a table, but this ain't Chipotle. Everything here is amazing. Every staff member is enormously knowledgeable, kind, patient, and very helpful. I've never been to a restaurant where the staff seemed so hell-bent on their customers having a great time. I highly recommend: 1. The agua fresca 2. Chicken torta 3. Seafood caldo 4. Cubana torta 5. Any ice cream concoction 6. Almond hot chocolate Come, expect a line, accept that you might have to get your torta to go, and have an orgasm while eating ANYTHING you get here. Secret insider tip: If you come during 2-4pm on a weekday, the line will be wonderfully short or nonexistent--and you can get a table for multiple people!
