It's really cool in here. Low lights, Boardwalk Empire-esque (or Prohibition era, your call), and a swank decor will have you looking for Nucky Thompson and Jimmy Darmety. That being said, cool is the best thing Gilt has going on for it. The atmosphere is amazing enough to outshine it's shortcomings, but if they don't fix the ugly parts Gilt Bar won't be around long. The service from our waiter was incredible. He was knowledgeable, polite, speedy, and appropriately attentive. The hostesses at the front... not so much. They (all 4) seemed to be dealing with some sort of crisis that made us wait for 10 minutes to even check in for our reservation, and then I got some nasty attitudes to accompany my slow welcome. I'm sure there was some sort of reservation crisis, but that still doesn't warrant snapping at patrons. If this is face of Gilt Bar... ew! Now the drinks... I know they have this whole kitsch prohibition drink thing going on, but I'm no dummy. As in I know what a vodka-tonic should taste like. No matter how amazing your Pimm's Cup may be, if you can't put together a basic drink in my book, that equals no dice. The food was just... interesting. Not quite tapas, not individual meals, the portions were a bit strange. All of the options were quite heavy (i.e. pastas, meat, etc) besides the hamachi or salads. Though I'm a moderate eater, I couldn't get over how salty everything was. The food sort of tasted... soul-less. Maybe I'm getting a little too detailed, but remember that episode of Top Chef where Carla made a dish that she put some "love" into? All of the dishes at Gilt felt quite unloved, like they were comprised of labor and obligation, not passion about cuisine. So all in all, I'd go back, but probably not for dinner. Ideal for a drinks only date (with a small appetizer), but don't expect a decent vodka tonic.
