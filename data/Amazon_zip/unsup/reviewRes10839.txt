My bf's cousin Alex recommended this place while we were in town. We took a couple of trains to get to it and finally found it on a very chilly 19 degree weather day! The wait was about an hour long so the host said. I was a bit frustrated due to exhaustion, famine and temperatures my body hardly ever experiences. We had no where else to go at this point and decided we would wait the long hour long wait! We walked around up and down the blocks which had boutiques and other interesting little stores. I actually took advantage and bought some other winter device to cover me even more from the cold. We went back to check on our queue order and the guy said another half hour. Of course at this time I am even colder and hungrier so I start talking to the host about how we're from out of town and had heard great things about this place and so on. I guess that worked because we were seated 10 mins. after that!!  The service was great. The waitress gave us a couple of recommendations and then the BF of course had the final say on what to order since I had had a really bad pick a couple of days before....lol! We ordered the Reuben with a Caesar salad and also the Pumpkin Pancakes. The Reuben and Caesar were fairly decent, in fact they were pretty amazing until I tried the pancakes! The Pumpkin Pancakes almost made me slap myself! The pancakes themselves were so thick and dense filled with chunk of gooey chocolate. The vanilla creme on top was heavenly! I could die happy after eating those godly pancakes! I am a bona fide pancake lover and make pretty darn good pancakes myself, but I have never tasted better pancakes in my life! I could eat them for a week straight and love 'em more and more each day! Thank you Alex for this recommendation! The only bad thing about this place is the time you have to wait to get to chow on those beautiful pancakes!
