It was March 31 and we were sitting outside eating Irazu for dinner. What more could you ask for? We started out with guacamole. The guac is good...somewhat overpriced though. Guac is, at more than $6, more expensive than the burritos and sandwiches? Seems kind of strange. For dinner I had the Pepito sandwich...it was superb. My wife had the vegetarian burrito...she said it's the best she's had in the city (and as a vegetarian, she's had many). Another person in our group had three different empanadas...they were supposedly amazing as well. We walked away a very satisfied group of people. The only downside to going to this place is the hipsters...but I'll save that rant for another time and another place.
