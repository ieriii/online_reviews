While the food was delicious, I gotta say - the service was some of the best I've had in awhile.  I'm a bit of a high maintenance customer, in that I can't decide what beverage I want until I know what I want to eat (because I want them to complement each other), and it sometimes takes me awhile to decide what I want to eat - and I make the server help me with all those decisions. Our server Dan was totally up to the job of answering my questions - giving helpful opinions and being witty/funny during the process. There for a Sunday night dinner with a gal pal, it was totally not busy (and also a Bears Game, though, so maybe it's busier some other Sundays) - and just delightful.  Cornbread: PHENOMENAL. And I don't just call any cornbread phenomenal. Salad with fennel, grapes, and cucumber - unlike any salad I've had, and yummy.  Shrimp and Grits - yum... though not *quite* as yum as I expected after all the Yelp reviews. Good dish - just didn't change my life. And I had a red wine that Dan helped me pick that would go okay with everything I was eating. No dessert - we were too full. My friend got the burger and thoroughly enjoyed it. (She's a foodie, too - and would only get a burger if it sounded like a good idea).
