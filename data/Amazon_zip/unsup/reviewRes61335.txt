My husband and I have been able to indulge at Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, so we were excited to finally try Brazzaz.The salad bar was, eh, okay. The vegetables and salads were comparable to the others, the warm food was soggy and salty. The side dishes were different from the what the other two offered.... black beans, rice, and some spinach spread. We weren't sure what to do with the spinach spread... there were no crackers at the salad bar? The beans were thick, the rice was tasteless and a weird gooey texture.FInally, the meat. The meat was all overcooked, and charred, leaving a bad taste in our mouths. The variety was slim and most cuts didn't even make it to our table, even after asking the staff (who was an overall-fake friendly and didn't seem happy with their forced smiles). The best thing about the entire place was the grilled pineapple, which we could never seem to get because they would run out by the time they got to our seating area.We went on a Sat night and paid $50/pp.... huge disappointment before we got the bill... imagine after we saw it. I highly suggest going to Texas de Brazil, save some money by signing up for their e-club and enjoy their twice-the-size salad bar and large variety of flavorful, correctly cooked meats. Also, the staff is actually warm and inviting.I hope this helps!!!
