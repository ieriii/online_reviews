I was lucky enough to live across the street from this restaurant for a while. It's not a cheap dinner - around $20 per person for the full bbq experience, it is totally worth it. I love the ribs (the meat is sliced off the bone). And the 20 dishes of sides that come with the meal are a real treat. Something new every time I go. Just know that if you go, you're going to smell like bbq for the rest of the night - even if you choose something else off the menu.
