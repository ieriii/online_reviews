Thankfully, we avoided the famed 3 hour line (ours was more like 30 minutes). Thankfully because if I had waited 3 hours in line for these dogs, plus paid $7-$9 for them, I would have been significantly more perturbed. As it is, though, I'm satisfied - no more, no less. The dogs were about as interesting as one would expect, given their exotic ingredients - but not crazy well cooked, nor, it seemed, was there too much thought given to the flavor combinations. The much whispered about foie gras/duck sauternes sausage was... ducky. (Sorry.) Not exceptionally flavorful, and it could have used something apart from duck to set off the duck flavors. The pork/blue cheese combo similarly could have used much, much more blue cheese... but it was good anyhow. The winner of the day was the crayfish/pork dog, which was almost too thick for the bun and bursting with shards of smoked crayfish flesh, which were in turn buried in remoulade. This dog was the one the three of us fought over. The one we all wanted to be our last bite. We gobbled down the other two and stared wistfully at the crayfish, waiting for it to be our turn. If everything was as good as that crayfish, sure, I'd be waiting in the line around the block with my $9 ready like everyone else. As it is, I'm kinda miffed about the price, and cautiously optimistic about returning to see if there are any other hidden gems. But I'm going to come at really weird times of the day. Definitely not at noon.
