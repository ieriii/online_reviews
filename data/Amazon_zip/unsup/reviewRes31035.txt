So, its our first time eating at Sunda and we wanted to experience the best while in town from Los Angeles. We asked our waiter what she would recommend and we were not disappointed except for the Albacore Sushi (No LIKE) don't buy, don't even think about ordering it. 1. New York Steak Lollipops (Very Very Good) 2. The Great White Tuna Sushi (Very Very Good) 3. The Firecracker Roll (Very Tasty) 4. The Albacore Sushi (Never Again)  Overall the food was delishhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! Its a must come and eat here if you ever in Chicago.
