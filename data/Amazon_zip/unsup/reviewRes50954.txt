I've been to Wishbone twice and I think it is a great joint for breakfast or brunch--plus the space is massive for Lincoln Ave. and if you have a big crowd in town, that can be the most important thing. Both times I've been I've only had to wait less than 15 minutes. The servers were attentive and quick.  The food is good. Went to NOLA this year and it reminded me of that (which is obvious as this place is southern inspired cooking, right?).  One of my party ordered the fruit bowl and I was like "Why did you get that? It'll be like two grapes, an apple slice, and three pieces of banana"...I was in for a surprise as when it arrived, it was an actual huge bowl of fruit (all types). I guess I just judge a place by its fruit bowl.
