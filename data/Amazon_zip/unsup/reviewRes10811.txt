Great beer, and the brewmaster is usually in the house. The pizza is oven-fired and pretty darned tasty, and the bruschetta is surprisingly delicious, but the beer is the star of the show. Should you turn up on a night when there is live music, don't look forward to stimulating conversation, as you will have to shout to be heard, even in the booth section up the steps. Great place to go to kick off a long night in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. EDIT 1/16/08: They took the bruschetta off the menu!!! BOO ON YOU, Piece!! Stuff was amazing! Now that it's off the menu, maybe I can ask for their recipe...
