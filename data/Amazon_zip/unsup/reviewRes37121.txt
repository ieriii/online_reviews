I found it funny answering some of the questions in making this review, since Fox and Obel is a grocery store and not a restaurant. I look at Fox & Obel in the same vain as I look at Treasure Island or even Dean & Deluca. It's a food market for the die-hard gourmet folk. It's definitely a place where you won't pay bargain prices for items, but these aren't the items you'll find in your local grocery store. If you're wealthy, then you can afford to shop here all the time, but I think the true strength of Fox & Obel is that it's a spot for the rest of us to get those imported items that we normally can't get, as well as those "finer things in life". Good imported cheese? Caviar? Imported preserves made from fruits you normally don't see? Fox & Obel is the spot. I wouldn't shop here regularly simply because I'm not of the income level to afford it, but I will come here when I need those particular gourmet items you just won't find at any grocery store.
