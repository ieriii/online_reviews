Sunda folks! That's all you can say is folks!! This was my 2nd time there and it was amazing just like the 1st time. Reservations were at 10pm and it was still bumpin like bumper bowling! The Beef Lolllipops were stupendous! And i got the Shaking Beef as my entree and that was really good as well. Billy Dec was in the place that night and he walked by our table and I was able to get some small talk with him. He came by after we finished our plates with a FREE dessert on him. What a fella! If there are any such thing as goodfellas out there, he is it. He's a fella.
