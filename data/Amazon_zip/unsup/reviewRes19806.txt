5 stars for the food, but minus two stars for their wacked out ordering system. Nota bene! Xoco is NOT a good place for a group! Especially if you don't all arrive at the same time. On top of the fact that it is very small, they don't let you sit down until you order. My friend and I were a few minutes late meeting some friends there. They ordered their food and sat down, but there was no room for us to sit with them, so we had to wait until the table next to them cleared out before we could even order. By the time I sat down and got my food, they were already done eating! Dining Fail! As for the food, my friend and I ordered the only two vegetarian options on the menu and split them. Extremely delicious (although the soup was a little on the salty side). Oh, and you can't go wrong with Mexican hot chocolate! Also, do NOT drive here! Parking is (I guess obviously) atrocious.
