We came here with a large group for a birthday dinner. The service was excellent - we got tons of delicious cornbread muffins and drinks as we waited for our whole group to arrive. I shared crab fritters for an app and they were excellent, as were the sauces served alongside. For dinner I had the black bean cakes with both the mango salsa and the red pepper sauce, Yankee coleslaw (vinegary which I favor), cheese grits and green beans. I absolutely loved everything. The food was really flavorful, fresh and interesting. I also got the very reasonable flight of red wine for $7.95 which was unpretentious and good. I realize this place is totally batso crazy in the mornings and I think I'll just return for dinner. The whole place was dimly (with a big Christmas tree), fun but not loud and just delightful. We watched snow fall out the big windows and just had a blast. Hooray.
