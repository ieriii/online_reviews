Ok, I have to say, I'm irritated by the other reviews. So many focus on the supposed "bad service." I have been here several times in (as Sinatra said) 'the wee small hours of the morning'...and these ladies do their job, regardless of who they are dealing with. (Think of the 'wee small hours' and the people that may inhabit that time period.) The ladies seat you, they serve you wonderful food, and they make sure you have what you need. They are straightforward. They are working their asses off, people, and dealing with all sorts of folk in all sorts of...states. So back off. Seriously.
