Fair pricing, excellent service, good food. Came here with a big group of people, the place is quite big and it was packed, which I take as a good sign. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli along with the Fried Calamari and Caprese Salad. The Calamari was great, great sauce, fried but not really greasy. The Lobster Ravioli was pretty good, I can't complain, the sauce was not quite what I was expecting but still good. For dessert we had the pane cotta. Excellent dessert, highly recommend this restaurant's version of it!
