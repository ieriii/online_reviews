gave it a 2 because at 4 star it is over-rated, and i would rate it a 2.5 which means i either round up or round down, i round down to a 2. went on a sun night ~830 because we were in the hood. it was so dead. like we had the entire dining room to ourselves dead. that kind of takes away from the ambiance. everyone here says you order an entree you get the salad bar? at least on sun night, the only entree that came with salad bar was eggplant parma which i was going to order anyway. menu is kind of weird like that. eggplant was the cheapest thing there, and it comes with salad bar and a soup too? other things were more expensive and only came with a soup OR a salad. that salad bar kind of scared me. i have not read any of the reviews and i don't rmember what they said on check please 6 months ago, but i asked myself what did they make fresh and what was out of a can on that salad bar? for example they had these mushrooms. did they make them in house or open a jar? i don't know. the bread they brought to the table was sad: crusty, dried out, did not taste fresh though the eggplant parma was indeed tasty
