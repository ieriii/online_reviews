Okay... I have to confess, I actually wanted to go to Tango Sur. However, when I called a week prior, they said that their large tables were all booked and we weren't likely to get seated till after 10pm. THAT was not going to work. Luckily, a transplant Chicagoian told us about Las Tablas. We were able to get seated after about a 10 minute wait for 14 people. Score! They said that while that they would accommodate us , we had to quickly clear out of there because of later reservations. A bit strange for them to hint that to us but be a bit slow on the take. The bill and etc were a bit slow... but that was all the better for us. As for the food, it was solid. I wish the accompanying sauces had more of a kick to them but they did the job. The BYOB is for wine only, and only on the weekdays so we missed out. Ps. Does anyone know what's up with the model pictures on their website menu and wall? Awkward, much?
