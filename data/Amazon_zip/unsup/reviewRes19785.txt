I have only been to a handful of Sushi restaurants in Chicago, but Coast is the only one that I have returned to again and again. I do, I love Coast! I have never been less than impressed with the quality of the sushi, the presentation, the waitstaff, and the vibe of the restaurant itself. Great date spot.  I am partial to the rolls, and they have always been delicious. The man normally gets the sushi or sashimi plate, which always works for him. They often have really yummy sounding specials as well. Sushi! Yum!
