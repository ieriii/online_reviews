Y. U. M.! This place was great!  To start with, we had the nicest waiter. He was so patient with 3 chatty broads and definitely had some great recommendations. He even overheard my friend and I say we were going to split our dishes and had the kitchen split out dishes for us! Our dishes were good and the portions were very generous, especially for the price. My girl friend is a super picky eater and they made her something that was not on the menu, did not complain about it, and did not charge her extra for it.  The desserts were good. Nothing spectacular but very good. We got the creme brulee and these pistachio gelato filled cream puffs covered in chocolate. I am not a huge cream puff fan but the gelato was delish. I cannot wait to go back in the summer and enjoy the patio!
