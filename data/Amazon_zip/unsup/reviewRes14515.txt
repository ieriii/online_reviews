This place was pretty awesome! The beer selection was great, and the in house brews were excellent. I loved the hibiscus beer! The bartenders were fast, and the food was great. I got the mexican themed burger and it was excellent! The side of blue cheese potato salad was also quite good. I feel that my views of bar food are always slanted by my previous intake of 5 or so beers. I would eat almost anything at that point.
