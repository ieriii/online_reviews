Awesome coffee and pickles! Those two things don't usually go together but they certainly do at Milk and Honey. As my "across the street" coffee place I have been going to Milk and Honey since it opened. I've gotten my morning coffee from just about every place through out the Wicker Park / Bucktown area. For some reason no one brews their Intelligensia quite as well as they do here. Plus a medium for under $2 w/ tax...well that just makes me feel a lot better than the plus $2 cup at Starbucks. I'm a fan of the sandwiches as well. The roast beef sandwich and the crap cakes are always great. But the best part about their sandwiches are the pickles. I'm not a huge pickle fan normally. I'll eat them but not go out of my way for them. But the Milk and Honey pickles are something else. These homemade pickles have a little more spice and zest than a normal pickle. As far as I'm concerned it's the best pickle ever.
