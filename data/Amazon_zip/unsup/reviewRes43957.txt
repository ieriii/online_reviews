This spot is very unassuming but is definitely one of my favorites in the city. The place is quaint but very comfortable. The menu is a bit limited, but hits everything across the spectrum of sweets, eggs, healthy stuff, etc. I am still amazed that they keep their prices so low - nothing above $6.75 and the portions are huge. Everything is very fresh, and the coffee, etc. is very good (Intelligentsia). As with all the other good spots, it does get crowded on the weekends. But they use an interesting system - you order when you get there, take a number, and then whey they call you, you sit and they serve you pretty much immediately. I like this, as it ensures those who are sitting are eating, rather than each table sitting for 10-15 min to order and wait for food to arrive. Bottom line - this place never disappoints. Check it out, but don't too many of you go at once cuz I need you to save some space for me!
