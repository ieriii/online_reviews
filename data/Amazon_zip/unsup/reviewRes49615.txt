So they moved the location. I think it's now 2946, can't remember...It's now across the street. It's so much bigger and classier. I wish they had entertainment. I went w/ a group of friends who thought the place was too dim. The bathrooms are in a maze. You have do go down a group of stairs, turn around the corner and voila. Definitely didn't like that. They did have a nice seating area to wait for who ever is in the stall.  Well I opened up the menu and it's pretty expensive. Bout $15 - $35. The food got there pretty fast and it comes out steaming. The waiter was very attentive and everything we needed he pretty much brought out. I didn't think the food was that great compared to El llano. The food is inexpensive there as well... I think I will come here but only if I'm on a date or something.
