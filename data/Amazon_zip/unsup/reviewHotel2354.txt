We looked at this hotel for our wedding. We could not get a date that worked otherwise we would have held it here. We worked with Amy and she was great. Very responsive and worked with us on price. The hotel is in a great location, has a decent sized pool, big bar, rooftop deck, and the price for parking was a bit better than the other hotels we looked at.
