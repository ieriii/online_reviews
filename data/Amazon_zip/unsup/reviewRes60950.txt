I had the pleasure of eating here a few months ago when I passed through Chicago. The next time I'm in town I'll be stopping here again. Everything my friends and I tried was seriously tasty but I'd have trouble ordering anything other than the pork belly and cod dish. Scrumptious. The apple cider donuts for desert were as delicious as I expected. The service was excellent. Our waitress was cool and knowledgeable, and especially helpful with the wine pairings. This place had everything I need in a meal, great food, great service and a reasonable price.
