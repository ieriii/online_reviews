I was so excited to try this place & it did not disappoint! The baby buddha is the smallest bowl I think but still was a ton of food & I wasn't even able to eat it all. I'm excited to come back to try the wings! The place is very small & it was very busy. We were there around 7pm and had to get take out, so plan accordingly.
