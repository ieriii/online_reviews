I absolutely love this place! I'm very picky about Mediterranean food being that I'm Armenian and grew up eating the best home cooked Greek/Armenian food ever!! The owners of this place gotta be Greek or Armenian because they have authentic recipes and the flat bread there is amazing! My guy takes me here when I just don't feel like cooking and he knows I'll leave there a happy girl! They also have free valet! -C.L.G.
