Note to self: hop over to Hopleaf again soon. This is definitely the spot for you beer lovers out there. Or you food lovers. The food ain't too shabby here.  Our table shared a bottle of Domaine Dupont cider made from 6 different types of apples from France. And I really wish I could have Belgian style mussels for dinner every week. The broth, made of ale, shallots, and celery was mouth-watering fantastic and explains the french bread served up with the entree. The fries and garlic aioli are another story, which I will summarize for you as "the epitome of deliciousness".  I will be back to 1) dine on the outdoor patio, and 2) try the duck reuben! And the order of mussels and frites? A given.
