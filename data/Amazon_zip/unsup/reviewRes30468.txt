I loved it! Great atmosphere, great service, and very unique sushi/roll/menu options! I love sushi, but plenty of options on the menu for people who are not full on sushi fans. Food was excellent! Very rare to order something, and then want to order it again...and we felt this way multiple times! Can't wait to go back!
