I went to Coast last Sunday after wandering Bucktown for a few hours with some dude. Turns out, it's pretty awesome. I have a terrible memory, but we ordered the special hibachi carpaccio with jalepeno and lime, a spicy salmon roll, something with scallops and a volcano roll. Everything was ridiculously fresh and delicious; you can really taste how excellent the fish is. Another bonus was the fresh wasabi we got on the side. How have I not had it before? Who knows. But it's the bomb dot com. Overall, the atmosphere is casual but sophisticated. Our waitress was friendly, and very willing to offer suggestions when we realized that we didn't order quite enough food. I'd definitely come back with a large group and more wine.
