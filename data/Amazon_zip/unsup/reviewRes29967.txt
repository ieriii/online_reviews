This is definitely my new favorite place. Flavor Flavor Flavor from the Oh so delish Margaritas to the best queso fundido and Ceviche I've ever had. My server was incredible to the point where I felt like I was the only table he was waiting on. I was a special occasion for our visit( My birthday) and they sure went above and beyond. My boyfriend ordered the steak the server recommended and I got the Catfish. We savored every bite of our meal it was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had. If you love lots of flavor and great Margaritas definitely check this place out!
