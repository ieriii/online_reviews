The treat truck is a brilliant concept that is exceptionally well executed by Donna. Most of the treats are grain & gluten free. She also has frozen yogurt spiked with things like chicken and beef. My dog looks for the truck whenever we're walking in that area and insists on checking out the place where it's usually parked! He loves it, and so do I. The owner, Donna, is fun and very customer focused.  Donna also does grooming out of a space on Randolph & Halsted. I had her groom my dog in late June and she did a fabulous job. It's a cage-free environment and she takes one dog at a time. I was able to stay, watch, and provide input. She is very meticulous and wanted to make sure I was happy. I was, and would definitely let her groom my dog again. I highly recommend the treat truck as well as Donna's grooming services!
