The service at this restaurant is what stood out most for me. The servers are knowledgeable, funny, and work very well together.  Most of the food was delicious. The duck confit, lobster, and shot of whiskey mixed with cheese were my favorites. A few of the courses were a bit too salty for my liking, but overall, it was a great six course meal.
