Great place! I came in with my parents just last night on a very busy friday without any reservations. We were asked to wait in the juice bar for 15 minutes before we were seated. It was probably one of the best waits I've ever had. We were given little appetizers to hold us off while we waited for our table. I've never had any other restaurant do that for me! I found it very nice of this small family ran business.Once we were seated our waters came out, we already knew what we wanted to order and gave the waiter our order. Our food came out only 8 minutes later! We proceeded to eat and enjoy our dinner with service checking up on us. I only took off one star because the portion of my King Crab Pasta didn't seem to be large enough for me. Otherwise everything else seems to have been a great evening at Simply It!
