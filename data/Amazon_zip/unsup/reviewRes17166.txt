HOLY guacamole! My in laws were in town and we took them out to celebrate their 30th Anniversary. (We had notified the restaurant in advance when we made the reservation.) Bright, bold colors, a soaring ceiling and lively staff welcomed us. Our waiter was fantastic! He approached the table and said, "I hear we are celebrating a special anniversary tonight!" (My in laws loved this touch.) He introduced himself, explained the specials, and took our drink orders. Multiple mixed drinks quickly covered our table. The colors and the flavors of these delicious beverages were as bold as the decor. The aged cheeses we tried were also delicious, each with a unique and distinct flavor. We sampled some additional apps and then moved on to our main course. My ahi tuna was seared to perfection. My mother in law had the fillet special; it was also cooked perfectly and had a phenomenal flavor. The guys ranted and raved over their dishes as well. Complimentary glasses of champagne were raised as we indulged in a delectable dessert. Cheers to wonderful meal ... oh, and a happy anniversary!
