We walked over and sat at the bar at 12.30p to wait for our fourth companion to make it. There were tables available, but couldn't sit until all of party made it. Pleased me since it allowed me to watch the bartenders craft their cocktails. Oh man. memorized. Though I didn't have their bloody mary, lawrence or whatever, it is supposedly a-fucking-mazing. The food? I got the aged cheddar cheese burger with bacon and beef fat fries. The fries are fucking delicious and great. Others may feel that they are too salty, but they are perfect for this guy. Totally going back. Additionally: The males in this establishment are to grow mustaches for July.
