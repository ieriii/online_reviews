As a transplant from Atlanta, I got pretty excited when I heard there was a "Southern" restaurant in my area. So the first time I went to Wishbone, I was a little disappointed by the mediocrity of what I consider the Southern staples--the biscuits are nothing to write home about, and the sweet tea is straight nasty. However, authenticity aside, there is some seriously tasty eatin' to be had at Wishbone. Their fried chicken (which I wish was a menu fixture rather than a special) is delicious, their vegetable sides are great (especially the black-eyed peas), and I could bathe in their cheese grits. The mac 'n' cheese is also orgasmic. Another bonus is the service. I have never received anything less than gracious, friendly, and attentive service here. Sometimes it can be a little slow, but I think part of that can be attributed to the size of the restaurant. All in all, I like this place a lot. It definitely fits the comfort food bill, and it's a great place to go with friends. Plus, they can accomodate vegetarians super-easily, which is a plus for someone who is often the sole carnivore at the table.
