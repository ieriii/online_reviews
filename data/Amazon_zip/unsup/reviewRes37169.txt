My boyfriend is a BIG beer fanatic...borderline beer snob. We made the trek out here on a rainy, windy Saturday night from the Loop. That's how much he was looking forward to go. This bar does get crowded on a Saturday night. They have a front area bar/dining area (more beer on draft), dining area in the back, and upstairs (serving bottle beers; cash only upstairs). It's hard to find seats at the bar so expect to stand awhile and wait for a seat. For a beer newbie and a beer snob, we were both impressed with what they had on tap. As a female, I particularly liked the: - Lagunitas - very light and crisp with a citrus aftertaste - DuPont - Avec Les Bon Voeux . At a hefty 9.5% alcohol content, this drink does not taste like it! But it's good. I don't drink my beers fast but I was enjoying this one beer quickly. A good drink for any females and males. We also ordered the charcuterie and it was good , except for the picked little eggs (stay away from those!). It was a good pair to the drinks that we had.
