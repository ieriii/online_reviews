Okay agreed.. Andersonville is a place to be... I found a very good salon (sonia salon) and now this.. Great beer selection and easily one of the best bars in the area. Or, should i say in chicago.. It wasn't very crowded to begin with but surely people love this place .. Within half hour the place got very crowded and it was hard to buy beer at the bar without standing in line for sometime..Again.. Great beer selection.. Place to Go...
