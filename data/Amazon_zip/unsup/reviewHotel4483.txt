The hotel is very nicely done up. Exactly what you would expect from a prime location such as this one. The hotel is a blend between old fashioned style and modern ikea furniture. The room was really nice and I loved the fact it was sweepingly large. I had a fantastic time here. I would like to return to this hotel, if they were having another special like they were when I stayed. Otherwise I would imagine this place would be pretty pricey.
