Can't say enough about the fare here.. Awesome.. :) I have been back a quite a few times since my first visit here and am definitely going back when i can.. Suggestions: Empanadas - Must try. They are delicious and perfectly cooked.  Entrana - Juicy and tender steak. Yummy !! For first time visitors or groups, you can try the combination platter as well which has a little bit of everything including steaks, sausages, ribs and seafood. All dishes are accompanied with tapioca and the most delicious mouth-watering plantains. And to back these up the chimichurri is in a class of it's own.
