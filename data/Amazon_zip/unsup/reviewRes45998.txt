i had a honey vanilla latte, and the flavor was way better than i expected. it was good to the last drop, as they say. i also shared some of the fudge cake and peach cobbler, which were delicious. the fudge cake was a little too much to handle, and it made me question my commitment to chocolate. i could probably eat a whole peach cobbler from grand lux every day. my wife said it tasted like a little weed was mixed in the batch, but i think she's crazy. for the coffee, it was about $5, which i think is definitely a good price for what you get. you'd easily spend that much on a mediocre coffee at starbucks. it took a little while to get out cobbler, but it's because they have to bake it...and that's the kind of thing you don't mind waiting around for.
