Good Place! Inside is spare/Large bar-seating for like 20/Old 70's Wurlitzer Jukebox with some obscure tunes/Backroom seating/Patio, etc. I'm gonna start in the Liquor Dept--Great Beer List/Whiskey List! Probably 100 Brews and at least 50 different Whiskeys on the list. Drink list is about 7 deep and the bartenders take pride in EVERY drink they make!! The "Logan Palmer" is an amazing choice for sure.. never had anything like it! Also the St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout is flat out Great... Onto the food--- got it going with the "Rabbit" app and "Welsh Rarebit", very good things going on! Next round were the Famed Scallops/Awesome flavors happening! Main Courses were mind blowing--Steak and Pork Belly..some of the best flavors I have tasted in quite some time! The Pork is a MUST TRY!! EVERYONE here was friendly as hell from the Hostess to the Bartenders to the Bus Man!!! When it's all said and done, they top it off with a comped shot of Cabin Still!!! GTFJD PS--Tons of Amazing Looking Women lurking around....
