If you are fortunate enough to be able to afford Alinea then my advice is to do it. Yes, I felt like collapsing to the floor when the bill came, but the experience and food was so damn good that I could rationalize it. Alinea is a once in a lifetime experience. Much of what makes Alinea so special is the element of surprise and creativity, so I will not divulge its secrets. I will say that each course is so incredibly delicious and innovative that Alinea ranks as the best overall dinning experience I've ever had. Yelp needs to add another star for Alinea.
