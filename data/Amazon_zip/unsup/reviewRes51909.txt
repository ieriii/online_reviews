I don't really like deep dish pizza. I do however, like the cornbread texture and flavor Gino's uses in the crust. Negative for the over abundance of cheese. Does a person really need a pound of cheese on their slice of pizza? No, they do not. I have yet to try Gino's thin crust, so maybe next time that will be the winning ticket. The bar and bartenders are the best part of this place. A must stop if visiting Chicago.
