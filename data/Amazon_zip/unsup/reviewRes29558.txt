Great place for a inexpensive pasta meal. Food is excellent and I would recommend their Macaroni & Cheese as the best I've had for the money. However, my favorite meal is the Frutti Di Mare. Portions are huge! I don't believe I've ever finished, but it makes good for drunk leftovers. Best part is they deliver!
