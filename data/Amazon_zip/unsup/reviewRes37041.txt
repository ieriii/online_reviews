Service was awesome!! People at the door were friendly. When we sat in the area that doesn't have servers and you need to go to the bar (which is clearly marked), one of the staff still came up to us right away and told us where the full service area was if we were interested. We moved to that full service area and our waiter seemed a bit confused or distracted, but immediately this other lady started filling in for him, correcting his mistakes and answering our questions. He may have been new, or on drugs, but kudos to the lady staffer who saved us!  The Beer Choices: Simply Amazing. Extensive craft beer list that will not disappoint. The Food: This is why Hop didn't get more stars from me. I'll begin with the $12 specialty sausage and german potato salad appetizer. Got 2 small pieces of sausage and fried potatoes. I talked to the waiter and it was explained to me that it was a non-deli style german potato salad. listen guys...these were fried potatoes and nothing more. A friend ordered the duck sandwich which arrived with burnt toast and terrible tasting fries. The Tilapia was more breading than fish.  Stick to Beer!!! Dump the food! and Keep up the Good Service!
