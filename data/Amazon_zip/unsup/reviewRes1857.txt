After seeing this on No Reservations and CBS Sunday Morning, I've been planning when I could take a Friday off of work to go here. And when I finally did, it was SO worth it. Location is challenging. You're in a partial CTA dead-zone but this place is really a testament to the fact that people DO indeed travel for good food. I went on a Friday at about 10:45 a.m. to make sure I would get the duck fat fries. Yes, I know it's early but there was already a line out the door and when I left around noon, it was insanely long but it moves pretty fast along. I had the duck fat fries, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris and one of the specials, Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions. Both were good and good size, but I preferred the fois gras. It wasn't too heavy and the duck sausage was actually very tasty. The Ribeye was good too but not my favorite. The duck fat fries were great. Really, nothing more to say there. I even got a Chicago dog to take home for my dad. Service is great, Doug takes your order, answers questions and helps you get the best tasting dog possible. I even got to put in my take-home order when I got my main food and it was ready and warm for me when left. I know there will always be a line, but I would definitely go back (early again too).
