I am deathly afraid of spicy food. I break out in the sweats even before I take a bite. I went here with a bunch of Yelpers to check this new place out. I started reviewing the menu days in advance to try to decide what I wanted to get. When I finally arrived I finally turned to a pussy and ordered the plain jane fried chicken. The chicken was solid. It wasn't the greatest that I had, but it was above average. From hearing what others were saying, I probably could have taken the next step up in sauce without my spice-o-phobia kicking in. We ordered a side of mushrooms and what can i say, they were fried mushrooms. What I really enjoyed were the smashed potatoes. They serve them chilled which originally stuck me as odd, but when I tried them, I was thoroughly impressed. I am not sure what they put in them but they were delicious, even served chilled. I have a feeling that the owner was the guy taking the orders. He was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I was also impressed that he warned us about the potatoes. He checked up on us several times and made sure we were doing OK. He really went out of his way to be sure we were enjoying ourselves.He even changed the radio station when he overheard us saying what a crappy song was playing. I sure hope they continue this habit of good service.
