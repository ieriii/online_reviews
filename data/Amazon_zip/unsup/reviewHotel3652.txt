Went for high tea here recently. Its definitely an experience to have at some point. You get to choose from a bunch of different teas, finger sandwhiches, scones, and pastries. At about $35 per person, its quite hefty for afternoon tea, but the entire experience is lovely. The atmosphere, service, and ambiance are really amazing and it makes for a very relaxing, yet elegant occassion. And of course the beautiful harp adds a very elegant touch.
