Incredible! We sit down, order. I go to the bathroom for two minutes, come back, and the table is covered with rainbows. I don't know what any of it was, aside from the short ribs and beef (which were maybe the most tender meat I've ever had), but there was enough of it to sink a ship, and everything was awesome in combination with everything else. Seaweed salad, spiced cabbage, weird rice jello?--all I know for sure is that I'll be coming back with a lot of friends... (Oh the partitioned seating is a nice touch)
