This was our first opportunity to try Sapori Trattoria as we were visiting from out of town. I had read the reviews about the Monday night special so we made it a point to go on Monday to try the $20.95 prix fixe fare.Food, glorious food, you certainly will not go hungry on Monday. The menu for the special was quite extensive. Especially for the entrees, I would have preferred a few more choices for the appetizer as a couple in our group really weren't interested in the calamari and 2 of the four choices were calamari based.We had the avocado crostini, fried calamari, stella salad, squash soup, and three entrees as well as tiramisu for dessert. The bread is tasty and they kept refilling which meant we were quite full before we ever got to our salad/soup course.The entrees were LARGE, and we left nearly 1/2 of the total amount. If we weren't staying in a hotel it would have feed us for another two meals or so with takeout.The weather was very pleasant and we enjoyed sitting in the outdoor seating area, although Halsted isn't exactly the most enjoyable street to overlook we had a great time.The service was excellent and our servers were pleasant, always smiling and gave us the attention we needed at the appropriate times. Total bill for 4 with a bottle of wine and tip was $150.
