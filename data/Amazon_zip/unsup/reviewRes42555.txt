I love the Art of Pizza! I've heard all the hype, and had never experienced it until one lovely Saturday. The food is amazing, not just the pizza.( You get a definite bang for your buck) The people are friendly and attentive. I love the buttered garlic bread, buns, everything. Their pizza is also amazing, but overall a great experience. Also, if your order is over $20 they give you a free 2 ltr automatically! We all win in a situation like this.
