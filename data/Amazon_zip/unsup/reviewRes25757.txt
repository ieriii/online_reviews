I'm really not a big fan of Piece Pizza, but I went with a few friends and was told it would be hour and half wait. WTF? I know it's Saturday night, but It's not worth that kind of a wait. Instead, we went to Pequod's because none of us had been there. We arrive only to have to a 15 minute wait, which is much better. We got deep dish pizza, which didn't take long to make. The pizza was really good. However, we all thought "it could use some extra cheese." I told another friend the next day and she asked if we had extra cheese because they apparently don't put enough on it. Ahhh, that would have been helpful. Remember, ask for extra cheese! It's worth it.  I can eat...alot. I could only eat two slices of their deep dish.  Base your ordering on a 2 slices per person rule and you'll have plenty. I found the restaurant to be quaint and comfortable. The service quick and friendly. Worth going again. I forgot to mention... In the time it took us to drive there, order, eat and pay, we would still be waiting for Piece Pizza to actually get around to seating us. Which would you rather do? Wait or eat?
