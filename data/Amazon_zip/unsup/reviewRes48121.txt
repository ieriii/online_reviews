As a bartender, I don't get many weekend nights off, so being able to hit The Publican on a real-live weekend night (after tearing my real-live ACL) had me all-a-flutter (or maybe its all the pain killers). Nevertheless, The Publican offers, hands-down, the best meal you will ever have from inside a hog pen (seriously, the hog pens are part of the decor). The simple but elegant "beer, oysters, and pork" concept, fresh ingredients, skillful execution, generous portions, and friendly service make this place five-star worthy in my humble and drug-addled opinion. That, and they have Orval (the wifey's favorite beer). Happy wife = happy life. We bought the kitchen a 6 pack (which is an option on the menu) and they rang a huge bell and applauded us. But it is we who should be applauding you. Keep up the good work!
