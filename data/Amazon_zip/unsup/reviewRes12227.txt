This is the best pizza, I've tasted since living in Chicago. I'm not a deep dish and this is what I have been searching for all summer. It is in a great area where people act like real adults and the service was awesome. My friends and I received 50% of our off because of a mistake. This is by far the best pizza I have tasted since coming to Chicago. Keep up the great pizza and service.
