Great fusion twist to traditional tapas. Eating here brings back such pleasant memories of our meals in Valencia and Madrid. A visiting friend also said the food was very reminiscent of her particular region, and always tries to eat here when she's in town. We've been both to the little round bar area and the dining room, and the space is so well appointed, with detailed attention paid even to the smallest of decor. Ignore the snotty hostesses (minus half-star), once we got past them, the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. The food, desserts, wine, and cocktails are all excellent. We've had the flatbreads, gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas, paella negra, lamb, and several other things I can't remember now, but I DO remember it all tasted great. The mushroom soup was so heavenly I could have drunk a gallon of it. Both red and white sangrias were yummy, and the "Dark and Stormy", gaaaahhh.....
