Alinea was simply phenomenal. And SO FUN! Walking in the entrance, you knew you were getting into an experience to say the least. The dining room was cozy and warm, like dining in a fancy friend's house. The service was perfect - professional but not too stiff. They were good at reading our table and as the night progressed, and even became friendly - cracked a smooth joke here and there, and answered the questions that we rhetorically asked ourselves. Also, contributed to our skydiving conversations. The food was out of this world. Each course had a story and contributed to the entire journey. The wine pairings were perfect as well.
