Pizza is pretty good, however, their staff and service is downright horrible. Ordered delivery and not the whole order arrived and when asked when we can get it, the delivery driver started giving me attitude and talking back to me. Called in to get it corrected and the person taking orders started giving me attitude as well. Such a shame good food gets overshadowed by horrible service.
