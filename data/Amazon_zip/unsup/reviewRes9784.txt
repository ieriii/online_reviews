What an absolutely lovely dining experience. Lovely is really the best word to describe the feel of a meal at Le Colonial. It seems like most nice restaurants I find in Chicago are either too scene-y or too stuffy. Le Colonial is neither of these things. I was able to enjoy a completely delicious and relaxed gourmet meal surrounded by what looked like a set from "Casablanca." The staff was attentive and helpful-thanks for the thorough definition of a lotus root! But none of this would matter if the food wasn't top notch and it absolutely is. The French-Vietnamese fusion tended to lean more towards the Vietnamese side, at least in the dishes I ordered, up until my desert of a very traditional creme brulee. Everything we tried was delicious and some of the food definitely had a kick, which I appreciated. I can't wait to get back and try everything else! I feel as though this review isn't terribly eloquent, but it's always easy to put voice to complaints: it's harder to aptly describe a blemish-free dining experience, except to say that this was one! Highly recommended.
