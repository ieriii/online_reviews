If this placed served Mimosas & Bloody Mary's, it would have gotten 4-stars. Enjoyed Yolk multiple times and love the California Omelet. Actually, it's the only thing I've ever ordered. It is absolutely humongous and could easily feed two. If you take it home for leftovers, remember it has guacamole which doesn't reheat very well. Service has always been pleasant. If you can get a booth, you're in luck. The table configuration is a bit tight and a times annoying (maybe cause I'm not a morning person). For a table of 2, I've never had to wait more than 10-minutes.
