Ok, I'm going to split this into two parts. The "experience" and the food. Did the Tour with the wine pairings. Experience wise, I'd give this place 5 stars. The atmosphere, the level of service, the presentation, are all perfect as you would expect. This is an experience that few will ever see a glimpse. Now to the food. The food is definitely different and covers a wide range of flavors, and for innovation I would give it a 5. That said, I can honestly say its not the most amazing meal I've ever had. I'd rate the food on a pure taste level a 2, and since alinea is a restaurant, i feel the food is what i should rate(gave it 1 more star because of the experience). I feel a lot of these reviews that give 5 stars, and comment that this is the most amazing place outstanding, etc are people who are just too scared to admit they just dropped a considerable chunk of change on food that actually didn't taste good, or their rating the experience. I will probably never go here again unless someone is paying for me. During our meal I can honestly say we were the youngest people there, and probably having the most fun. Sat on the second floor, in the back corner for two. Alinea is in its own price range, but others I would consider in place of Alinea would be Moto, or for a downright deal I love Bonsoiree(BYOB).
