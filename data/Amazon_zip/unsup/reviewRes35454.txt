Let's just say it's the best duck around town! We came here and had a hard time ordering only because we didn't have cash and wanted to order enough to make the minimum so we could use a credit card! I think this place was recently renovated. The place is HUGE. There is a lot of space and it's clean. We were seated and didn't have to wait long to order our food. It took us awhile to decide what to order since they have a lot of items on their menu. We settled for their 1. Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce 2. Combination on rice (which is BBQ pork, BBQ Chicken, and roasted duck) 3. Egg noodle soup with shrimp dumplings and duck The noodle soup was SOOOOO good. The broth was fresh and tasty. The duck was juicy and tender without a lot of fat. The combo on rice was a huge portion also. As a garnish, they give you 1/2 of a preserved duck egg and some Chinese broccoli as well. I can't wait to go back here and try the other stuff on their menu! Definitely a place worth checking out.
