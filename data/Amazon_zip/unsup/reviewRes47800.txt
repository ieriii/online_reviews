Only stopped here for drinks. We had the Raspberry Sangria, which was very good and refreshing, but the menu said it was topped with fruit, there was one lone raspberry floating in it and the glass was only about half full. Which was fine because the drink was only $8.00. It was still very good. This place had a fun vibe and a great view up on the rooftop. It is def a much younger crowd, 20 somethings, so you had some sloppy drunk young kids here, but all in all it was fun and a great rooftop. I would love to go back and try some of the appetizers.
