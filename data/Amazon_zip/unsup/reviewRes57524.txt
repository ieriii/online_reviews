Be warned... The dishes meals here are oversized, lol. Not that it's a bad thing of course. I went in with my coworkers after a long day at work and ordered the lamb already not as hungry as my buddies. When it arrived, I was awestruck! Thankfully, my friend finished what I had left of it. The place is great and the staff was very friendly to our group! Long story short, I'm making plans to eat there this friday night!
