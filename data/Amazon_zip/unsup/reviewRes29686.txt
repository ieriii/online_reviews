Unlike stated, this place IS NOT GLUTEN-FREE, but has a notable risk of cross-contamination. Although they even have a gluten free menu, the communication from the rude staff indicated that a person with gluten intolerance is better off - or dying in starvation. So that's what we eventually had to do after engaging in an insulting debate with the waiter leaving my partner running out in tears. Great job staff.
