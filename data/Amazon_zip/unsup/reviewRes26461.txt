I will remain forever loyal to my NY pizza but GOOD LORD is Pequod's tasty! To me, pizza is synonymous with the perfect balance of cheese, sauce, & bread of a large floppy slice from my favorite pizzeria in NJ, but I'm starting to cross over to the dark side. The best part of Pequod's pan pizza is by far the crust. Caramelized and crunchy yet chewy and not crumbly like other deep dish pizza places.  I've only gotten delivery and so I can't comment on the restaurant experience, but as an East Coaster who has been ridiculously stubborn about her pizza preferences for the past 8 years, I will say...I'm in love, Pequod's. Thank you.
