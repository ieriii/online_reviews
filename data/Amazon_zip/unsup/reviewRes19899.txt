Rick Bayless + upscale counterfood = affordable celebrity chef dining to the masses = success It probably doesn't hurt that Rick Bayless won Top Chef Masters, but Bill Kim has done it and I hear Graham Elliot is going to as well. It's not exactly cheap, but not unreasonable either. It's all about perspective. A top chef meal for 2 under $50? Sounds like a deal to me. Cubano: pork loin, bacon,cheese, beans & avocado? Delishness. Ahogado: either they messed up and gave me the spicy or the medium is really spicy! I grew up on hot sauce & kimchi, but found myself wimping out on the spicy broth. Chips/guac/salsas: pretty good, but I would love if they would offer some papas fritas churro: $1.25 each or 3 for $3 It's worth trying $47 for the cubano, ahodaga, chips/guac/salsas, beer, wine, chocolate con leche, and a churro. Was the food worth it? Yes. When you're thinking about the food the next morning, you know it was good.
