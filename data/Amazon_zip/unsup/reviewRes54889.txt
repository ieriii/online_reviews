Great Beer Selection.My friends in Chicago wanted me to discover the premier gastropub of the windy city.I get lost in their beer menu, I honestly think they have too many!Just my opinion.Pro & ConsLets start with the cons, too noisy, very loud! The waitress seem to be in pain!Our table! they stuck us on the second level in a corner, my 2 friend were Little embarrassed by our seating arrangement.The pros, the polenta was to die for, the mac and cheese was pretty good with just the right crust.Great beers, we sampled 3, I don't remember the names.Overall, good place, Chicago have room to improve on gastropubs
