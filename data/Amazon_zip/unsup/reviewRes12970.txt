A carnivore's paradise. The salad bars offer much more variety than Fogo de Chao. The non-stop meat carved at your table is tasty. Considering the mass quantities of quality food, the price is reasonable. Skip the meal before you go, don't overdo at the tempting salad bars, and leave plenty of room for the lamb, chicken, beef, sausage, pork, etc.
