Went here in the summer with a group of friends. Stopped for drinks up on the patio - which was awesome. The blackberry mimosa I had was perfect for the weather.  Dinner was a bit much, but I wanted to try everything - and all of it was pretty good. They also have a great salad, bread and cheese selection that is included in the price. Decor is neat, cool hipster feel to it. More worth it for the patio than the food.
