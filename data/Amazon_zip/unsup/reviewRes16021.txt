The food was very good and we enjoyed the live music. The only issue we had was our seating. We waiting over 1/2 hour to be seated with a reservation. They sat us right by the door which was very drafty since it was cold (and smoke coming in right from the bar next door). I asked to be moved and we were promptly moved to a booth towards the back. One thing I should point out....when we moved to our new table, the four water glasses at our old table were left there for the new people sitting. We saw someone re-filling these water glasses rather then replacing them. And two of us drank from them before we left the table. Gross. The food was delicious....would consider going back but will not drink from the water if it is sitting at our table when we arrive!
