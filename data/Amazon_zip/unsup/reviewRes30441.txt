I went to this restaurant last weekend. Food was fabulous, I had pork and nectarine stuffed poblano peppers with a wonderful walnut sauce topped with pomegranites. It was lovely. According to our waiter the salsa's that are sold in some stores are not the same ones that you get with your chips and salsa. They are great though. A friend had the guacamole and told me it was to die for. I found this restaurant to be fabulous, and i would gladly go back.
