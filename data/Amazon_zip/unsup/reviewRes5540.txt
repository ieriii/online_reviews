I am baffled! I do not understand the raves about this place. 1st time in, the hostess was so inpolite and unwelcoming i wanted to run out of there. so we did. the place seemed packed but that was becasue the entry was cramed. next visit the place was empty. we tried 2 plates and they were both horrible. the shrimp and crab was bland and ... well ... just plain horrible. Prosciutto Bread Balls were also pretty bad. So i guess go for the wine? but then what's the big deal? I mean this is Chicago I can find 10 great wine spots in 10 seconds AND have a great experience instead of walking into an attitude parlor.
