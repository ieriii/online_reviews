While the food was good, it was just good, not oh-my-god-this-is-amazing, and it wasn't good enough to overshadow the abysmal service by the host/hostess. We had a reservation for 8:00 on a Friday night. We got our table at 9:19. The hostess wouldn't even make eye contact with us--whenever I walked up to ask how much longer it would be, she saw me coming and would duck into the back. I get it--you're popular and you're busy. If you wanted us to wait that long, I might even have done it if they just didn't take reservations (a la Kuma's Corner). The bar was too packed to grab a seat, and we were too hungry to drink that much, so we just waited for a while. The only thing that kept us there was that we couldn't get another table at a nearby restaurant. For as big and popular a restaurant as they are, I would think they'd have their s*** together a little more.
