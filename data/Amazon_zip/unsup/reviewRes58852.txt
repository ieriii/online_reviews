Wish I could review the food, but it never got that far! Friday night I ordered on grubhub, 60 bucks worth, because my bro and his wife were visiting and have never had sushi! So I ordered from Sunda cuz ive heard it was good.. Well they call back like 15 mins later saying they dont deliver to me.. Ok fine, im over it... Until today, tuesday it is still a debit on my account, no refund yet. So I call grubhub and the guy i talked to called sunda right away. He called back, he was super super nice, he said they never processed any kind of refund ;( Thought I would just forget about it? Ha, yeah right! I watch my money closely guys!!! Maybe this was a mistake, but if I were them (I have worked in service industry for about 6 years) I would have made sure to refund immediately! If I wouldnt have paid close attention to my bank account it would have gone unnoticed!
