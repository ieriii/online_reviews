This place is alright. The server was good, the food was good as well. When I called to make a reservation for by boyfriends birthday, the girl who answered the phone was very, very rude. I almost canceled the reservation, but the boyfriend really wanted to go. I have been to 2 other similar-concept restaurants which were MUCH better. I wouldn't go back knowing there is better out there.
