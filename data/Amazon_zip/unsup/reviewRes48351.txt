Loud up scale beer hall. Love this place but it is not for the weak at heart ...you know the ones that go to the same chain restaurant every Saturday because those are the wings they really like not those foo-foo ones. This place is full of the rarely seen proteins, the menu makes the oysters seem like a food staple ... there is bone marrow, pork rinds, blood sausage, beef heart and sweetbreads. If I haven't lost you, then there is also an amazing beer list. Yeah, I know what goes better with pork rinds than a great beer!  I have been there for dinner: lots of great hams and tons of beer. I went for Sunday brunch ... the food was even better than the dinner menu, I thought, and the Bloody Maries were so good ... they have little bits of veggies ...yummy it's like a drinkable soup! I would not recommend this place for a romantic date...it is not a romantic room ... it is communal seating...I have to be honest, I don't get this trend I hope it goes away ...I would rather have one of those situations where there is only a few inches between tables...Anyway maybe someone can make me understand the appeal. Regardless it is a great place to have a nice beer and snacks with many friends that don't mind speaking up! Bonus: The Host totally looks like Vincent Chase from Entourage
