I realize that Grand Lux is a "chain" restaurant, but in my opinion it is one of the best in Chicago. They have a large, excellent menu. I have been there many times and had wonderful service every time. The portions are big, but not so big you can't eat them. I've tried everything from breakfast, to pizza, to pasta, etc. Everything has been delicious! :)
