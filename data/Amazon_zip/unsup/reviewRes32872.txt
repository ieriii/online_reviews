I have had 2 private parties at Sunda and they were OUTSTANDING. The people that were in attendance were high level executives who attend more than 2 "fancy" dinners/events a week and they were raving about it. This was a feat in an of itself since they are notoriously difficult to please.  The party room had it's own private bar and bartender as well as multiple servers working to ensure that food was coming out in a timely and well balanced manner. The food itself is terrific from the Sushi to the noodle dishes and the multiple meat options. The events department was really helpful in helping select the appropriate dinner menu that was varied and satisfying to many different palates. They also were in constant communication and answered all of my questions within a timely manner (really great response time). I plan over 100 dinners a year and this was by far at the top of my experiences.
