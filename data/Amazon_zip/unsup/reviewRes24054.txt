I love Irazu so freaking much. Seriously. The fresh banana milkshake reminds me of the ones my best friend and I used to make when her mom would leave us home alone. The prices are good and the skirt steak entrees are awesome. Good guac. The only complaints: crowded and cash only. Still gets 5 stars from me though!
