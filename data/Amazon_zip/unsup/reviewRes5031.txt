Had a great time here when visiting Chicago. Extensive wine list and great service. They don't take reservations but I was able to walk in w/ my brother around 10pm on a Friday night and get seated right away. Don't get me wrong, it was still packed but seats were opening up. Had the bone marrow(always delicious), broccoli (really garlicky but great), jamon de negra and a pecorino and St. Agur blue cheese (great blue), prosciutto balls (nice, but not a must have) and the pork bucco (fall off the bone wonderful). They suggested a great Greek white wine that I can't remember the name of but loved. Place was nice, not pretentious, I'd feel comfortable there in work clothes or just walking in w/ jeans and a sweater (which is what I did). Will definitely come back here next time I visit.
