My husband and I went on a recent Sunday night and after a couple of appetizers we cut the evening short and went somewhere else. The Rockit Bar people obviously had lots of money to spend and have borrowed heavily from other Asian venues. But they seem not to have truly comprehended the secrets of success. The room was striking and beautifully appointed but the menu gave us clues that it was going to be a half-baked, pan-Asian mess. For example, they listed five sakes by Gekkeikan and used the names Wagyu and Kobe interchangeably. Plus the wine list was filled with too many uninspired, big- producer labels. We ordered the Ultimate Hand Roll which turned out to be an inedible soggy mess of cold tempura and mushy crab. The "Kobe" beef on crispy rice was strangely flavored and ultimately overwhelmed by the wasabi mixture on top. The duck "bao" were tasty but didn't win any points for being really plain bao and duck sandwiches. I could go on but I hate long review so if you like decorationand aren't very sophisticated about Asian food or sake or wine then have at it. If you have high culinary expectations spend your money somewhere else.
