Saturday night failure - I only came here because my friend was in town and she mentioned she would be hanging here for her b-day. Love this girl to death so I couldn't decline. I heard this place was slightly weird. After my first experience breezing in at Do Division Fest a few week's ago, I figured it wouldn't be THAT BAD. Wrong. Average people, average music, weak drinks, not sure about the food but it looked pretty average too...cougars in the basement swinging their arms about and almost elbowing me in the mouth grooving with their 20 something boyfriends. GET. ME. OUT. OF. HERE. NOW. The friend I came with phantomed after 30 minutes. I think he was being hunted by the jungle cats and needed to make a prompt exit. After a chic walked in with a jumpsuit on and requested "Beyonce - DIVA" I was outtie 3000. The Saturday night saga continues...
