Stars for food and ambiance, although not sure why almost every table around us had children as small as 3 months to 9 years old (maybe some special on a Saturday night?)... Negative stars for the poor service the waitress gave. Aside from being slow and obvious that our 2-person table (although we were first seated) meant nothing compared to the 10-person table next to us, she never offered us a second drink or dessert and my dish came out very wrong. She seemed confused as to what to do (take it back? or just bring out the veggies you requested? take back? what should I do?)  As this was a special occasion dinner and so noted in my reservation, I guess I expected a little more... ...the food was good but nothing heavenly. We won't be back.
