Ok, I am little surprised this placed so many great reviews. I will keep it short and to the point. We went their to try the buffet. The menu wasnt bad. I really liked the rice and vegetable curry. the dessert was really good. the mishty was warm and not overly sweet. my gf loved the mango ice-cream.So overall not bad. Here is the bad part- The Service. We had probably one of the worst waiter I have ever had. We waited for 10-15 minutes before he came to take our drink order. He barely came to check on us. Had to ask him to refill our water twice. And every chance he had, he went behind the bar to take sip off his drink. Just horrible.
