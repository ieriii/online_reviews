I went here last week with a few friends and we had a great time. When we first went inside I was worried as it seemed the place was a bit nicer than my chucks and jeans outfit could offer, but others were dressed casual as well and a good time seemed to be had by all that were there. As far as food and drinks...they were spot on. I deferred to my friend to ordering the wine and tapas as she's an expert on both. We all split the bacon wrap dates (my friend likes them so much she was seconds away from licking the plate when the waiter came back), the Serrano Ham and Fig salad (which was so good I almost licked the plate), the garlic shrimp, the albondigas de catalana (Spanish meatballs) and the mixto, which is a cheese plate with three of the chef's choice. I can't remember what three we had (thanks to the two bottles of wine we had) but you really can't go wrong with cheese. The pairings sounded weird at first but trust them on it...they were delicious. We washed it all down with these tasty little chocolate croquettes for dessert. We determined that following dessert we could all die happy. Well done Mercat. All in all, I had a fantastic time and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun (and expensive) night out.
