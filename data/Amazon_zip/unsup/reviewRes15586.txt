Let me start with..... I would give Carnivale a 5 but the service was slow. We waited over 1/2 hour for waiter to come to table, then 15 minutes for our drinks. ( TRUE STORY!) AND We came for my BF birthday, with reservations, and they forgot it was his birthday, and I wasn't happy about that. However, that being said, the service after that was exemplary!!!! The waiter knew every item in detail on the menu, including the wines. I was thoroughly impressed. We ordered the cheese tray & Spanish olives. Very delicious. We ordered Salad, Halitbut & a vegetarian dish. The fish was so buttery it melted in your mouth. Literally. :) Everything was excellent. Loved the ambiance. We stopped for drinks after dinner in the bar area, and the live jazz music was nice. Other than service in beginning everything was perfect!!! I will definitely go back... it is a little $$$ but well worth it, and I would HIGHLY recommend!!! This is one of my faves....
