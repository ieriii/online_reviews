This rating has nothing to do with the food as I never got to try it. I (skeptically based on other reviews) made a reservation for 9:00 pm on Saturday night. We arrived at 9:05 pm and on the way in I heard a woman on her way out saying they were running a half hour behind on reservations. I went up to the front and gave my name and the hostess said it would be a couple of minutes. Had I not just heard this other woman, I would have taken that to mean, we will seat you in a couple of minutes. Since I had heard this other woman I asked what she meant by a couple of minutes. She proceeded to tell me, well, we still have to seat some 8:30 tables. So I said it'll be more than a couple of minutes then? We proceeded to stand in the ridiculously crowded "bar area" for about 5-10 minutes. We kept getting pushed by people walking by as there really is no where to stand and then decided to leave. I think it would have been well over half an hour before we would have been seated. I mean how long has this place been in business and they can't figure out how to keep reservations? We went to Socca a couple of doors down, got seated right away, had awesome service and the food was amazing. I will NOT be going back to Mia Francesca. I don't care how good the reviews say the food is. I should not have to wait more than 5-10 minutes if I have a reservation.
