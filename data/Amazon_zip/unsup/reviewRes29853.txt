ate there about a month ago. tried & loved the "peanut sauce lover". sauteed cashew nuts, white & green onion w/peanut sauce & choice of chicken, pork, beef or shrimp. took a while to get food ( about 25 min) waiter not rude but less then friendly, although he cracked us up when he mispronounced "PEANUT sauce". prob. will be back.
