I stopped by here yesterday afternoon and was so happy I did. My girlfriend and I are usually looking for places with a lot of flavor on a Sunday afternoon in an attempt to get rid of our hangovers. 90 miles hit the spot. We had the papa rellena a stuffed potato ball which is deep fried, the yuca frita, and for sandwiches tried the Ropa Vieja and the Guajarito. Both of the sandwiches were delicious, especially smothered in the salsa you can bring over to your table. The yuca frita was fantastically crispy and topped with plenty of minced garlic. The papa rellena wasn't bad but was lacking compared to the rest of the food flavors. We almost decided to go back again today for lunch but we weren't sure if we would make it back to work in time. I took one star off because the service was lacking, not bad necessarily but the workers just seemed very disinterested in the customers, and I think 5 stars should be reserved for all around excellent dining experiences, but I cannot deny my craving for 90 miles right now!!!
