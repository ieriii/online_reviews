I thought this place was LA BOMBA! Cozy, comfortable interior, we sat at the bar table right by the window. The service was attentive despite some other comments on here saying it isn't. Pizza was delicious and a good value. A small is plenty for two, and even with three toppings it was only $15. The ingredients are super fresh and they don't go too heavy on the dough or oil. Sodas are in those huge glasses and they'll refill them for free. And yes, the best part is that crispy charred cheese crust. Don't be afraid, black is good.
