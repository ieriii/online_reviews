I can't believe I neglected to review one of my favorite little joints! This place is AWESOME-O! The last "O" stands for "Oh, so!" Cuisine: One of the best food stands around town with a big menu and decent portions n' prices. Now, I've never had home made Cuban, but if I did I expect it wouldn't be too different from 90M. Service: Happy/Attentive/Accurate. Diggs: TARDIS anyone? This place is super cool for being bigger on the inside than on the out. The Cubano newspaper clippins that plaster the walls can provide some good conversation or distract you till foods up.
