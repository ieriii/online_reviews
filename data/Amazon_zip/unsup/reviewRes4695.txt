Love the food! Amazing dishes. I have been there 3 times in the past year and every single time the food has been outstanding. The ONLY bad is that waiting for a table takes for ever. I went on a Friday afternoon - 1 30 pm - with a gf to have a late lunch and we had to wait for 50 minutes for a table. Once seated, we had to wait for 15 minutes for the waitress to come to our table. Waitress was sweet and VERY helpful BUT Gosh in order to place our order we waited for a total of 65 minutes. Food was amazing. Nonetheless, the restaurant may want to hire more servers OR start accepting reservations. 50 minutes for a table its too much ... this is not an isolated Friday issue, I have gone on a Wed and on a Sunday ... each time I had to wait over 45 min.
