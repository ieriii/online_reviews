Worth leaving the neighborhood for. Destination dining, to be sure. I can't say anything about breakfast that hasn't already been said, other than that I feel the prices are fair because the portions are h-u-g-e! I've had both the whole wheat pancakes, the eggs benedict, and the omelettes. Get the home fries. Good stuff, Maynard. Groovy Wife and I have gone for dinner a couple of times, and have found the experience to be well worth the trip. Again with the huge portions, again with the creative menu. I had the savory pot-roast special the last time I was there. The little carrots were glazed to perfection, the meat just falling apart at the touch of a knife how it should be. I enjoyed the window seat as well...looking out at the goings-on of Greektown. The food comes quickly, but you rarely feel rushed here. In sum...highly recommended.
