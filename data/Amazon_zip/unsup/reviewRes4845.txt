Food: Fried pig ears with crispy kale was very delicious. Don't be afraid to try this dish especially if you already have tried head cheese. it was a little hard to eat with forks--call me asian but would have prefered using chopsticks with this dish. The combination of crisphy kale, salty fried pig ears and sour pepperoncis worked very well together. Pork liver and toasted bread: Fresh pate is always good. This would have been better if the bread wasn't so greasy with butter to begin with. I would have preferred plain toast in order to really taste the pate. Calamari: Delicious-especially for those who like anything tart, lemony or sour. I was expecting it to be fried like most places, but it was nothing like I expected to be. Mussels: This was my favorite of the tapas ordered. Coconut milk and I think curry was used in this dish. Those two flavors are great especially with mussels. it was served with chopped onions, celery and the best part, bits of bacon! yum! It added a great salty flavor to the dish. I found myself digging for all the goodies in the bowl of juice so don't waste it! Use your bread and dip away. Service: Very attentive staff. Very helpful when asked about any menu item.
