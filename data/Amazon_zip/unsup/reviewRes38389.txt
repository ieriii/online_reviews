Great Beer list...it fills an entire menu. The mussels in the white ale sauce are a must!!! YUM, YUM! The fries are kisckass and the fish is good, too. The dinner area is a little small and the tables are a bit close together. The front bar is great. AND, if you are planning a party....the upstairs party area is huge and perfect for about 40-50.
