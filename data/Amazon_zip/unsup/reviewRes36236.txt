The juice bar is something else!! If you have the fresh squeezed oj you are having a life changing experience- so be warned. You will not want regular store bought OJ after that! I had the half order of french toast and it was definitely enough food, I wouldn't not have been able to eat the whole order. It was amazing. Baked in custard I believe with the warm maple syrup which I think they make. Very awesome!! They don't have WIFI which sucks but the awesome food made up for it! GO GO GO!
