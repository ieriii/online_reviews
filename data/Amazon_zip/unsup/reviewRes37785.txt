I wish I could give more stars because I really like the food here. I will say their sandwiches can get really meaty and dry though. But everything else is spectacular.  My time is with the staff. We go there now with the intention that their staff is going to treat us like redheaded step children just for the noki! Their hostesses are extremely rude, "as if you should know." I feel like a newborn that forgot how to breath every time they seat you. There was one time we ate their before a gallery show, our waitress didn't tell us the specials, made herself scarce, not a kind bone in her body.  The next couple that sat down she went through the specials etc, we felt alienated. Andy by the way we were not difficult. We knew what we wanted to drink, we were polite and cordial. Hopleaf plays the cool kid card for sure. If you have never been expect the frigidness but come back for the food. Anything that doesn't involve sandwiches and fies is usually spectacular.
