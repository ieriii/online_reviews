Anyone notice that the cheese they use in the food has changed? It has no flavor and it's mushy. I don't know how to explain it. It started like a month ago. I go to Garcia's at least twice a week and I let some time go by thinking they ran out of the usual cheese. But its been 6 solid visits and I lost my love for this place. I have never left any food on my plate but in the last 3 visits I have only eaten half my meal. I am really disappointed in the change. I don't even enjoy the food anymore because this new cheese is like biting into someone's flabby arm. :(
