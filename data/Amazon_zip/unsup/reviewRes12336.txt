I've been here for Brunch and Dinner, but since my brunch experience was awhile ago, I'll only review the dinner. The dining room is nice. You might complain about the "scenic" view of Irving Park Rd and its proximity to the el, but since it's not downtown, what do you expect to look at? I liked the exposed ductwork in the dining room and the art on the wall. But did you ever notice the price of some of these works of "art?" Let's just say, I'm not sure I'd pay the $900 asking price for some of them. Dinner was good. I got the Cuban chicken and my GF got the Ropa Vieja. I thought the portion for my dish to be on the small side, but not horrible. I wasn't hungry when I left but I wasn't full either. I guess that's good for my waistline.  The butter they serve with the bread is really good. It's like butter mixed with red pepper and maybe garlic. Yummm. I saw some people order the steak and it definitely looked good. I'll try that next time I come back.
