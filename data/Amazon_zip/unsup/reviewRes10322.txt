2.5 stars It's not that it wasn't good-- it was. But that's the problem, it was just that-- good. For the price and talk around town, it should have been a dinner to remember. Okay, I take part of that back. The reason I made a reservation here was because of the Best of Chicago show that boasted its gorgeous outdoor seating area. It really was beautiful. The lighting, the trees, the candlelit tables, the festive atmosphere-- all of that was lovely.  As for the food and service: - Bread basket was an excellent variety of focaccia, breadsticks and sliced white bread. This along with the high quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar started the meal off well. - The prosciutto meloni was excellent, but you really can't mess this up, as long as you have a good fresh product, which, of course, it was. - I was looking forward to the stracci de faro, which I saw others write about here. But it tasted strange-- I think the leeks overpowered the whole dish, and the shape of the pasta, which were free form triangles, made the texture of the sauce feel slimy. - The veal, which our server recommended, had the same not-so-fantastic quality. Tasty for sure, but nothing to write home about. - The service was adequate, but lacked personality. It was father's day, and I understand the evening was hectic, but I felt a bit rushed and even forgotten at moments. I understand what a crazy night looks like, and this was one of them-- but as a server you have to be very careful not to pass your stress on to the guests-- it's something this crew can work on. I may come back for a drink on the patio, but that's about it unless I hear the food gets better!
