After living basically across the street from Caro Mio for 2 years, I had finally stepped in their door rather than it's neighbor Sabor A Cuba. I had heard from several trustworthy [Yelper and non-Yelper] sources that this place is a hit--and I must agree. For my Spanish-speaking mind, 'Caro Mio' makes me think "Expensive, Oh My!" Entrees are ~18+ each, however, once you bite in to your "pasta fatta in casa' (pasta made in-house), you'll see why. This family-owned establishment makes everything to order. While I'll admit that gnocchi is almost always the dish I get when out for an Italian meal, I'd be crazy not to venture in trying other dishes here. My favorite dishes are: Lasagna Caro Mio (I claim their specialty because it's baked in an individual casserole dish smothered with fresh cheese and a tomato meat sauce), Pappardelle Gratinato (my favorite noodle shape [pappardelle] mixed in with sun-dried tomatoes, chicken and spinach with the perfected marscapone cheese sauce) and Spinach Gnocchi Gorgonzola (sorry I had to throw this one in here, even though it's a gnocchi, because it's perfection without the gorgonzola being too overpowering and is just as delicious as the Italian food I've had in Italia-influenced Argentina.) To help you plan your visit, so you don't wait as long as I did: -I recommend making a reservation ahead of time, but they're only accepted if you party is of 6+ guests. Otherwise get here early since the wait often travels out the door.  -Thank goodness it's BYOB without a corkage fee because it gets you through the wait. The corkage fee is possibly already included in the food prices, hence them being a bit steep. -Be sure to start off with the Bruschetta con Basilico----Delish! -If you use the website, becareful you don't click on the wrong link or you'll become Eliodoro's date in Italia. -The Latino staff is extremely accommodating, diligent and very attractive.
