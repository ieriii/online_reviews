The best crab rangoon IN ALL THE LAND. Seriously, I crave the crab rangoon. It's SOOOO good. Go out of your way to eat this crab rangoon. Do it. NOW. I've been here a few times and can say the Rama is delicious and the Panang is delicious. Perfectly spicy. I got a sushi roll once with bbq sauce that was sooo good but half way through I couldn't eat any more because it was too sweet. Share that one, I guess. It's really nice inside and also BYOB, which rules. Plus, you can't go wrong with the menu. It's never ending and I love that I can get Thai and my boyfriend can get Japanese. Awesome.
