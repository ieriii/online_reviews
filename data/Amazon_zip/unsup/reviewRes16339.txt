9:30 - reservation 9:45 - we were told that the 9:00 reservations have not been sat as if that was a reasonable excuse and we would just have to deal. 10:00 - Told "5 more minutes" 10:15 - we were finally sat. Got little more than a "thank you for your patience". Food and drinks were ok, but not great. I was really disappointed - I had friends in from out of town and this was not the way I wanted them to be treated!
