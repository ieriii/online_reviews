To put it simply, the food was great. But the service and the drinks sucked. Period. I felt I should expand on my review to explain the comment upstairs. So we waited for a good 20 minutes between check-ins from our server. The drinks were off. All of our drinks tasted wierd. Too bitter, too strong, not enough liquor, etc. It wasn't even a busy night. Parking was also an issue because I didn't find a lot.I don't know if there was supposed to BE one but I sure didn't find one. So I ended up driving around til I found a parking spot on the street. The food was great though. Compliments to the chef. But the other issues, especially the wait service overshadowed the quality of the food.
