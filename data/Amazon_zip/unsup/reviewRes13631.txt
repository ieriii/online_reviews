Super awesome brunch! We came here bright and early one Sunday morning, and sobered up with a nice blood orange mimosa and a crazy looking bloody mary. They probably have the best breakfast sausage I've ever had in my life. It was seasoned PERFECTLY! And, they have a delicious breakfast that's surrounded by cheese soup. I don't know how the AM can get any better than this place. Its a small brunch menu, but who cares when everything's good??? PS- Their beer is super too!
