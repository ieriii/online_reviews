I have been ordering these guys to deliver to my work for years! I moved away 3 years ago, but return to the area once a month for local clients and still have them deliver. I used to super-love Sultans and would order them twice a week before. Its super-affordable for as much food as they give you, and really tasty. I love their lentil soup. Yesterday, though, I was kind of bummed. My lamb shawerma was dry, and the lid hadn't been secured before transit, so my food was outside of the container all over the bag. I am pretty sure they deliver by bike, so I can forgive a little lost juice or a few grains of rice. I just can't get past the dry lamb. *single tear rolls down cheek. The lentil soup, however, was absolutely perfect as usual, along with the spinach pie. I think the lamb could have been a fluke, and I love these guys anyway, so 4 stars. They are always so kind and friendly on the phone, and willing to laugh. And, they deliver FAST!!
