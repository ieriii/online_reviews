I'll give them three stars for having some of the best, freshest broccoli I've ever tasted....other than that, the steak was mediocre at best, my fries were dry and out waiter was not that great. It took him 15 minutes to bring drinks, we asked for more bread and he forgot, so we had to chase him down to get it. It was like he was disappearing on us for like, 10 and 15 minutes at a time and just not coming back at at all (we had to send another waiter to find him)....we still tipped him, just not the entire 15%.... They had this kid's special, a little 4 ounce fillet with mashed potatoes...the steak was so dry I could barely cut the thing for my daughter. I ended up giving her some of my Rib eye, which was more fat than meat. The lobster bisque was awesome, I really could have just eaten that and some bread and been done.... All in all, the decor was nice, but it was a bit loud in the restaurant. I've had better service at Olive Garden.....I'd rather go to Wildfire.....
