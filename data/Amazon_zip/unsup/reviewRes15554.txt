Only had drinks here, but had a fantastic time! For some reason I felt like I was walking into Circus Circus in Vegas upon entering, but I wasn't completely put together upon arrival.  Why not 4 stars? They had a sign on the way in for margarita classes they host, so I assumed they would be amazing. Mine was so salty it was a joke. i made everyone taste it, and they laughed. We dubbed it the salt lick. I was chasing it with tequila shots just to get it down!  Other than that, everyone was super nice. Really cool band, making me wish I could give 3.5.
