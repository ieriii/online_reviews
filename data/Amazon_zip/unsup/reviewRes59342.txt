This is a great place to get lunch, since my work is only a couple of blocks away. My apartment is unfortunately just outside of their delivery area, or I might eat at Indie all the time. I really enjoy the Chicken Teriyaki or Salmon Teriyaki bento box, as it is very filling (comes with salad, miso soup, and california rolls). In addition, I'm a big fan of the panang curry. Granted, it is probably not the most authentic, but it is amongst the most delicious I have had. Specifically, I really like the choice of veggies. Cabbage, carrots, peas, and broccoli, rather than just peppers like many other places. The panang curry is rather more soupy than others I've had before, but it is nonetheless delicious and flavorful.Although I usually have it delivered, I've also dined in on occasion. The decor is rather cute and trendy, with comfortable cushioned seats. Not necessarily my taste, but by no means unattractive.
