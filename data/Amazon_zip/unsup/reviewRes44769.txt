Second time I've had Chicago Deep Dish Pizza - it was OK tasting--didn't taste unique... We ordered a Standard Deep Dish with Sausage, mushrooms, olives. The pizza had no flavor or differentiation from regular pizza, except for the fact it has a lot more cheese - so I don't see anything special with it. Service was below satisfactory - the wait staff didn't seem to care about keeping the customer's happy. She was snappy, short, and down right rude at times, to other customers. I may visit this place in the future - perhaps it was just a bad day for getting pizza when I was there.
