Even though their food is so very good, I've pretty muched stopped going to Glenn's entirely. You can't get a seat without a reservation, period. Which is absurd for a small neighborhood place that bills itself as a Diner. Glenn's got too big for its britches which is sad--they certainly earned it but I probably won't go back unless/until they expand.
