I love Cuban food but had yet to try 90 miles. It isn't too far from my office so I stopped in last week for a late, dine-in lunch. I had the bistec sandwich, my husband had the media noche and we split the croquettes and a pastillita (guava & cheese). Total was $22. The croquettes were good. They only had one version, which seemed to be ham. I had no complaints about the media noche, and the only thing that could have improved the Bistec would be more chimichurri but that is like liquid, green, crack to me. The pastillita was good, but I would have preferred a little more filling. Don't take me being nit-picky wrong....this place is great. The staff was really awesome: patient, courteous and even offered up some recommendations. I will most definitely be back (and will try the Lechon likely- pork and sweet plantains on a sandwich.....yes!)
