Any good food place must not only rely on the quality of its food, it must also provide quality service. It should also not make its patrons feel as if they are being nickle and dimed. This is not the case at Fox & Obel. My partner and I stopped in for a snack after a night out and were happy to see the that chips and hummus could be order as a small dish. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hummus, but a quick visual calculation indicated that we would need to go back for more chips as they gave a fair portion of the hummus, but only supplied 4 small chips to eat it with . We figured this was no problem, surely they would give us more chips when we ran out. After all, it is the hummus that is important. Nevertheless we loaded our chips as much as we could to see if we could get by, but alas, we could only get about half of the hummus. So we went back to the counter to ask for some more chips and received the bad news that it would be an extra charge for more chips....yikes. Worse than that, the extra charge would only get us 4 more chips, hardly enough to finish our meal. This is pretty lame for a "high end" grocery store / eatery. Staff was not simpathetic, and hardly seemed to care or acknowledge our disconent. We will not return.
