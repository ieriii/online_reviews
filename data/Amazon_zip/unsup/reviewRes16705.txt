I recently dined at Carnivale and I am glad I gave this place another chance. I had dined here when the restaurant first opened, and was not impressed at all. On a whim, I decided to give the place a try again, and I am glad I did!  I was thouroughly impressed.  The service was friendly and fast and the food was great. The decor is fun and lively. And, they definitely have some of the best empanadas in the city. I love latin food, and I think Chicago is lacking in this food category. So, I am glad to have Carnivale in Chicago!
