Not much I can add to the ~300 reviews already. One of the finest dining experiences I've ever had. The aromatic additions to several of the dishes were different, surprising, and honestly amazing (fresh heated rosemary, burnt oak leaves, vaporized nutmeg, etc). Lives up to the hype, go if you love food.
