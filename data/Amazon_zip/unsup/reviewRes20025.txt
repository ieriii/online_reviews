I was in Chicago on business and found this restaurant on Yelp. The reviews led me to it and I can say that even the best of reviews did not do this olace justice. Never have I been to a restaurant where everything we tried was just as good if not better than the previous dish. My coworkers raved about how phenomenal their rabbit salad and venison dishes were. My mussels were amazing with a delightful yet not overpowering curry broth. Dessert was an absolute treat, the Greek yogurt custard melted in your mouth and the honey on the baklava was fantastic. And not only was the food amazing, but the service was absolutely grand. Our waiter was knowledgable and polite. The house manager was equally great. I would recommend this place to anyone in Chicago and looking for a great overall dining experience.
