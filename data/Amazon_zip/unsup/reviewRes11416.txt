I've visited twice: once at 1pm on a Tuesday and once at about 8pm on a Friday. Coming in at 1pm, there were about a dozen people, most drinking beer, a few eating pizza. I had two beers that were both solid, a smoked porter being my favorite.  Returned for dinner and the place was packed. We were told we'd have a 90-minute wait, so we should try to find a place at the bar. We ordered some beers and we were able to grab seats at the bar within about 10 minutes. Again, the beer was great. This time, I had some pizza and the white pizza was phenomenal. Perfectly cooked and super thin. However, I can imagine this evening going much worse if we didn't find seats so quickly. Can't say it's reliable enough to return if I'm planning to eat.
