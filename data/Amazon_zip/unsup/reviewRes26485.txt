I stumbled in Simply It one day, home sick from work and just wanting some Pho to make me feel better. I walked in and realized that I only had 7 bucks on me - when I asked what my total would be with tax it came out to $7.13 and I when I started to leave to run and find a quarter somewhere the owner came and told me to sit down, not to worry about it and that he would take care of everything. He said he could tell I was sick and proceeded to bring me a newspaper and some ginger tea and told me to sip the ginger tea slowly. When my Pho was ready he told me not to rush, finish my tea and then gave me 2 more giant Styrofoam containers of ginger to take home and sip all afternoon.  Now I'm not an expert on traditional Vietnamese foods, but the soup was delicious, fresh and flavorful. I really place a high value on great service, and Simply It was outstanding. Upon my exit to go home and eat my pho, I vowed to return...and plan on it!
