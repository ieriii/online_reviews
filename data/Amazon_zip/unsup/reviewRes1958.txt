I've been here twice and I love the food. I don't remember what I got the first time...I just remember being overwhelmed with great food. The second time I went, I went in a small group again. We all shared the Ribeye Steak Sausage w/ Crispy Fried Onions & Blue Cheese , the Bacon & Jalapeno Duck Sausage w/ Brie Cheese, and the Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage. We all enjoyed the food and even though we had to wait in line for an 1.5 hours, it was worth it. If you go on Fridays and Saturdays, BE PREPARED to wait in longer lines. However, their duck fat fries are awesome, so it's up to you if you have the patience to stand in line.
