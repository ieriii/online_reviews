Oh man what a find. We tried this place on a whim one winter afternoon and I've always been so grateful this place came into my life. If you like crepes, this is your place. Sweet or savory, this place has got you covered. Some of my favorites? Crepa de Roma, Icosium Crepe, Crepe with eggs and beef sausage, Crepe Salem, and of course my favorite of the bunch, Crepe de Limone. Did I mention you can top your sweet crepe with ice cream? Even pistachio ice cream or rainbow sherbet?? You can also order the largest bottle of Orangina I've ever seen in my life at this place. What's not to like? Icosium Kafe, I love you!!
