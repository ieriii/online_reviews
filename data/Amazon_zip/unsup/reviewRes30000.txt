This is the BEST vegan (and non-vegan) restaurant I have been to yet!!! We visited Chicago within the past year and were determined to try out a bunch of vegan restaurants, because Chicago has MANY. This one kept popping up. Actually, we had received the latest issue of VegNews (literally just before leaving for Chicago) whose cover was designated to vegan restaurants in Chicago (what timing) and Chicago Diner was in the list! I think it's only downside is that it's so popular among vegans and non-vegans that it can get really busy and there will be a wait. It is also a little tight inside but still plenty of elbow room to enjoy and eat. The servers were great but the food was AMAZING! It was all very "American Food" and was soooo good. We topped it all off with their peanut butter and cookie dough shake. Loved it! We even had a non-vegan friend with us that really loved it! And the best thing about their menu is that it is LONG, full of TONS of options. I would definitely go back to Chicago just for that! It's worth every penny.
