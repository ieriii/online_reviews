This is a cozy little spot in Greektown, worth hollering at if you want some good brunch / breakfast stuff. The parking sitch sucks but that is to be expected in this hood. Quick review: Food: Lots of different options, good stuff, creative, try the salmon benedict. Service: Mostly timid, trepidatious women who should speak with more confidence. Ambiance: Small, but not in a bad way, terrible art on the walls. They have wheat grass shots, which are cool if you want to be sober and vomit.
