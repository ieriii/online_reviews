Hot Dougs is legendary because of the high quality encased meats, the service, and the wait to get it. Hot Dougs offers daily specials of rare meats such as kangaroo, yak, rattlesnake, or rabbit, most of which I have eaten before with great interest and satisfaction. The safe menu (chicago dog, corn dog, brat) is really inexpensive and delicious. I can say without hesitation that Hot Doug's offers the best corn dog anywhere for $1.50. Doug himself mans the register each and every day, and is always willing to take part in silly banter while you order. He truly loves his business and it shows. I'm pretty sure if you get a readily visible Hot Dougs tattoo you and your guest will receive free meals as long as you don't abuse it. Not enough for me to get one but I hope it is for someone reading this.
