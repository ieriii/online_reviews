Irazu is great. I have been wanting to try it for a while and was finally able to a few weeks ago. The delivery was fast. I love the casado, it tasted great, was a large portion (it was 2 meals for me), and was reminiscent of the casado I had in Costa Rica. I would definitely order from here again.
