Yes, Hopleaf is legendary for it's beer selection (and it is a fantastic beer selection!), but what I really rave about is their mussels. These are the best mussels I've had since I moved her from Scotland (and the Scots know their mussels, ya ken?) I will concede that the white ale sauce is extremely salty, but the fact that I haven't had any mussels that even came close to this on this side of the pond, make this place stand out. Good luck getting a seat in the bar at just about any time. But if you can stake out a spot, grab yourself any of their beers and dive into a cauldron of mussels.
