Wakamono used to be a small establishment. Back then it a little more quiet, cozy, and the food arrived quickly. Now it has expanded (a testament to the quality), but it doesn't appear they've hired any more sushi chefs. This had lead to what I consider a very, very long wait for my meal. The quality is excellent. I've been to this establishment more than a handful of times, and each one has been a delight to my tastebuds. But that is where the joy ends. The restaurant is far too large for the number of chefs they have. And the noise is just excessive. The entire place is built with very eye pleasing wood, but with the very loud music and large number of people, it makes conversing very difficult. Truthfully, during the nicer months, I would never eat there if I couldn't be certain of seating outside. Not being able to converse with my dinner mates is a serious issue.Suggestions for the owners (I'm sure they read this): Invest in some noise absorbing materials and turn down the music. We're not at a club or a bar. We're at a restaurant, trying to enjoy our meal and talk with friends. And get a few more chefs. You could turn more tables and make more money. Waiting an hour for food is just not cool and may drive people to find quicker delivering establishments (they exist).I wish there were more options for ranking instead of a single star rating. The food would get a 5, decor a 4, experience a 2.
