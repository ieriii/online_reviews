Alliance Bakery was the starting point of our recent "Bakery Crawl" which I have to say was a novel experience. Other reviewers have covered the ins and outs of Alliance baked goodies, but I wanted to mention that Alliance serves Intelligentsia coffee and even have their own special "Alliance Bakery Blend" which you can purchase whole bean (or ground) by the pound. I enjoy Alliance's special coffee blend but please note that I am a smooth coffee drinker (which does not mean "weak") and I think that certain major chain brand coffee beans taste burned to my palate rather than robust; I feel there is a noticeable difference between the two. I can always tell someone in the Wicker Park area that has been to Alliance recently because they have just a hint of cupcake frosting on their face! It's so hilarous!
