I LOVE when my high expectations are met. Such was the case last night at Piece - I've heard such great things about their pizza and beer (two things that are high on my "love" list), so I had to check this place out for myself. I arrived last night just before 7 p.m., and put my name in for a 45 minute wait. So, we sidled up to the bar (sort of, considering the place was packed to the gills) and ordered a glass of their homemade brews. I opted for the deliciously sweet belgian-style Surrender and my friends tried the Golden Arm (a Kolsch beer) - both proved great sippers and even better matches to Piece's pizza. Speaking of pizza - wow! Fresh ingredients on top of delectably melted mozzarella cheese (we opted for the "red-style"), perfectly cooked thin-crust, served by the HUGE slice. Our toppings included sausage, onion and mushrooms- mmmm. So good. I also ordered a Dark-n-Curvy , and though I liked the Surrender slightly more, this dark wheat ale was certainly not too shabby. I think it's probably wise to come here on nights that aren't Friday or Saturday - if you're not willing to deal with the waiting/crowds, you may not love this experience. It's SO worth it though.
