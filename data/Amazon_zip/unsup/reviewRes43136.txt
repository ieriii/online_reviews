The place is stunning with a great vibe. The food is fantastic and the service is superb. My favorites are the pork meatballs, the bone marrow and toast; the escarole and the steak. I love the concept behind this restaurant to make good food at reasonable prices and not get all caught up in the presentation. These are great dishes to share. This is a place I will come back to on a regular basis and bring friends from out of town. This is a Chicago staple and here to stay for the long hall.
