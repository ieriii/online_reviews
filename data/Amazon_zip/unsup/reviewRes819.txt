After living in Chicago for almost 7 years, I finally made it to Hot Doug's for the first time. I went with three other people on a Saturday morning. We arrived a little after 10 and there was already a line of about 20 people. The place opens at 10:30, so we had a little bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad. Once it opened, the line moved fairly quickly. We lucked out because we got the last table available for 4 people. I chose to stick to the basics and ordered two Chicago dogs plus a side of the duck fat fries to share. These Chicago dogs were the best I've had, no doubt about it. The people I was with ordered a variety of things, including the rattlesnake dog, which they all raved about. The duck fat fries were good, but not great. I've definitely had better fries elsewhere. I would certainly come back here for more hot dogs, however. I'll have to remember to come here during the week sometime when I have a day off.
