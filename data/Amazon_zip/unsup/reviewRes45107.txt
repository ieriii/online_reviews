The octopus appetizer was phenomenal. I say that because I haven't eaten octopus in a cozy manner. It was warm and with potatoes, onions, peppers, down right cozy. Not cold and sharp, but warm and fuzzy, but also fresh tasting. Highly recommended, The half portions were enough, because they were so rich and satisfying. I had the lamb sausage, my husband had the delectable veal ragu. The cocktails were inventive and smart, and the wine list goes on and on. I appreciate the 250ml glass for $10-a good deal. The waiter was informative and there when we needed him. Just overall a really nice date experience. The fact that the restaurant was packed on a Monday night, explains a lot.
