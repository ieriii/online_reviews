A wonderful experience on our Anniversary . Went for a 9 course Vegetarian meal with wine pairing. Felt like we were indulging in a artful dining experience. Everything was just perfect from portions, to the presentation . The Kohlrabi cold soup was excellent. Only wished they did not charge extra for the dessert instead of the cheese sampler we opted for, Overall a great experience.
