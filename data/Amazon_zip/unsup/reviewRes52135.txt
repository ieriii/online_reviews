I am originally from the New York/New Jersey area and while I was in Chicago, I had the chance to try both Gino's East and Giordano's. Out of the two restaurants, I prefer Gino's East over Giordano's. I am always going to prefer New York style pizza over Chicago style, but if I am in town, I am going to Gino's East.  The difference between Gino's East and Giordano's lies in the pizza dough. Gino's East pizza dough is a corn meal based one while Giordano's is a flour based one. The flour one is inferior in my opinion because it is much dryer. It tastes as if the pizza was cooked on a slice of homemade, but extremely dry bread.    While at Gino's East, we orderd the Gino's East Supreme and the Meat Legend. Each was good as they both contained their famous crumbled sausage. The pizzas had fresh ingredients and were very delicious. The only thing I am unaccustomed to with Chicago style pizza is the amount of sauce it contains. The biggest difference between Chicago style and New York style is that Chicago style is a full on meal. New York style you can grab a slice whenever you like, but Chicago style you must dedicate a good hour and half and sit down to fully enjoy. The restaurant is a decent sized place and even for lunch, we had a half an hour wait before we could sit down. Lucky for the location of this specific restaurant, it is located in downtown Chicago with department stores just around the corner to kill time until your table is ready. Gino's East is definitely an experience that you must have if you are in Chicago. I cannot wait till my next visit to Chicago so I can go there again.
