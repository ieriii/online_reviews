When I crave any Vietnamese food that i can't make on my own, I go here. The Pho (noodle soup) is awesome and the price makes it even better. Portions are large and the veggies and meat are fresh. The coconut-bean drinks are great and the pork dishes with rice are awesome. The menu is large and service is quick. Definitely worth a try!
