**Horrible Service**pizza ok**wait time horrific**If I wasn't so determined to have some dinner...I should have walked out. Ordered a standard sausage pizza, was told it would be 35-40 mins....we waited an hour & 45 mins four our pizza!!! We were being VERY patient and watched,three other groups delayed, and their evening ruined too.Deplorable!!!No apologies from staff either. And to top off the night...we waited 15 mins for the valet to get our car...AR finally tracked him down outside the garage talking on his cell phone!!DEPLORABLE ALL AROUND!!!
