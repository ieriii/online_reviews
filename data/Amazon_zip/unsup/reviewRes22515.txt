I love the fries and the atmosphere! The hot dogs are good but not my favorite - they are bigger than normal hot dogs which means more dog in each bite. I've also had the Superchickenmidgees which are chicken tenders and the Superburger which are both okay. The hours are so convenient and the atmosphere is great so I really enjoy going here.
