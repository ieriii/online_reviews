Got an invite to meet friends at The Bad Apple last night (a Tues night, around 7:30pm). I was fearing typical, greasy bar food. Wow - was I soooo pleasantly surprised. the place had a good crowd for a Tuesday and a ridiculously huge beer selection. There was a whole left side of the menu with apps, salads and sandwiches, which I'm sure are great. But, I was drawn to the full page of burgers. The options were so creative! I loved how so many burgers involved "house made" ingredients. I opted for the Edmund Fig-something-er-other burger. It came topped with smoked onions, a giant portion of goat cheese and a house made relish of figs & bacon that were cooked down in porter (beer?). It was DIVINE!!! Honest to goodness, the toppings were glorious (could have been eaten on their own) and the burger cooked perfectly. Had I known they would cook them so specific, I actually would have gone with MidRare. Medium had pink, as expected, but I would have preferred a bit juicer. Anyways, it rocked and I downed every bite! My friend tried the Elvis Burger - bacon and house made peanut butter (think nutty, not sugary). It was great! And, at just $8-$10/burger, a great deal! I will definitely be back!
