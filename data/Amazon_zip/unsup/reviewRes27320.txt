Hola! I returned to Frontera and expanded my horizons..... No enchiladas this time, I got the duck breast. Wow, was that awesome. Me likey! For appetizers we ordered the guacamole (as good as I have had), the ceviche trio (still awesome) and the jicama pineapple salad, which I think I could have eaten by myself. Not that it was small...it was just way yummy. When I am drooling over something that doesn't involve fat, salt, or some sort of refined/processed sugar, you know it's good. For desserts, we split the chocolate pecan pie and the tres leches cake...we enjoyed both. A special shout to the blue agave margaritas...those, along with the fabulous company I was in, made the 2 hour wait for a table actually quite enjoyable.
