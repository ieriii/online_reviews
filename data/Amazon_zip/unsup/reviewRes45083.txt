Among stiff competition, this is probably my favorite place in my neighborhood (and check out my A-ville list, I loooooooove my neighborhood restaurants). Why do I love Anteprima? They do simple, straightforward rustic Italian food. It's not cheap, but it's near top quality because of the delicious ingredients they use. I'm not familiar with Italian wines as much as I would like, and I always have been able to get a great recommendation from the manager, who makes the rounds but not in an intrusive manner. Very enjoyable guy to converse with - for instance, after ordering our apps, wine and meal once last summer, he stopped by to point out greens he grew in his garden and some of the other quality ingredients. And this probably puts it over the top from four stars to five in my book.  The only drawback to this place is that it does get very loud and busy - make sure to have a reservation, and ideally have 4 or less in your party - tried to squeeze in five here once and it didn't really work.  Anteprima is my go-to spot for a quick celebration or treat, and a great example of the best Chicago has to offer.
