If you're looking for Chicago style STUFFED pizza -- go to Giordano's! (Yes, there IS a difference between stuffed and deep dish pizza -- both of which are commonly referred to as Chicago-style. Wikipedia has a detailed explanation for those curious!) Love their buttery flaky crust - crisply baked, never soggy. Stuffed pizza packed with cheese... the kind that actually stretches with each savory bite. Loaded with toppings of your choice. I prefer their special - packed with green peppers, onions, mushrooms and italian sausage. Takes 35 minutes to await your stuffed pizza - but worth every salivating ticking second. There's almost always a tourist filled line at this location... but there's plenty others in the Chicagoland area to fulfill your stuffed pizza crave!
