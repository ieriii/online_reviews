This is somewhere between 'Eh' and 'No'. Granted they are more known for their pizza but I decided to get a sandwich and beer instead (I know, great combination!). The beer came out reasonably quickly and was ok. I got the Hopster which tasted fruity (not a great taste for most beers) but I finished it up in preparation for what I thought would be a delicious sandwich. What I got was two massive slices of bread, just a little bit of tuna salad, (like 1/4 inch) I think two tomatoes (may have only been one) and a shred of lettuce. Oh, and some chips. I was starving so I ate all of it, but I didn't like it. Way too much bread - I felt like I went to a bakery and got a loaf, but put the sandwich meat and toppings on the side. My friend literally took the inside of his turkey sandwich and put it on the other half so that there was substance (hard to do on a tuna melt though). The service was rather slow. It took a long time to get to ask for anything we needed and longer to bring it. I eventually just walked up to the waitress while she was at the register and asked her to bring me some condiments. While I didn't have the pizza, some came out to the table next to us and I was very unimpressed. It looked like frozen pizza that needed another 4 minutes in the oven (Pretty much survived on that in College, so if you want to get technical it needed 4m15s) Definitely not going back. They only got three starts because the food was ok and I did really like the atmosphere. I'm sure the other beers were ok.
