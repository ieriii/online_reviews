OATMEAL SHAKE!  [Yelp won't let me draw those cutesy little hearts out of a "less than" sign and a 3, so you just have to imagine them here. A lot of them.] Hooray for outdoor seating as the weather starts to warm up. Yesterday was muggy as all get-out, in true Costa Rican Rainforest style, making the experience all the more authentic. I was famished by the time we got here, so I was excited to have chips and salsa placed on the table shortly after our arrival. I snarfed them all down, record-speed, and *poof!* there was another basket of chips before we even had to ask. For my main course I went with the potato tacos (out of homage to their sheer odd-ness). They were decent (not sure what I was expecting... they are potato tacos. Tacos full of potatoes. Yeah, you can probably pretty well imagine them without buying the entree. Ah well.) The mole sauce did kick things up a bit and the fried plantains were delish. An ideal return trip for me would be a plate of fried plantains and an oatmeal shake. I wonder what kind of toppings you could put on plantains: cinnamon? chocolate? Mmmmm.... Irazu is BYOB (and conveniently close to Red and White Wines) but less wine = more room for oatmeal shakes. Priorities, people.
