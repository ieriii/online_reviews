No doubt about it, a highlight of our recent trip to Chicago. Two teens and two middle agers all very happy with the fabulous selection. That's not easy to do! Highly recommend the multigrain pancakes--the most delicious flavorful multigrain I've ever had, heaped high with berries and whipped cream! And if you happen to be in town for the Pitchfork Music Festival, you might just sit next to a hipster musician like Thurston Moore, like we did!
