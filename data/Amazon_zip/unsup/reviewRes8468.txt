I love love love this place. The food is amazing. Also, take out is lovely. You have to place your order in the store, but they gave me a glass of proseco as I waited and handed me my pizza 10 minutes into my placing my order. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is due to the price; a little on the high side. But, I still manage to go there at least every two months ... so it doesn't bother me all that much. So fast. So wonderful.
