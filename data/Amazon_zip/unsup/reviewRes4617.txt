Grabbed lunch here last Sunday and was very impressed with their small plates. We got the cucumber and feta spread which was refreshing and opened our appetite a bit. The special that day was pig tail, so we ordered that as well. Tender, fall off the bone meat the melted in our mouth. The raw corn was very different and recommended by our server, however, probably our least favorite dish of the day. Our favorite was the pig's ear. It's a delicious blend with kale and egg. A must try! Service was great, overall enjoyable experience.
