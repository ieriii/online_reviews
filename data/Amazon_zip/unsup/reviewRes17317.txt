Five stars for Carnival! The ambiance was amazing. It is a gorgeous restaurant, filled with a diverse crowd. I went there for my friends 18th birthday because of the fun atmosphere and the live music. I met the band outside of the restaurant, their name was Vagando Muzica and they asked us to go dance after dinner. Our food was good, it was plated very nicely. Portions were good. We had a large group and we had 2 waiters, so they did a great job taking care of us.I love the celling there As soon as we finished our meal, we went over by the band and met their manager. They sang happy birthday to my friend and though it is not common for people to dance, we did and got another table to come and dance with us! I even danced with a guy there with his wife! It was such a fun night and I would return when they have live music, so I can get my groove on! I still talk about my fabulous night there!
