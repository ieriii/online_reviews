I confess to coming back here a few times. The Korean places further up on Lincoln and Lawrence and Bryn Mawr are just too far sometimes, while Lakeview is tolerable, especially now that I have a car again. It really isn't Korean food...as evidenced by the spinach leaves (what!?) in the bad boy Buddha. (Edit) Raw spinach has no place in bibimbap. But I've had the steak bowl more than once now and it's tasty. Definitely call ahead if you're doing takeout...the line gets long! Oh, and one other thing...if you ever eat in. The music? Very inconsistent and almost odd! Must be the tastes of the staff...one night it was heavy bass metal, which would be cool if I was at Kuma's...and another, it was some whimsical...for lack of better term, I'll call it fairy music. Cannot say that either added to my dining pleasure.
