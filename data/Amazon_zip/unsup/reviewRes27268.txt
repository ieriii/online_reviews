This is in my top 5 favorite Chicago pizza places. The carmelized crust IMHO is why we go back and what sets it apart from my other favorites in the area. We usually order sausage and sometimes extra tomato and basil. We always order in (except for when company is in town) so that we don't have to wait for a table and pig out without being judged :)
