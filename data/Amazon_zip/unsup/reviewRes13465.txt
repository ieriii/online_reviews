Tiny beers!! Yay, yay, yay for tiny beers!!  What I mean by tiny beers is that you can order a 5oz sample size of their beers. I love this because I'm a beer nurser. I like beer, but I can't drink it fast and when it gets warm I start to lose some interest. But that doesn't happen when you drink tiny beers! I should also mention that the bacon popcorn is amazing, not for the bacon but for the sage. OMG, that sage is amazing! Also, best fish and chips in the city! Note: it is virtually impossible to get a seat right away. More importantly, they will not seat you if you're in a group until everyone is there.  One last thing, the wait staff is always amazing!
