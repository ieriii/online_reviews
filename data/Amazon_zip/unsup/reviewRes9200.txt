When you venture out in Chicago looking for persian food , two names stand out above the rest. Reza's and Noon O Kabob.. Reza's is where you go if you dont know what true persian food tastes like. Noon O Kabob is where the local Iranian diaspora goes to on weekends for family dinners, because that is exactly what it tastes like. Good old home cooked food, and there's plenty to go around. Albeit their portions of gone on a diet like the rest of the country, they haven't skimped on the flavors. The koubideh is always grilled to perfection and served succulent with grilled tomatoes on the side. Always ask for your tomatoes with a little char on it, the point is to be able to smoosh the grilled tomato into your rice with its juices. the kashkebedamjhan is amazing, and really brings out the grilled eggplant flavor that is a signature of the dish. They make their feta on site and it tastes fresh,be careful not to fill up on it with the warm pita that is served before the meal. Definately try the homemade Akbar Mashti ice-cream after your meal, its not your average pistaccio ice cream for sure.
