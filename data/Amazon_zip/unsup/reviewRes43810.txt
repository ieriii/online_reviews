This used to be "my" steakhouse when I lived in Milwaukee and I would come to Chicago to shop at the Merchandise Mart. I've had countless lunches here pouring over fabrics, designs and layouts. But last Saturday night- I finally had a chance to try the Kinzie Chop House for dinner, and it did not disappoint. The place has been redone since I was here last. Cool, contemporary, with tones of brown and cream. The doors along Kinzie are open in nicer weather and there are a nice mix of booths and tables. I got there late (darn that Eisenhower freeway!) but the staff was great in accommodating us to get in and out and still make our theater "curtain up" time. A couple of their great martinis later and my time on the Ike was but a distant memory! We started with the mussels, which had to be some of the largest that I have had in a while. I stuck to my favorite cut of meat (NY strip) but my friend had the bone in Delmonico. While huge- the flavor was amazing. Typical steakhouse sides included asparagus with hollandaise, and a loaded baked potato which they split for us in the kitchen. I liked the nuance that they put salsa on the potato in addition to the other standard toppings. Our server was great (of course- it may of helped that we had a mutual friend). He moved us through in just about an hour without making us feel rushed. He also suggested a really nice and spicy Cab to go with our choices which was perfect. While they do have valet parking- there is also a large parking garage just across Wells St and the El stop is nearby as well. I may always associate the Kinzie Chop House with lunch since that has been when most of my visits have taken place. But when you are looking for a great steakhouse experience for dinner, in a little more intimate environment than some of the bigger places in town, look no further than the Kinzie Chophouse!
