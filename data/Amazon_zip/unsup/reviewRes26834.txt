I've been eating Pequod's for years now, and it is still my favorite deep dish pizza. As others have said, the caramelized crust is so so delicious. I love everything about the pizza--the crust, the cheese, the sauce, etc. I usually order cheese and mushroom, and it never fails. I must worn you, though, it takes a while for delivery (as does any deep dish pie delivery), and the bottom of the crust can get somewhat soggy after the travel. I recommend going in to eat. The inside is nice since the post-fire remodeling a couple of years ago. One last thing...try the fried zucchini. It's homemade, and dipping it into their ranch dressing sends me into euphoria.
