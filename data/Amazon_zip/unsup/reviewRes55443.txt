Everytime my family comes out to visit we always try a new restaurant downtown and most recently we tried Piccolo Sogno. I loved everything about this restaurant. The service was the great, the bartender was very nice, and the food was amazing. I defnitely recommend this restaurant if our looking for a more expensive, but amazing italian dinner.
