I am really not sure what to think about this place. You know, when you are perfectly balancing on the fence and not sure which side to swing to? I thought my husband described it very well: "Perfectly impersonal" The room is absolutely stunning. From the dramatically oversized windows, to the open kitchen and the honeycomb staircase. Quite impressive. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable. She explained the menu very well and answered our questions. But there was no personal touch, no connection. You can tell the company knows how to run a restaurant, the staff was well trained, things were done right but it felt a little mechanical. Food was a hit or miss. Some things were delicious. My favorite was the American Wagu skirt stake. Perfectly seasoned. And unfortunately overcooked. We didn't get a chance to tell anyone about it - a manager walked by but didn't stop and our server came by the table to bring our wine but didn't check on our food. And by the time I could open my mouth (which doesn't take that long, believe me) she had disappeared. Even so, the steak was very tender and delicious. The rabbit ravioli was super yummy too. The portions are small, so just get a few extra items. And seriously, what brainiac came up with a name that nobody can pronounce or remember? So you see what I mean? I'm still on that fence.
