One of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago. Better than Cocco Pazzo. Great outdoor patio and great vibe to the place. Great friendly service. Food is outstanding and a really good Italian wine list with fair markups, except for the blue chip names where it is 2.5 times retail. The other wines are only 2 times retail. I highly recommend this place on all fronts
