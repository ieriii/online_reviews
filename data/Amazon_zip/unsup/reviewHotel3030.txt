I loved this hotel! It was walking distance to the Navy Pier and it was surprisingly cheap. I stayed here during the week for work and it was well worth the price. The room was great - nice flat screen hotel, bliss products, comfy robe. I also loved the decorations! I had a bunch a boxes shipped to the hotel for a tradeshow I was in town to attend and they did not charge any extra for receiving them (many hotels do this and they charge by weight). All of the staff was extremely friendly. When I am here next year I will be sure to book here!
