When I give this two stars I seriously mean "Meh, I've experienced better."  That all I've had to say when people ask me how Glenn's was since I went there. Everything I really wanted was not available at the time we were there. The eggs I had tasted like there were out of a powder mix and their special potatoes were ok.  As for Glenn's itself that too was - "Meh!" I don't recommend you go there with a large group. They aren't really equip from a space perspective to handle it. "Maybe" I would give it a second chance, but I'm not banking on it.
