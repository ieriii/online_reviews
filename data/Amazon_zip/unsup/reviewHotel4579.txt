The lobby is misleading. the lobby makes you think the place is huge, but the rooms are tiny. they lack a mini-fridge, decent TV, and wi-fi. The wired Internet is $20 a day, which should be free. and wireless requires a $200 deposit. the place is crap. if Hilton is meant for business travelers the least the could provide is free Internet and wi-fi. when i went to get ice the machine was broken and the elevators were malfunctioning. if you want to pay a lot for a garbage hotel, this is the place.
