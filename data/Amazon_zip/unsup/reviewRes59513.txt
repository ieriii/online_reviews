Think red leather booths, christmas lights year-round as part of the decor, and having to plan a big workout for the following day, because this isn't "light eating". But if you have a craving for Old World Italian in a slightly kitschy, very friendly setting, then this is THE place to go. I have to admit, I lived in the neighborhood of this place (Old Irving) 10 years ago, but only ordered take-out pizza back then. I had never set foot in the restaurant area. Boy, was I missing out! Inexpensive, solid Italian food and great service combine to make this a fun change of pace. They have picked up a lot of new business since being featured on Check Please, but the quality remains unchanged. Delicious mussels, (the small variety, not the overly huge rubbery kind) are a good start. You will be hard-pressed to save room for dessert, and it will run you about $20 per person for soup, salad, and entree (without drinks). I wouldn't eat here twice a week, (because I can't work off that much food), but twice a month is perfect.Oh, and they have their own PARKING LOT, true story.
