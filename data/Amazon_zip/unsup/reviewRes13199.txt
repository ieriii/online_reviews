Geez, 71 bucks for "diner" dinner sure leaves a bit of sticker shock. I understand that it's not cheap to supply the midpoint of the continent with fresh seafood daily, but yikes. It doesn't help that they don't list the prices on the menu board. $10 for calamari, $20 for crustacean pot pie, and $24 for ahi steak. The tuna was delicious, but the other two items didn't live up to their price tags. The calamari was salty and floury, and the pot pie was full of good seafood but otherwise bland. The house-made key lime pie was fantastic though. I wonder if they had the limes shipped from Florida.
