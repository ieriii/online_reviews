BEST RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO!!! If you like small, quaint, personal, neighborhood restaurants- this is the place to go! The food portions are very generous, and there's not a bad thing on the menu. No bar to sit at while waiting for a table would be the only downside. But there's valet parking for free and Chef Anthony is the BEST! I highly recommend the lobster ravioli, lasagna (big enough to feed the brady bunch) or the salmon. The best! We bring all out of town guests here.
