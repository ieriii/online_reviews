I have only gone in for carry-out, but it is always extremely fast. Before I can choose which of the funky retro variety of sodas to try, my meal is ready to go. I am a fan of the Baby Buddha which I opt to have without the egg on top making a really guilt free and satisfying meal-just the right amount. Its a little weird the first time, I just wasn't used to having anything like that served cold. I admittedly zap it in the microwave so its not cold cold, just 'crisp.'
