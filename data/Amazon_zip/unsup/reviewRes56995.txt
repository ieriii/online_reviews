One of the gauchos that served my table was extremely accommodating as to how I liked the meat cooked. He came back to our table before the kitchen closed just to check if we had wanted anything else after already eating so much.This was a great experience. I just wish that they had more 50% off specials. The last time that had this special was two years ago, I believe.
