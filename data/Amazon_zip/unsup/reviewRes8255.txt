I went into Spacca Napoli with the Windy City Pizza Club on Sunday night at 6pm. Trying to find an all around pizza experience? Here is your place. Finding the restaurant was easy and parking was plentiful. Upon entering we were greeted by Jonathan Goldsmith who put us at a nice table for our party of 10. The restaurant is very roomy with lots of nice tables and lighting. The overall landscape of the restaurant was very nice and reflected what it would be like to dine in Southern Italy with wooden tables and private dining areas. The service was also very friendly and smart. There was one screw up with a pizza, but the great part about this place is that the oven is so large and so HOT, that it only takes 3-5 minutes from the time you order to the time you are eating. Each pizza is big enough for only 1 person. The size is large compared to any large pizza you would get anywhere else, but the crust is so thin that sharing would be pointless. Also, you would not want to take out from Spacca Napoli because the pizza is only good when eaten when it comes out of the oven. Because of the high moisture content and the fact that the pizza is ready after 5 minutes, you wouldn't want to compromise the taste. I had the Bianca con Bufala e Rucola Pizza which is Mozzarella di Bufala, Arugula, Basil. The pizza came with a giant pile of green and the crust was very thin and light. If you have ever had Naan (leavened, oven-baked flatbread), this crust was close to what that taste like! So good! Overall, the Windy City Pizza Club had a very relaxed and nice time at Spacca Napoli and we will be back. Thank you Jonathan Goldsmith, owner!
