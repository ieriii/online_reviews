EIazu definitely deserves a positive review, despite the fact that I had some REALLY bland food there. I got a dish with tuna, rice, and some veggies. Looked good on the menu, but it was all texture. No flavor whatsoever. BUT I was with a big group of people and received a lot of charity food from their plates. Everything else on that menu rocks. The skirt steak was the definite winner. Service was great. Our server, Amanda, did a great job at accommodating our big group and didn't have a problem taking my meal off the tab. Irazu kicks butt. No doubt about it.
