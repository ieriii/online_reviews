This is the best Thai food hands down. It is the only Thai place where I feel safe eating the beef, which is mouth watering. All dishes I have had here are beyond exceptional. The ginger chicken is comfort food, the masaman curry is gorgeous, I could go on forever. This place is the best. I know live in CA, and even with all the Asian restaurants here, I still crave this place.
