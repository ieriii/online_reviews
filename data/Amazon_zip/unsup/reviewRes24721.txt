I used to live in the area and definitely did not go to Irazu as often as I should have. I took a date here last Friday and had a great time. I had the steak and onions, which was very good. The chips and gauc were also very good, but not the best I've had. Service was friendly, but a little pushy, and seemed to be rushing us through the ordering process. I understand given the long wait to be seated. My only real complaint was that it took forever to be seated on a Friday and they do not take reservations. I definitely plan to go back.
