Noon O Kabab was one of the first cases of the show "Check Please" completely ruining an establishment. It is virtually impossible to get a meal in under two hours on the weekends now and the prices have gone up as the quality has gone down.  The Eastern European (huh?) waitresses speak barely a lick of English and are almost as good at ignoring you as the incredibly rude hostesses. The last time I went (and I do mean LAST time, as in last time I will ever step foot in the place) my small party and I were unable to decipher who our main server was for the entirety of our NEARLY 4 HOUR ORDEAL of a meal. Not to mention the fact I was chided like a school kid for daring to ask one of the hostesses exactly who was supposed to be serving our table. The food was... forgettable compared to the horrid service. Not terrible, but certainly not worth the abuse we endured.  "Check Please", please stay home. You are ruining too many good eateries in this city.
