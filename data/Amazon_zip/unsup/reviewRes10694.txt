Last night, my husband and I went to Piece with our friends. We got there first, so we sat at a booth and ordered some beers. There were several beers on special that night, including the Swingin' Single, which was what I ordered. It was a light Belgian Beer, and I enjoyed it. It's an appropriate Tuesday night beer - it says, "Hey, it's after work and I want a beer, but I don't want to get obliterated, yeehaw!" Once our friends arrived we started looking over the pizzas. We decided to get a large red pizza for the four of us - cheese/tomato sauce, good basic stuff. As for toppings, we chose the green peppers, mushrooms and onions. We also ordered the house salad, which was greens (none of that pussyfoot iceberg), red onions, cucumbers, a light sprinkling of Gorgonzola and candied walnuts tossed in a vinaigrette. Our server was very attentive and brought our food out in a timely manner. The ambiance was ok - there were some unbelievably obnoxious kids that kept throwing their plastic cups on the floor, and their parents kept remarking on how cute they were. Ugh, wrangle your kids plz. Anyway, after some waiting the food came. House salad was awesome. Flavors were balanced perfectly. I could have eaten that all night. Pizza came out next. The large is, uh, very large. When they say it's hot, yeah, it's very hot. I probably should have given it a minute to cool before I tried to snatch a piece from it. Very thin inner crust on the pizza, and a nice chewy outer crust is good for soakin' up cheese/grease/etc. Loaded with cheese and toppings, we finished the large, though we stuffed ourselves to the point of overkill doing it. I would say I've had better pizza in the city, though this was very very good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back if I was in the Wicker Park area.
