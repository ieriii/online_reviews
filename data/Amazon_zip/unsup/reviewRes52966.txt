They have a real nice outdoor patio in front during the summer that I'd give 4 stars, but in cold weather it's a different story when you have to sit inside. We went on a recent Fri. night and the noise was as loud as I've ever experienced in a restaurant. The large back room is the worst, given the acoustics, and it's rather aesthetically challenged. The front room is much nicer, though still kind of noisy. I don't have any complaint about the food, it was all fine, and having BYOB is much appreciated. They also have decent veggie options. We did, however, wait at least 30 min. for our food to arrive, followed by our check about 15 minutes later as they were anxious to turn the table over.
