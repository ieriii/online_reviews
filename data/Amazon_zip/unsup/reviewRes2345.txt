Being that I'm a regular, I wonder to myself, why has it taken so long to write a review? I am a HUGE Chicago hot dog fan. I've eaten at all of the most popular joints in Chicago, and have had hot dogs all over the world. However, the one place I keep returning to, is Hot Doug's. Granted, the last time I was there on a Friday, I had to wait an hour to get my food, it was worth it. The service is friendly and quick (lines is slow, but food is ready shorty after ordered), and no matter how busy they are, Doug has always asked how I was doing, and was very friendly. Also, even at their busiest, I've always found a place to sit after I ordered. The variety of hot dogs toppings, and sausages are fantastic, as well as the quality, and consistency. The duck fat fries are a great treat, although I love their regular fries as well. Just do it...the 1809 reviews don't lie (well, the ones that gave it less than 5 stars are)
