Walked by in the freezing cold with a friend and we jumped inside for warmth. Immediately I got a great vibe from the old wooden pub style, chandeliers, big fireplace, cozy booths, and sturdy tables. The host was very personable and seated us in a back booth. First things first on a chilly Chicago night - ordering up some brewskies. I was delighted to see Fat Tire on the menu. We split the cheddar and artichoke dip served with little toast pieces to start. Piping hot yes, flavor mania rockin' my world not so much. Good, but not awesome. For my meal I ordered the Blackened Chicken Pub Club piled high with bacon, avocado, and swiss cheese on a toasted bun, um delicious. My friend ordered the macaroni and cheese which was $13, and so so SOOOO worth it! Cheesey goodness plus bacon, diced tomatoes, covered in fried onions - it was some of the best mac and cheese I'd ever had, and still gooey till the bitter end. Everything on the menu was total comfort food, and with friendly service and fire place cozy-factor, I can't see why this place isn't on everyone's go-to list.
