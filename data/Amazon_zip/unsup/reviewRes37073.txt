Love. This. Bar. I've been exploring all the wonderful things Andersonville has to offer, and this is the best gem I've found. The beer is amazing, probably, but I pretty much drink whatever name is funniest, so I'm really just here to emphasize the muscles!!!! They are so, so tasty, and you get a ton. I went with a friend who loves to eat almost as much as I do, and we made do with an order of muscles for 2, and another appetizer. Meals made of appetizers are how I dream of living every day, so yes. The atmosphere and the service are great as well, and you KNOW you're in a good restaurant in Chicago when you have to go down into the basement and pass a creepy atm to pee.
