I ordered the thin crust last night, while the toppings (Sausage and Mushroom) were delicious, i wasn't overly impressed. The outter pieces were must better than the inner ones as the crust wasn't even substantial enough to stay together-it fell apart quite easily. After reading all the reviews I'll opt for the deep dish next time.
