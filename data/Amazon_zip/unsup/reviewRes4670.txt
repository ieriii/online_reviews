Wow! I love the name, The Purple Pig, very catchy! But wait till you taste the food, it'll blow you away! I enjoyed every part of my dining experience here. First, the server, Steven, was very friendly and helpful in servicing my table for the night. Thanks Steven! Second, the food was amazingly delicious. I've tried a good amount of bone marrows in NYC, but Purple Pig takes the award for their simplicity and for maintaining the essence of natural flavors while integrating a few twists. The absolute must-try popular dishes include the milk braised pork shoulder which melts in your mouth, the turkey leg confit that is big enough to feed two, and the sushi quality octopus that is grilled to perfection. Also had the wagyu sirloin tip - cooked just right. Everything came in good portions. Last but not least, you'll be leaving this place stuffed and happy without having to break the bank. I wish there were more places like this in NYC. I'm going to miss The Purple Pig!
