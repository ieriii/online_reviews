Love, love, love the rustic European design and feel of Davani Enoteca. Very open dining room that is great for groups, unfortunately this also means that it can get pretty loud. Went with a group of 7, we started with a sampling of 5 cheeses for $15, great presentation and the staff is able to describe each option and give recommendations if desired. This was a fun way to sample different cheeses, served with a raisin toast and strawberry preserves. Everything sounded great and had great presentation, unfortunately nothing really stood out to me. I ordered the roasted cherry tomato + burrata + basil pesto for $8, the dish was a gorgeous take on a Caresse salad, warm roasted tomatoes sill on the vine atop a hockey puck sized round of Burrata cheese which is mozzarella filled with cream. It was good but nothing I am rushing back to get again. I also got the Risotto Carbonara for $8, consisting of Italian rice + pancetta + sweet peas + parmigiano + farm egg yolk. I was super excited for this dish and extremely disappointed, it was not as creamy of a risotto as I like and the Italian rice was a bit aldente, ick. Though our server Hila was fabulous and handled it very well offering to have the chef prepare me something different. The atmosphere of Davanti Enoteca is so great that I would definitely come back, but probably just for wine, appetizers, and great conversation in a gorgeous setting.
