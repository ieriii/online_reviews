Oh well, we should have stuck with our trusty usual's from XOCO next door! We walked right in and were seated immediately. Our appetizer was the shroom empanadas, they were really salty and barely room temp! Next I had the fish fajitas, very fishy, well half of it was, like they used two different fishes & Bones! Our service was more interested in his female co-worker & we needed attention. I had a Margarita & it was strong & lacked the flavor flair I had hoped from Rick. The Ambiance was the best part of our visit XOCO will be visited next time ++++
