The food is delicious and inexpensive. The servings are generally huge. I love this place!! The only reason why i dont give it 5 stars is because 80% of the time I go there the service is super slow (even when theyre not busy). Its usually the waiter who is really slow and innatentive. This is why I have picked up my food instead of dining in lately. But you cant go wrong with the food.
