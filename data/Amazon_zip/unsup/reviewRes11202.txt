Good pizza, beers are not too bad either. One complaint and this is actually for most Chicago local brews... Why Are you afraid to give the beers a stronger flavor? It is the same fault i find with goose island, revolution brewery etc...let the natural flavor go wild. Your buddies just outside of Chicago (3 floyds and the like) got this figured out... Can you?
