Visually, The hotel is modern, creative and pretty. However, it's good design does not make up for the so-so staff.-I only saw one employee, a bellman, dark man with braids, who provided exceptional service. I watched him from the bar as he kept guests dry from the rain, continually keeping the elevator ready, and carrying luggage with a smile. The bar wasn't busy and the nice bartender unfortunately couldn't multitask well. **the elevator requires your room key and it continually didn't register with many guests.. And one point, it wouldn't work for a bellman. The elevator wouldn't allow me to go to the Vertigo room either.. That was frustrating and I tried both days. I didn't ask the staff for help b/c like I said, they didnt really seem that helpful. I did love the comfy king room. The bed itself felt like heaven. There was a personal patio and an awesome shower. The layout of the room was creative. It felt as if you were in a loft.
