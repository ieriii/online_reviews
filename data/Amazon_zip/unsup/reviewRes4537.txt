First off I've been to the Green Mill numerous times, it just so happens it's always on a Wednesday. Almost every Wednesday, from 9pm to 1am you can witness Alfonso Ponticelli and Swing Gitan! Being a witness to their performance will not disappoint. They play in the Gypsy Jazz style, a la Django Reinhardt. The music has a folksy swing to it. Plus the absolutely amazing ambiance sets up for an lovely even. If you've never been to the Green Mill, don't wait!
