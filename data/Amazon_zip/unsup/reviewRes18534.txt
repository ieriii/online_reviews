This was my first time going to this restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided we would check this out because my roommate had stated the place was pretty good. We went there on a Friday a couple of weeks ago. They were quick to get us a table and serve us. This place has a great beer menu if your into drinking all types of beers, fairly priced. The menu has a variety of burgers, sandwiches. One of the unique things about their menu that I noticed is that they have all different types of fries, from garlic to chipotle fries. About five different varieties. Something different than other restaurants. I ordered the brisket sandwich on texas toast with garlic fries. This meal was not so bad, but I will say I think that the brisket needed a little more kick to it. But other than that the food was great. I would definitely come back here and try some other food. If you want to come to a place with fast and friendly customer service with satisfying food then check this place out.
