The first room they gave me had absolutely no view, it overlooked the atrium and some ugly rooftop of the hotel. I asked to be moved and they were very accommodating, which I give them credit for. However I have some major issues with this hotel thus far. The room looks worn and is not up to my standards for almost 200 a night. I ordered room service, and the food was good, but I had an issue with the service. I asked if the guy who brought it up if he had change, he said no. I gave him 40 for a $32.00 meal expecting him to return with my change but he never did. Needless to say I am not pleased. And I also cannot seem to find any information in this hotel room on the amenities. The booklet on the desk has room service info, but nothing about where the gym is located, is there a spa, etc etc. I expected better from a Hyatt.
