We've been going to Frontera for over 20 years now and we've seen a definite decline. My brother, who's also a frequent visitor, has seen the same. The food is still good, but the service is lacking. It's as if they outsourced they're entire staff to save money. Example: Our server did not attend to us until we'd been there for over 10 minutes. I tried to get the attention of the seating hostess, but she was busy carrying on with one of the other staff members. Once our server did show up, his accent was so thick that we could barely understand him. Nice to have authentic pronunciation of the dishes, but this was over the top. The rest of the service was much of the same - slow and late. Furthermore, the assistance server placed the dishes in front of the wrong people - like Denney's: Now who had the chicken? Overall it was very disappointing and embarrassing for us; we brought family with us to share the experience that we'd been raving about for years. What a letdown. I guess all good things come to an end eventually (slowly).
