It's the Olive Garden of Greek food. The kitchy interior, the overly-oily food, the inflated prices, the servers who refill your water glass after every time you drink a sip. Not veg friendly- the dolmades (grape leaves) and the stuffed peppers and tomatoes all have meat in them. The vegetable plate presents an assortment of delicious things entirely doused in oil and fat and overcooked till they're slippery and gooey.
