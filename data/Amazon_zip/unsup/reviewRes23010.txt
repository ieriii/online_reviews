We were really disappointed with the food at Greek Islands when we went this weekend. We've always ordered a gyro platter to go (which is gigantic and enough to feed 2 people by the way), and it's delicious. However when we dined in, I wanted to order the milk-fed baby lamb that they had as their special for Easter...however, they were entirely out by 7pm! Outrageous.  Everything was over-salted. Saganaki? I couldn't finish it...I NEVER not finish cheese that's in front of me. I thought that by putting it on top of the bread it would be palatable but I was wrong. The spinach & cheese pie? standard Greek fare and yes, salty. I ended up ordering leg of lamb, which was the only non-salty thing I tasted all night. That being said, it still wasn't that great and I wouldn't get it again. We left the restaurant disappointed...with the number of Greek options around, I don't think we'll be returning to Greek Islands for anything but their gyro platter.
