Came here for lunch with coworkers. The prices were great - $9-11 for almost all the sandwiches. The market fish special was $19. The decor is colourful and fun while maintaining classiness. The service was awesome. Besides the usual (polite and friendly, timely and efficient, came by regularly but not too often), the woman who took my order helped me choose between two sandwiches by offering to bring me one, and if I didn't like it, she'd bring me the other. I couldn't believe it. The food was great. I ended up getting a grilled prime ribeye (or something) with arugula and avocado mayo sandwiched between - wait for it - fried plantains. It was awesome. The plantains were perfect sandwich bread; they weren't too brittle, but separated cleanly with each bite, and they had that awesome fried fragrance with minimal oil. Highly recommended.
