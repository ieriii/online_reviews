They changed up the Bubbly flight selections, woohoo! It's a good place that can manage a sparkling wine flight without letting it get too fruity. Delicious pear, endive and bleu cheese salad too, the mustard dressing was perfect. And thanks to the waiter for not letting me get so excited about picking out my cheeses that I would forget about the accompaniments. It surely would have been disastrous. Dying to try the fondue when I come back, but had another great night at Bin! PS - I nearly died of jealousy after watching some roasted bone marrow walk by me to another table, only to find that it just comes with the steak. Make that available separately pretty please! This girl wants some delicious fatty meat-buttah.
