i'd give this one 3.5 stars too fairly generous portions. broad selection. It makes you feel you're in a newer version of the Cheesecake factory. The burger topped with a short rib is delicious. Their pizzas are pretty good too.  Salads and brunches seem to be their wheelhouse. Brunches are the standard variations-on-a-theme with little imagination but well executed.  Not bad for brunch, lunch, or dinner. cannot rate desserts, but would assume they're okay, too. this is a fine selection if you have picky or high maintenance eaters or if you're hungry. Beware of long lines and lots of tourists
