Pretty predictable little joint. I've been here a handful of times and it's always just standard. There are for sure better italian places in Chicago. The last time I was there was my worst experience. I was on a date and we had a reservation, they sat us upstairs in the very back corner at a cramped, forgotten about table that the chubby waiter could barely get to. The service was super slow and the food was just standard. I will say that I had a dessert there once that I have never forgotten about, a chocolate chip coffee cake served warm with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream. It was so mouth wateringly delicious, but also simple enough for me to rip off the idea and make at home :)
