Irazu used to be one of my favorite restaurants but over the last year or so they have completely lost it. When I've gotten food there in the last 6 months it has been a disappointment - lots of wrong orders, some late orders and strange things like...there was wet pieces or paper towel/napkin or something in my burrito tonight, yuck. I paid extra for spinach and zucchini to be in it too, but my burrito arrived with mushrooms and zucchini. I really don't like mushrooms and I paid extra to get them, not cool. Anyone who liked Irazu 2-3 years ago knows what I'm talking about when I say that they have lost it. The atmosphere dining in has lost some quality as well. It's super sad because they USED TO BE so good. RIP Irazu ;(
