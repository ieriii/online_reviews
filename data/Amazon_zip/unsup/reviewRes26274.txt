I thought I would update my review since I have been back a few more times since my first visit. Everyone is very nice in this restaurant and their food is even better. I think I just happened to go there on a really really hot Chicago day. I went here last night again with my boyfriend and our bill was so cheap! This by no means their food is cheaply made. He got a Vietnamese sandwich that he couldn't stop raving about....and it was only $4!!! I had the beef pho again and I loved it as usual. This is now my go-to Vietnamese restaurant...closer than the Argyle little Vietnam but almost just as good. My boyfriend is a super big fan of their mango smoothie and I think he would go for just that.
