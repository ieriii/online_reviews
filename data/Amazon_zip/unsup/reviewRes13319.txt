Really enjoyed our stop in at Revolution, recommended by a friend we were staying with. The list of homebrewed beers was fun and impressive. I found myself really wishing I'd bought one of the growler koozie thingys but forgot on my way out the door. The menu is full of tasty treats. Highly recommend the bacon popcorn (like how can you go wrong with bacon and popcorn, hello???) and I had a giant cheeseburger that lived up to all my expectations. Really a fine stop for good grub and good beer. Just crowded on a Friday night, but what did I expect? The staff was courteous and prompt, so no complaints here.
