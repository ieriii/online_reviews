The last thing I expected to eat in Chicago was kabob, but here I am with my folks, scarfing down mounds of rice and filet after juicy filet of salmon (with lemon juice sprinkled on top, of course). I know my Persian food, and this place served up some of the tastiest I've had. After your meal, ask for some hot tea and some baumiyeh (kind of like bits of churro dipped in saffron honey syrup): a delicious ending to a belly-busting meal.
