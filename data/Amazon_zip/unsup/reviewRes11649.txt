This place is a lot of fun. The best time to go is during live band karaoke nights. Just don't expect to hear a word your friends are saying to you during the evening. As for the pizza, it's thin crust and yummy! The pizzas are served on large trays that are stacked one on top of the other. We got several kinds served to our table and there wasn't a dissatisfied soul in the bunch. One drawback is that the service can be a little slow due to the large crowds.
