I have to appreciate a late-night spot in the city. Surprisingly not too long of wait.. Food comes out quick.... I know I can always enjoy the sides I order: the Galbi, Bulgogi, Kimchi jiggae for about 5 people On the filp side, I always seem to have to call out for servers, but no big, I'm stuffing my face anyways.
