I'm basing this review on one visit to the "Revolution". A buddy of mine and myself decided to try it out after hearing about this new-fangled bar in Logan Square. I'm sort of a beer snob myself, so I wanted to see how their brews stacked up. Got there at about 6:30 on a Saturday. Was VERY crowded which was to be expected. They don't accept reservations so what you see is what you get. We were told it would be a TWO HOUR AND 45 MINUTE wait. Most people would have given up at this point (especially since they wanted us to stay on-site.) But since we were trained in this sort of thing, we told the lady we were going for a smoke outside and then went to another bar close-by to wait it out (score one us.) Finally got in and the beer was ok. I found it to be a little watered down and missing some flavor for a micro-brew. The food was actually very tasty, but not worth a 2 hr 45 min wait. Go here during the day for some food and drinks, but skip it on the weekends...at least until the infatuation stage dies down.
