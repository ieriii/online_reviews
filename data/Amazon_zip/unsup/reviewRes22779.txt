I think I have been a victim of great expectations as a result of high yelp approval. I was hoping to experience the best cheap eats in Chicago. I tried the steak dinner and it was way too salty and way too sour. The oatmeal shake did not make my head spin right round either. I actually preferred Pepito sandwich over the dinner plate. Oh, you should check out the pics I posted.
