Alright, let me give you a little history. First off, my office was looking for suggestions for our annual Christmas party. Of course, being in an office of federal auditors, I'm sure you can imagine that when it comes to planning these parties, my two true loves - good food and tasty martinis - are not their priority. In fact, they're all about the cheap and easy, and not in the good way. Well, after suffering through the last two crappy parties, I decided to go into bitch mode and took over the party planning myself. So...I happened to come across Kinzie's corporate lunch menu, giving everyone their choice of salad, entree, and dessert for only $15.95. And they didn't skimp on what was offered, either - offering ceasar salad, beef medallions, salmon, decadent chocolate cake, etc. Hells ya - cheap enough so no one could bitch about the price, and since everyone made their own selections they couldn't bitch about the food, especially when their genius ass chose it. So I set up everything w/ Fannie, the sales manager for their private events. She answered every ridiculous question I had and was endlessly patient, at the last second giving us extra time to fax in our contract.  The lunch itself was great. We were in their private dining room, which is absolutely gorgeous. We had our own private place to hang coats and our own restroom - it just had everything right there. The food was a hit - although I know a few people were not digging the chophouse salad. Anyways, I thought the beef medallions were the shiznitz (and not skipped on at all portion wise) and the martinis tasted like liquid candy so I was happy. Although next time I would hide the bill from the boss...I got some shit since he reviewed the bill and noticed they charged tax on the gratuity.
