This is one of the most delicious meals that I have ever eaten. My husband and I ate every single bite of every single plate that was brought out. I tend to be a fairly picky eater, but Graham Elliot opened up my mind (and my palate) to some new and amazing things. Some of the highlights included the deconstructed caesar salad, the onion bisque, foie gras lollipop, parmesan popcorn, the skate confit and the pillow talk cocktail (I wanted to drink about 40 of them)! Topped off by impeccable service, all-in-all, this was a phenomenal meal.
