I am tempted to give this place four stars instead of five but the food was so AMAZING that the wait and the lack of wine variety is irrelevant. We came here on a Friday and it was jam packed! We were told the wait was going to be 25 minutes but it ended up being 45... : ( However, the staff was friendly and really accommodating and our waitress Evelyn was awesome. She was really fast and very attentive despite the fact that she was waiting a table of 20 and 16 other tables. We got the spinach cheese and tomato dip as an appetizer and it was really yummy! We ordered a large pizza (for just two of us) and it was HUGE....One side had basil and mushroom and the other side had onions and garlic. The tomato sauce was incredible and everything tasted really fresh. The crust was perfectly thin and all of the ingredients stayed on.. Now my fellow Chicagoans don't go getting your panties in a bunch, I'm all for deep dish...but this has been the BEST pizza I have ever had in Chicago. A word of caution...if it's just two of you, get a medium...if you can eat, get the large...I'm pretty tiny and my boyfriend and I almost finished the entire pizza...We definitely got stares for ordering a large...One older woman gawked in shock at us (the group of 20 table)..I wanted to tell her that she could calm down, I'm still young enough to eat as much as I want without having my hips expand...it still goes to all of the right places ; ) Then again, she was probably just jealous.
