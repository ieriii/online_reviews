Thanks to Groupon I was able to try this place that normally I would not have and I am glad I did. Parking was ample for a Sunday and the place is very cozy. The Entraa was awesome and definitely recommend! The empanadas were great with the delicious dipping sauce. I personally wasn't a fan at all of the Limonada for having way too much ice and not enough flavor. I wish I read before i went that it was BYOB or I would have picked up a bottle. Kind of weird to me the place didn't have linen napkins with it being "upscale". Our busboys were great and it seemed like we heard the other waiters were great but not ours and for this it looses a star. Our waiter was not busy but was slow and rude. He came up to our table, leaned over, and just looked at us to order. Very weird.
