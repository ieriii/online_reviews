One of the best carne asada tacos I've ever had! The tacos are large-size, with an excellent blend of spices and highlighted with tasty Mexican coleslaw. El Milagro has few frills, and certainly won't win many style points, but if you're looking to fix a quick and ultra-affordable Mexican craving...it's worth the trip to Pilsen. BTW - next door is El Milagro's wholesale outlet where you can stock up on numerous Mexican treats ranging for all natural chips and tortillas, cactus salad, pork rinds and large selection of sauces! Ole!
