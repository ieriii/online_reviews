I'd love to give this place 4 stars, or even 5, because they have some amazing looking burgers on the menu. Unfortunately I can't. I thought the food was average to slightly above average. I wasn't shockingly impressed.I ordered the Big Texan b/c the pulled pork on top sounded intriguing. Sadly I couldn't taste much of the pulled pork. I also ordered the curry fries and I got super excited cause as the server was bringing the food I could smell the curry. Sadly, I couldn't realy taste the curry...:(Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad at all. It's a good burger and good fries. But i was just expecting much more from the descriptions and aromas from when the waiter brough the food.I'm still willing to give them another try, of course!
