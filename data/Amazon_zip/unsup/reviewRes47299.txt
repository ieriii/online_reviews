Went to Lockdown on a Tuesday after hearing great things about the burgers and the sweet 1/2 price burger special. No doubt the burgers were great and are worth even full price, the mac & cheese is ridiculously good, and the beer list is pretty solid (love to see Rogue beers)! Unfortunately, it was also a Bulls playoff game night (very unfortunate for the Bulls too... let's try to forget) and the place was packed. Generally this isn't an issue with most places, but Lockdown is a very small place and most of the tables were occupied by people who were just slowly sipping away at their beers while my friends and I were left waiting, shooting daggers at everyone. Obviously it's not cool to bum rush people squatting at their tables, but also not cool when there is food to be served and I'm freakin hungry. The manager was super friendly, though, and helped us find other "accommodations". I can't really elaborate out of respect, but it was all at once funny, unusual, and extremely nice on his part. Anyhow, with all the great burger places popping up around the city I don't know if I would make a pilgrimage if I wasn't already in the area, but Lockdown is definitely a solid place to get your burger/beer on deal or no deal. I would probably just try avoid game nights.
