This is my favorite pizza spot!!!! When I want to sit down and eat pizza - this is the only place I can think of. It is REAL chicago deep dish!!  On me and my boyfriend's two year anniversary, we decided to do something simple yet satisfying - order a deep dish pizza with everything we've ever wanted on it (which equals like a +$25 pizza because of the toppings so yeah it's a special occasion-type-dinner). So we got extra sauce, extra cheese, garlic, basil, tomatoes, and i think we also had sausage (not sure). It was still delicious but we won't get extra sauce and cheese ever again - very messy on deep dish.  We'll stick with our usual garlic, basil and tomato deep dish though. If only they had ricotta cheese as an additional topping option it would be - perfecto! Th wait staff is very nice and I have no complaints about the atmosphere. This is a place for people who want REAL pizza. No joke.
