I don't know what the hell is wrong with the Bongo Room. By now, everyone knows that the food is good, and the brunch is unbeleivable. And by my standards, I'd say it's of quality. But what really cheeses me off about that place is the service. I've been to the Bongo Room about five times, and every time, I've gotten some psychotic, pushy, angry server. Different every time. Each time, the same process, trying to get me to eat and get out. From the order to the bussing, they exude the attitude of superiority, like I'm wasting their time. Maybe I could forgive this on brunch weekeds, but all the time? Why? It's not like they have the right to act like elitists: the service sucks! On one specific occasion, the service was so poor that I have not been back since. When asking for more time to look over the menu(on a weekday afternoon), the server rolled her eyes at me...and came back 45 seconds later to ask if I had decided. When I order drinks, they weren't removed or refilled. And minutes after I had received my entree, mid-bite, still clearly eating, the server had the gall to ask me if I was finished yet. No. You did not just do that. Needless to say, NO TIP FOR YOU! The food at the Bongo Room is a plus, but it's of a caliber that is available at other places in chicago. With better service. I'd go back if I didn't have the feeling that they seek out antagonistic servers in the hiring process. So I can't really conscience the wait for food that is well made, but doesn't stand out in any serious way.
