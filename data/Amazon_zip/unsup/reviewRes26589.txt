I've been back twice to Pequod's since the big fire. The first time I tried the deep dish, since I hadn't had it before. It was OK. The second time I went back for a slice of cheese and mushroom and was really looking forward to the caramelized cheese experience again. I was, however, very disappointed! There was no carmelization in sight for me or my boyfriend, and the slices were pretty bland. What happened Pequods? The mushrooms on my slice were practically refrigerated, and the cheese barely heated.  I was also a little sad that the run-down atmosphere and wall of snapshots has now been replaced with an updated, just like so many other bars, look. Not a bad look, just not as unique as it once was!
