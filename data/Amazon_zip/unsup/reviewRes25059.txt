Another great restaurant in Chicago. This is located in the Blackstone Hotel next to the Hilton Conrad on South Michigan.  Small plates with fantastic flavors....great seafood offering, with other offerings like Tocino Con Cidra!! Hard to find in the city.... The cheese selection is nice-the Cadi Urgelia is amazing. You will love it.
