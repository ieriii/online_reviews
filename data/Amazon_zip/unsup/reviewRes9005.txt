This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I went for the first time a few weeks ago. We sat upstairs, which had a cool island vibe with the faux palm trees and music. The food was excellent. We had the Goi Chun, Chai Gio, a diced beef dish (amazing), a roasted chicken, and a bouillabaisse. Everything was outstanding. Food arrived at the table very quickly. Service was also very good.
