This is my boyfriend's favorite sushi place. We got sushi here one night during the week to-go before they were closing around 11:00 p.m., so I partially take the blame for the lackluster rice that filled our rolls. However, they have many choices and the actual rolls themselves are creative and good. I will be back to try again, but before 11:00 p.m.
