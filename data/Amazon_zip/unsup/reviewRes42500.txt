Came here for holiday dinner with my work team, and it made for a very fun evening. Ambience is great, love the light fixtures and wood tables. Food was...rich, indulgent, heavy. Delicious, but not the place for a light meal. I felt so guilty after stuffing my face with the likes of bone marrow with garlic toast, cheese plate, ricotta gnocchi in brown butter...and the real star - the cornbread!!! This southern girl is a slave to perfect cornbread, and it was fantastic. I think we ordered all the side dishes, and I was surprised at their complexity and general tastiness (never have I had such good brussel sprouts). Wine list also had a nice selection, including a few reasonably priced German wines - my favorite. When I'm up for a meal with the calorie content of an entire week, I will definitely be back.
