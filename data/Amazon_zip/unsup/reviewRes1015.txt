Waiting 4.5 hours in freezing cold winter weather for a mediocre hot dog? NOT worth it. The line wasn't even that long where we were standing.. So, why did we wait so long? For some reason, we figured "We came all the way down here, we might as well keep waiting. Maybe it will be worth it!" I had high hopes for this place.. The most fun part was meeting people in the line. You get to know a lot about them after standing next to them for 4.5 hours. We actually sat down at a table with them after we got our food and ate together. We went here after I saw it on No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain. I literally made it my goal to come here the weekend after the Chicago episode came out. Buuut I was incredibly disappointed. We ordered a bunch of different hot dogs. The foie gras, kangaroo, etc etc. The buns were cold and hard. The hot dogs were nothing special imo. They were cold. I also ordered the duck fat fries that everyone was raving about. EH. They were not crispy. They were soggy, room temperature, nothing special about them. Our total came out to over $50 for 2 people on freakin hot dogs and fries. Plus, they only take cash so that was a little inconvenient at the moment. The best thing we had was the corn dog. The $2 corn dog was the best thing on the menu. Sad... We went a while ago, but I won't be going out of my way to go to Hot Doug's anymore. Seems like TV made it extremely popular overnight and there are a lot of good reviews, but I was VERY disappointed. Maybe I got them on a busy day, but I doubt I'll be going there again anytime soon.
