The decor is fantastic and very romantic here. We started with the empanada sampler, which was good but not great. Their chimichurri sauces were merely "ok" for me - I've had better. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa, which I thought was absolutely wonderful. The fried pork belly was what really piqued my curiosity and surprisingly, I loved it. Shared the pork belly with the rest of my table and they fell in love as well. We asked the waiter if it were possible to order the pork belly alone but sadly, the kitchen said no. The steak itself was tasty too but the cut of the steak, which was more like a thin strip, would call for a well done or charred cooking; I ordered it medium rare. The rice and beans were fantastic - I've never had plain white rice with beans and it just completely changed my ideal for "rice & beans." My boyfriend's grilled octopus would've been tastier to me if they were cooked a bit longer - it felt a little underdone. The desserts were a mere "ok" for me as well - we had some sort of flan and a passion fruit mousse. Their mojito was good but I felt it needed a little more sweetness to it. Overall, my experience was alright. I think that for the price and the amount of food that you get, it's worth it. Will I go back? Probably not - I have my own favorite place for steak and chimichurri.
