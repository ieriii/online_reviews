My 5 star rating is reserved for only extremely special restaurants/experiences, and therefore the Gage gets it! Came here a couple years ago for a quick lunch with a friend as I was passing through Chicago on a flight out of O'Hare. Love the pub atmosphere at this tremendously well-located place; the dark wood, whiskey bottles galore...Nice! My friend and I ordered lunch, a beer, and split dessert and coffee; I had a roast chicken salad that was fresh and well prepared. Between our entree and desert courses as our server was clearing our plates, a tiny bug appeared on the table, which I swiftly flicked away and said "oops! get out bug!". My friend and I could not have cared less about it; it was small and not even close to our food. We hadn't seen each other in years so had a lot of catching up to do, blah blah, we didn't even really pay attention to it. At the end of the meal, the manager appeared and informed us they would be picking up the tab for our lunch, due to the "insect inconvenience". I have NEVER been so surprised in my life. The server must have seen me flick the bug away, but we never even complained because it didn't matter...Talk about paying attention to your customers! My friend and I felt like we were royalty for a day. Seriously? That was not necessary at all, but as I was about to embark on a vacation and spend stupid money elsewhere, it was appreciated immensely. Well done, Gage! I hope to hit this place up for a little happy hour action the next time I make my way to the Windy City.
