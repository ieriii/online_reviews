The Pig is a little piece of North-side paradise hidden on the Miracle Mile. Only 70 seats or so in the place had us waiting over an hour. We sipped a carafe of wine in the odd little hallway. Once seated we were side-by-side at one of the massive communal tables. The food was so so good. Our standout by far was the bone marrow. We also had the shaved brussel sprouts (awsum) and some other odds and ends. We weren't wild about the dessert which was almost like rice pudding. When we got the bill, we couldn't believe how cheap it was! Fun fact, I'm pretty sure there was a "professional" working the room. She had on this dramatic fur coat and kept coming/leaving with different gentlemen. I definitely plan to make it back here for a work-week lunch or post-work dinner!
