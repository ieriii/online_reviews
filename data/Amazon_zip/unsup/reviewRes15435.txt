Another "a-ok" for the price place. Nothing to knock your socks off here. I think I read a review about Calo from a guy from New York that called their pizza dough "bisquick". My sentiments exactly. Better than the cornmeal type "crust" at some other places here.  I'm not a Chicago native either and don't get the pizza thing here. It's all about quantity and not quality. It sure looks good, tastes o.k., it's heavy in a pretty box but about 2 hours later......... There's a city that you'd never guess that won 3 places in GQ magazine's "Best Pizza In The U.S." contest. Chicago got one spot. Bread/dough is a MAJOR part of a pizza and Chicago lost out on that. A clean place (thus an extra star). Do pass on the rib special though. They're too quickly prepared, tough with some tangy cheap sauce. MIne take alot of time and I have a following. I'm sure the surbanites on the weekends that sustain this "neighborhood" love Calo though.
