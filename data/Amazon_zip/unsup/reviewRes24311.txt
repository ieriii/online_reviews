I've always been a "breakfast" person, so as you can imagine, crepes are a favorite of mine. I went there with a friend one Sunday afternoon; it was pretty packed, but luckily there was one available table for two. The menu has a great selection of sweet or savory crepes -- I got the Crepe Marrakech, which was delicious. I wouldn't recommend it for take-out though; I ordered a sweet crepe (the Crepe Perla -- with cajeta, bananas, and coconut) by phone, and while it was ready in only six minutes, in the few minutes I spent transporting it back to my place, it got cold. I don't know how fresh the crepes are, because you can't actually see them making them (while in London I would stop by creperies, and they would make the crepe right in front of the customers), but the combination of fillings is creative and flavorful; the decor of the cafe matches their creativity and flavor; I'll definitely be going back here often.
