At Tru, you will find full of surprises! Until today, this is still by far the best restaurants that I have ever been to. It is expensive, but it's definitely a very unique dining experience, and I would return if I ever visit Chicago again. The service was outstanding, it's almost surreal. Restaurant itself is like a gallery, and food is the art. Everything is perfectly measured.  The tasting menu is what you want to order, and don't forget to order the melted chocolate cake with ice cream. It was too good to be "TRUe"! The day when I went, Nicolas Cage was there with his Korean gf (4 years ago)! I can't say enough good things about this restaurant; you will have to experience it yourself. I highly recommend this restaurant for any special formal occasions.
