Hands down...my FAVORITE Italian place in the city!!! From the quaint decor to the delicious aromas coming from the kitchen, as soon as you walk in the door, you will not be disappointed!! The food is delicious and the service is knowledgeable and attentive, without being intrusive. Not to mention that it's BYOB. It really doesn't get any better than this kids.
