Wow, what a spectacular time! Its not cheap, but boy was it a blast! I'm a pretty picky eater, but enjoyed trying new things and ate Elk and Rabbit and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy it was! Food was excellent, service was great and my friends from Michigan thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Then again, we could have enjoyed our meal at a mcdonald's but that's not the point. Trying new foods at places like this with great friends is what makes these dinners special. HIghly recommended if you're adventurous. They do offer Steak and Salads, but experiment a bit, you might like it!
