God love the Hopleaf! Probably one of the most chill bars/restaurants/taverns around. I love that this place is so chill and yet I don't feel like I'm sitting in a dirty dive $hit hole of a place.  They have an awesomely large selection of microbrews and Belgium beers. I think they have around 300! If I'm not drinking a cider, I just tell the bartender what I like and they'll give me their knowledgable opinion and suggest a beer. I've tasted many a new brew this way.  I haven't eaten much here, but I have dined on the mussels. Fabulous and I plan on tasting more. Hopleaf get s a little crowded, especially on weekends (obviously), so if you are interested in learning more about their brew selection and looking to taste some new stuff, go in during the week when everyone isn't in a super rush and tcan ake the time to recommend something to your liking. Oh yeah...don't dare ask for a Bud or Miller...you find it here.
