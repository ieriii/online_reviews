This restaurant was absolutely fantastic. It is intimate, and the food is just wonderful. We had an early reservation, so the restaurant wasn't full when we first arrived, but even after it began to fill up, it was very pleasant. Our waiter was wonderful, informing us of every aspect of the menu. He checked in often, making sure each course was going well and that we had everything that we needed.I was very impressed by the food. We had the Combination, and it was very, very good. The dipping sauces were fantastic. Both the cheese (pre-main course) and chocolate (post-main course) fondues were great as well. I was worried it would be too much food, but the portions are plentiful without being excessive. I was very impressed, we had a wonderful time!
