We had dinner at Alinea on Saturday night with another couple. I don't even really know how to describe the meal, but to say that it was absolute perfection on a plate and in a glass. We did the 12 course and wine pairing, with the two "upgrades". (You reach a certain point when you find yourself paying $300/person for food/drink/tip that another $20 doesn't seem all that bad.) And what a good decision that was - a 2000 Chateauneuf de Pape was served along with lamb seared three ways served on top of the tiniest little smoking granite grill with an infusion of fresh rosemary. I'd go through the courses, but they wouldn't make sense out of context. Let me just tell you that the meal ended with a cinnamon and caramel tempura batter wrapped around a 10 inch cinnamon stick. I might have traded my first born for a dozen of them to go. The service is unparalleled. Our dinner companions have been to Trotters twice and we ourselves have had a fabulous meal or two, but I've never been so comfortable in an upscale restaurant. I was seated on the equivalent of a comfy couch with beautiful silk pillows at my side. Our team of waiters and sommeliers were serious but not stuffy, knowledgeable but not pretentious and definitely enjoy their work and respect their chef. Grant Achatz is an incredibly gifted chef, notwithstanding he's only 32 years old. As we left the restaurant I asked our hostess, who not only sat us, but walked us to the door and hailed us a cab, to point him out in the kitchen. He was leaning over the counter, working along with the rest of the kitchen staff, you would never have known he was the head chef of Gourmet magazine's "best restaurant in the country".  I was thoroughly impressed. Do make a point to try this fantastic restaurant.
