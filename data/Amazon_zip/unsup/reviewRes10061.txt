Visited Chicago this past summer and ate here after roaming around Wicker Park. Yes, it's really noisy and sort of hard to have a conversation with friends. But who wants to talk when you have a whole pound of tasty pizza in front of you anyway? I'm usually not crazy about thin crust pizza but Piece nailed it. The crust wasn't so thin that it tasted like paper, and it also wasn't burnt. The toppings were probably my favorite part. I'm thinking that it would be pretty impossible to go wrong. My friend/fellow glutton ordered a pizza covered with bacon and mashed potatoes. Gross right? WRONG. Effing delicious. I liked it even better than my pizza, which had pepperoni and spinach. To top it all off, great beer selection to accompany your perfectly baked pie.
