When you dine at the Gage, definitely try and do so when the weather is nice and snag a table outside. Also, be prepared to spend a lot of green. The food is unique, high quality, and tasty, but it is not cheap. In terms of drinks, our table stuck to the beer list (which is pretty expansive and impressive) and the prices were okay. The only thing that was a complete rip was $9 for a pint of Goose Island's Green Line. My uncle developed that beer and I don't even think it should cost that much! $4 or $5 would be a much more reasonable price. I know we're on Mich Ave, but whatever. In terms of food, we all split the vindaloo mussels, which were ridiculously yummy. Would definitely order those again as my meal! I ordered the scallops and Amish chicken. Scallops were good, but not $16-for-2-scallops-good. The Amish chicken was very flavorful, tender, and more appropriately priced. Others in our group ordered the salmon and sea bass special, both of which were excellent.
