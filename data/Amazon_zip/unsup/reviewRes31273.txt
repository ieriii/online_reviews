My friend Brenna and I went here brunch and the food was delicious :) We had a blast and ended up staying for a few cocktails (ok maybe more than a few)!!! The bartender/part owner Omar made us some AMAZING drinks, they were more like custom made cocktails that tasted like heaven! I will be back here again and again!!!
