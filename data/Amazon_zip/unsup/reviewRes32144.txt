i love deliciously prepared fake meat. this place does it for me. i also love vegan baked goods. cha-ching, 2 points. kind of on the pricey side but it isn't horrible and the food is good enough, the portions are large enough, to justify it. the last time i was in there one of the waiters had everyone in the house sing happy birthday to not one but two different, unrelated and unacquainted people. one of them was an 80-something year old woman. i liked that.
