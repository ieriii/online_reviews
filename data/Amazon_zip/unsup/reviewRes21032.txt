Let me tell you why I love visiting my brother, b/c when we go somewhere to eat we throw down. When we went to Xoco we split 4 tortas and I had a coffee and a churro. Their Pepito -short ribs torta is by far my bro and I 's favorite and I'm stealing this line from a Tina Fey interview " I would stick my penis in it" if I would not require skin grafts and be arrested for doing so. It is one of my favorite sandwiches ever, the meat was fall apart tender and mixed well w/ the cheese and just enough heat. We also had the Choriqueso- chorizo, Ahogada- carnitas (warning the dipping sauce for the Ahogada will make you wish you were born w/o a tongue it is fire in a cup) and Jamon- griddle torta w /prosciutto. They all tasted super fresh and their flavors were not muddled like a lot of Mexican food tends to when alot of ingredients are involved. The coffee was excellent - nice and strong and the churro although small was cinnamony, sweet, light and crisp. We did not have to wait cuz i flew in kinda early and came btwn their breakfast and lunch switch and got a table. But when we left Xoco it looked like the bread line in a 3rd world communist country, I would be surprise if there was not at least a hour wait. It is also $ I think we spent 60 bucks and I was full, but def not stuff, then again my bro and I do have obnoxious appetites.
