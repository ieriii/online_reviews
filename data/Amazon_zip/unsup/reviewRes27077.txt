This was our second visit to Frontera in three years on visits to Chicago. We arrived for the evening rush and were delighted when our wait was less than 15 minutes. Bottom line for our group - we're glad we've been there, but now we've done that. Two of my friends had a roasted goat starter that had way too much cheese to swim in. Service was very good, but like I said, we're over Frontera.
