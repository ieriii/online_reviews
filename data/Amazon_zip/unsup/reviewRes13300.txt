I was playing with some quotes about revolution for this review, including: Give me beer, or give me death. They may take our lives, but they will never take our burgers. Get up, stand up. Stand up for your ale. The revolution will not be televised. So drink some more beer. But as you can see, they all ended up being really, really dumb. So I'll just say this: If there ever was a revolution I could get down with, it would be one with burgers and beer. Rev is open until 2am every night, so it has become a late night fave for me and the manfriend. First: order beer. They have something for all tastes, and it's all good. All the servers are knowledgeable about their selection, and they're all super cool. I'm not gonna lie, I wish they were all my besties. Don't tell them though, they might think I'm a creepy lurker and avoid me the next time I go in. Watching the bartenders yank down on the fist-shaped tap handles is just fun. Second: order food. Preferably burgers. Haven't had a bad one here yet. The Hombre Burger with poblano pepper, chihuahua cheese, avocado, and tortilla strips is my fave. The apps are the shiz too. Bacon fat popcorn? You had me at bacon. Polenta fries? Gimme. The building is huge and awesome, so take a moment to look around while you eat. Exposed brick, crazy artwork, a fireplace, and a cool upstairs dining area all add to the experience. So what are you waiting for? Grab a glass and a plate, and join the revolution.
