I know this place is a northwest side tradition, a staple even. I enjoy being able to order via drive-in, but I am not convinced that this is one of the better hotdog stands. The hotdogs and toppings at Superdawg are quite good. But, I am a Vienna hotdog fan myself. A few times, the fries here have been cooler and dry; it's like they had been sitting around a while. A few years ago, I decided to try their hamburger. It is one of the most mediocre hamburgers I've had. Stick with the hotdogs.
