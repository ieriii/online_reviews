Having just moved to Chicago from San Francisco I used Yelp to help me find some restaurants while my parents were in town visiting from California. I liked what others said about this restaurant so quickly made a reservation. The ambiance was great, looks similar to a loft with the high open ceilings and nice brick walls. The moment my fiance and I were seated waiting the rest of our party we were quickly offered a cocktail. Thumbs up on that part. I ordered the beet salad and lamb. My lamb was a little more rare than I had hoped for but it was still great. My mom ordered the risotto which just melted in my mouth, it was so good. I also liked how the portions are just right so you aren't walking out of the place stuffed. Service was great, fun hip atmosphere (may have been too hip for my parents but they still had a good time). I do recommend this to anyone wanting to try something a little different.
