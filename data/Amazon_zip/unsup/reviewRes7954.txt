This place rocks! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that it is pricey. Though for a great meal and all they offer a 5 may have been warranted. A absolutely wonder full salad bar with even better meats. You got to love a steakhouse that has steak roasting on a spic-it as you walk in to the establishment. A worthwhile experience!
