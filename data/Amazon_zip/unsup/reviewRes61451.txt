This is utterly a place for "the locals." Groups of men wandered in, grunted orders at the counter, ate and left in the time it took for our order to be taken. The utensils and decor could best be described as early 1980's cafeteria. Since my dining companion and I had no idea what anything was, we closed our eyes and pointed at something random on the menu. The owner was friendly and tried to explain what stuff was, but really he could just confirm that there was chicken involved in some form. Positives - plentiful and cheap food, excellent lassi, open late. Negatives - no descriptives, sloppy-joe texture, customers "cleaning their noses and throats out" actively and loudly at the bathroom sink. I have no idea if I liked this place or not, but I was hungry enough to eat the food and it hasn't destroyed me yet. Yay?
