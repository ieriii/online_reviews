A great time did we have! The seafood here is phenomenal and was beyond expectation, and my other half confirms the Steak was divine. If you are an oyster lover than their oyster bar will certainly have what you are looking for to appease and please any discriminating palate. They are always having specials, and the libations from the bar are made well and worth what you paying for. Valet parking is convenient, however parking can be an nightmare depending on the day of the week, season and the weather of the day. Even so, if you are looking for a nice upscale restaurant to have a nice sit down romantic or casual dinner, this place can certainly deliver. Can't wait to go back again!
