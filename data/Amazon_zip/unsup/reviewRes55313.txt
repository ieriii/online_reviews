Fogo is the BEST Brazilian steak house in Chicago! Fogo de Chao has the best steaks, plantain and bread!! Best beef ribs! Texas de Brazil has the best salad bar and their lobster bisque soup is superb and Brazzas has good meat too but Fogo is still #1 to me because of their meat and plantain. I just wish Fogo has discounts like Brazzas and Texas de Brazil.
