Kind of a Kuma's Light, I guess one can say. I haven't been when it's really crowded as people mention it's hard to order beer/food when it is. I guess I was lucky that it was not crowded at all when I went. I can see people thinking the service is subpar as I thought that too and there was only 4-5 tables dining at the time. Anyways, to the food. Real good. People are saying the burgers are huge and I actually thought they were average at best in terms of size. Maybe I'm used to Kuma's and other places which burgers that'll rip your stomach apart or maybe I'm a fat ass. Or both. But they were quite good and cooked as I wanted them. You can sub fries with the specialty fries for a small charge and they have some good flavors worth checking out. The apps are also pretty good (esp. the fried curds) which they may run out of if you go late or something. Bunch of "weird" burger topping that make my mouth drool and worth going over and over again to try something new every time. Especially for burger lovers such as myself. Slightly worse than Kuma's I guess but worth it considering you won't have to wait 3 hours. Oh, the beer list is wonderful too, which is always a positive.
