We went here for fun and early Valentines. It was amazing and beautiful inside! I'm a sucker for tin ceilings and their decor was a amazing. I have never been to Vietnam but by it's popularity it seemed like something that people liked. The upstairs has an amazing bar and more seating area. The bartender was very friendly and there is a huge wine list. We basically pointed at things that we haven't tried before. The hostess was relatively friendly. We got seating at 9pm as was our last minute reservation. We had an awesome table near the window where I could see my former employer from long ago - starbucks! The appetizers were really good - the monkfish with sesame crackers was soooo good! 5 stars basically for that. It tasted so freshly made and so delicious. Boyfriend had soup with asparagus and that was tasty too. The main dishes I have to agree - double the price for something that you can get cheaper at an actual Vietnamese restaurant. Though the sea bass was good and yummy with glass noodles, my chicken dish was just ordinary. it had a kick to it with chilli but not too amazing. For dessert we had delicious port a 10 and a 20 year olds. Also I had the creme brule which was an amazing combo of creaminess and carmelized sugar on top. Pudding is not my thing but boyfriend said it was good. So overall it was a great experience. I think our waiter was just recommending the favorites that weren't too crazy. But if you go, don't play it safe, get the chicken with mango and stuff on it. The atmosphere is amazing with wooden accents, "palm trees" and an actual rug in the bar area!
