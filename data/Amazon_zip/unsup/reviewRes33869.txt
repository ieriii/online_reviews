After all the hub bub about the best falafel in the city I came here and honestly just thought it okay. Not terrible but not terrific either. I came here with a friend of mine and was really looking forward to it. He however, used to come here all the time before he up and joined the Army so it was old hat to him. However, he didn't seem to mind too much. I've had better, the falafel was okay nothing too special. The chicken shwarma was also...okay and that's the rub. I've had better elsewhere and that is perhaps what is so disappointing about it. I think I psyched myself out with all the good reviews here. I acknowledge that perhaps I haven't given this place a fair shake and am more than willing to try it out.
