Love it. Must admit that the first time we tried this place, they just opened, and service was poor. Went back this week to give it another try, and was very pleased. Honest, tasty BBQ (I went to school in NC, and consider myself a BBQ expert), inexpensive, and fantastic atmosphere (whether just out for dinner or to watch a game in the bar area). Also very accommodating for kids. Happy to add this to our Gold Coast top five.
