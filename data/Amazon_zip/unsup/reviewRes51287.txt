I recently went to Garcia for the first time in years; I used to live in Lincoln Square and go occasionally when it was a narrow hole in the wall. Now the dining room is twice as large, there's a bar, and better decor. It's still loud inside, though not as terribly noisy as before. Food isn't the best Mexican food I've had, but it was pretty good and the portions are a good size for the money. I ordered a 3 steak taco dinner, which was a mistake, as 2 would've been more than enough.
