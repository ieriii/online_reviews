The rumors are true...this place is fan-tastic. Some of the best brunch service across the board, along with a decent selection on the menu and food. I recommend the Avocado + Eggs Benedict, and pretty much anything with the words 'juice' or 'coffee' in it. Portions are definitely large for the prices. A full brunch for 4 came out to under $60, so not bad. Lack of booze can sometimes be considered a huge miss for brunch, but still a great place. A little tip on for Sundays, at least - there's a pay lot a couple doors South that's only $5. Not a bad deal if you're lazy before brunch.
