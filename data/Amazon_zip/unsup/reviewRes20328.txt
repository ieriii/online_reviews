I tried this for the first time this morning. I ordered take out, and it was good. I had an empanada with salsa verde. I have a low tolerance for spice, and this was on the spicier side for me, but I enjoyed it. The empanada was flaky and the crust was well executed - I enjoyed the crust more than what was on the inside. I also had a muffin. The muffin was really good. Way better than the crap Sprinkles tries to pawn off on people. I also ordered a classic hot chocolate with 2% milk and dulce de leche. I couldn't taste much of the dulce de leche until the end of the glass, but the hot chocolate was VERY chocolate-y and VERY good. I enjoy the hot chocolate from Ghirardelli's more than here, but this was far superior to the Starbuck's hot chocolate, which I frequently get. I was trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars, but I went with 3 because I couldn't find descriptions of what was in everything (still have no idea what was in my muffin or empanada) and the woman behind the counter was not helpful at informing me when I asked her. I had to wait more than 20 minutes for a to go order and it was pricey. I would stop here again if I were in the immediate vicinity, but I would not make a special trip for this.
