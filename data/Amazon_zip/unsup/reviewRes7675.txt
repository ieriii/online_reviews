After you get over the novelty of the Brazilian steakhouse concept, there's really not much to be so excited about. Ooo! I flip over a card and it tells them to offer me meat! Ooo! I can turn it off! On! Off! On! Off! Holy crap look at all of that meat!! Granted, I've only been here several times for lunch. This is not the type of place you want to eat for lunch unless you want to waddle back to the office and you keep a pillow in your office for a long afternoon nap. So maybe the appeal is different in the evenings. Despite my pooh-poohing of the concept, Fogo de Chao does do one thing well, and that, thankfully, is the meat. Bacon-wrapped filet, come to mama! For a girl who is (admittedly) not the hugest carnivore, this place does make me long for the mass hunter ways of my Neanderthal forefathers. Meat on bone. nom nom nom. Though Fogo does insist they are vegetarian friendly, I would feel horrible for anyone veggie who got roped into coming here: yes, you have free reign to the salad bar, but the salad bar is rather limited. And they run out of things quickly and don't replenish it often. So its a tourist trap. And a chain. But its a fun one. At least once. I don't think your arteries would want you to make this one a regular thing.
