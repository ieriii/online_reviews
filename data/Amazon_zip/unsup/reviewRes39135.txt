Went here late, drunk, and hungry. Hit the spot. They have a delcious Goat soup. Served in a nice deep (clay?) bowl and boiling hot with plenty of spice. Good size menu, so theres likely something for everyone. I love Korean cuisine, it's a treat to have a server bring you 8-12 little plates (banchan) before your meal. Everything has it's own unique texture, color, and flavor. Service is not the greatest, but that's to be expected. Just ask for pitcher of water and you'll deal. Go late night and you're likely to run into some interesting charechters too.
