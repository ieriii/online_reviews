Ordered carry out from here a little while ago. The thin crust is very good. It had the right proportion of toppings and crust. Sauce was very good as well. Pizza was not soggy nor the toppings watery. It was hot and fresh. Price is also a plus. Good pizza that is not over priced is doubley nice(if that is a word).
