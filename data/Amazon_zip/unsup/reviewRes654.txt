My dining experience at Alinea absolutely blew me away. I have dined at some of the finest dining establishments in Chicago, but nothing compares to Alinea. It took 1, 2 months to get a table, and the place was slightly difficult to find, considering that there are no signs outside with the restaurant name (from the outside it looks like someone's house). We went with the smaller tasting menu (still had over 10 courses though), and had the wine pairing. Every single dish was like a piece of art, and there were plenty of surprises. Some of the dishes were in solid form, but once you pop it into your mouth, they immediately turn into liquid. Chef Achatz is just amazing! Service was also very good, like a well-oiled machine. As soon as we finished a dish, it was promptly removed, and soon afterwards the next course would appear. Our servers were very knowledgeable of the food and wines.  Many of the courses were really small in portion, but at the end of the night (after 4+ hours), we were stuffed. A true once in a lifetime experience.
