Delicious! My fiancee and I had dinner here last night and got the three course crab festival option. It's a great option because it hit most of the things were looking for: crab. But the waitress allowed us to substitute things (which is unusual for a fixed menu). This allowed up to get lobster bisque instead of clam chowder.  I made reservation a while in advance on http://opentable.com - we got there early and we waiting until our reservation time and were seated. I only wish we could have been seated in the main dining room instead of right by the door/bar. All in all, fantastic experience!
