Okay...I'm a little obsessed. How often is too often to come here in a given month? This place is absolutely perfect for those lazy nights of not wanting to cook, but still wanting to do that silly healthy eating thing.  Of the thousands of times I've now been here, I have only once not ordered the salad bar. How could I pass it up? Edamame? Chick peas? Zucchini? Fresh soups? Cream cheese infused with chocolate chips??? (okay, that's not healthy, I know)...awesome.  The fiance typically gets a delicious looking sandwich with amazing chips...I always secretly hope he orders them so I can sneak one or two or five.  On the days when we're really splurging (look, I had a salad, all right??), the cookie ice cream desserts are heaven. A half order is perfect for two...or one if you don't feel like sharing. Totally acceptable.
