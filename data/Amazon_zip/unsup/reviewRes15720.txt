This review isn't based on the food, since we didn't even eat. We came here to enjoy a few drinks -- apparently, an unacceptable thing, according to our waiter. When we walked up to the hostess stand, we asked for a table for three in the bar area -- since the bar itself was two deep, we thought the best option was a table in that area. So we were seated, and the waiter came by with menus. He was really friendly, at first -- asking how our day was, joking about the fact that hopefully it would get better with our experience there. When he returned, we gave our drink order. He then asked if we wanted any apps, and my friends and I decided we'd just stick with drinks. He gave a brusque "okay" then walked away quickly. Odd, but mmmkay. Five minutes later he came back and said "Are you sure you don't want an appetizer or meal? Because you're really not allowed to sit here unless you purchase food." Um. wha? Stunned, my friends and I sat there for a minute, completely mute. Then I asked for clarification -- we really weren't allowed to be there unless we ordered food? When we could probably spend MORE money than the price of a single appetizer by having two or three drinks each? Apparently, yes, that's exactly what he meant. Angry, and quite frankly, a bit embarrassed that we were essentially being told we weren't welcome there, I said to the waiter we wanted our bill and that we planned to leave. We paid, AFTER we at least enjoyed the drink we were paying for and I vowed never to return.
