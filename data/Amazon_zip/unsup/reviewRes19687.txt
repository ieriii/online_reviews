I would give it 10 stars if I could. This is my favorite restaurant anywhere and here's why: -Hamachi Carpaccio (thin-sliced yellowtail with one sliver of jalepeno, and one sliver of cilantro), cold with a rice vinegar marinade. -White Dragon (i realize how lame, but i had a dream about this roll...twice...) Just trust me, it's amazing. -volcano roll -rainbow roll is perfect. Not one weird bite, perfect size, doesn't fall apart on your plate. -BYO!!! -Delivery -Atmosphere is just classy enough -Never had a bad roll here, and there was a period of time where I ordered delivery from here at least once a week. The only bad thing I can say about Coast is that their delivery is a little slow. If they say an hour, it's an hour and 10. totally worth the wait. Whip out some pretty plates and enjoy at your kitchen table with friends. They don't disappoint.
