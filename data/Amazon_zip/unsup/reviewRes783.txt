If you live in Chicago. Is this the place to stop off to grab a dog and go? Nope. If you are from out of town, looking for a great representation of a Chicago-style dog? This is the spot! (or from the neighborhood looking for some great food!) I find it helpful to read a couple bad reviews, to help structure my good review ... Is there a wait to order? Yes. If you came alone, or with someone, you will most likely chat with someone new, or get to know who you are with a little better ..how horrible! Far too often, we scarf down a meal and move on. Here, you can take advantage of some creative menu choices, and since you waited, you can appreciate it a bit more, since it an "experience" rather than just another lunch ... Dog for $2 ...yeah! 10 out-of-the-ordinary menu choices? ...Uh huh! Colorful owner and helpful staff? ....yeppers! We need to have more "experiences", and less "just_________ "(fill in the blank). Kudos to you Doug, and all of your hotness.
