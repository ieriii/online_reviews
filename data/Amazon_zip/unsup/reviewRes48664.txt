The oysters are seriously fantastic. They're the freshest oysters I've ever had in Chicago. For the main course I got the sweetbreads. It was nice, but lacking some flavor. Would have been great with a little bit of salt. My husband got the ham chop, which was very fresh, but pretty ordinary. They have an awesome beer selection, but my husband and I opted for a bottle of sparkling wine. We got the NV Jean-Paul Bruin, "F.R.V.". It was beautiful. I'd like to go back and try the fish.
