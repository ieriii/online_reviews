A nice dining room that wasn't too stuffy. The room wasn't too crowded and it was dimly lit - but still had a laid back atmosphere.  We had the mussels in cream sauce as an appetizer. I've never seen mussels this big. The portions of pasta were a good size. I'm usually skeptical about ordering pasta at restaurants because the portions are sometimes pretty small. But this was about the right size..not too big and not too small. Plus they had a decent beer selection.
