wonderful brunch place ! came here for brunch with my mum :D I love the assortment of freshly blended juices here! (~$4-5) I also like the fact that they have daily specials and great service. I LOVE the assortment of jams that come out with the butter. Top notch :) I had the chevre omelette with sundried tomatoes, pancetta, goat cheese............ DELISH!!! droooool! I love how all the flavors come together in perfection. Kinda a little goat cheese heavy though. The red potatoes that come on the side are so flavorful. Comes with a nice refreshing slice of cantaloupe and choice of toasts. Also shared the mixed berry french toast which were really good and so soft in the center but thicker crust. I think they used some kind of bakery sweet egg bread or brioche? Whatever it was, it was delicious and made me crave french toast everyday for the rest of the week! The ambiance is relaxed and sunny. A great place for brunch in the middle of Greek town.
