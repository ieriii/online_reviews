We were heading to a friend's place for dinner and were asked to bring an appetizer so we thought a pizza cut in small squares would do the trick. I searched their area for options and Piece came up. We couldn't have been happier. The crust was spot on, I could almost eat it plain like a cracker. Despite being very busy on a Saturday night the pizza was ready when they said it would be and was a hit at the party.
