Chef comped dessert because they ran out of an entree special Pumpkin ice cream Served in a little pumpkin with cinnamon, brown sugar. Fantastic. Everything I had was superb. The place does get very crowded, so go early or make a reservation. Unfortunately, I lingered over finishing the review and 10 months later, the details are hazy. I just have a warm, fulfilled, delicious memory.
