The pho was decent, but overpriced compared to other argyle restaurants (ie Tien Giang). The experience was fine, except the service by the vietnamese waiters and waitresses. I have never experienced the urge to get up out of my chair and bitch slap our waitress, but I was pretty close. She was extremely rude when taking our orders. We had a special order and she had the attitude of "Jeez...anything else". The menu was very large and the pho was acceptable.
