I came here last night for a friend's birthday and had a great time! We had a table for 12 and were seated upstairs in a semi-private area. The actual restaurant is in a hotel and the dining area is pretty large. But since we had a large group, we had to go upstairs to another area, which was great. Since we had a large group, we asked the waiter to place orders for us and he did a great job. He explained every dish to us and brought dishes in groups (e.g. breads/cheeses, meats, seafood, etc). The bread they bring in the beginning was awesome! It's like just bruschetta (sp?) and crunchy. I don't remember the names of any of the tapas we ordered but you won't be disappointed. They had this green pepper w/cheese dip, which was awesome. We ordered sangria and I liked it even though it's sweet. The service was great and our waiter was top-notch. He was always checking in on us and asked us for permission to keep ordering more food. Oh, if you want to bring a cake for a birthday, they charge $2/person. That's annoying but it's ok. Overall, we had a great time and will return!
