Hands down one of the BEST dinners I've had in Chicago! Amazing food + great atmosphere + attentive service + affordable = 5 stars on Yelp! I wish I could keep this a secret but the Winter Delights menu is fantastic! It's tons of food...you really get alot for $20. Our party thought we should order appetizers because the Winter Delights menu wouldn't be much food but in the end we couldn't finish our meals....just such a deal! I'm going out on a limb to say that if you like salmon, Kinzie Chop House has the best salmon in the city. I know, it's a bold claim. Just try the herb crusted salmon and you'll see! We also had an amazing chocolate souffle as our dessert course and it was phenomenal. Perhaps all this stuff tasted so good because it was only $20? The service at Kinzie is great....attentive and friendly and not at all pushy. We were celebrating two birthdays and the server brought 2 extra desserts as "birthday" desserts in addition to the ones we had already ordered. Just such a nice touch. I will be back to Kinzie for sure....for another great experience!
