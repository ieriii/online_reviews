Had the pleasure of visiting this place on a sunday night. We had reservations at 6:30 and we sat right at that time. The place is small but organized and had a cool atmosphere. The food we all had was great and very tasty. The complaints I have for this place is few: Our waiter first of all was not so friendly, they were out of 5 different fish for the night and of course my first 2 selections they were out of, but oh well it was a sunday night after all, and finally it was sooo hot in there.  I'm going back again for sure to hopefully get the fish I want this time and maybe sit a t a table were the waiter is not so rude.
