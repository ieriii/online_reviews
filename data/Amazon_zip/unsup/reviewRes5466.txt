I was at the Purple Pig last week and I can't stop thinking about it. It is the best restaurant I have been to in Chicago in a LONG TIME. Better than Girl and the Goat. I loved every single thing I tried so much it was almost a competition of dishes. The chorizo stuffed olives...the peas with bacon...the turkey leg OMG...the tenderloin...the asparagus salad and that orgasmic ricotta and chocolate filled donut! Freakin' awesome! Amazing outdoor seating too which is rare since it is on Michigan Ave. Plus, it wasn't overrun with a bunch of tourists in their gym shoes and tight shorts.  Our server was also a part time doula, yoga instructor, and she wore cool earrings which added to the relaxed vibe. If there is a heaven it might be the Purple Pig.
