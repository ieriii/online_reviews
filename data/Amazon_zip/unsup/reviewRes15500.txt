I walked around like an idiot trying to find the entrance to this place. Someone had said it was right across from Big Star and I was like - Noooooooooo.... Welp, actually, it is. Yes, there are "rules" and an exclusive air about the place, but it's not as anal and pretentious as people might claim it to be. Basically, it's the antithesis of a place to come dance and pick up girls and take car bombs and sing along to journey. If that is what you thought it was and if that is what you are looking for, just turn around and go back to wrigley. It's not worth the embarrassment. Now, if you are looking for a place to take a date or somewhere to spend an evening with a few friends, this is perfect. It's romantic and intimate and unlike anywhere else I have been in Chicago. The drinks are all $12 dollars so try something different. You can get the basics elsewhere for less, so get outside the comfort zone and see where the world takes you. Violet Hour was exactly what I'd hoped it would be. I won't be making it a regular stop, but it's a great option when I am craving something different and classy. One word of warning though: don't come after a large meal. It's dark and cozy in there and I started to fade after the first 45 minutes. Woops.
