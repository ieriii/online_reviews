I love any place that gives you an amuse bouche. Service is great.  Food is creative and tasty. I had the pork belly confit. Awesome. BF had the kobe burger - lotsa flavor. Friend had the sloppy joe. Again lots of flavor. We shared the homemade sausage - the bun, the kraut and the arugula slaw were great, but the sausage kinda sucked - even though it was huge. Go and get a bunch of plates. Everything is priced well.
