Ok... So I finally broke down and tried it out. After all of the hype I thought that I would be disappointed. Ummmmm no. There's a reason why there is a line around the corner all the time. Doug has taken the hit dog to an artistic level and made some combos that you wouldn't even imagine. Even if you aren't a hot dog fan you owe it to yourself to give it a try. Maybe just wait till it warms up (for good!) since all good things come to those who wait.
