In all my years living in this area, I just tried this place a few days ago. I never had any idea what they served. Who knew... Crepes... The only restaurant visited for hearty/dinner crepes was Creperie. To compare the two is light night and day. Isosium Kafe was very nice and welcoming. We had a very nice waitress who spoke to us as soon as we were seated. She explained the menu and the specials. Then after our order was taken, we received our soup within 5 min. Then our main course came within 15-20 minutes of the soup. After eating dinner crepes, we did not want dessert crepes.  Would definitely go back!!
