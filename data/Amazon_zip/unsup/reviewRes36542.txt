I have been here twice now. My freind Joe took me here for the bday and I really enjoyed it, the aroma when you walk in is so amazing and not the overwhelming smell some places have. The second time was a bit manic. The credit card machine went down. uh oh.....yes they were slow about it and no explanation to what was going on, we went for our check and found out I had been double billed and they had already voided the second charge. The food was just as good as the first time around. I checked my account the next day and could see they charged me again. I called straight away and they had already voided it and had a receipt to fax me! fantastic. They profusely apologized and offered to work with my bank if needed. Who does that these days? When I had received my fax not even two min. later its the restaurant calling to ensure I received my fax and apologized again. Things happen. tis life, but you cannot miss the food here. It is soooo yummy. I love the selection and that it is a BYOB. I also enjoy the crowd as well. Very very alternative.
