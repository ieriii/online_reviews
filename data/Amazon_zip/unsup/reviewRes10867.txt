I'm going to give you a PIECE of my mind! This place is great! The bf lives in Ukrainian Village and this is the best pizza in the area. We usually get our pies to go, but I have eaten at the restaurant and had a wonderful experience. For me, the biggest pro for Piece is the price (alliterations abound!). When you can get a large pizza that will easily feed 3-4 people for less than $20 (depending on the toppings you get) I call that a deal!
