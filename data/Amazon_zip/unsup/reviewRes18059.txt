Temper the effusive hype, please.  I'm glad I satisfied my curiosity around Rick Bayless and XOCO, but I would only go back to make sure I didn't hallucinate. Maybe the chef branding and the line onto the sidewalk bloated my expectations, but my experience was underwhelming. The food was ordinary and pricey. The wait and crowd were stifling. I had to search to find a lone, cramped chair along the wall, where I barely had room to eat. The paper from my neighbor's sandwich basket was literally hanging over my chips and salsa. I ordered the Choriqueso with quacamole and chips. None of these items stood out from any number of torta shops I frequent at half the price. For a sandwich, chips/guac/salsa, and two craft beers, I dropped close to $30. Really?? I just can't reconcile the food with the obvious demand for it, much less considering the price. XOCO: Been there, done that, feel a little suckered, wish I had made time to try Frontera instead.
