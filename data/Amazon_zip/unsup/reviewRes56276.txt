I truly love this place from the moment you walk in you are greeted by the owner and all there staff.. The food is always super fresh I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants and let me tell you the name says it all Simply It!! I eat there three times a week and my food is always amazing, if your in Lincoln Park try this gem..
