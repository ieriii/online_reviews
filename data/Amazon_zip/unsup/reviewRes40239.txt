i always try to add something unique & NOT-yet-listed when it comes to my reviews....which means i ought to read the previous reviews. there are over 200 reviews for this joint....i am well meaning, but terribly busy....which means i won't read all of them. so the ond thing i can add that i do not think has been listed hitherto is about: their potato salad. yes, that good ol' mayonnaise based goop of sweet mush that comes as one of their panchan. nothing fancy. just your deli-type all-american picnic must-have. theirs ranks right smack among the best of the jewel-n-dominick brands. not complicated & stuffy like whole foods-n-treasure island sorts. just honest to goodness artery-clogging creaminess that brings back the eternal question yet once again: why DO korean restaurants in the u.s. serve this among their fermented wonders?
