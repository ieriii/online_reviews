I would go here ALL THE TIME if it weren't pricey. The beer list is amazing and all the servers know their stuff. I went about a year ago for an anniversary dinner with my husband. We did oysters and drinks first and then the full meal for dinner. Everything was awesome but we probably could have eaten more...portion sizes weren't huge. By 8pm it was also SUPER loud. I would recommend this place to anyone for happy hour but maybe not for an anniversary dinner. Excited to go back for oysters, pork rinds and beer!
