SORT BY DATE. READ THIS REVIEW. SEE SOMETHING IN COMMON? FOOD GOOD......SERVICE SUCKS! That is the only constant about this place. Great food...horrible service. I do not yelp, I thought this was a useless website, however i had an experience that motivated me here today. I have dined at the Pig 3 times. Once at the bar. This is what you need to know. great food, small portions. you'll drop 300 with a party of 4. However, the service is so bad its amazing that it can be categorized in the hospitality business. It should be re categorized into condescending experiences. Reminds me of getting ripped off by a mechanic without the smile.There is nothing hospitable about any of this staff. The servers and manager have always been aloof. It was as if I should thank them for allowing me to be there. In this friggin economy? Maybe if Avec, Blackbird, Bristol, Publican, and all the other restaurants that can deliver on both sides of the dining out experience. It is not enough to just offer great food at 100 bucks a head. You need to offer service just like all these other places do. Look at all the reviews people. The same reoccurring trend Great food.....Horrible service.
