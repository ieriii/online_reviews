great wagyu ribeye, lobster mashed potatoes, butter cake. the truth- you could get the same quality at another steakhouse and get a much better service and overall experience. i asked for their best seat in the house when i made reservations and got a table next to the kitchen door. Also, i dont understand the big claim that this is a vegas style supper club type resto. the look and ambience is pretty much like any other fine dining resto in chicago. only thing diffrerent is the piano at the bar. so what? the live piano music is not even in the dining room for guests to enjoy.  i live and dine in the city on a regular basis ( about 3 times a week in fancy restos) and this is no different from mortons, or gibsons, or even chicago cut steakhouse. good but not exceptional.
