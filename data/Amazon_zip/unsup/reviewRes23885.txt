I ordered take-out for my family from Lao Sze Chuan this past week, as I had been dying to try it and was right in the area. I chose the three chili chicken, the mongolian beef, pork fried rice, and pot stickers. Overall, everything was very good. The pot stickers were tasty; but nothing exceptional, the fried rice was great, and the mongolian been was probably the best I've had. However, I was expecting the three chili chicken to be spicy, and it wasn't. Regardless, it was still very good, but just not what I was expecting. I do plan to return soon and try more items on the menu, as there are so many to choose from.
