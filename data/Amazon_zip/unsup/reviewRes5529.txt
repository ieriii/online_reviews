Great place to check out in Chicago, especially if you are open to trying new foods. I would give it a five, but haven't loved a few of the dishes ... Prepare for a tight space and long wait - not the best place for groups and you won't have any privacy. The servers are enthusiastic and well informed. The menu can vary bit I recommend the bone marrow - don't forget the salt!
