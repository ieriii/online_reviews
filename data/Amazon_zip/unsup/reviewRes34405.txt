This place is pretty excellent- not sure if it's 5 star worthy, but I'm having trouble thinking of a casual spot that can compete with Yolk so it's possible I upgrade to a 5 at some point. On nice days, you can wait for your table outside while you stare at those metal legs hanging out in Grant Park, which always leads to interesting conversation when you're hungover from the night before. When they're ready for you, sit down and order the Eggs Florentine or any of their benedict-style dishes. The omelettes are enormous and their fresh fruit is awesome. I love fresh fruit. That's all I really have to say about that. Also, Luol Deng eats here and, though he probably burns far more calories playing a game of hoops than I do in a week, that has to mean breakfasts here are somewhat healthy. Ok, that's it- you're getting 5 stars.
