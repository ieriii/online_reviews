One of my favorite restaurants. The food is delicious, they have a great location, and I love getting one of the seats that overlooks Michigan Avenue. They have wonderful salads, and great sandwiches/burgers. But my favorite since I'm obsessed with chocolate as you can tell from my reviews is their molten chocolate cake. It takes some extra time to make so we usually order it with our lunch or dinner, and then it is sooooo good. YUM.
