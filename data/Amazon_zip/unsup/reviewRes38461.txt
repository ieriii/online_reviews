Ohmygod. Best deep dish pizza in the city. If you go during lunch or dinner time, you will have a wait. Deal with it. This most recent time I went, we were seated immediately although there was a wait, and the waitress was wonderful in making recomendations of how many pizzas we should get. This is always on my must do list when visiting Chi Town.
