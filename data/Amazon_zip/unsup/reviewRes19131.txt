Okay, the drinks are a little pricey, and the ketchup sucks, but holy shit. I got the Edmund Fig-Gerald burger, which is topped with goat cheese, sauteed onions, and a fig & bacon relish. I was a little bit nervous about the relish, but it turns out that figs and bacon is my new favorite combination. This burger was seriously the crack. The fries were great too; there was so much food that I brought half the burger home. I just ate the leftovers today, and even after a day in the fridge, I was standing in my kitchen exclaiming over how delicious it was. Seriously, go get this burger right now. Our waitress was great, too. Friendly, fast, and not overly chatty. I'm definitely going back to try another burger off the list!
