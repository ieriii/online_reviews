The Green Mill has been open since before Prohibition. Similar to how people wear diapers when they're first born and when they're really old, the Mill now looks just like it did in the 1920's - the epitome of the speakeasy. The Jazz Showcase beats it out for best jazz in the city, but I would rate the Green Mill #2. I've only been up here on weekend nights so I can't attest to the weekday lineup, but the weekend groups consist of the best local acts around, sometimes people with a bit of national recognition. The cover fits the bill at $12. - The Green Mill is a very smoky place. I pretty much expect to end up next to a guy with a huge cigar for some portion of the night. - If you plan on paying attention to the perfomance:     Get there early to get a seat, and do NOT sit at the bar or in a booth that is not in the front section. About the second set, people will gather like cattle in front of you and you won't be able to see shit. And people in the back talk loudly throughout the night. - If you plan on going for background music:     Sit at the bar or at a booth in the back and enjoy. But zip the mouth when they play a ballad, please. - Hang out and meet the band after the show, while the jam session trudges along. - Mad Hatter, PBR (why??), and Guinness on tap. I've only ever drank beer here so I have no idea what the drinks are like. American Express only.
