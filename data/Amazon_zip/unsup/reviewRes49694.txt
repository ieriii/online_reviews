Love it! I have only been twice, but I want to take everyone I know here. It is soooo yummy. The steaks are awesome, so moist and delicious. I had the shrimp last time....mmmm. I'm dreaming of going back. There is soo much food, you will have leftovers. Save some room for the coconut flan, sooo good! Oh, I almost forgot. There is this amazing appetizer of plantain covered in guava and cheese. yum!
