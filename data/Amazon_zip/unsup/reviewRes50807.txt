i write this review for one simple item on the dessert menu: Sea Island Benne & Honey Cake, with butter roux icing. I went on the Andersonville Dessert Crawl yesterday, and was reminded about the cake & butter roux icing. Could eat this for days. Just make me a large tub of it all, I'll pick it up every Monday out back in the alley. Simple exchange of money for goods- please no questions, just assume i'm "sharing" with others.
