My family has been eating at Giordano's for over 25 years and this location at Prudential Plaza has ruined my experience with them. My wife and I live in the loop and have had nothing but bad experiences with this location. A few of their servers are condescending and most of the staff treat us like tourists. A little over a month ago, we decided to go over to this location and have dinner, but the wait was over an hour, so we switched to take-out and waited for our pizza. It should have taken 40 minutes, but ended up being close to an hour and ten minutes before they informed us they had given our pizza away by accident. Instead of giving us a free pizza for the 2 hour wait for our pizza, they gave us 3 dollars off and sent us on our way. There was little apology for the mix-up. Once again, they treated us like tourists. Pizza is good, but service is terrible and not worth the wait and headache.
