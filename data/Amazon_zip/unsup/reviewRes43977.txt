A true neighborhood steakhouse, and a Chicago Classic. Sometimes this steakhouse is overshadowed by some of the bigwigs like Gene & G's, Gibsons and such, but it's JUST AS GOOD - maybe even better. Wonderful crabcakes, perfectly cooked, juicy steaks and fabulous desserts! Everything I want in a steakhouse! They also have recently done some renovating and also have an expanded room with more private-party tables and, on occasion, music. The servers here are also knowledgeable, and most have been there for quite awhile. A great dining experience!
