My boyfriend took me to dinner here, back in January, when the only thing that warmed me up in that area of town is hot fresh brewed coffee. I don't frequent this area, but this is a place I definitely want to find myself at more often. Their food was so excellent I had to blog about it. http://foodiequest2011.b I want to eat those french fries everyday of my life until I die. And Thank you Gilt Bar for converting me to brussel sprouts. Also, while you're there and have the chance, go downstairs to Curio Lounge and let the bartender become your drink chemist. Best Pisco Sour I've ever had in my life. You're welcome, I'm sure you'll thank me later.
