The menu here is HUGE. I love the variety but it's really hard to make a decision! I strongly suggest the ASIAN NACHOS. These things are probably one of the best things I've tasted in my life. I don't know what it is about them. I had the chicken salad w/ peanut sauce which was great. I love the big booths and service is very prompt. I've only been here for lunch and we've been in and out in about an hour and a half. Pretty touristy so if you're visiting the city I'd give it a try!
