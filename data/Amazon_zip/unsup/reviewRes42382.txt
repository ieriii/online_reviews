A #44 with extra soft tendon, and I'm a happy man. I don't adulterate the broth, but I do make a little saucer with hoisin, house chili paste (no sriracha), a whole teaspoon of black pepper, some sugar, and a drizzle of fish sauce. Dipping the meats into this sauce and into your mouth just takes you back to Vietnam. Heaven or Hell, I'll take both.
