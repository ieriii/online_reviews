You can get the huge tables in the back (and occasionally private rooms). I really like the dishes--I don't know if I've had better sze chuan food in the SF Bay Area, but here--really spicy, really savory, really delicious. Chinese menus are always complicated and difficult to get through, but go for the sze chuan classics. I haven't been disappointed yet.
