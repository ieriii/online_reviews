i would give this place 4 stars for the pizza...but the service really brings it down. i love competent people...but that is not what they seem to have.  i guess maybe i am being too picky, but i generally feel that i should not have to repeat my order 4 or 5 times when its just a large thin crust cheese pizza. it got to the point where i was trying to think of a way to EXPLAIN what i wanted, like "ok-roll the dough out thin...then put some sauce on...and then just throw some cheese on top."  i would like to try the famous deep dish pizza, but i am not sure i want to call back to place the order.
