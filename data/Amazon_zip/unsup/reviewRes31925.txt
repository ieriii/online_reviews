I was pretty disappointed when I went to the Chicago Diner for the first and probably last time with a friend. SInce I moved here from L.A. I have been lookin for that veggie restaurant that will knock me off my feet(like a Cafe Muse or Jax Vegan Cafe in West L.A.), but this place was ho-hum. Our waiter was pretty nice though. I had the Philly cheese steak I was not impressed and my friend didn't take more than 2 bites out of her grillled cheese sandwich. I guess I was just expecting more from a veggie restaurant with such "history and reputation" in Chicago. on a good note, the blueberry-banana smoothie was pretty damn good and the BBQ wings I had were not bad.
