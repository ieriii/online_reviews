1st time I came here, I was in love. Only mar to the dinner was a not-so-good beer, and very limited/nonexistent wine list. Since, no meal has quite lived up, but still excellent. Kinda pricey. the menu & the concept seem to have changed multiple times - I'd expect the menu to, but the concept went from eclectic with a strong shot of Southern to almost exclusively Southern. FABULOUS corn bread. Atmosphere will carry off a special event dressy dinner to casual meeting friends. The brunch has been getting a lot of press, but I've only been for dinner. Knowledgeable helpful wait staff.
