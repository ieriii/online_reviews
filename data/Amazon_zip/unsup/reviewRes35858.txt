I live 2 blocks away from here and this is probably hands down my favorite place in the Argyle Street area. The duck is a must have. I can usually split 1 duck with 3 other people because they give you so much with it, though if you are really, really hungry you could probably split one with another person. They carve the duck at your table and then take the carcass into the kitchen and make soup with it. They give you dumplings to eat with the duck and you also have your choice of fried rice or noodles. If you want veggies you have to order that separately but everything is so reasonably priced for what you get. The skin is just so crispy and well seasoned and flavorful. I'm making myself hungry now.
