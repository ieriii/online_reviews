Decent Chinese. Finally. This is my first chinese meal where I enjoyed every dish. Its also my first in Chicago's Chinatown. We started with soup - dumping and hot and sour were both good, then we had potstickers done very well. For entrees we had a bland mixed vegetable dish and a house lamb dish that was good but too much dried crushed red pepper sprinkled on after the fact. Nothing we ate blew me away, but I could eat any of them again. Service was good, but slow. Probably the slowest chinese place I've ever been - we there almost 2 hours and our food came out slowly in stages. It was a busy sunday night with people waiting, tho. I would definitely eat here again but I would try other chinatown spots first.
