A friend treated me to an workday breakfast at Meli, and I'll definitely be back. For those who prefer a more savory breakfast, they've got you covered with a pretty large variety of frittatas, omelets, skillets, and benedicts. For those like me, who need both the sweet and the savory, there's also a good selection of waffles, pancakes, and crepes. We had the Mana Mou skillet with Angus steak, peppers, mushrooms, onions, and cheese. It was delicious. Also had the caramel banana pancakes, which were good, but I prefer a more busy pancake style a la Bongo Room. The juice bar is great and really sets this place apart. You really can't find fresh-squeezed juice beyond the apple, grape, or orange varieties many places. I had the fresh-squeezed pear. Unsurprisingly, it was like drinking a pear ... so good. This place has already ascended my list of favorite places to breakfast or brunch. Can't wait to return.
