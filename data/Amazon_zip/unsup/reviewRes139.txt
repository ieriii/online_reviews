The experience at Alinea is almost one that you don't want to taint by bringing it to words. We took photos of our courses as they came through to try to be able to describe to others later what was going on, but it was almost like the photos didn't do any justice to the sublime amazing journey that one goes on while going through all of the courses. It's almost like a whole new world is opened up to me... yet all food is now slightly ruined and will never be as good.
