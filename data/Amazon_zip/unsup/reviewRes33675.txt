Straight up - this place is amazing. Service was wonderful. We arrived early for lunch, and didn't wait long. So I definitely recommend coming in early. Our server, Greg, is a ball of sunshine. He was attentive, cheerful and helpful. If you can, get seated in Greg's section. :) Food is wonderful. We came back for seconds before we took our flights home. The first time I came in, I had the chicken wrap was delicious and healthy too. No guilt for me! Plus the fruit? Sweet and fresh! The second time, I had an Iron Man (egg whites, bell peppers, mushrooms and avocado) omelette. It was perfect. My friends also ordered yummy traditional breakfast stuff that I'm considering a trip back to Chicago to properly try everything on the menu. In short, food is good, people are friendly - go!
