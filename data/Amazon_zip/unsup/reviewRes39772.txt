I dont care how decent the food was, the service is just rude. Changing our tables just to give it to another couple for no reason,no panchan served until your food comes, outright lying about how long an order will take ("if you order single order, it will take half an hour"; came in 10 minutes anyway). Non existent waitress, never checking to see how we were doing. Will never return.
