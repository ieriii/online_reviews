This place is by far the best pizza in Chicago. I've eaten in once and I've carried out once. Both times, the pizza has been amazing. The pizza does take a bit longer than most other places, so if you want fast and mediocre pizza, go somewhere else. Definitely order the pan and load it with toppings. We had the pan with mushrooms, pepperoni, and black olives and it was nothing short of perfection. It is very filling though, so I'm not usually able to eat more than a piece and a half. The large for two people is way more food than you will need, but I was excited for the leftovers the next day. Oh, and the re-heated leftovers were almost as good as the pizza was the first time. Definitely try this place.
