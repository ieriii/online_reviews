Way back when, Hot Dougs was one of my first finds on yelp. Back before the fire. Back before the new location. Back before all the people in line. Oh wait...there has always been a line... These puppies are worth waiting for though. Who would have thought you could get so creative with encased meats? Doug. You gotta love Doug! It's hard to decide what to try so you will be obligated to come back, stand in that line and try more. Do not forget a side of fries.
