After a fun day at the Adler, we stopped by XOCO to get some items to take home, and boy oh boy am I glad we did!! We got more DELICIOUS hot chocolate, a few of the Mexican chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter topping and some of the roast duck caldo. All I can say is OMG was that AWESOME!!!!! That soup tasted so good. I never had anything like it. One of the great joys of life is to discover wonderful new tastes and the caldo surely was one of those pure pleasures. I can't wait to try more items in the future. Bravo!!!!!
