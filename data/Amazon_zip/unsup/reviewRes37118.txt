This is such a cute market! I absolutely loved it! I have passed Fox & Obel quite a number of times and finally took a look around. They are more expensive then your typical grocery store ($5.99 for a 12 pack of Coke) but their quality is also superior to your local Jewel or Dominick's. My friend and I had a fun time going up and down the aisles looking through everything. They have a lot of special dessert treats but I knew I had to get something chocolatey to try. I ended up getting a devil's food cupcake with cream cheese frosting and it was very good! Moist cake and very rich & sweet frosting. Not bad for $3 but I wish I got another one as well! I will definitely be back for more and hit up this market when I'm in the area.
