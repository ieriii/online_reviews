As someone who is not typically a fan of Italian, I really enjoyed this place. The service was a little inconsistent, but the food was great and the back patio was beautiful. Probably not a place I'll frequent, but a good go-to when you're in the mood for some good wine and heavy duty, delicious carbs.
