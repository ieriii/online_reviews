Hot Doug's is consistently one of the best restaurants in Chicago. The reason why this place is so good is because the specials (and when you go, you'll want to order at least two sausages off the specials menu) are some of the most inspired dishes I've ever seen in my life. Don't waste your time on the hot dogs and regular sausages. I'm sure they're all good, but they're nothing like the specials. As of July 2, 2010, here are just a few things on the menu at Hot Doug's: Rosemary and Garlic Smoked Chicken Sausage with Sweet Chili-Garlic Mustard and Cheese-Stuffed Marinated Hot Peppers Spinach, Mozzarella and Pepperoni Pork Sausage with Pesto Genovese, Roma Tomatoes and Gran Cascina Pecorino Cheese Hot Doug's BLT: Bacon Sausage with Avocado Mayonnaise, Iceberg Lettuce, Cherry Tomatoes and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese Once in a while, you'll get a special that seems somewhat lacking - either the flavors promised in the sauce will not jump out all that much, or the sauce will seem flat, or something. But even then the food will seem pretty good. And then it's great, as it was for example when they were selling the Teuben (a Reuben sandwich as a sausage), it'll blow your mind. Hot Doug's is cash-only, so keep that in mind when you go. I honestly think the ideal thing to get is two specials per person, and then if it's Friday or Saturday, split some of the duck fat-fried french fries. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to drive up to the northwest side of Chicago.
