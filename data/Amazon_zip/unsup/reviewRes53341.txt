I come here everytime I come back to the chi to visit my parents, Alinea is PERFECT! The service is impecable, the wines are amazing, the hamachi is my absolute favorite dish, and the chocolate mousse is to die for! The full bar is a plus! The interior is fantastic, there is nothing negative I could say, it's perfect!
