Great food, service and ambience! I've been here for dinner and lunch and both times have been equally thrilling. The expansive dining hall offers an exciting backdrop for fun conversation, drinks and delicious food. The chefs really succeed at reviving a lot of traditional latin dishes; almost everything on the menu is delicious, just ask the waiter what they would recommend and you'll be in for a surprise!
