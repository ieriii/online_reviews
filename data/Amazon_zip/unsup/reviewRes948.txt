This place is soooo good. It is so out of the way, but it is worth the walk and bus ride. The hot dogs were smoked and grilled. The flavors of the bread and toppings were just perfect. If you wanna try some unique hot dogs and sausages this place is the place to go to. Froi Gras hot dog and spicy sausages ahhhh so yummy. I had four dogs and they were under 10 bucks sooo good. Italian, Polish, Chicago style, Spicy OMG so worth the walk.
