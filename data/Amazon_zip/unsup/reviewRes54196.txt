I'm vegan, so I love their veggie tacos and killer guacamole here. The oatmeal shakes are also very good. This place is great, you can eat like a king for very little money. As busy as they always are, it's amazing that the owner always remembers my name. Its just a great find in the bucktown neighborhood. I've lived here for over 17 years and unfortunately only discovered this place about 5 years ago. It's so good I've heard people want to keep it a secret. Also, if you come definitely get the mashed potato tacos...awesome.
