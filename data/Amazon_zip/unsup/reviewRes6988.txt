You know what the Italians say....YUMMMMMMMY! The first thing you notice here is that it's a small, intimate place. That's become my key indicator lately of a great dining experience. This typically leads to great service, and it did. Our waiter was cool. Even a bit on the sarcastic side...my kind of guy. As for the food, WOOT! They nailed it. Authentic food and huge portions. We all ended up trying each others dishes because they all looked so good. I had some of the greatest Lobster Ravioli of my life...and I don't even like Lobster. Delicious. I had some spicy sausage and pasta and a gnocchi dish. Tiramisu finished us off. Everything was terrific except for the Caprese. It does LOOK like it would be amazing...it's just ok. They have a good wine list and full bar. There is also a check-in special from Yelp! Free espresso or cappuccino. Nice touch. I can't wait to go back for their Monday deal where you get way too much food for not a lot of money. Perfect. I will definitely be getting the Lasagna when I return as I saw it last time and haven't been able to get it out of my mind since. Make reservations on Open Table.
