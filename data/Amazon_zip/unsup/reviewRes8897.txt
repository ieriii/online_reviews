This place is fabulous! We were initially looking for a Thai place in the area but it was no longer there. We drove down the street and saw this place and decided to stop. I'm so glad we did. Everything is so fresh and delicious. It was pretty slow when we arrived but soon after it picked up. The hummus is honestly the best I've had in a long time. I could have eaten a pile of that for lunch. I did order the salmon kabob and it was incredible. The outside was crunchy and the inside was moist and tender. And the dill rice??? WOW! Hubby had the ground beef kabob and while it wasn't my cup of tea, he really enjoyed it. Our son had the chicken kabob and it was moist, flavorful and delicious. Definitely try this place out. You'll love it.
