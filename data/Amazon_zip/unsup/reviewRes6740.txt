Yum! Everything we had was excellent. The space looks great and all the employees were helpful and enthusiastic. The one questionable thing to me is the pricing - we were confused by how some small dishes were as expensive as the pizzas when all are of such high quality. In the end it doesn't matter at all though b/c for a decent price you can get some of everything, great value in my opinion. Everything was very well presented and just fantastic. They really thought about the menu and the finishing touches put it over the top. For the wine lovers its an even better bargain as you can pay retail plus 7 bucks for corkage.  You should definitely try this restaurant!
