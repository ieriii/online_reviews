The one-star rating is for the service, not the food. So today I learned that I can enjoy a place like Sultan's for ten (!) years, but that can end pretty abruptly with one incredibly rude employee. The staff here used to be friendly, and it helped make it such a cool place to go for a cheap and tasty meal. What happened? I see by some other recent reviews that I'm not alone in being treated so rudely. It's really a shame, but I won't be going back.
