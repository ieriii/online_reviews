I thought the food was very good, the service slow but OK and the wine selection good. So why the low review? The price which I thought was too high. I don't think it represents good value for the price. If one takes price out of the equation, the restaurant rates 4 stars. We were a party of 4 and had pasta, salad, sea bass, a fish stew and calamari. We also split one dessert. All of us liked the food.
