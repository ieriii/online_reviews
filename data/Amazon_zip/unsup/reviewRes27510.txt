I'm glad I asked if the chips were vegan because they cook them in the same fryer as their meat. Regardless, they had jicama sticks for the guacamole which was super good, and the tamales are vegan and they are very good. I usually don't like tamales but these are small so the filling-to-cornmeal porportion is perfect. Really great find for Chicago.
