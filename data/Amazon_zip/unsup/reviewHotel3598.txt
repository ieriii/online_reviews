Okay, I am a Hilton point whore, but that aside, I still love this hotel. In fact, I love it so much that the fella and I came right after we got married to celebrate! Usual great service at check in (being a HH Diamond probably helps) and congratulations on the nuptials. We had a beautiful room overlooking the lake and there was a bottle of chilled champagne and a box of chocolates with a note from the manager waiting for us in our room. In fact, they later sent a second bottle of champagne up! Yes, the Drake will get you drunk as hell on your wedding day, how very thoughtful! Good restaurants, nice bar with hilarious bartenders, great staff, wonderful (recently redone) rooms, ambiance, ambiance, ambiance. They went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay, we'll definitely be back every year on our anniversary. It's a Chicago classic, period.
