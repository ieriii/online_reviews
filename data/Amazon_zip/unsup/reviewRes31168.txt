Really .. the best meat-free reuben i have ever had. Giving up meat 26+ years ago wasn't really that difficult, but i did miss my favorite deli sandwich - being a native new yorker - it's the reuben. I have tried all the variations in NYC, all around the country, tried making my own .. nothing really compares to what they do here at the Chicago Diner. Totally exceeded any expectations on the reuben-front. The sweet potato fries were OK. That is really all I can say about them, I read a lot of reviews here saying how great they were and had high hopes and they didn't wow me. They were just kinda plain old fries made with sweet potatos. not special. The "hot wings" app was really REALLY good - good texture (a little firmer than expected but still good) the flavor was amazing and the non-dairy ranch was really great, and i think the dips and sauces here at the Chicago Diner are what make it excel - they totally nail the way things should taste without using the bad ingredients. Mac and cheese- another "also tried" .. but wasnt really wowed. it was good and it was vegan.. i guess that helps. If i lived closer this would be the place i went to all the time. Funky interior, really nice staff, reasonable amount of wait time, quick service. awesome food. what more could you ask for?
