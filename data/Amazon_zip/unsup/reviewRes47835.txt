We went here for a dinner reception last night. Zed451 is absolutely beautiful and the atmosphere is just great. The food was also delicious and included a great selection of cheeses and meat. The staff was friendly and professional. I would love to go back and have dinner with my husband here and see how that experience compares versus the more formal setup that we experienced last night...
