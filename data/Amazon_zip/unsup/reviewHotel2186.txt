I would never pay full price for this hotel, but Hotwire got us a last minute deal for Lollapalooza, when hotels were tough to come by, so it was great for the price. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable for 2, the flat panel TV was large (32" or bigger), and everything else seemed to be up to par with a nice hotel. The location is the one thing it really has going for it. Right on Michigan Avenue, a few blocks from the river, you'll get to pretty much everything from here on foot if you want to. But then there's the downsides. The "high-speed internet access" was a $13 per day wireless setup. When a hotel costs $350 per night for a room (full price, not what I paid), I'd expect that the internet access be reasonably priced if not free. $13 is ridiculous. And it wasn't all that "high-speed" either. On top of that, everything in the room had a price. Want a bottled water? That'll be $6.95 please. Forgot your toothbrush? Only $3 for this generic brush-on-a-stick. Grab a Coke out of the "Refreshment Center?" For $3.75, no problem! The drapes definitely didn't keep the light out as well as I'd hope, just as someone else mentioned. The towels were average, there was no fan in the bathroom so the mirror was always fogged up, and the remote for the TV was near useless. A few people mentioned that the water in the shower/sink would constantly change temperature, and I noticed the same thing in my room (I just love having my warm shower turn into a scalding hot shower). I wouldn't stay here again unless Hotwire assigned it to me.
