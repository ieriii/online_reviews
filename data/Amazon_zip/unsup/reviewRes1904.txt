I'll admit that I'm not the biggest hot dog fan, but Hot Doug's has the potential to make me a born again hot dog lover. There are so many types of encased meats to choose from that for a Hot Doug newbie, you could be a bit overwhelmed. But, you can't go wrong with the ever faithful Chicago Dog and the Corn Dog (my first and definitely a good one).  My biggest "beef" was that it's so far from the train that getting to this place is pretty hard if you can't find a ride. But still, if you are looking for a Chicago tradition I would definitely recommend....just stear clear of lunch time and have cash ready (no credit/debit).
