I was planning to stay at The James and instead opted for this property after coming across a cheap rate at http://www.getaroom.com. My only gripes: my room was small and the service was a little slow. The food we bought at the restaurant didn't disappoint! I didn't have a chance to use the gym (too busy checking out the shops along Magnificent Mile), but my cousin said it was worth checking out. This is by no means a luxury hotel, so cross this one off the list if that's what you're after.
