Enormous Beer List, Fantastic Burgers, at a great price. The wait staff was attentive and very knowledgeable about the product. The only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the lack of a dessert menu. I had the Sir Loin a burger topped with sliced sirloin and horseradish aioli, and it was worth a second trip for sure.
