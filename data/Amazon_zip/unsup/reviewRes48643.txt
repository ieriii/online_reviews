As a huge fan of both Avec and Blackbird, I had been looking forward to the (over-hyped) opening of this place for several months, but I gotta say I was a bit disappointed. It specializes in beer, oysters, and pork, and since I'm not a fan of oysters or beer, I can only comment on the pork. While nothing we tried was bad, nothing was really amazing either; the flavors were very one note, without the complexity you'd find at either of their two sister restaurants. We tried the steak tartare (the best of the bunch with perfectly cooked frites and a side of pickles; a fairly traditional preparation with a raw quail egg on top; raw egg + raw beef = yum; no, really); the potted rillettes (basically pulled pork that you spread on toast points; EXTREMELY salty -- which I liked -- but my partner found off-putting); the whitefish fry (good, but lacking in fish; again, EXTREMELY salty; brine, perhaps?); and the blood sausage (average; came with giardinera which were more of a sweet pickled variety, than the typical spicy kind) The service was good, even if our waiter was a little snarky. The manager (owner?) came by and asked how everything was, which was nice, but we couldn't help noticing that his pants at the bottom were showing about three inches of leg (Hey, when's the flood?!). As for the decor (supposedly German beer hall chic), I was also disappointed. I'm guessing they spent some money on this place, but it doesn't look it. The lighting is full of these hanging globes which are in every bad Lakeview studio apartment. They covered the ceiling in textured wallpaper, but it resembles a bad popcorn ceiling--not the look I'm sure they were going for. The bathrooms, however, are cool and worth checking out.  Also, enough already with the damn communal tables!!! I know it's trendy, but I don't want to sit next to strangers. There, I said it.
