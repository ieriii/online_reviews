Best restaurant in Chicago, hands down. This review is coming a year after I actually went with my girlfriend, and we still can't stop talking about it. Yes, it's pricey, but well worth the experience. Instead of having a sexy dinner somewhere and going to a show/sporting event/night of binge drinking after, you can spend the same amount on a night at Alinea for a perfect experience. The 12 course tasting with wine pairings left us very satisfied.
