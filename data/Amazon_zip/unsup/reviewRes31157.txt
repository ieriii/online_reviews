We went for my b'day on New Year's Eve. Would have liked a little later time but that was our fault for not booking earlier. They salad was OK, steak and tuna were excellent and the lobster/truffle gnochi was decadent. Nice touch was a slice of chocolate cake with chocolate sauce saying "Happy Birthday" and my name that was unsolicited by my lovely wife who made the reservation. A lovely evening.
