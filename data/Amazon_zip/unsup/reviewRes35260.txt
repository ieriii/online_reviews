It's been quite some time since I've written a review, sorry, my avid followers. :( I just had dinner at Sun Wah the other night and thought this would be perfect for my return review. This place is huge but if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, your best bet is to make a reservation. I've been a couple times where I've forgotten to make one and had good luck, but don't chance it. You'll see you have tons of options on the menu, so much, but I'm going to say what most Yelpers have...get something with duck. I've gone with the bbq roast duck almost every time I've eaten here- ok, every time except the last because apparently I said "pork" not "duck" and my date, knowing how much I wanted it didn't even tell me ;), but I digress. The duck has always been juicy and full of flavor. Don't pass it up! Another favorite of mine is the vegetable pan fried rice noodles. The noodles are slightly, but perfectly crispy. And I could probably eat them every day. :-/ The service can sometimes be slightly slow, but as long as you're enjoying your meal and the company you're in, it should only matter to the people waiting to take your table. :) I have to say I'm almost ashamed that I haven't come here with a couple more people and ordered the entire duck to be sliced table-side and used for multiple, delicious dishes. That being said, who's going with next time? :)
