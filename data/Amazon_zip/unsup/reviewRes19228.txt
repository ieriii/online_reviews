As a vegetarian, I probably have no business reviewing or even liking Xoco. But what the hell, I can try! Their beans are cooked in pork fat so we ate pretty much all their mushroom dishes without the beans. The waitstaff were nice enough to add extra veggies and cheese for us. Everything was delicious. The guac was amazing!!! We topped it off with some hot chocolate (Aztec I think). It was an afternoon well spent.
