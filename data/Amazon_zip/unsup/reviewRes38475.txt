This place would be great if the bar were about two or even three times bigger! It gets so crowded on the weekend that you can barely get in the door, let alone get to the bar or get a table! The beer selection is great - I admit I haven't heard of the majority of them, but my beer connoisseur friends seem to know which ones are good. Though eating mussels at the bar weirds me out a bit, the mussels are really good. All and all a fun spot, but I just wish it weren't so freakin' cramped all the time...
