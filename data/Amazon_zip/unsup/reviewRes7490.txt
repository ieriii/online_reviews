My wife took me here for my birthday. I love barbecue and this place is a bit more upscale than your typical bbq joint. The atmosphere is really nice, especially when you sit outside. I ordered the q3, ribs and two pulled meats and a side. I had the pulled pork and the brisket. We also ordered cole slaw and mac & cheese. The food comes with four different sauces for dipping. Over all, the meal was good, especially the ribs. The one down side of our dinner was the temperature of the meats. The pulled pork and brisket were cold. We don't like to return food so I didn't say anything. I took the left overs to work a couple days later and heated it up and it tasted even better then at the restaurant. I would definitely go back and have the ribs. And this time, they better be hot!
