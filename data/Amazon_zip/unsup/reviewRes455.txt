One of the best eating/dining/service experiences of my life. My friend Shelley and I dined here a couple years back before they got famous and we did a 7 course tasting menu, took 4 hours and the service from the staff was amazing. They weren't stuffy, had some fun with us, we had fun with them. Pricey, worth it. Good wine pairings, we did the whole shebang. As usual, asked for a tour of the kitchen. Pristine.  The orange blossom aromatherapy pillow on my plate (and then telling me to breathe in deeply) was a bit much, but I'll forgive them. :)
