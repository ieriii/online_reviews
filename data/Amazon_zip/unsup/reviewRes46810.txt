I live a block away from Uncommon Ground and it's quickly become my go-to place for a nice, quiet and relaxing dinner. The decor is warm and inviting, it feels like you're having dinner and drinks in my parent's comfy up-scale living room... a fireplace warming the room, lots of dark leather couch type seating and wood everywhere the eye can see. The menu is solid -- comfort food -- steak frite, mac n' cheese, bacon wrapped meatloaf. The service has always been outstanding -- I'm a little confused as to why UG isn't constantly packed to the gills... but, I'll take it, as I love being able to get a seat whenever I want. I highly recommend you try Uncommon Ground, it's Midwest cuisine at it's finest. =)
