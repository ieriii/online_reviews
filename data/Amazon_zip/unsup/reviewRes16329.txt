"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked. "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad." "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice. "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here." This place is cool. It has a very trippy entrance located flatly along the wall of the building and the inside is intimately dark with a hushed ambiance. It does sort of feel like you are going in to Wonderland and you could easily forget that you are in modern day Chicago. Not only is it easy to lose yourself in your glass, but in time as well. You will be surprised how fast time is moving when comparing drinks with your friends and pondering over the menu for what to get next. While the prices of the cocktails are expensive, you do get a stiff but very tasteful drink. The music has always seemed to fit, but I'll admit that the first time I went, I heard Danzig being played overhead in this "classy" lounge, and I wondered what in the hell I got myself in to. Be prepared by not wearing sandals and don't plan on using your cellphone while inside. You may have to wait to get in, but it will be worth it. Don't forget, "Read the directions and directly you will be directed in the right direction."
