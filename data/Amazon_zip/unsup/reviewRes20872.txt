i've returned 3 more times because i'm determined to eat my way through the entire menu. yesterday it was the quest for caldo which is served after 3.  i had the roast duck. the broth was reminicent of bill kim's (of urban belly) broths. tons of duck, epazote, skinny radish. SURPRISINGLY light. i know rick has been dining at takashi a lot lately, i'm starting to wonder if takashi & bill kim & morimoto are inspiring his soups. well done !!! i returned again with goodies for home, so i purchased 3 tortas. i killed the woodland mushroom with goat cheese & probably a head of garlic. you WILL smell for hours after this one. this seems to be one of the highest rated sammie which is why i had to try it even though without any meat i was skeptical. i want to try to copy it at home. awesome flavor combo! vegetarians will be SO happy. i got the queso/chorizo torta. it reminded me of the frontera grill's HIGHLY addictive queso fundido. that's because rick's "made-in-house" dry chorizo has a very specific flavor. the cheeses are also home made as are the awesome salsas. tasty & delightful. the last sammie was the braised short rib with pickled jalapenos. and darn it, it really got me thinking.....how can this taste THIS good??? all cultures do short rib differently. the cooks that understand the short rib can make it taste like you never want to eat anything else. this torta blew me away. i wasn't expecting it. i don't know much about short rib in regional mexican cuisine. next time i want to try the abhogada which really needs to be eaten there because it's swimming in sauce & requires a fork & knife. wait. that's not all. the soft-serve topped with maple/bacon crumbles & salted caramel.  damnit.
