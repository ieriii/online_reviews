I started eating take out at Sushi X a few years back and it was SUPERB. I ordered from them, even though Bob San was just a block away, because I truly loved their quality of fish, packaging and service. Then, I finally came to the restaurant when I moved closer and it was a huge thumbs down. The bad decor was a total turn off. I had not been back for over 6 months because of that, as well as, the fact that Butterfly Sushi opened and it was AT LEAST $3 cheaper per roll, had a friendly staff and livelier decor. I came in tonight because I heard from a friend that the Sushi Happy Hour (Sunday through Wednesday) was a great deal. Unbeknown to me, they changed the special. I learned later. After my meal I once again realized that there is a good reason why I do not frequent this place- The fish to rice ratio is not worth the price, the decor still stinks, and the waitstaff is not friendly or informative and they constantly try to force you into buying more food. All reasons why they are never packed and Butterfly always is. Not interested in going back. I'd rather wait in line at Butterfly than come here.
