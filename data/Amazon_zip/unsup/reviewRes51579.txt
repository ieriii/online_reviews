I have been to this place a lot however it doesn't have the best quality of steak. My boyfriend ordered the enchilada, and I ordered the taco meal. Both of us ordered steak and it was very tough and chewy. I usually order to chicken because it tastes great. If you go here don't order the steak instead go for a different type of meat. The serve was okay and they need to get the food out quickly.
