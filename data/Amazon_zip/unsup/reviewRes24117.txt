The vegetarian burrito here is amazing. I've had trouble moving past it to try all of the other delicious items on the menu. I was so jazzed when they started delivering. I also really like dining in. It's BYOB, during the summer they have a nice little outside seating area and the service is always really good. They are friendly and just as excited about the food as I am, which I love. They have this salsa verde that's out of this world. It's so spicy, but for some reason I can't make myself stop eating it. It's usually pretty packed, and sometimes if you come in too late they will be out of certain items, but it's just because it's so great.
