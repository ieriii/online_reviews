About two weeks ago I was like a poor little 12 year old with a couple of throat issues and I couldn't really eat much so I tuned to XOCO for some delicious soup for takeout.  I tried two soups: Shortrib Red Chile Soup: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula, lime and Pork Belly Vermicelli (Fideos): Crispy-tender pork belly, toasty-tender noodles, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, salsa negra I highly recommend the Pork Belly Vermicelli. Holy flavor explosion. There's the perfect amount of each ingredient. I was in heaven. And because I love trying new foods, not being able to swallow isn't gonna stop me from taking a bite from some other things that were ordered. The Pork Belly Torta (Weds Special) is absolutely amazing! The guacamole is pretty good too.
