Been waiting for months for the opening and finally it was a great experience when it opened. Have been there twice already in the late evening and it has been packed. Are the owners thinking of expanding? I hope. The place itself is very nice inside, with a fireplace in front of the waiting area; makes the place cozy and enjoyable. The wait staff is very friendly and are happy to get you a beer even if you cannot get close to the bar tender; its been that full. I have had Cross of Gold, Eugene, Workingman Mild and Bottom Up Belgian Wit and really enjoy them, especially the Cross of Gold. I even thought about joining their Mug Club, will keep thinking about it though, maybe in the Spring. I was there with my cousin who enjoyed very much the Anti Hero IPA with a Forest Burger. She also enjoyed the place very much. The customized wood work also adds a nice touch to the place. I will go back cause would like to try the food but better to do it during off peak hours cause the wait time for a table is long.
