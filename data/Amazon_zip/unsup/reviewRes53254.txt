I dined here this past Saturday and was saddened to see that it did not live up to my expectations. I had dined there before and had pleasant expereiences but it was just horrible this past Saturday. We had reservations for 7pm and we did not get seated at our table until 8pm. The hostess was less than apologetic about the situation and kept chalking it up to a party being at the table since 4:30pm. Once we got seated at our table we quickly learned why a table would have been there since from 4:30pm to 8pm...the food took FOREVER to arrive at our table. We seriously should have ordered while we were waiting for our table and the food would still have not come out right away...that's how long it took. Appetizers took over an hour to come out and let's not even get started with the entrees! The owner came by our table to ask how everything was and when we expressed our dismay at the amount of time it was taking for the food to come out his response was "That happens sometimes but I guess you gotta run a business to understand that"...Really??? That's not a positive comment to make to people who are starving and who have been waiting for over 2 1/2 hours to eat already! I understand that there are delays sometimes but it was just ridiculous this night and the staff did not seem apologetic at all, they did not seem to care at all. Very disappointed but this and will not be going back anytime soon!
