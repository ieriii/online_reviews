This place is a lot of fun. I've never seen a Greek restaurant that offers up tons of little dishes like tapas, but that's what we ended up doing. Got 5 dishes to share for 2 people. Flaming cheese is really just for the fun of the show. The actual product is not all that tasty, more like seared mozzarella that's a lot cheesier-smelling. Gyros are a MUST-TRY. They do a great job with slicing the meat very thin and searing it just right to an almost crisp texture. Grilled octopus was tender, though not particularly interesting in taste. We were hoping to get baby octopus, but they were out. Dandelion greens are an acquired taste as they are quite bitter, but we really enjoyed getting some cooked greens in our system. Hot lima beans were decent - again, appreciated the addition of veggies in our diet after a lot of meat-bingeing, but it's not overly special.
