One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It's not trendy but it's modern, beautiful setting, and wonderful food. I'm so tired of the crowd trekking out to the next hipster place centered around smoked meatstuffs. It's the kind of place you'll return to, where you don't have to wait usually but a reservation is a good idea. It transports you to another era without seeming like a theme restaurant. The French-Vietnamese food is light and different from the norm, elegant and worth returning to try more items. I also am a sucker for a their drink list, but here you don't feel like you're at Trader Vic's but rather could be in Indochine having one back in the day. It's just perfect! I would recommend it for a date (romantic) but have even gone with the family and it's just as nice for that. The somewhat quiet atmosphere makes it fine for older people who have trouble hearing, without making it seem as though everyone is eavesdropping. Upstairs has an even more intimate seating area and bar.
