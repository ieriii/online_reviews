Simply It is simply fantastic. As someone who works in the area, it has quickly become my favorite lunch option. The Vietnamese sandwiches are delicious and filling, come with a fresh sliced orange, and cost....wait for it... $4.50. It's a shame that people regularly spend $6-8 bucks at the nearby sandwich spots for something less tasty. On a cold day, I crave their Pho soup. I have yet to have better Pho anywhere, and I grew up on Argyle. I also enjoy the smoothies. It puzzles me that people have complained they're too sweet. The blend the fruit right in front of you, and without adding any sugars or sweeteners. They're delicious and refreshing.But what's really got me to 'yelp' about this place is the service. Simply It's staff epitomizes the friendly attitude you look for in a neighborhood restaurant. My greatest hope is that the neighborhood continues to support them when Children's Memorial moves next year, and they need it the most.
