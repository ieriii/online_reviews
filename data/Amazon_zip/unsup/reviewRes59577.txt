My friends and I love going here since it's basically down the block from work. The kalbi is always great...bacon is also good but I won't recommend putting more than 1 order on the grill, and neither will San Soo, because your lung will be cluttered up with smoke when you're about done with the first order. Minuses are, a bit worse than average service (they basically just bring you food and sort of give you a hard time if you try to modify your order, esp if you don't speak Korean), and they charge for rice. Pluses are, they open 24 hours 7 days a week, a lot of condiments (come with the entrees), and very good food (i personally don't think the marinated meat is bland and i tend to like very salty food).
