Very authentic Indian food that tastes great without costing too expensive. The wait service was very accommodating; two of us showed up at 615pm, and we ended up waiting over an hour for our third guests. The restaurant had no issue with sitting us while we wait for the late party on a Thursday night. A short walk from the Red Line is a big plus as well. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants great Indian food.
