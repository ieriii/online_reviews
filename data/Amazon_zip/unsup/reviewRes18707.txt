worth the wait. and come with friends so you can share (attempt to share) some churros and each others dishes. there's a line - always- so don't worry, you have time to make a decision and change it a million times. everything sounds phenomenal...and everything actually is. always order some chips & guac to start. i'm a fan of the daily special tortas myself, but many of the other dishes are fantastic as well. the flavors are just amazing...soup is fantastic if it's chilly outside! the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is fun, the food is consistent. great stop-in for lunch or a mid-afternoon meal if you want to avoid lines.
