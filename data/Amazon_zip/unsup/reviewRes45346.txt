Fantastic place! It's been awhile since I've been here, but this is one great place- good food & an incredible beer selection- not many places like this in Chicago! Top notch from start to finish. The ambience & layout reminds me of a Calfornia one-off (maybe the rhino place on Coronado?.....) rustic, homey and contradictory upscale vibe with down to earth food with a good specialty beer line-up.  I got the Elliot Ness (beer), Wilde burger, sweet potato fries and a bite of my friend's farmhouse chicken. Finished off with an Apple Crumble for desert- too many good ones to choose from! My friends are jealous I eat that much, but as long as calories= calories out....... One of the city's best restaurants, that I have regretfully not made it to lately- maybe because I don't go to Lakeview much, but now will make an effort to go again soon!  Only complaint was that the food took a little long- but they were packed, so it's understandable. Highly recommended if you want a great meal!
