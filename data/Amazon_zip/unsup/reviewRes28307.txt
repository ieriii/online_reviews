I was pretty impressed with Mr. Elliot's fine restaurant. We were seated promptly amidst the aroma of the "jasmine and rosemary" water (I was corrected, it is not tea) pot. I had a really great cocktail, something along the lines of rum with pumpkin spice and froth. The main course left a little something to be desired, but I would still say it is worth the money and fit for a foodie.
