Wonderful Thai food and excellent sushi. This place has the VERY BEST crab rangoon I have ever had. Those little crunchy purses of crab and cream cheese (amongst a few other ingredients) are something that I have come to crave! I have had countless dishes on the menu and tried oh so many sushi rolls and they are continually very good. Some mild to moderate flaws here or there however. One bad Blue Crab sushi roll experience, vegetables undercooked more regularly than I'm happy with, and delivery times that can exceed 85 minutes for relatively simple orders to a location only a mile or so away. But overall they have earned my repeated business for what they do right. Friendly service, nice atmosphere, BYOB, OUT OF THIS WORLD MANGO in the mango sticky rice desert at times when mangoes are out of season (how do they do it?!? Its sweeter than sugar!!), and all-in-all consistently good food. This place is doing sooooo many things right that it warrants a place on my "Favorites in Chicago" list. A must try!!!
