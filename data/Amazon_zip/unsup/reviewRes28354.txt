After flying into Chicago on a Friday afternoon, my girlfriend and I dropped by the Frontera Grill later that day to see what all the fuss was about. Since we've watched Mr. Bayless cook food on PBS for a while, and it was reported that he had cooked for the President at a state dinner earlier that week, our expectations were very high. We cabbed it down and arrived around 7:30 p.m. -- prime dinner time. As expected, the lady behind the counter took our name down and said it would be two and a half hours before we'd be seated. Just come back in two hours, she said. So, we decided to walk around for a while and come back and get drinks at the bar. After 45 minutes, we checked back in, received a buzzer and went to the bar (which was still full). To our surprise, the buzzer went off after only 15 minutes. So, the actual wait was only around one hour. Good thing, since we were told to come back in two hours?? Anyway, onto the food. The margaritas were excellent (the blue agave was superb, the topolo was ok). The side dishes (we had the sopes and the ceviche) were fantastic. The main course was also wonderful (I had the asada brava - flank steak with a sweet corn tamale). Given all the expectations, it was difficult to see how the restaurant could have lived up to the hype, but it certainly did. the one thing I would say is that the portions (both food and drink) could have been just a tad bigger for the price. Other than that, it's definitely the best Mexican restaurant I've been to, and perhaps one of the best ever.
