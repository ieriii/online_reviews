As Martha would say, "What a dump!" Although not without its charm, the Tremont is old and with the apparent exception of the penthouse suite described below, not very well kept. The elevator creaks and makes thumping noises. My room smelled mildewy, the wallpaper was peeling, and the paint was chipped. The AC (which had an "on" setting and an "off" setting) pumped dusty air through a rusty vent surrounded by a corona of water stains in the ceiling. At 11:30 pm, I awoke to the sound of a door slamming over and over and over again. I staggered out into the hall to confront whatever ingrate was making the noise only to find that the elevator was stuck on the floor and the door was opening and slamming shut. During my three night stay, my key card magically deactivated four times. Don't be fooled by their website, which lists room amenities that you may find within. There is no room service, no in-room coffee pots, and when I asked about the promised in hotel "fitness center," the desk clerk said I could go to the Westin Hotel around the corner and, once they called the Tremont to verify my status as guest, use theirs. The TV in my room offered a dim, warped, off-color view of the five available channels. There are no window screens and a card on the desk cautioned that opening a window would lead to bugs, attracted by the lights, flying into the room. Because I am soft, I gave the place three stars because the employees are polite, helpful, and well-practiced in coping with angry guests. The lobby is also gorgeous and I had a pretty decent view of the Hancock out of my window. It is also cheap as hell for a hotel off Michigan Ave. Still, if you are looking for a hotel with more comfort and less character, and you can afford it, stay somewhere else.
