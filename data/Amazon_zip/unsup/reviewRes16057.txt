The ribs are absolutely awesome and a great deal at only 9.95 for a full rack, soup or salad, AND a pasta or potato (sun-thurs). This is my favorite dish here and usually what I get most of the time. Pizza is thin crust and delicious (not to mention HUGE). Beware though if you don't like really cheesy pizzas. I'm not a fan of the pasta here - they have a great selection but every dish I've ordered has undelivered. I think they tend to overcook the pasta so it comes out kind of hard and the sauces arent very flavorful. But the best thing about Calo's is the free focaccia bread! YUM. Good place to come with friends, excellent ambience and a pretty decent meal at a good price (if you dont get the pasta).
