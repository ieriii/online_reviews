I have nothing bad to say and really nothing new to add. We went for brunch and the food was amazing. I had the breakfast burrito which was awesome. It is rolled tight and then the tortilla is grilled so everything is nice and compact, not messy like most burritos. I loved it. It was freaking huge as most of there food seems to be and I had enough for lunch. My dinning companions had their version of a BLT-which is bacon and ham, the spinach benedict and the asparagus benedict. Everything was fabulous. The space is nice. We had great service. I cant wait to go back for dinner-soon! I want those pork chops.
