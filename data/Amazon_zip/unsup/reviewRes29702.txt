I wanted to love this place. I've been veg for a long time and everyone told me to check it out when I moved here from SF. So when my vegan friend came to visit, we made plans to go. But overall, I was mega underwhelmed, by both the food and the service. We expected to wait awhile, and were ok when they told us it'd be an hour, but we ended up waiting for over two. It's not just the length of the wait that was annoying, but mainly the indifference and rudeness from the host. When we weren't ignored outright, we kept getting jerked around. We were told things like 'you're almost next, we're clearing tables right now,' etc etc, but then we kept on waiting and watching other groups get seated (larger than us even) who we were pretty sure had come in after. Once we got inside, the food was fine but not worth the wait. Everything felt too heavy, not very inspired, and not super fresh. I also found it really odd to see all the egg dishes on their brunch menu. My vegan friend was very happy with her meal but unless she visits again, I can't imagine going back.
