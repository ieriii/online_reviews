Yeah it's in Greek town. I love to be there in the Summer. Not especially happening for drinks at the bar. The bartender had a bit of a non-plus attitude.  But I am a fan. I'm sure she is shell shocked from obnoxious guys drinking in there. The humus was excellent. The fried cheese too. Really pretty good atmosphere where we sat near the bar. I went toward the bathroom and it gets a bit touristy though over there. I had the lamb kabobs and it was good but didn't wow me. I should have went for the Lamb Chops. But I was trying to be good. We racked up some bills this week.
