Oh what can I say about the Mill that hasn't been said before. I can go into this bar anytime and know that it is going t be a good night. I was most recently in their on a Wednesday night where they had a live singing belting it out from behind the bar. The crowd is mixed, young and old, hip and square (aren't they one and the same nowadays anyway?). I prefer to go to the Mill on Thusday nights when the full orchestra takes over the stage and I can enviously watch all the dancers shine on the stage. The atmosphere is great and is a throwback to a really great scene that unfortunately is dying a slow death. Get to the Mill, you won't regret it.
