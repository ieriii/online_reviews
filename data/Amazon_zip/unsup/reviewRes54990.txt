Yes, it was a Saturday night and the wait was over an hour, but it gave us a chance to savor the bar. Wow...reminded me of my parents bridge club with the old fashions and manhatten. They were fantastic!! The food is truly edgy....but if you like the edge..this is it. The bone marrow with bacon/shallot jam was the closest I've had to a restaurant in Paris!!! Thanks for bringing a little bit of euro-flair to our American palettes!!
