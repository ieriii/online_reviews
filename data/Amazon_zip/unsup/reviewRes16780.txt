I'm sorry that I just don't get why people "LOVE" this place. Though I migrate to more divey, laid back bars in general, I can appreciate the quality of the drinks here. And for $11 and a ten minute wait per drink -it better damn well be good. I really wasn't impressed by the condescending pretentiousness of my server when I didn't know the reason she "clapped" over my drink. Being made to feel stupid was not making me want to tip her for the overpriced round. The giant "snow cone-like" ice cube in my boyfriend's drink made it difficult for him to drink and enjoy. The tall high back chairs are uncomfortable and make it hard to actually look at the person with whom you are talking let alone for you to eat what you've ordered. I gave the place 2 stars because...of the no cell phone rule, the beautiful decor, regulated crowd size and the perfect volume of the music. Waiting in the ridiculous lines, the attitude of the servers and the pretentious vibe can be left in NYC. I'll stick with the place that truly makes THE best drinks in the city-The Matchbox- the drinks are handcrafted minus attitude and the $11 price tag.
