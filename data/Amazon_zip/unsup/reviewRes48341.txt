Stopped in last Thursday for dinner. It was my second visit following a dinner in February. I wondered if my unfinished 5-star review from the February visit would hold up and it did. I was just as much, maybe even more impressed this time around than last. We had reservations for 7:30 and although a bit late were seated in a cage booth, which I think is pretty cool due to the exclusivity factor of the doors.  My last visit I had enjoyed the Sunner Kolsch, but being no longer available, I tried and liked the Einbecker Pilsner $6 my friend and I ordered the Chacuterie plate $21as an appetizer, which was along with the bread they serve could have substituted for an entree. It was a nice assortment of meats and pickled items acidic enough to bring out the flavors of the meats. It was by no surprise that I ordered again the Grilled Chicken, this time a half with summer sausage $22 and we also had the Suckling Pig $21, which I was not as impressed with, but was surprisingly better the next day cold! For round two of beers, my friend had the Monk's Sour Red Ale $6 and I decided to try the Weihenstephaner Lager $6 which was just as good as the German pilsner I tried. Our server, Justin was spot on and provided good recommendations for beer based on the foods ordered and also gets a kudos for the blueberry granita he recommended for dessert. Valet for $8, but also street parking can be found. Publican...come to L.A.!
