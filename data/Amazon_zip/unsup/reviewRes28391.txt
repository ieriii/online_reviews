Dined with colleagues at Graham Elliot's eponymous restaurant in Chicago this evening. A frequent Top Chef judge and a particpant in Top Chef Masters, Graham was a maestro of the kitchen and the restaurant this evening. Food, wine and service were spectacular (5 stars), but the noise level was deafening. The server said that the "chef was a bit of a rock fan, so he like the music loud." Well, as a patron, I didn't like having to shout to converse with companions, so the overall dining experience was 2 stars, at best. My mouth is still watering, but my ears are still ringing. Don't bother ... I said, louder now, DON'T BOTHER.
