Indie Cafe is wonderful. Some of the best sushi that I have had. And since they also serve Thai food, there is something even for those who aren't too keen on raw fish. The atmosphere is great for lunch or dinner. The lighting in the room changes making it feel really bright and laid back for lunch and a bit more elegant and romantic for an evening meal.
