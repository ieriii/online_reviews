I love getting delivery from this place when I'm in the mood for sushi since they're close by; they're so fast and everything comes tasting great. Eating in kinda sucks, as our waiter didn't seem to care either way about us and the seats are crowded together, but the food itself is awesome, and the price isn't too awful. Their gyoza are the one item I would definitely not recommend. They were bland and so crunchy that they seemed deep-fried rather than pan-fried, ick. The philadelphia roll is my favorite, and their salmon roll and tuna roll wouldn't be bad if they didn't put wasabi in it. They insist that putting wasabi in the roll is the 'proper' way to do it, but they're the only place I've ever been that does it like that. If you do dine in, try the orchid tea, its delicious, but just like the green tea ice cream and iced thai tea, its something they just buy and dish out, not a culinary creation.
