How overrated can you get? It's delicious, don't get me wrong. It's a great date place, it has great food from cheese to dessert. However, romantic? MAYBE if you get one of the booths. Maybe. If you don't mind the stench of oil cooking. If you're at a table like 90% of the people there, you're rubbing elbows with your neighbors, listening to their conversations, it's awful. Go right at opening and get a booth. Otherwise, it's as romantic as White Castle. The inevitable Melting Pot comparison: Melting Pot wins hands down on cheese, as there are many different kinds of cheese they have, most of which are better than Geja's. Melting Pot wins on dollar value for meat, you get way more there in the Big Night Out than you do for the full dinners here. The two tie for meat selection. Melting Pot also wins hands down on desserts - so many different selections and you get to make your own if you desire. The atmosphere is just as good if not better for a date there with the round tables that allow you to sit next to your date. I go here when I want fondue with a change of atmosphere. A+ for banning kids though.
