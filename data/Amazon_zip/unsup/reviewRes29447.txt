Vegetarians - you gotta make getting to this spot a priority. Sit In the garden if you can. It's diner-style so the food is not particularly light, but you can just take a run first (along the lake, of course!) and totally enjoy it, ordering and eating all your favorite childhood classics-how often can vegans do that? It is gluten free friendly and it is also possible to order on the lighter side-but I think you miss out if you don't order something sweet or treat-like here (hello, I'm looking at you, chocolate shake, and you, vegan cheesecake).
