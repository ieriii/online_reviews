I miss good pho and really haven't had it in Chicago for a while. Being away from it makes me miss it a lot. Tank noodle really hit the spot on my last visit to the Chi. Sunday was incredibly busy with multiple large groups that all had to wait, but they kept it to a minimum. Our group was rather large about 5 at first and then grew to 7 and they were very accommodating. The pho here is always good, I think it's a milder broth but it actually lets me taste the meat better. The meatballs-my favorite are really good here-nicely formed, and tasty, it's definitely well made here. The brisket cut here is also rare but not sickly raw as some other places are, which makes it easier for my stomach now that it's no longer made of cast iron anymore. My go to place for pho on Argyle.
