Let me start by saying that I LOVE pizza, I love thin crust, I love thick Chicago style and everything inbetween. But what I don't love is this place. It was ok. Nothing too special. If you compare it to Zachary's in Oakland its mediocre at best. Maybe we had a bad pie but I don't think so..pretty bland, except the sausage, that was the pizza saver. But literally the only true flavor was in the sausage. Next time I'll go for Gino's East.
