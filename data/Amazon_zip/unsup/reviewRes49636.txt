wine and dessert, wine and dessert yum yum yum....that's all it really takes to make me a happy camper. Have to say...the waiter (sorry I don't remember YO name) really knows his vino. So Bin 36, I give you props for your hiring skills. While the desserts were mediocre, I have to say I fancy your wine selection. The resto- spacious so you don't have to worry about butt-grazing any tables here. I just might have to come back. Adios for now =)
