Not your typical Greek restaurant. This place is great! It's our favorite place to eat. Every time we go I order the lemon chicken rice soup and the Mediterranean salad. It's consistently good. Their ingredients are always so fresh and the desserts are amazing as well. The only problems I've had is that the wait staff occasionally forgets about us. The food makes up for that though.
