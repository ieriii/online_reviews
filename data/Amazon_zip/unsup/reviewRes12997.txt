My boyfriend and I went to Cafe 28 for our 5 year anniversary. (5 years, woohoo!) We called to make reservations, but they only take them for parties of 6 or more. There was a 30 min wait when we arrived so we had drinks at the bar before dinner. The bar area is small, but nice and the bartenders were skilled and attractive (as is required for a 4 star review). The drinks were good, but pricey. We were seated pretty quickly for a busy Friday night and out waitress came by promptly for our orders. We got the ceviche and the taste of cuba for our starters and the almond crusted halibut and seafood paella for our entrees. The appetizers were both delicious, definitely try the ceviche. Unfortunately, our entrees arrived five minutes after the appetizers and the langostino atop my boyfriend's paella was really undercooked. The waitress, who did not bring the food out, apologized that they were brought out so quickly and took them back for us. When they made their second appearance, they were fully cooked and pretty good. The paella was really tasty, but I felt the halibut dish was a little bland. I agree with another reviewer who said the jalapeo mashed potatoes were boring and in need of their namesake chili. We shared a trio of sorbet and a glass of cava for dessert. The sorbet was superb. Overall, the experience was good and we will go back. I'm sure the poor waitress thought she was going to get a terrible tip, but we couldn't fault her for the hasty kitchen and food runner. Give Cafe 28 a try, but be sure to order your entree after you've had your appetizer.
