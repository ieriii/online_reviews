Nice place! I keep trying different drinks there and have never been disappointed--they have some fresh ideas and use top-notch ingredients for the cocktails. Get there early--the line is around the block late at night. The atmosphere is a breath of fresh air because it doesn't feel crowded, the Robin's egg blue paint and drapery are nice and it's never very loud. You don't have to dress up, although people tend to look very nice--it's got this cool prohibition vibe going on. A great place to go on a first date before dinner or to meet up with an old friend.
