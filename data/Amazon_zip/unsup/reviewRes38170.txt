As a west coat girl I never understood the argument between what is better, Chicago thick or New York thin pizza. Well, I don't see how a limp paper-thin slice can even compare to the gobs of melted cheese and thick crust like that in Chicago. Last year on our first visit ever to Chicago we hit up the Giordano's in Rosemont and were so pleased. So pleased in fact we ate there 3 times on our little trip. This year, we returned to the Windy City to celebrate our anniversary and couldn't decide what we were more excited about, Giordano's pizza or our 29 course dinner at Alinea. As soon as we landed and checked into our hotel, we were off! The wait was around an hour, but oh we didn't even flinch. Soon, our dreams were fulfilled. The tangy sauce cuts though the river of cheese like some creation straight from the heavens. The crust, ohhhh the crust, like flaky golden sunshine! We left oh so full and oh so satisfied. When we woke up on our last day in the city, we couldn't decide where to eat our last meal. Then, at about the same time, we realized we needed Giordano's again. This time, we ate twice as much. Now I have never been to New York, but if it were based on pizza alone, Ill stick with Chicago!
