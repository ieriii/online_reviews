Enjoyed my stay! I was here for business and thought this place was just perfect. My room was comfortable - great bed, big desk and a nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was small, but I have come to expect that in city hotels. I did laugh because it had the tiniest sink I had ever seen in a bathroom. The staff was very helpful and nice. I had trouble trying to print my return boarding pass in their business center, the gentleman at the desk took care of it for me without blinking and eye. Nice stay and would definitely stay there again.
