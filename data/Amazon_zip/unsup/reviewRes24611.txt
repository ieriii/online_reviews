Ok, so don't wear anything that you don't want to smell like oil for a few days, and it is pretty dark so make sure the candles on the table get lit. Otherwise, I really like this place. Yup, it's expensive and the server is always going to try to sell you the Premier Dinner, but that's their job, and if you get on the email list there are coupons all the time and they also run Groupons frequently. The food is really good and plentiful. Go hungry. And make sure you leave room for dessert because that flaming chocolate fondue is the best part.
