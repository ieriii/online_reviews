Got there at 6 on Sat and just missed having to wait. Our waiter was awesome and gave us great reccomendations. We started with Caprese. For entrees we had the gnochi special which was some of the finest I have ever eaten. I decided to try something new, the Osso Buca and am glad I did. The meat was delicious and fell apart. And we tried Fettuchini Alfredo which was prety solid. We got so much food, dessert was out of the question and have leftovers for tomorrow. BYO, great food and service. Will definately be back. I reccomend going with a group so you can make a reservation to avoid a wait.
