We bought a coupon for this restaurant because we wanted to try Colombian food. The portions are crazy huge! We started with Pulpitos al carbon, baby octopus marinated in a garlic. It was delicious! For main dish we had the Entraa and the Churrasco. The meat was tender and juicy and was kept warm on a flat top in the plate. The fried yuca and plantain were yummy! The waiter told us that Las tablas was the place to be for Sunday brunch!
