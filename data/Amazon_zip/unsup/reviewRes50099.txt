Love this restaurant! I've been here numerous times, once for my birthday, for a friends birthday and for a nice romantic dinner. The restaurant is great for both groups and couples. I'm not sure if they still have live music but they did one night when I was there (maybe a Friday?) and it really brought the place alive. The food is excellent, especially for the quantity and price. I usually get the Churassco or the combination with skirt steak and calamari. The steak is always perfectly cooked and flavorful and the sauces on the side add a little hint of freshness and more flavor, amzaing. The grilled calamari is some of the best I've had, full of flavor. And the yucca...hard to describe the amazingness! They used to be BYO all the time and now are only BYO on the weekdays, which probably helps their piggy bank more than mine, but it is still worth it. Highly recommended.
