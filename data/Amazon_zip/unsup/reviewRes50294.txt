So, I actually ended up eating at this place by mistake. I was meeting a friend for lunch and he chose the spot based on the good Yelp reviews. Well, he'd gotten there before me, saw the prices and tried to back out with many texts. (Let me note, the prices are not unreasonable, just too high for broke twenty-somethings.) However, I, like a dumb ass, walked right in, got seated and got a water so he was forced to join me. We didn't want to be rude and you know, leave, so we glumly stared at the menu which was way out of our price range and also filled with stuff I didn't understand. It's a Cajun and southern-style menu, which is not food I'm familiar with so I was faced with a ton of unfamiliar terms and ingredients. Our server was nice, but visibly disappointed by us, as we ordered the cheapest appetizers we could. I'm a server, I've been there, "Great. Water and appetizers. I'm gonna make bank on this pair." She hid it pretty well, but we still felt hella awkward. So, this is shaping up to be a disaster, right? Well, I got the sweet potato hash, and guys it was like heaven shone down upon me when I put it in my mouth. It was sweet, and salty, and perfectly cooked, and glorious in every single way. The tea I ordered was not only from fresh leaves and really delicious, they also brought me fresh honey right to the table. I am a horrible tea snob, and I was so impressed! My friend got some sort of pea soup, and from the look on his face it was an "I'll have what she's having" moment. So the food? Glorious. The service? Good, but not so friendly for us. I'm sure she would've been great for anyone going in there looking to drop some cash but she still made us feel kind of unwelcome. But the food? Glorious.
