I don't like deep dish I like Art of Pizza;s deep dish or pan or whatever This is a very cheesy pizza with just the right amount of sauce, which is not a ton I should say (personal preference). I ordered a pepperoni and italian sausage and while I'm no sausage expert, this was good sausage. You could taste the spices in the meat. A deep dish stands on its crust. And Art of Pizza's is exceptional. Its got a nice buttery and crispy outside and a perfectly soft inside. And it tastes great. What else do you need? Definitely the place to take your out of town friends eager to try a Chicago-style pizza.
