Loved Carnivale, I had been wanting to try this place forever. The food was great , I had the steak. But, the dessert was not so great. The desserts are less traditional and more eclectic but not my thing. We ordered an ice cream cake but I did not like the fruity flavorings. The atmosphere was interesting...kinda like you're in a circus but not in a bad way. It was fun looking around. I remember it being really cold though and I went in the fall. Anyways, I would go back and would recommend to friends. The prices are really high for tapas (probably the most expensive I've ever had) but it was something I expected going in. This place would be a special occasion only type of place for me.
