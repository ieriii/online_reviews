Everything has been said about this place. I met the BF before we went to a dinner party for some light snacks and brews. I died with their beer list, I love me some Belgian's! We had the pork rinds and mussels and loved both. This place looks as awesome as the food/drink is. For as tall as the ceilings are and as big as the place is, the wood and lighting give this cozy, comfy vibe. My favorite part was the bathroom experience, I loved the communal sink.
