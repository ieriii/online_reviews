Ohhhhhhhh man, that was the best chorizo I have ever had. I've avoided the Bongo Room because of the line. Few things are worth and hour + wait, and yes, Kuma's IS one of those things... however... It was a Tuesday and there was hardly anyone there.  So the service wasn't good, but it wasn't bad either. A side of hash browns was forgotten, mentioned, forgotten again, and brought near the end of the meal. Whatever though. No big deal. I had the special omelet... and the egg part was bad (overcooked dry eggs) but the innards were the best omelet fillings I may ever had. Chunks of firm, but not overly under ripe avocados, perfectly seasoned and not too oily, potatoes and cheese. Hello! I actually ate the filling out of the omelet. And the hash browns--seasoned with dill--were wonderful. My companion had the pumpkin and zucchini pancakes with some sort of caramel white chocolate cream on top. Ohhhhh my. I'm not a sweet breakfast fan (their specialty) but it was oh so delectable. I will be back to search out savory breakfast specials, but during a weekday
