Don't make reservations!!!! Never again!!!!   Thank you so much Brazzaz!!! You took my reservation 3 days prior when I called your establishment. Then tonight, our anniversary, you say you don't have our reservation???? The only resolution is to rebook our reservation and we would wait 2 hours plus like walk-ins??? After reading some past reviews, this seems to be somewhat common. How unprofessional?? You have lost our future business and future recommendations!!
