Mayan Palace is in a really cute location on the corner in Lincoln Park. I went on a weeknight with a few friends. We were seated in the way back at a table very close to a window outside of which was another table on the patio. It was all the fun of eating outside with a lack of flies dive-bombing our food. It was pretty cool. There was a special on pitchers of margaritas that night; they were half off. So were single servings. Margaritas were had. I remember more about the drinks than I do about the food. I don't quite recall what everyone had, but I do remember the serving being so large that I had to take a box home and I ate off of it for a couple of days until I got tired of eating it. I think there was still some left over after that too. We had a bottomless basket of tortilla chips for the table, salsa, and maybe guac. Again...the margs make my memory of things a little cloudy. The server was very nice and attentive. The only complaint I have is regarding the strange puddles of liquid on the floor of the passageway between the front dining room and the back dining room. I don't know what it was, but it makes an already menacing looking hallway look even more treacherous. Other than that, this place is fantastic! I'll definitely be back.
