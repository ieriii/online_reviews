I love the crab rolls!!!! you have to be a real sushi lover to go here. these fools that order cooked fish think that is sushi? come on you wimps you have to eat it raw to enjoy sushi (and most yummy things). i will say that the bathrooms were very clean and that is a good sign that the resturant has high standards.
