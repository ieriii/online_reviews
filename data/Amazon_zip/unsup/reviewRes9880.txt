Burrata con culatello is the appetizer that will put you to sleep in your seat and make you have piccolo sogno about creamy burrata. The prosciutto pizza (with added arugula per my request) was good. The hit of the night though was the pork shank braised in milk, served with mashed potatoes and smokey charred kaled studded with pancetta bits. The rich pork melted in your mouth and the bitter smokiness of the kale paired flawlessly. A spot on dish over all. Can't wait until my next meal at the little dream.
