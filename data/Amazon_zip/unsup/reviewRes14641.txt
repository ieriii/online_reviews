Since I moved to Chicago from South Florida I have really missed casual Cuban fare, however, this is no longer the case. After going to 90 miles my urge for Cuban cuisine can be satisfied. My husband had the Bistec dinner when we went and I had the Ropa Vieja dinner, both were incredible. The proteins were delicious, as were the rice and beans and plaintains. I am totally in love with this food. I can't wait to go back. So freaking good...
