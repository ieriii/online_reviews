Brunch places are always crowded on the weekends, so I never expect to be seated right away. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait long for our table. The place was packed. The menu explained that Meli was Greek for honey, and that was definitely a theme in the food. Which is good -- i like honey! I had the French toast, and I was pretty happy with it. I didn't try any of the juices, but a brunchmate did, and it came out room temperature. I guess this is standard, but it seemed strange to me. This is a good breakfast place. Pretty standard selections, all done slightly uniquely. It probably wouldn't wow any out of town guests, but if you live in the neighborhood, you probably go here fairly often. I know I would.
