Super cute pizza place off Ravenswood. The waitstaff was fantastic and very friendly and attentive. I was there for a birthday and we got free Perseco from the owner! V. Nice! I had the white pizza with buffalo mozz and although it was good, it need much more spice/garlic/kick. I also tried a tomato sauce and mushroom pizza which was very good. The crust is amazing, a true fire baked version! I recommend this place for a fun dinner out that is not your traditional, borring pizza joint.
