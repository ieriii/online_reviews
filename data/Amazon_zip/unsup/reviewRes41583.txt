Totally worth the trip from Oak Park. The Spring Rolls are fresh, but they were a little lacking in flavor. Their pho - large portion, no skimping on meat - was awesome. The banh xeo wasn't the best I've ever had, but hey, what do you expect when you get a fried crepe to go? I wasn't expecting crispy due to the drive, but even beyond that, it wasn't anything special. Their grilled pork is simply heavenly. I can't stop thinking about how amazing their pork vermicelli is. Frankly, for being in the Vietnamese-type district of town, I'd expect nothing less.
