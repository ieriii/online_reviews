Consistently delivers wonderful food and attentive service. The ingredients are always very fresh, the entrees - well prepared and well presented. When I have made a reservation, my table has always been waiting for me upon arrival.   Neg - the portions tend to be very small. I'm not looking for the usual vats of pasta that you find at some restaurants, but a slightly larger portion would be nice.
