What can I say about Hot Doug's that has not already been said? I was lucky enough to stay with a friend living a short walk from Hot Doug's. I had the Chicago dog, and the foie gras dog. Both were delicious. Hot Doug himself was working the cash register. I bought a shirt. The line went out the door, but the service was fast. Perfect for a hot dog place on any level, any day.
