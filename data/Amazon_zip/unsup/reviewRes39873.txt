one of my dining pals said it best - this place is like the diner of korean food restaurants. it's fairly loud and very casual. we went here on a friday night around 7pm-ish and got seated right away. the parking lot doesn't have a ton of spaces but there are always people in and out so you won't have to wait long. the prices here are average of what you'd pay at cho son ok and solga ($8 for JapChae, $17 for meat). i find that the bulKoKi (that's how it's spelled on the menu) and the short ribs are kind of bland. i recommend putting the garlic they give you on the coals to get some flavor going. i find the meat at solga and cho son ok more flavorful. the JapChae was pretty mediocre. again, kind of bland with ground meat. the service was not bad at all. the waitresses were very attentive and even made suggestions on what we should order and it was very busy. they didn't seem to care about the color of our skin - in fact there were many different kinds of people there. they provide you with a lot of side dishes (a lot of them you couldn't really tell what they were until eating them) - much more than what i've received from any korean restaurant i've been too. you get soup too. overall, the plus is that it's open almost 24 hours so if you're jonesing for korean food in the early morning hours, it's totally worth it to go here. for 4 of us, it cost around $28 a person with tip.
