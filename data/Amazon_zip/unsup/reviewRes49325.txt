So super city chic! I love this place. The decor is contemporary and the whole place has a "we're so cool because we live in the city vibe." We went of Friday night at 7:00 and there was plenty of room. You can get delish flights of wine, flights, of cheese, and then top it all off with a chocolate flight for two for dessert. Awesome. The Bin 36 Favorites 6 cheese flight was fantastic, my "bubbly" flight of 4 sparkling wines was great, and the chocolate for two dessert flight (which is enough for four if you don't want to gorge) was mmmmm. They give you flight maps with little descriptions of everything too.  The only disappointment were the entrees. The cod and stuffed calamari was bland, and my husband's marlin was good, but nothing to write home about. I would totally go here again and just do cheese, chocolate, and wine! They also sell all of their wines, conveniently listed by bin number so you can go right from the menu to the bin and buy it, and they're pretty reasonably priced. Most seemed to be around $15-$20. But of course our favorite was $26.50. Still pretty great though.
