Love it! Officially our favorite Indian place in Chicago, after going there once. ;) We decided to check it out because we had a Groupon. The food was a bit on the pricey side, but the restaurant is sooooooo nice (it's the kind of place where they give you two plates and two forks). I absolutely love the decor, it's cute and elegant at the same time. Definitely my kind of place, even if the food wasn't amazing--which it was. First of all, they give you bread to start, which is completely awesome because I don't care for papadum and that's usually what you get at Indian places. We tried two potato-based appetizers (samosa and some kind of potato-nut things, which were brilliant) and then had our usual--malai kofta for him, chana masala for me. Everything was absolutely delicious, and I can't wait to go back and eat it all again!
