Oh the much anticipated dining experience of a restaurant of Rick Bayless. I must say it was quite good, and I didn't even enjoy Mexican food that much until recently, but it's definitely grown on me. And Frontera has such fresh ingredients - brings out the best of the food. Two of us shared five small plates, and that was plenty of food (maybe we are weak). We got the guacamole, flautas, gorditas, tamal and tortilla soup. My favorite was the flautas - loved the shrimp and the fresh taste of lime juice and watercress sprinkled over the top. Didn't care much for the tamal - it sounded really good on the menu description, but I have decided I don't like mashed up plantains that much (fried plantains are delicious). It's a very festive place, great for groups and celebrations!
