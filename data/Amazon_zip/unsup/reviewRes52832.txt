Stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon and had an iffy experience. Our server appeared attentive at times, but would then seemingly disappear when we needed her service. Foodwise, we ordered the slow cooked beef sandwich, the fish sandwich, and rice pudding. Both sandwiches were just okay. (the bread was dry and stale!) The fish sandwich came with yucca fries that most likely sat under a heating lamp too long. I want to give 90 Miles another chance. They were probably having a crappy day, and it showed. If you're enticed by yucca fries try Skewerz on Damen.
