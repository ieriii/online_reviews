Delish pizza. Very fun for yummy treats that are very close to the Italian version. We had great appetizers (Mozzarella di Bufala and the Prosiutto w/ Melon) and shared a pizza and a bottle of wine. A little on the pricey side for pizza, but a great treat nonetheless. The wait for outdoor seating can be a pain, but the food makes up for the wait! The service was average, in all honesty.
