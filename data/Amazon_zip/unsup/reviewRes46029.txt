The past few times I've been here I haven't been overly impressed, yet I keep coming back so I must like it enough. They have an enormous menu of upscale chain style food that offers pretty much anything you could want.  The atmosphere is nice kind of swanky with dim lighting and dark colors. I prefer it during the day because it's so dark at night unless you are near the window which everyone wants. The view of the Christmas lights on Michigan Ave was pretty great even though we weren't sitting there. Our server made some pretty weird comments, but otherwise the food came out very fast and the service was good. The pasta fresca is ok- heavy on the vegetables and light on the pasta. Had to have cheese grater man dump a LOT on. Key Lime Pie is awesome and more than enough for 2 people to split. You can find dinners here anywhere from $8 to $30 depending on what you get. I think you can find this quality of food, service, and atmosphere elsewhere but it's a fun downtown place to go every once in awhile. I don't think it's worth waiting an hour for a table and wish they took reservations.
