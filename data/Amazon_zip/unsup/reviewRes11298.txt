Piece is amazing! For a pizza place, it really does not get any better. First off, just passing the place makes you crave pizza because it smells so good in there. Once you get in, that is the first downside because you are going to have to wait for about an hour if you get there between 6-8pm because everyone loves it so much. While you wait you can have one of their 10 different current microbrews they have. Right now, they have and Oktoberfest called Oktoberfist and it is delicious! It is a little pricey though...$17 for a pitcher. When you get seated, you can create your own pizza with unique toppings. I definitely recommend trying a white pizza with chicken and mashed potatoes (I know it sounds good, but don't knock it until you try it). They have pretty good specials too. On Sunday, you can get a pizza and pitcher for $25. Plus, you can buy a Growler full of beer and then bring it back for refills and have their beer at home. I go here about once a week, at least for the beer.
