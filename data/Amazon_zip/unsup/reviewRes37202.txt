One of my favorite markets in Chicago. They have a large array of products for a small store. Everywhere you look, there is something cool for food-obsessed people (like me) to admire.  They have an amazing cheese shop, with so many varieties to choose from. Great butcher and seafood shop, and the guys behind the counter were always helpful with questions I've had. The bakery always has fresh bread and tasty desserts. I love their selection of oils, vinegars, and salts.  Really, I could go on and on about this place. I used to go here almost every week when I worked nearby. It's pretty expensive, though, so shopping here is definitely a splurge (for me, at least). I hope they open more stores in Chicago :)
