For those who don't know yet, Wakamono now has a full bar but still maintains its BYOB policy but with a $3 corkage fee, which is sort of a joke given that such fees are usually really high. Anywho, I was here with Jordan B. and his friend because we were starving and they love Wakamono... I have to admit, I liked it too, beginning with my ginger martini on to the dumplings and then to the sushi rolls and sashimi. The fish was fresh and the rolls were well made, the wasabi was tart and the ginger was just fab! The service was kinda slow though and the waitress was quite incomprehensible, not to mention that she was a total ditz.
