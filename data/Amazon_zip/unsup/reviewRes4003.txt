I am extremely disappointed in Schwa! I made reservations for my 30th birthday 2 months in advance. They decide to call me up the Thursday before my Saturday reservation and leave a voicemail that they are canceling our reservation! I was so angry and disappointed! Obviously, a 30th birthday is a big deal. I had been so excited about celebrating my big day at Schwa. We had even bought them 2 big bottles of special Three Floyds beer (from the brewery)! They didn't even offer to make it up to me or even give me a reason for the cancellation. They just left me the same number that everyone else calls if I wanted to reschedule. So, obviously when I try to call the number back, I get their voicemail saying that their mailbox is full.  Yeah, thanks. I will not be rescheduling. I have been telling everyone about this horrible customer service. I'm sure the food is amazing, but I do not need to waste my time with this place when they treat their customers like this. Jerks!
