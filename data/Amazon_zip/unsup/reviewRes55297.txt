A wonderful fine dining experience!My wife invited me to Fogo De Chao for my birthday surprise and I must say that I was totally impressed with everything they had to offer. To begin with - their salad bar was by far the most spectacular salad bar I have ever seen and with the most extensive selections of fresh greens and other things. The all you can eat choices of freshly cook over open flame meats (choice of 7 different) was also spectacular and delicious. our food was very well accompanied by a wonderful bottle of South American red wine that made it a totally 5 star experience.  Fogo De Chao is hands down one of my top 5 restaurants in Chicago.
