I had my first crepe ever at Icosium a little over two years ago, and I'm pretty sure they have set my definitive standard for all crepes. The coffee is strong, the decor is vibrant, the staff is competent but not overly friendly, and the crepes are magnifique! I've never tried one of the sweet crepes, but might have after seeing that they come with little cocktail umbrellas! I've had salmon with goat cheese, apples with brie, and most recently, the house "Icosium Crepe", which I loved, although it was a little heavy on the peppers, and I'm not a huge fan of roasted peppers. (That's my own fault though -- I couldn't decided between the Chicago Crepe, and the Crepe de Paris with escargot, garlic, and brie, and decided last minute to go in a completely different direction). It was a great start to a day of sidewalk-shopping in Andersonville, I was full without feeling too heavy to enjoy walking around, and the coffee picked me RIGHT up!
