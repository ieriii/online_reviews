I absolutely loved the food! The empanadas are amazing, (sounds weird, but) the papas fritas are really good, as well as the yucas fritas. The Ropa Veija was awesome. My boyfriend had the Cuban Sandwich, and he loved it. I had the Guajirito sandwich during my most recent trip there, and I was not a big fan. Honestly, it was kind of tasteless. BYOB makes dining here really fun, too. I've only gone on weekend nights. Understandably, the service was quite slow because of it. The place gets PACKED on the weekends. If you want more personal service to ask questions and stuff, you might want to go on a week night.
