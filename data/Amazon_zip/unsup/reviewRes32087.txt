I really love their soup dumplings and the popcorn shrimps. Sushi is fresh but the cooked food are so-so. The duck, fliet mignon and lamb did not impress me... we wanted our steak rare... it came out medium well. I asked the server if it is rare. He said yes. You will have to be blind not be able to tell that it is not red in the center. Love the drink list tho... Service was pretty bad. They put plates on the table without readjusting the plates/glasses, so after they serve us soup/appetizers/main course, we have to move everything ourself. We ordered bottled water and they decided to chill it for us but never refill our glass unless we ask. We went at 9pm on a weekday and it was NOT busy anymore. We got better service at the bar last time from the bartender. They really need to retrain their staff.
