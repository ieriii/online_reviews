Recently stayed here for 10 days for a meeting. I have to say the hotel was good, but not fantastic. I was in the historic tower which was nice, but unfortunately they only had 2 elevators to my floor, which made the wait quite bad some days. The room itself was roomy and clean with a nice bed and tv/entertainment center. Things were always clean. They charged for internet which was a pain since I was there for so long. Also, the gym had a $18 one time fee which got you access to the pool (see other reviews...it is historic and nice) and a decent workout room. The service was good but I did not ask too much of them since I used yelp for most of my dining. THe location was great (right on the mag mile) and although not great for food would make this a great place in the spring/summer (too bad I was there in Jan)
