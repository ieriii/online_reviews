Went here during Chicago heat wave and enjoyed the cool covered patio with fans circulating nice ventilation. Affordable tapas with knowledgable friendly staff. Delicious food- Not a bad thing on the menu. We had the beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios, smears and meatball slider- all fabulous. Can't wait to go back.
