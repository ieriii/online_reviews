The food here is EXCELLENT. Service was superb and the overall experience was perfect.  We came here for a birthday celebration for 2 of my friends (Amy D. & Cindy D.) It's BYOB and they were very accommodating and provided glasses, wine glasses, ice. We ordered the opart beef, crab rangoon, beef salad for apps, which were all delicious.  For dinner, we had a range of curry, stews, pad thai, pad see ewe, and more. But when they ask if you want spicy - THEY MEAN SPICY. So even those of you out there who think you can handle, you might want to consider not going all the way and try the medium level of spiciness.  My favorite dish is the catfish with thai eggplant, INCREDIBLE. Definiteliy one of my favorite places to grab thai.
