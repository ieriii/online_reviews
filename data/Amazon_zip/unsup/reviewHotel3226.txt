WONDERFUL HOTEL!! My husband and I arrived in Chicago very early one morning and stopped at our hotel to drop our bags off and then go off and find some place to eat breakfast. To our amazement, Hard Rock let us check in early and grab a quick nap so we could start Chicago out right. The front desk staff were wonderful and let us know about all the food and night life around us. They gave us suggestions almost every day about where to eat and what to do. The rooms were great. The bedding is possibly the softest I have ever felt. I wanted to take the pillows home! But i didn't!! Don't worry. The room was very posh and seemed more expensive than we paid for. I loved the bathroom. Bathrooms are deal breakers in hotels for me. This location is great. You are about a block away from the bean and there are food and bars galore! There are bus stops everywhere but we mostly walked down Michigan avenue to do shopping and sightseeing. I would recommend this hotel to everyone! Usually I like to try out different hotels but we will definitely stay here again during our next trip to Chicago. You don't fix it unless it's broke!
