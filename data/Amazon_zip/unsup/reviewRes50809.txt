Food portions were huge!!! I enjoyed the food & it was relatively empty (although it was a Thursday morning) which you won't find @ Yolk. So it left a little to be desired in taste, but overall I can't really complain. When it comes to breakfast, it wouldn't be my first choice, but not dead last either. They are cash only -- I'm not a fan of that.
