hot damn chicago, looks like you're on a roll. There are already more than enough good reviews of The Publican so I'll spare the extreme detail and jump straight to what I liked: They aren't beer snobs! Even though everyone there knows the difference between "hoppy" and "bitter" they don't act like jerks when you talk to them about beer. Its like whoever taught them about beer left out the "now that you know this you should talk down to everyone around you" part. The food is excellent and well portioned. Sure the prices aren't tiny, but we fed three people with 2 dishes and a desert. nice. I'm knocking it down to 4 stars because holy crap why are they charging so much for some of those bottles. When I saw $30 for a 22 of bourbon county stout I just had to take a picture of the menu out of sheer disbelief.
