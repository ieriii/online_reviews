I'm not a vegetarian but I really love the Chicago Diner! My favorite dish is definitely the "Polenta Fiesta"....mmm yes I'm hungry just thinking about it. There is a ton of variety on the menu, so even first-time seitan eaters can probably find something appealing. The portions are pretty big, and I think the prices are fair, compared against other vegetarian restaurants.
