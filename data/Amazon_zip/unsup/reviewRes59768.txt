I've only been in Chicago for a short time, but before I ate here, I've been fairly unimpressed with the pizza. Art of Pizza definitely lives up to the hype. The crust is hearty, thick and flavorful (I got the pan pizza), toppings are thick and fresh, sauce has a great flavor, and it isn't so greasy that it weakens the crust. This place is definitely a jewel in Chicago's crown, highly recommended!
