This is a really good Restaurant. It can be hard sometimes to find decent vegetarian food but everything on the menu at the Chicago Diner is really good. The place is kind of small, which means you have to wait for a table, and the service isn't always all that fantastic. But the food always makes up for any other problems I come across. Great place, I definitely recommend it
