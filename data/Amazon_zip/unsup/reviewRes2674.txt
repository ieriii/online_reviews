yea i waited at least an hour and it was freezing, yea i started feeling desperate towards the end of that wait cus i hadnt had a bite all morning in anticipation and it was nearing 2pm. wuts cool tho is that the outside stretch of line is the worst and longest, then u get to stage 2 in the first doorway w about 4 other heads. stage 3 is a bit warmer w about 3 other heads in that doorway, then ur inside on the last leg of waiting behind maybe 8 people. from this point on u can see the menu and start to choose wut ur gonna eat. its hard to choose cus uve come so far and want to make it worth it, so u'll choose at least 2 dogs. i got the kiera knightley spicy dog, the foie gras dog, and duck fat fries. seating is first come first serve, and the food takes less than 10 min after u order. that foie gras dog is daaaang good. its one of those tastes that stay in ur head and that u crave....the foie gras is a topping on a duck sausage, and trust me u want to try this its so unique and bottom line good. duck fat fries have a lot of hype, but still very good and def worth trying. kiera knightley was a solid spicy dog, but not spicy enough for me...so i'll go with the salma hyek next time.
