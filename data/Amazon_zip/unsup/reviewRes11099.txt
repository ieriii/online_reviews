This is my favorite pizza in chicago. I'm not a deep dish girl so I love the crust here. The cheese is so hot that the cheese melts right into the sauce. The beers are always good and it's a great place to bring out of town guests for a different atmosphere. It's really busy all the time so it can be frusterating. We started getting delivery but it just doesn't taste the same. We have had some touchy service there but it seems to have improved recently.
