It's a great breakfast place...not only will I say that, but half of the south loop will say the same...while waiting in line. I try to only attend there when early on weekends...say before 9. The food is very good...and very large portioned. The coffee is okay--not bad, not the greatest. The prices are definitely decent...even my parents say so, and they're from the sticks downstate. I like breakfast and it's one of the few places that offer it on Saturdays in the South Loop. As previously stated, my friend loved the Hollandaise sauce. The pinapple/fruit boat thing is amazing. No matter...I still go for the standard eggs and bacon...
