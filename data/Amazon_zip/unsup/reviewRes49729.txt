What a great night! Great ambiance, great service, great food...a lot of greats. We came here after a book signing and art fair at Flourish Studios, and we were hungry. Came to the right place - we shared the empanadas, entrana steak, octopus, and calamari. The sides here are plantain, yucca, and potatoes. I loved everything except for the yucca; I'm just not a yucca kind of gal, it's a texture thing. I will definitely be back, I actually like Las Tablas better than Tango Sur.
