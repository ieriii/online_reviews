Art of Pizza is programmed #1 in my cell for two reasons.  1. It happens to be first alphabetically. 2. It's the best pizza in town.  Until proven otherwise, Art of has the best Chicago style deep dish in town. I know some people have knocked off some stars for their thin crust. Well, why you ordering thin crust in the first place? This is deliciousness I can't personally get enough of. Couple things to consider.  1. Delivery time is crazy long on weekend nights. Expect 1.5 hours at least. So don't order w/ an empty stomach, unless you bare the hunger pains. 2. $4 steak sandwiches on Saturdays. I love a good steak sandwich. 3. They give free soda if you spend so much. Take advantage. My current fave deep dish includes onions, gps, and sausage. Though I change it up a lot.  Mmmm Mmmm Tasty!
