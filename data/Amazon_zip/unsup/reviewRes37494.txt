I can't believe I'm writing this. I have been going to the Hopleaf for years--long before they were a restaurant. They have the best beer selection in Chicago hands down and I have always dug the cozy atmosphere in the bar (at least if it's not too packed.) If I were reviewing it as a bar, I'd give it a hearty 5 stars. But...I can't say that much about the restaurant part of the deal. On a recent visit, the food was just OK. My dinner was satisfying but not remarkable. Given the brevity of the menu, I was shocked that they didn't offer any kind of daily special. In fact, half of the menu was devoted to sandwiches. That may be fine for lunch but if they are trying to attract a real dinner crowd (and charging real dinner prices,) they are going to have to do better.  The kicker, though, was the service sucked. It took a grand total of 55 minutes to get our dinner order from the time we ordered. During that time, several parties around us were seated, ordered and were served their meals so our waitress' excuse that "we were slammed" simply wasn't true. Look, I'm a pretty understanding patron. I know shit happens and that's OK. But don't lie to me. So my beloved Hopleaf, this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you: 2.5 stars--and that is mostly on the merits of the beer selection.
