This was my first ever Brazilian steakhouse experience, and I have to say it remains my favorite so far. Their buffet bar surpasses Texas de Brazil, because it offers amazingly fresh ceviche, really good pastas, and many other sides. Their meat is great too, and they offer shrimp and even lobster tail on some nights! This truly is my favorite.
