I am a die hard carnivore so I've been to many a steak house. Here is what one should look for in a good steak house: 1. Good steak. 2. Good drinks made by career bartenders (you are not a career bartender if you were born in the 80s). 3. Career servers who look like they've eaten enough red meat to clog any artery and washed it down with enough single malt scotch to pickle any liver. 4. Lots of wood paneling (not the basement kind) and shades of hunter green or burgundy. That's it. In other words, a good steak house has a particular dynamic that is predicated on the "steak house experience" of the staff. The Chicago Ruth's Chris was staffed by college age "kids" for whom this job was interchangeable with one at TGI Friday's. Need I say more? The steak was good, though.
