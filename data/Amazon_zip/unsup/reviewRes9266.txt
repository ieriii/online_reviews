Doesn't get any better than this place when it comes to Middle Eastern food. The price is a lot more than your usual middle eastern joint, but they definitely make your money worth while with HUGE portions (one entree could feed 3 of me) and the tastiest of its kind. We also got tea at the end of our meal because we saw a lot of the regulars sipping on it, and now i will never leave this place without my cup of tea. It's soothing and fragrant and helps you forget how grossly full you are - Just another reason why this place leaves you wanting to come back for more.
