What a gorgeous Grand Ballroom. I have never stayed at the hotel, but have been to a few Indian Weddings here. The place is magnificent, beautiful, always elegant. Love the very long reception area right outside the Grand Ballroom, which has its own reception area as well. The Ballroom is just gorgeous, large, with such a beautiful balcony all around the top of the Ballroom. Love the Hotel, the Valet is super expensive though! $30 parking for a few hours!!! Crazy!!
