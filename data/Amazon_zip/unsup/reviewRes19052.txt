I don't see anything bad about this place at all. I went to The Bad Apple last night about 6:30. Upon entering, I noticed that everything seems very clean and nothing is out of order. We sat in the bar area at one of the tables. We ordered the goat cheese fondue dip that comes with toasted bread and at first I didn't like it but it grew on me. Next, I ordered the Big Texan burger. THIS BURGER IS PHUCIN AWESOME!! 1/2lb burger topped with pulled pork, onion rings and bbq sauce, all on texas toast. I was assuming the pork and bbq sauce was going to overpower the burger but it did not. The pork and burger were so juicy and tender and it was cooked perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the Pat LaFreida burger and she thought it was wonderful too. Burgers come with fries, which I think the fries that still have some of the potato skin on them are the best. We both washed our burgers down with a couple beers. A Two Brother's something for the lady and a Centennial (draught) IPA for me. Our beers were $4.50 and I think that is reasonable. The Bad Apple also boasts a two page beer menu that pretty much should satisfy anyone's needs. The waiter was friendly and the music they had playing set an awesome vibe for my dinning experience.  I will be back to try more burgers and beers.
