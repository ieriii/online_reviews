The atmosphere was great! LOVE the decor. $5 valet parking, but there was definitely some street parking too! I ended up ordering appetizers for my meal. Guac was good, but could have used some salt and lime. I was really craving salsa and they have NO SALSA. Not a big deal though. Empenada was SO good, loved the sauce and sweet potato! Overall, great experience and the mango margarita was strong and delish!
