I went here last night to celebrate my last day of teaching and the start of summer. The ambiance is laid back and casual but still very cool. Everything was on point. Wine list was very affordable. Dinner was delicious. Before bringing out any food they give you a "snack" of popcorn with truffle oil. It just tasted like popcorn to us. Nothing too special. We started with the Cheez-It Risotto. The combo of PBR onions, cheesy risotto and apples was awesome. The waiter said that it was an homage to Wisconsin and they used all Wisconsin products. When we asked how the Cheez It's fit in he said Graham always eats them on road trips which I thought was cute. We also had the "Chicken wings" with blue cheese and Budweiser foam. The chicken was tender and tasty. We then moved on to our entrees. I had the Salmon BLT which consisted of perfectly cooked salmon topped with pancetta on top of tomatoes and a salad. My boyfriend had the "prime rib" of pork which was huge and had a great flavor. He was especially surprised by the size and loved how tender and delicious it was. Between our dinner and dessert Graham Elliot actually came out to thanks us for coming on opening weekend. He seemed very genuine and sweet. For dessert we had the peanut butter brownie. I declared it a dream come true. It had a brownie which was chocolate and gooey with peanut butter, ice cream, a caramelized banana, and a malt ball. It was deconstructed and each element tasted delicious on its on or combined. Overall it was a fantastic meal. The laid back unpretentious atmosphere made it a fun place to go for an amazing experience with friends.
