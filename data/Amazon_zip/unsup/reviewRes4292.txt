I love the Green Mill. The first time I ever went was for the Uptown Poetry Slam, on a blind date. The guy had an early flight the next morning and bailed early. However I was having fun and wanted to stay. Marc Smith made me a judge of the slam. He asked me why I was qualified, and I said "My date left me, got nothing better to do." So began one of my better nights in Chicago - poets reading me their best seduction stuff and new friends buying drinks.  My other favorite thing to see here is the Patricia Barber quartet on Monday nights. It's not crowded and the music shines through.
