We met up for brunch with a friend at The Gage and had a great experience. The place looks small on the outside but it's actually enormous, with a spacious area in the back and more space downstairs that I assume is open in the evening. The house eggs benedict is made with rabbit hash instead of the traditional canadian bacon, interestingly enough. My friend Janet K. was game for it despite my fit of nostalgia over my childhood pet bunny, Thumper. Our waiter had mine altered to eggs florentine instead, and the hubs went with the corned beef hash.  I'm happy to report all was delicious. My entree came with a cute little cast iron pot filled with their fried potatoes- curiously mixed with brie. They were good but the brie did kind of coagulate and the mix of flavors was a little odd. Not bad, just very different. I think I would've preferred gruyere or maybe a little bit of stilton with the potatoes. The rabbit hash actually looked more like pulled meat than hash, but my dining companions both enjoyed it. The eggs were well done, but the real star of the brunch menu is one of their sides-- goat cheese grits. I am a great lover of cheese grits and these did not disappoint. In fact, they were delicious and I wish I could eat some right now. I would definitely recommend this place as a brunch spot if you're in the area. The service is spectacular and the prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the location (inside one of Chicago's historical landmarks). I'm used to restaurants in touristy spots being overpriced and underwhelming, but The Gage is neither.
