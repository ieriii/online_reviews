Davanti impressed me the first time and the second I was a little disappointed. My first visit we had the following: Vasi - Ricotta + Honey comb - Outstanding, I loved this! Served with toasts and if you ask they will bring you more to finish the Ricotta spread. Paste - Cacio e Pepe - Spaghetti + pecorino + black pepper - Loved this as well, the pecorino cheese and black pepper combined is a wonderful combo. Pizze - Pizza D.O.C. - Tomato + fresh mozzarella + basil - Classic, a must, very good! You cannot go wrong with this! So, over all our choices were very easy and classic I thought. Everything was great and perfect for two. Second trip, since I loved it so much the first time I returned.... Boards - Bruchette - 4 toasts with tonight's toppings - The night we were there it was a corn topping....super bland, not a fan at all! Paste - I had the Cacio e Pepe again (love) then we ordered the Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno - Rigatoni, tomato, sausage and parmigiano. This was excellent, I would recommend this dish to anyone. Pizze - Pizza con Prosciutto e Rucola - Prosciutto, mozzarella, fontina and arugula. This was just okay, not outstanding. I would not order this again either. So, I overall I would return but be choosy about what I ordered. Although I like to go to Italian restaurants where I can order anything and love it regardless.
