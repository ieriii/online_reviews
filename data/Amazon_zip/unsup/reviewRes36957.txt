I always have been, and will remain a fan of hop leaf - they have a great beer selection and great gastropub food. I've never had anything there I didn't enjoy.  My only complaint - I think the new addition looks great, but they managed to buy the most uncomfortable bar stools of any bar. I was there recently with a friend and after sitting on those metal stools for 2 beers we decided to leave because it was just uncomfortable! If you go, try to get a booth or the stools by the kitchen - or stick to the old bar side!
