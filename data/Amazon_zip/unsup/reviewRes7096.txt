I felt like I was walking into a delicious smelling dinner party the way the host explained the place. He showed us the "hip place to hang upstairs" and showed us where the restrooms where, and where to hang out coats. Typically the host just shows you to your table but he took the extra step in helping our party feel comfortable. 2 of us were gluten free - and the gluten free menus were quite extensive. We had pulled homemade pickles, pork with 3 types of sauce (spicy was my fav), coleslaw that we just perfectly creamy, not too much - and I was able to eat french fries because they only fry fries there, and no chance of cross contamination. what a dinner!!! Had plenty left over and the 2nd day it was just as good!
