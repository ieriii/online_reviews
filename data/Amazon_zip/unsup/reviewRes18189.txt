Thoroughly enjoyed The Bad Apple.  Came by for a late dinner over the weekend with homeboy and we both enjoyed scrumptious burgers (me: their one and only veggie burger, him: big texan, a concoction of beef burger, pulled pork, onion rings, maybe more...) and some awesome cocktails (LAURA-SAURAS is amazing! - dark beer + vanilla vodka + framboise; we also geeked out with two Butter Beers - surprisingly tasty!). * Most burger places have a few non-beef options: turkey burger, veggie burger(s), portabella, etc. Ya get one non-beef burger option here: that's the veggie. Which was delicious, don't get me wrong, but I was surprised to not see a turkey burger option as well. That being said, they do have many non-beef sandwiches from which to choose, for the non-beef-eaters.  * We enjoyed the food, but I've knocked them down to 4 because our fries appeared to be 'bottom of the greaser' type of fries. They were super dark (in a greasy way, not in a skin-on, or roasted kind of way), uber crispy and were just way overdone. We still ate a good portion of them (which seemed like a good idea at the time because we had been drinking, it was late, and we were starving - but this proved to *not be a good idea after all), but we agreed, we probably got some reject fries. I hope they're not always cooked this way.  I'd love to go back to try more of their cocktails, and give their fries and some other menu items another shot. If cocktails aren't your thing, their beer menu is pretty great.
