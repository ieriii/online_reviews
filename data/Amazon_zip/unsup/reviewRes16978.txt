Hmm - what to say, what to say. I came here around seven on a Saturday - which meant no line, cuz I do not rock the line shit. Oh, and I'm def not a drink connoisseur - give me some strong fruity shit or a Captain's and diet and I'm all good. I did appreciate the uniqueness and attention that goes into each drink here - and I loved that I was tasting something I knew I couldn't get anywhere else.  I do regret not sitting at the bar - my friend and I were super comfy in our chairs but I would've killed to see the bartenders in action. Getting the chance to ask questions and hear about the construction and ingredients of all the different drinks would've been worth the risk of my weak ass friend falling off her seat at the bar. Anyways, the only downside was our semi-toolesque waitress. She was cool and attentive at the beginning, but I had to chase her down for our check at the end. And by chase her down I mean follow her to the bar, have her ignore me, and have to have the bartender tell her I was trying to get her attention. Oh, and then I had to point out where we were sitting, cuz she had no idea who the hell I was. I just hope/keep telling myself her ass is super spacey, cuz I refuse to admit I'm that fucking boring or forgettable - maybe in ten years when I'm rocking mom jeans and driving a minivan, but certainly not now.
