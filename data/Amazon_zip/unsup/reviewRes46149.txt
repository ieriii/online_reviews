As a Chicago tourist, Grand Lux Cafe was delicious and convenient! It's downtown, right along the Magnificent Mile. If you are lucky enough to be seated by the giant windows, you'll have a fantastic view of the city. It's like your tucked away in a cozy, warm cafe, looking outside the window, people watching and observing the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago streets. My family and I lucked out the afternoon we went, it wasn't very busy or crowded. I love the decor, kind of "golden glamorous" -- kind of similar to the Cheesecake Factory but I didn't get that "this is a franchise restaurant" feeling when we were seated or while we were dining. Absolutely delicious pasta dishes, very large portions -- so they're comparable to the price. We received excellent customer service, and didn't wait very long for our drinks, or food to arrive. We even saved room for the famous hot and delicious Beignes (we were advised to order these in advance so we wouldn't be waiting 30 minutes for them to arrive - great suggestion). Overall, Grand Lux is an awesome cafe, definitely made it on my list of yummy and inexpensive places to dine in Chicago!
