Upscale & trendy....just how I like 'em. I love this place, and after reading some reviews, I only hate that I have never been for dinner; only drinks. The bartenders are attentive, friendly, and give great service. The downstairs lounge is marvelous; with a private feel. Only thing is, when we went, downstairs only took cash, so we had to cut our night short once our cash was depleted. Definitely a nice spot to chill in the downstairs lounge.
