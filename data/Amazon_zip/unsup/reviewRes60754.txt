Going to Lockdown before the Blackhawks game has become a tradition for us! Every chance I get, I bring friends to the place and they leave happy! The food is incredible, the atmosphere is great and there is always something fun going on there to enjoy (from a suburban person visiting the city that is!)The burgers are out of this world, the steak sandwich is phenom, and the salads are amazing. Even with all that said, the Macaroni and Cheese is out of this world!Look forward to every chance I get to go down there and eat- makes the crappy 1.5 hour commute worth the wait! Keep up the great job and I look forward to the expansion! Hawks winning the game makes for a perfect dessert too! See lots of hawks fans in the place beofre games too which is nice!
