A few friends and I went here last night and, much to our surprise, were able to get a table within a half hour. The atmosphere was a little loud, but definitely had a great, hip vibe. The food was fantastic. We started with the cheese and meat plate, selecting a parmesan, mozzarella, goat cheese, salami and prosciutto. There was a very tasty raisin bread that accompanies the plate. For our main courses, we ordered grilled asparagus with pickled rhubarb, roasted beets, and risotto carbonara. The asparagus was surprisingly good. I have never really been exposed to rhubarb, but it served as an excellent complement to the asparagus. The roasted beets were out of this world! They came topped with candied walnuts and had walnut butter on the side. Definitely the best beets that I have ever had. The risotto was excellent and entertaining. It was perfectly creamy. And you get to mix the egg yolk in right at your table. I also had the opportunity to try a sip of my girlfriend's specialty cocktail, and man was it potent! Long story short...You should check out Davanti Enoteca. You won't be disappointed.
