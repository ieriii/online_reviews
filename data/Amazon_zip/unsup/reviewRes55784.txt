Great food and good prices! Classy atmosphere without feeling overly trendy, or stuffy. The Seafood salad was amazing, so much seafood, I couldn't finish it. Lots of different choices to chose from on the menu, I also hear their ribs are great. It's a must visit in Andersonville, it is no wonder why they've been there so long
