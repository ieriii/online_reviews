Four of us had 8:45 reservations on a Saturday night. The place was packed and we had to wait for a while in the stuffed bar. When we were offered a table, it was in the bar area - which we thought was ok (before we noticed that the dining room was so much nicer). Our waiter was sort of amusing, but some of his food suggestions were off base. Fried green tomatoes, shrimp/grits, and KC competition ribs were good. Hush puppies, Mac/cheese, and greens were average. Kobe brisket was dry and a waste, and the pulled pork was cold / not memorable. We all agreed we would go back for KC ribs.
