I got in line at 1030am and waited in line a little over an hour. Would I do it again? Hell yeah. Duck fat fries, were delicious... although I'm not quite sure I'd be able to tell the difference besides in color. The Chicago dog at $1.75 was delicious and a steal. For our specialty sausages, we had 3 foie dogs, 1 rattlesnake, and one pork sausage. The foie dogs, at $9/ were a steal given the generous slices of foie on top... I was taking the smallest bites milking mine to the last bite... the rattlesnake sausage wasn't gamey at all and so good... tricked my mom into eating it, boy was she mad when she found out, haha. And the pork sausage with the cheese on top was also very good. I cannot wait to come back here when I'm back in Chicago. *****
