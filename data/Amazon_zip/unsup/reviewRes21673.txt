I went here for dinner after running the CARA Lakefront 10-miler earlier in the day, so I definitely brought my appetite! Our large party was seated in the spacious back room comfortably, and service was just fine- no complaints! Food: I got the 2 taco plate with ground beef, rice and refried beans-- very tasty and satisfying! The boyfriend got steak fajitas w/guacamole and also enjoyed them. The best part? The flavored house margaritas! I had strawberry and raspberry flavors and they were deeelicious and fairly strong (bonus after my race...I slept like a baby that night) Not super cheap, but food is good quality and tasty---I would love to go back for more margaritas!! :)
