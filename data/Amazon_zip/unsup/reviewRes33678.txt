After five or six visits, Mia Francesca has become a neighborhood favorite. Whether dining with family, a group of girls, or date night, it's a great place to go. I typically order a pasta dish and have never been disappointed - they have a constantly changing menu and I always ask the waiter what he likes best right now. Huge portion sizes, average prices ($13-$17 entrees), and good wine keep me coming back. The place is very crowded, so if that bothers you, I'd pick another place. And if you're there in the summer, try getting a spot on their tiny little back patio.
