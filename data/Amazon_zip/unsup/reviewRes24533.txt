If there were 6 stars, Geja's, you would get them. I can't believe how many times I've been here in the past and haven't reviewed it.  Let's start with the staff.  Every time I have been there, they have been incredibly kind and helpful for all the first timers I bring. They recommend great wine, just enough food, and have excellent service. Those complaining about the price, go somewhere else. You will not get the trifecta of atmosphere, wonderful service, and outstanding food that you get here.  You start out with the melted gruyere and crunchy bread, and frankly, I'd be ok with that and skipping to dessert. Eat slowly, because you will soon enter food coma.  I was there with 2 vegetarians, and they have veggie/tofu platters that surprised and delighted them.  The rest of our table had beef, chicken, and scallops. It was restaurant week, so for $30 per person, we had ridiculous amounts of food.  I have to say a word about the dipping sauces, there is a huge platter of them that will rival any chef who loves making marinades and sauces like I do. I'm a fan of the dill sauce, but also love the garlic sauce as well.  A little flavor of everything for everyone.  The night we were there they had a great flamenco musician, which kept us awake for the last course of melted chocolate, fruit, and sweetbread.  On our ride back in the cab, one of my companions did indeed fall into food coma, but it may have been the wine. She's a tiny girl.  There's just something fun and intimate about going with a group. I've gone with 2, 4, and 8 people. Every time it is the same amazing experience. You will never be sorry visiting Geja's. Just don't plan to do anything else afterwards, you will be overstuffed. For me it was kind of like eating at my grandma's.
