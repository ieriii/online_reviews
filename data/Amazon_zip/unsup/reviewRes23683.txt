I used to love this place-- quality crepes, and extra bonus..zabiha halal meat! HOWEVER, it grieves me to say this, but icosium now only lives in the shadow of its former glory. as the other raters mention, the crepes have in fact shrunk, and I was left feeling hungry after sharing one savory and one sweet sucker with my fellow. At first i thought they were much smaller due to the new presentation (rolled up as opposed to the former triangular shape), but i'm sure that wasn't the case. For savory, we ordered the Marrakech (indulging in my compulsive habit of customizing by substituting feta instead of cream cheese) with the morrocan sausage-- i admit it was very good. For sweet, we ordered the Bella, but they ran out of belgian chocolate so they substituted with nutella-- not particularly good, and kind of a rip off. I had gotten this in the 'golden olden' times, and i loved it....so it was really disappointing. ...overall, it's decent, but just not what it used to be (i have to give props to the service and the polite waitress we had though!). i won't be making special trips just to eat here unless they revert back to what they were. i left a polite note on my receipt, and i hope the manager considers my 'cries' and brings me back my beloved icosium.
