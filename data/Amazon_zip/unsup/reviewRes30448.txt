MMM, Nanadict! I love a great eggs benedict and nana did not disappoint! 1. Perfectly poached egg, runny yellow solid white 2. Crispy delicious pupusas 3. Spicy chorizo 4. Mild poblano hollandaise I'm willing to dish out $13 for breakfast + $3 for coffee as long as it is for something extra tasty and filling.
