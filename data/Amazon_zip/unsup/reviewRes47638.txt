I want to give this place 3,75 stars. Nothing unpleasant, but nothing super amazing for the price you pay too. It's basically an independently-owned Fogo de Chao. You pay approximately $60/person if you do the regular fair. It was my first time in Chicago and my friend's parents wanted to treat us to a nice dinner in downtown. My impressions: - Nice, hip, downtown-y atmosphere and quite friendly staff from the hostess to the watiress - Kinda pricey! $44 for the combination of access to Harvest Buffet (basically 2 choices of soup, couple of different slices of cheese and 2-3 different versions of boring salads) and 5-6 small pieces of meats of your choice (sausage, fish, beef and pork) that they not-so-frequently bring. $9/glass Pinot Noir and $9 for dessert. I mean, if the meat were grass-fed / free-range / wildly caught: that would be definitely worth it. But, I don't think it was. - Normal service. Nothing bad, nothing amazing. I'm not a huge fan of steakhouses or Fogo de Chao-ish places, so if you like that stuff, you might really enjoy ZED 451.
