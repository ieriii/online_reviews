I will come back later to finish this... but WOW. almost 3 hours of food and winegasms. 8 of 10 courses became my new favorite everything, and the other 2 were still fantastic. By "fantastic" I mean they met my every single want and dream, but didn't exceed them by 200% or more like the other 8. Fois Gras lollipop starters are a must. Don't forget to check out Grahamwich on near state and erie for a helluva lunch, too.
