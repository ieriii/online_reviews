Just a few notes. I think the $19.95 lunch special has officially ended or they overcharged us a little - $23.95/pp. I absolutely love their salad bar - especially the creamy mushroom risotto. I think their meat is second-rate to Fogo but Fogo doesn't have grilled pineapples! So I think Brazzaz edges out Fogo for lunch or the non-voracious meateater.
