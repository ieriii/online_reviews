Spacca Napoli serves delicate thin-crust pizzas that are apparently prepared in a very authentic Neopolitan Style - never having been to Naples or Italy, I can't vouch for the authenticity, but the pizzas I have tried have all been delicious. The also serve a few simple Italian appetizers and desserts. If you plan to visit for dinner, make reservations if you can, I've been lucky to getting seated right when they open for dinner at 5:00, but by 6:00 their dining room was already full & there was a line out the door of folks waiting to get seated.
