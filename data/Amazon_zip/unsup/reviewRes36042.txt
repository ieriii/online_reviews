The Beijing Duck Dinner really is fantastic. Two in our party were not going to partake in the duck, but couldn't resist eating it once it was rolled out to our table, sliced and made into soup and added to fried rice. Also had the garlic ribs and Hong Kong pork, both were great. Will be back again. This is my new fave Chinese restaurant.
