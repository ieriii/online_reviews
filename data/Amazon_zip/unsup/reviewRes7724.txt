Good, but not great. I went here with a group of friends. We enjoyed the seafood, ribs, and pasta and our waiter was friendly and competent. We did not enjoy our rather loud neighbors who seemed to have just finished a few rounds at a sports bar. The wine list could be more extensive and the parmigiana should be made without breading the eggplant. All-in-all, I would return to this restaurant.
