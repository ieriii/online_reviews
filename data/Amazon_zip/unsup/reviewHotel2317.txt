Really conveniently located hotel with lovely rooms. I was here one night earlier this week, and the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds I have been in in months.  I also liked that they had a busy bar scene on Tues night around 11pm- looked like a lot of biz folks were at the hotel and that was nice, since it's also tourist season and it sucks to travel for business and stay at a hotel filled with families. Makes you miss home even more :) Also, room was large and the hotel was right on the Magnificent Mile, close to tons of good restaurants and SHOPPING!
