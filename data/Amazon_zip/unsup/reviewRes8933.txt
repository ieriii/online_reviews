Spacca Napoli's inside decor and outside patio is way cute! Plus Spacca is located on a side street right in the middle of a neighborhood so it's nice and peaceful.  Just perfect for a nice weekday dinner out with some friends. My BF and I went with our friends Jenny and Ed. They had gotten there a bit earlier and ordered the meat and cheese plate. I saw the remains and got the chance to snack on a bit of cheese and meat. It's seemed like a pretty good meat and cheese platter. We ordered three pizzas, the bufalina pizza, the funghi (the sausage and mushroom pizza) and the spicy salami one. The Bufalina, if you like cheese, is pretty cheesy and tasty. There is no red sauce on this one, it remains true to its name and is pretty much fresh mozzeralla cheese on flat bread with olive oil. Who would have thought something so simple would taste so good. My favorite though was the spicy salami pizza, it had an awesome kick.  As many reviewers have said, the middle of the pizza does tend to be quite soft, but since I like a soft crust it didn't really make a difference to me. Just a warning though, if you decide to pick it up and eat it with your hands, be careful of the pizza slice bending in half and the toppings falling to either your plate, or worse, your pants!
