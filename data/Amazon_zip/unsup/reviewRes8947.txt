This is another one of my family favorites, especially on the "tanned skin" side of the family(hah, i go to the beach without sunblock) - so you know this restaurant is authentic. Like many of the Middle eastern restaurants, the portions are huge - but lets talk about the flavors that stick on the taste buds and stay in the brain for what seems forever. Meat marinated to perfection; the shish and chicken will have you asking for extra napkins for your saliva. Oh, and it's tender too. My favorite addition to the meat is the rice, Basmati rice, saffron rice, dill rice, whatever rice you order is WOW. Pounds and pounds of Basmati rice seems to fill the plate, and pounds and pounds seem to leave the restaurant when we're done. It's all that good. Finish it off with some hot tea - it is the perfect complement to the 5 lbs of love you just consumed. The tea is a special blend that is so outstanding, i haven't been able to find it anywhere else, even Teavana throws their hands up on this one. I remember when this place was a hidden hole in the wall gem. Now it's expanded in the last number of years, but hasn't lost it's touch. Whether you go or not is up to you, if not, its just less time I have to wait to get in!
