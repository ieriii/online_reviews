Almost always crowded - great for people watching, but you may need to wait for a table. The service is hit or miss with the staff - a lot of friendly mixed with a little bit put out to be there. Look, I know, your job sucks, but so do ours. And I know that servers hate this, but I've been there, so I know you have to just suck it up and put on your best happy pants face sometimes. Like I said, most of the staff are friendly, and efficient (which is even more important), but there are one or two duds in there. The bartenders are great, so if you have the chance, eat at the bar downstairs. If it's not swamped, they'll chat you up and swap stories, tell you what's the best on the menu for food and drinks, etc. The crowd is a mix of locals and people from other neighborhoods. Also a mix of ages, etc.
