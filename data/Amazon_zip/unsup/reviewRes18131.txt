This quaint Italian eatery is still among my favorites in Chicago, and this was confirmed on a recent visit. A group of 14 of us descended upon there for a friend's birthday dinner, and they were pretty awesome to us.  Everybody really enjoyed their food. From the homemade gnocchi to the salmon drizzled with honey soy sauce, everything was delightful. The BYOB aspect is always a crowd pleaser. And they were very accomodating to our humongous, loud group.
