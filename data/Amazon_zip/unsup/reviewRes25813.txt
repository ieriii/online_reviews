The four and five star reviews are wrong. This place sucked in my opinion. My barbeque spare ribs were a tough sinewy mess that made my jaw sore from trying to chew through this tepid mess. Should have sent it back, but I never ever do that.  Wife's duck dish was blah, more or less. The BYOB at no charge was a positive for us to enjoy a high quality wine, but there were too many tables teeming with bored toddlers yelling while their parents were getting wasted with their friends with kids as well, probably trying to put themselves out of their parental misery at our expense. Found that all very annoying.  And this was at 8:30pm on a weeknight.
