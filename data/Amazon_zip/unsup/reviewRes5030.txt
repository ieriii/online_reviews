My mom and I went to Chicago for the weekend and I was told by several chefs that I had to go to Purple Pig. She isn't a huge foodie, but I persuaded her to give it a try. We started with the Pork Fried Almonds with roasted garlic. I am never one to order mixed nuts on a menu, but I must say these were phenomenal! We also finished dinner with the Sicilian Iris. This wasn't on their normal menu... I had seen it on their website. This was a brioche dough filled with chocolate and ricotta, deep fried and topped with powdered sugar (enough said!). These were so delicious that we went back the next day and bought two to take back to Indy. Even if you are not into crispy pig ears or fried pig tail, this place is sure to please!
