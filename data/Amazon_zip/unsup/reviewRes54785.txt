Celiac's beware!!! Meli's lists several items which are gluten free - I was very excited about this because I have celiac disease. When I talked to my waitress this past Friday at lunch about gluten she didn't seem to know what I was talking about - so I went the safe route and ordered a basic salad. The salad arrived with a piece of bread on it - so I explained that I can not have wheat (at this point it wasn't worth describing what gluten is) and asked to have another salad made. In half an hours time I found I had been glutened! I'm still sick (usually getting sick from gluten takes about two weeks to get over). I called the restaurant to let them know what had happened. A gentleman named Chris implied that I had called to try to get a free meal as well as implying that Meli's didn't get me sick. I told him that I had gotten sick and even a free meal wouldn't be enough to get me to come back to his restaurant. I thought I was doing the responsible thing to alert him to the problem.
