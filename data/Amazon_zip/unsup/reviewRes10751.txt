At over 800 reviews, what else can I add? This is honestly the best pizza I have ever had in my life. Pizza, beer and Wicker Park. Excellent. The place was jam-packed on a Wednesday night, but since it was just me and my friend, we were seated immediately...albeit at a long table with four other people, but we were hungry. My friend and I started off with the warm spinach and tomato dip. It looks small but it split perfectly. For our pizza, we got the red pizza with roasted red peppers, chicken and mushrooms. I washed it down with the Golden Arm beer. So great. Not much more to say... except you should go here.
