My boyfriend and I went here on a recommendation from a co-worker the night previous. It is a bit far from our area but totally worth the trek! We sat outside and ordered two pizzas, one with red sauce and truffles and the other with olive oil and mozzarella and basil, and they came out shortly after we ordered. The pizzas were big enough for one person, so it was good that we ordered 2 of them since we destroyed them. The waiter explained to us how they cook the pizzas and that it only takes a few seconds in the oven. He was also very friendly and helped us figure out where the bus back to our area was even though we decided to walk. We will go back again and I am excited to try other options!
