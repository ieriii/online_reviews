I love love love this place. Anything made with sloe gin and fizz makes my mouth tingle (in a good way!) and Violet Hour has such a huge selection of fancy, innovative, and unique cocktails! The wait can get pretty outrageous but I thought it was worth it. Try to avoid coming with a big group, though, because you might not be able to sit together without waiting for an eternity. I can't wait to try Violet Hour again!!!
