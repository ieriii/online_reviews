Sometimes it's nice to not have to do all the work. To come into a restaurant and have it say right on the menu next to the vegetarian taco, "A vegan's choice." that works just fine for me.  And the taco was impressive, massive and deliciously tasty. I didn't catch too much hotness from the hot peppers but that's okay. I went a little wild and topped the taco off with some plantains--brilliant move.  I also got an oatmeal shake with soy milk and the waiter dude informed me a "users tip" to stir in the cinnamon...really not too sure what else I would have done with it, but it was delicious.  As hyped up as this place was to me, it still lived up to it's expectations. Yah! Irazu!!
