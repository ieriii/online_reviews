This place was so awesome - in fact, I can't believe it's taken me this long to review it. I went there the night of the VP debate, which had been well-advertised and thus was pretty crowded.Just the fact that they even HAD a viewing party for the VP debate endeared me to them from the beginning. They even had us sit "communally," which was fun, so we could bond with our fellow anti-Palin-ers. My friend and I split the pulled pork sandwich (huge and yummy, and the have WAFFLE FRIES!!!) and the mac n' cheese, also delicious, not to mention had a few beers. After the debate was over (and we were drunk and happy), we pulled out the electronic Catchphrase, and since there were 3 of us girls at the table, our server (who as I recall fuzzily was like a cuter Seth Rogan) jumped in and played several rounds with us. It was great fun. Not sure how this place would be on a non-debate night (I could hear the Cubs fans upstairs yelling at the TV's), but I'd guess it's basically the same, except that everyone is rooting for a sports team and not a politician. Super fun though. Go there. Eat the mac n' cheese. Play Catchphrase with the server.
