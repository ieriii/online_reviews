We were a group of 30+ and chose to book the private room on the second floor. The set menu that was prepared for us was good. We had 3 different pieces of sushi roll as starters, two salads (spinach mushroom, chicken and greens), deep fried shrimp balls with sweet sauce on top, cod on eggplant, canton chow mein (did not taste good), breaded chicken breast. Overall the food was good, the ambiance was great but the bill came to $140 including all you can drink (however most of us had 1-3 drinks and i had a non-alchoholic drink. We were charged for people that did not show up due to flight delays due to hurricane Irene.
