Had dinner with friends from phoenix and they knew the server...small world! Small dinning room, but great service. We had the mac and cheese to start and as an entree, I had a fantastic veggie burger. We had some wonderful beer and a bottle of organic wine. Overall fun time! Can't wait to go back for some vegan carrot cake!!
