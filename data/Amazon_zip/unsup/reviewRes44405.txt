This use to be my most favorite place in the city but they've recently raised their prices as well as their byob corkage fee and I think the sushi is starting to fail as well. I long for Wakamono from days of long ago. Please Wakamono I am asking you to do me this one favor. Go back to the way you were, to the way we were. I miss you.
