I've been to this and the location on Washington a few times, but this weekend was the first time I tried their red beans and rice with eggs: Can I tell you how good it was? Well it was really good. Good rice, the beans and sausage were spicy just enough and the eggs were done nicely, not too runny, just enough, the biscuits were very good but i could have left without the other sausage on the plate... not sure it just seemed out of place ( but who am I to complain about extra food, seriously). Nice staff is a plus and every time I walk into Wishbone I am greeted promptly and seated without much of a wait ( unless its ungodly busy ), the wait staff are very friendly and were engaging.
