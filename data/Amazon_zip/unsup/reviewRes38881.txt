La Villa should change their name to Disappointment Pizza. We ordered from them last night, first time (based on Yelp comments and attempt to support our neighborhood restaurants). We ordered two different thin-crust pizzas and a salad, and we asked/stressed the desire to have our pizza cut properly in a pie shaped (yes - a slice! Not this crazy Chicago/midwestern need to chop the damned pizza into little puzzle pieces). Anyway, picked up our order: 1 pizza w/ artichoke hearts and tomato; another with sausage, pepperoni and any other various meats they could toss on. Both pizzas were somewhat burned; the tops were dark and the crust was very dry and tasted a bit like burned toast. We all felt quite amazed at the absolute LACK OF FLAVOR of either pizza. In fact, I'd have to say, probably two of the worst pizzas I've ever had. I ate a minimal amount just to keep me alive through the night but hated every moment of the chewing and swallowing. PS - they went ahead and cut the damned thing all whackedy instead of pie-cut as requested. Violence ensued. Now the quest to find good thin crust pizza in the Irving Park/Avondale neighborhoods must continue.
