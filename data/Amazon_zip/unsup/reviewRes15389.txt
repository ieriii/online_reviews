i know i've reviewed this place before but now i've eaten there and holy shit. 10oz of ground beef with pepperjack AND 3oz of carolina-style pulled pork piled on top of it! my god it was awesome! seriously good. the gentleman sitting next to me at the bar ordered the bacon wrapped monkfish special. it looked fantastic. he couldn't stop telling me how fantastic it was. his words to describe it, "this is the best meal i've had in chicago. things like this make me want to quit my job and become a food critic."
