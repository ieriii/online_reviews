It's 2am...I'm starving...I have 10 dollars left. Did I really spend that much money at that last bar?....Oh well at least I have enough for a cab ride home, BUT I'm so hungry ....mmmm Mexican...wait GARCIAS...cab...Garcia's...cab...Garcia's Garcia's will always win! True I give this place bonus points for late night dining but its rare to find a place that I am dying for at 2pm as much as when its 2am. The burritos are seriously huge, I suggest the suizo style where they layer a ton of cheese on it.  They are large enough to share even for those who aren't the size 2...oh I just ate a salad and I'm stuffed types (completely unrelated but what's up with those people anyways). The salsa is good the chicken enchiladas are amazing and everything is pretty. On the down side this place is insanely noisy. Even when it's not busy I have trouble carrying on a conversation across the table. Service can be a bit so-so I haven't had any overall bad experiences but I have found myself rationing my beverage intake while waiting for an MIA server.
