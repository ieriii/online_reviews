Great. This deep dish has the best crust, in my opinion of "the big three" (Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's) - it is flaky in a good way, and adds just a bit of crunch to the otherwise gooey and squishy pizza. The sauce is sauce, not puree (like Gino's East) or stewed chunks (like Lou's), but has good flavor and just a bit of acidic bite. The famous upper-crust is there if you look, but honestly, I don't taste or feel it when I eat it, and if I didn't look for it, I'd never know it was there. The cheese, of course, is excellent as well. This is perhaps the thickest slice of the big three deep dish pies. On a negative note, this location is stingy with toppings. My recent visit included both Italian sausage on one pie and pepperoni on another. There were, sadly, perhaps two or three sausage chunks per slice. Pretty sad, in that most bites were just cheese pizza. The pepperoni was flat layered at the bottom, and sparse as well. I could see it in cross-section, but could not even taste it - just not enough of it there... This location gets pretty crowded, so expect a wait for a table. But their lobby/hostess stand area is tiny, so no way can all the waiting parties wait there, so you wait outside with everybody else. PLEASE GET AN INTERCOM!!! They have none, so if you wait outside, even 10 feet from the door, you'll never hear them call your name. So what do you do? Well, you wait outside, then 10 minutes before you expect to be seated, you have to bust into the hot and crowded hostess/lobby just to listen for your name. It's packed, hot, and uncomfortable. GIORDANO'S, PLEASE FIX THIS!
