This is my new favorite brunch/breakfast spot, and I have never had a problem with service here, despite what other reviews say. If you aren't getting good service try sitting at the counter, they will never stop refilling your coffee. I have only eaten brunch here, but I've never had a problem with a wait -- it's never been more than 10 minutes, even with 3 people on a Sunday. Maybe they like me, or maybe they recognize their regulars? The New Orleans scramble is delicious, the chocolate chip, apple, and blueberry pancakes are too, as is the french toast and the hash browns. Eventually I will get an omelette here, but I can't comment on those now. I love that they have tons of sugary cereals available, the coffee is good, and the prices and portions are very reasonable. I just wish they had bagels.
