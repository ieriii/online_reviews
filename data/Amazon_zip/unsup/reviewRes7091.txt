Food ok.. BBQ is hard to master but should be mastered if you are a BBQ restuarant. This place has not mastered it yet. Usually, you can smell BBQ cooking and you couldn't here which was weird to me. The ribs were good but not great, the corn bread dry, and the fries left something to be desired. The portions were large so I suggest sharing an appetizer and an entree. Overall I would go back but may try something else.
