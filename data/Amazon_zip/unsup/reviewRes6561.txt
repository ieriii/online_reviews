Wow, this was on my third visit to the neighborhood and it was so good! Me and my cute, short-haired friend had the Pollo 'Sole Mio', perfectly grilled with an *amazing* side salad (I kind of feel bad my friend didn't try it... I haven't had such a good salad in a long while, so good...), The Divanti Burger which really hit the spot and an order of Bruschette (...so good...). I wanted to order more but I (we) had to behave... They also have a mouth-watering selection of wines (Which, I'm sad to say, we didn't get a chance to try. But DEFINITELY next month) and they have an excellent cheese selection (which, again, we will try next time. With the wine!) If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend this place!!
