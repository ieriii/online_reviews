I thought I should write something from a service perspective here. After my first review, the restaurant attempted to contact me and at one point succeeded as I walked into a meeting and could not speak long. I applaud Steve and his team for following up in an effort to make my experience at Shaw's a better one. While I have not been back, I will surely, make that effort in the near future. They have certainly worked hard to earn my patronage and I can certainly appreciate it. Thank you
