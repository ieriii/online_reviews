great, of course, for vegans, but NOT good for gluten-free people. one time the waitress told me they could make me plain rice with vegetables, and when i was eating it, i found a few huge chunks of seitan - in other words, 100% gluten! - right in my food! when i told the waitress, she was like, oh, gee, huh. i was sick for 6 weeks. it's kind of a big deal! i didn't eat there again for over a year and a half. gave them a second chance, and was made sick again. i will never, never, never eat there again! it gives me tissue damage!!!
