My sister and her husband brought me here during one of my visits - amazing! The duck is just delicious. The skin is so crispy and fatty, I don't know why there aren't bags of duck skin chips. The little buns were fluffy and made perfect little sandwiches. The soup was greasy and warming, while the duck fried rice was rich and filling. I cannot believe how much food you get for such as small price. The only thing we didn't really care for was the crab because there wasn't much meat. I am definitely coming back here when I am in town again!
