I came to this place a couple months ago with the gf when I decided I wanted something out of the norm. It was a lot pricier than what I'm used to but I wanted to splurge. I'd just made a good amount of money from a recent project and wanted something different and on the expensive side. The food itself was rather good. It was presented in a very good manner and the taste was exquisite. The servers were very well trained and knowledgeable when they brought us out our food. They would tell us what the dish was and what was the best way to eat it get the full flavor profile. Make sure you pay attention because the way you eat it actually has a lot of impact on how it tastes. Certain things are meant to be eaten together in the same bite to give it its maximum use of whichever ingredient. My only complaint about this place is that the portions were small but then again it's fine dining and that's the trend nowadays. Smaller portions.
