Decent pizza, really not mind blowing. They have a lot of different options for toppings which is always fun. Friends and I tried Fogo's version of a supreme pizza, the veggies were good and the sausage and pepperoni tasty, and we also got one that had sun-dried tomatoes, basil and mushrooms. I didn't really notice any basil at all, the pizza sounded on the menu more interesting than it was. We ordered it delivered and it was supposed to get there in 45 minutes, it took an hour and 15 min... So that's not good, considering we were all starving. With lots of good pizza places (both thin and Chi-town style) to try in this town, I don't know if I'll be back any time soon.
