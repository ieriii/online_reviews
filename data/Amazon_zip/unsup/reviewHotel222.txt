I snagged a great rate on Hotwire to stay at the Indigo for one night on a recent stay. The location was very convenient from Midway airport. I hopped right on the orange line, transferred at Roosevelt to the Red Line, and walked from the Division stop. Very easy! I also liked the neighborhood, which was a more upscale, residential part of Chicago I hadn't seen before. I felt safe walking here by myself after dark. It is also a few steps from the Third Coast cafe, which is one of my new favorite places in Chicago. The rooms at the Indigo are brightly colored and I couldn't help but get a little giggly at the boardwalk decor. It was slightly on the schmaltzy side, but I still liked it. The bed was comfy and the room was larger than I expected. I would definitely stay at the Indigo again, especially if I can get a good rate.
