really like this place, eaten here at least 20 times. - food is creative and tastes not like 'bar food' at all. there is nothing 'typical' about the taste. their mac and cheese is a favorite - prices are reasonable - friendly and attentive staff - the owners are nice guys and you can tell they have a passion for what they do - atmosphere and patrons are laid back i recommend fifty/50 to all my friends and will stop in myself later this week.
