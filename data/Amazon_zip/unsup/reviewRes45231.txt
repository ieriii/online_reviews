With so many great Italian places, this was not my first choice but I was with a group (6 ppl) and obliged. The fact of the matter was, it was a good meal but I hardly see myself returning there anytime soon, namely due to the fact that there is no valet service (tough parking area), its VERY loud there and, as I said, there are just so many good Italian spots already. This just didnt make the grade. In defense though, its a very good place. If I lived around the corner, I'd probably go again. Strong selection of appetizers with a few standouts including the grilled octopus and bean dish, although the roasted beets were quite bland. My scallop main course that I shared was very good but the grilled calamari was a bit spicier than I had planned. Desserts were downright bad. Nothing worth ordering there I thought, but most Italian desserts are mediocre at best.
