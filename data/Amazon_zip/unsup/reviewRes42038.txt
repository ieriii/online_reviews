My favorite Noodle place in the Arglye/Broadway are - really good soups and other fun dishes - Expansive and Quasi-Eclectic Menu, rock bottom prices, BYOB, and generous portions...I do agree with Stephanie M. that you are usually waited on by (sometimes that is) different people during your dining visit and the service can be a tad bit slow sometimes (especially when they're really busy, which they can be as this place is very popular), but that's a small price to pay for how good the overall experience is, if you haven't been there before, you owe it to yourself to go
