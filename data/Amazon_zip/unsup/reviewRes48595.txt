Sweet piggy and beery goodness! I really really enjoy the publican. Although I will get the bad out of the way right now, the NYE dinner I had here was meh at best but that is really the best I can expect from anywhere on NYE. Otherwise I love this place. My favorite way to dine here is just to stand at one of the bar high tables for a few hours and get food off that menu. You can have beer after beer and make a nice 5+ course meal for yourself with cheese, frites (w/ egg), trio of hams (drooool), pork rinds, oysters, chicken, muscles and others. Sounds like a pretty awesome meal to me, who needs to sit? The beer list here is probably one of the best curated lists in Chicago. They do tend to focus on the rare bottles here if you are draft beer inclined.
