Went here last night and we were glad we did. Great meal, great atmosphere and great service. What more could you want, maybe a free dessert...got that too. Started with a grilled calamari in a light balsamic sauce appetizer. It was outstanding. We had the osso bucco over lasagna and the linguinie with scallops, rapini, basil and garlic sauce. Both were delicious. The staff were all attentive right down to fixing a wobbly table. After talking with our waiter about how Chicago has avoided the scourge that is chain restaurants so far, out comes a slice of tiramisu (sp) compliments of the manager. If you are looking for a place to go, try this one. You will not be sorry.
