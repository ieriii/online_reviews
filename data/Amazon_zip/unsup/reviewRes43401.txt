It's been said on other reviews but I'll say it again anyways, the ordering process is odd, you go up to a counter, try to quickly figure out what you want, order and then stand around waiting for a table. It's a bit of a cluster... But, the patio is nice (on a warm day) and the food is okay. I thought the menu was a bit limited, so I ended up just having the granola and yogurt which was actually quite good, but a friend's breakfast didn't look so appetizing.  I was hugely disappointed in the coffee, if you sit outside there's a thermos for refills and the coffee in this thermos is like a watered down version of folgers, YUK.  I don't think I'll ever be back.
