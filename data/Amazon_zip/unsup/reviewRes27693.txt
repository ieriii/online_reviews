Ok, first thing you need to know is make a reservation several weeks in advance or be prepared to wait to be seated. This place is a hot spot. The best way to make a fabulous Mexican restaurant is a fabulous margarita. We were able to taste the menu and settled on one to be the best. Blue Agave was very sour... I ordered it bc I love sour and this was too sour. The Gold was OK, nothing too exciting, tastes just like a regular typical one...hands down the best one was the Topolo. Seriously a bomb margarita! I would go back to have one of these again. Appetizers- you have to order the Trio Trio Trio, which is a trio of ceviches, OMG sooo good and all very different. One is limey, another has a mango or papaya taste and the other is a little spicy. It was Chris's first time having sopes. I explained to him what it was and he didn't seem excited... but I ordered it anyway. It was delicious, the little corn bowls were fluffy and strong enough to hold the yummy bits of pork inside. Not huge portions so don't be shy putting in an order. Which leads me to the pork... oh the pork! Get anything with pulled pork, whether it's an entree or apps, you won't be disappointed. It's a little on the salty side but they make their own sour cream which is such a nice balance. It's super good. Things we didn't like: Don't order the plantains, they were tough, heavy, and gummy, overall just not very good (see Plantains at Cha Cha Cha in San Francisco!) The other thing we didn't like were the flautas, kind of felt like the flautas at a Chevy's, not very inventive or worth the prices at a place like Frontera. Service was great, very prompt and smiley. (we love servers with smiles! it's the easiest way to wine a patron!) We would definitely go back.
