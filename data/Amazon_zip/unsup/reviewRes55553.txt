Try to hit Bongo on weekdays for lunch if your schedule allows. M-F there is never a wait for a table, yet the place stays busy, the energy level is still a good and having breakfast for lunch is always a good idea.People love the pancakes, but the omelets and sandwiches are also amazing!Wait staff is wonderful, many have been there for years, and they always remember you. Owners John and Derrick are always welcoming as well. If you are looking for something as a replacement for the sun during this cold, grey, endless winter, I suggest Bongo -- After this review, I'm heading over there!peace . love . goathttp://www.bucktown.org
