I appreciate the great pride each staffer and owner takes in this place. Quality, unique products. Extremely tasty. My fave is the chicken/spinach sausage with some sort of sinfully yummy cheese chunks and sauce. Mmmm. Love the fun names of the food. If you don't want a long wait, try to make it there on a weekday, where services is speedy and you'll get a seat. They REALLY should consider rearranging their hours for more weekend business. I cannot take my out of town visitors there for a delightful treat because the lines are just too long on Saturday and they're closed Sunday.
