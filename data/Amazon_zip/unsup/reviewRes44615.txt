Stopped here with a friend early on a Friday night. Got a key lime bar and mint tea, both which were FAB! The main indoor seating area you actually have to leave the bakery side and walk outside and go in another door. We were here for an early evening chat and tea. The room was as quiet as a morgue! People were either studying, or on laptops. There was no piped in music and we had to whisper. Don't "shush" me Alliance!
