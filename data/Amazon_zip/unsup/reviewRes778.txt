I'm an out of towner, so I understand that this is more of a "touristy" thing to do than an authentic Chicagoan thing, but still, the dogs were great. I'm also a vegetarian and the Joe Strummer was probably the best veggie dog I have ever had. We waited in line for maybe a half hour and after ordering we were served very quickly, and the staff was super friendly and helpful.
