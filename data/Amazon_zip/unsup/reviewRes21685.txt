If all I wanted was a glimpse of nostalgia, Superdawg would get 5 stars without a doubt. This is definitely a place to see, with towering neon hot dogs and the entire drive-in aspect. It's a really cool experience and a really cool place. However, this is just as much about the dog as it is the place it's served, so 5 stars are not to be had by Superdawg. The dog is good, but for the price, I can do better a couple blocks from home. The pickled tomato is a cool addition, but it makes it hard to eat the dog without removing said tomato. The fries are decent. I want to go back for other stuff, like the burgers, shakes and whatnot. I'm glad I went and saw the scene, and it was good, but it's not THE Chicago place to go for a hotdog.
