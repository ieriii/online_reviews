I had the breakfast burrito and my husband got the shrimp and avocado eggs benedict. We switched halfway through since they were both so good. There is a morning rush, but the wait was only about half an hour and there was a coffee/tea bar where you could order prior to sitting. The food came out quickly and was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place.
