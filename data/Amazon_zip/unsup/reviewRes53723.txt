For all the hype, this place failed to deliver. It is also misleading for this to be considered a hot dog place since the hot dog is marginal and they really seemed to be an exotic encased meat purveyor. Duck fat fries are not special and I really think that people think they are special because people have told them they should think they are special. I think the one time will be probably be the only time.
