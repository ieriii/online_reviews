Unless I have brunch-crazed out-of-towners in tow, I generally try to avoid venturing out of my house on a weekend morning for anything more involved than a cup of coffee or a bagel. We made an exception recently and trekked down to Yolk to meet friends for a good ol' stick to the ribs breakfast before heading over to Chinatown for the Lunar New Year festivities. Lesson learned: Don't go breaking your rules about brunch on weekends. I have rules for reasons! And I can't say I wasn't warned-- I read Yelpers' yelps before hitting the Red Line and wan't surprised to see the place packed to the sidewalks with cranky people waiting 30 minutes plus for fried eggs and pancakes.  Why do we do it? Brunch is supposed to be a fun, leisurely excursion full of fat and sugar and caffeine wherein we can catch up with friends and/or family and lose track of what time it is. Can we accomplish this when hungry people who have been waiting for an hour are standing at the edge of your table, shooting daggers with their eyes, hoping you get an emergency phone call and will have to abandon your belgian waffle untouched and relinquish your table to them? Can we do this when the kitchen and waitstaff is so slammed that they are no longer able to distinguish between an english muffin and wheat toast ("what is it?!" "I don't know!" "Who cares?! It's bready, give it to them!")? Eating at Yolk was more an opportunity to reflect on the cruel punishment we put ourselves through in order to drink coffee and attempt to answer the question that has plagued mankind through the centuries: "Sweet or savory?" There's a doctoral thesis in here somewhere, but I'll go to a corner diner to lazily brainstorm the possibilities, thank you. Ultimately, the food was good, but so is the food at the Original Pancake House.
