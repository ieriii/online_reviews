This used to be one of my standbys...fresh, tasty salad crepes that won't break the bank. So, I was understandably disturbed to find their once-affordable savory crepes ($7) are now $10. Admittedly, the crepes come with soup and their prices were possibly too-good-to-be true before, but it just seems like a poor attempt at competing with the full-service brunch joints in the neighborhood.  Some of their offerings (especially the sweet crepes) are still in the $6-8 range, and service is friendly, but I'm sad that they have fallen prey to the arbitrary price-gouging that characterizes most Andersonville restaurants as the area gets trendier. That said, their savory crepes such as the Chicago Crepe, Ikosium Crepe, and Greek Crepe are yummy, healthy concoctions that are quite filling...I just won't be able to eat them as often now :P
