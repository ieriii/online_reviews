A bridgeport gem! I work in the stockyard district and this is far and away the best option nearby--and I'll admit I've driven all the way down from Lincoln Park on several weekend occasions because I can't get enough of the awesome organic fare. I've had pretty much everything on the menu at this point and one thing is as good as the next. If you get breakfast, be sure you get their homemade jam...absolutely unbelievable.
