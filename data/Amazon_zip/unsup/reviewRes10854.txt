Make no mistake... this is a sports bar FIRST, a brewery Second, and a pizzeria Third. I love this place because it is a place where yuppies, choads, and beer enthusiasts can all come together and watch a game, sing some karaoke, have a fantastic beer- or 5 and eat some pizza... Pizza that, thank holy f-ing god, is NOT Chicago-hot-dish-style-"pizza". Beware that this place will fill up on special events. I have been on a 2 hour wait to get seated before. If you want to try this place, consider your timing. Go early or at least not during some huge game. You will get the best service and a chilled mug. I have been here during all possible times, busy, slow, games, dinner rushes, brunches and many times I see customers getting rude with the staff. Chill out people! The name of this place is PIECE, so calm down, have a beer, watch the game and say the restaurants name aloud a few times. About the pizza: Crust is baked in a gas oven on a stone. It is not a greasy crust. When they take it out of the oven it quickly lays on a lightly corn-mealed 1/2 sheet-pan. It is cut pie-like and served with condiments on the tray. If you order basil on the pie, it will be shredded, not whole. The mushrooms are sauteed and wonderful. My favorite combo: White crust, red sauce, ricotta, basil, artichokes, mushrooms, black olives, red pepper flakes, black pepper. My favorite beer: Whatever is darkest. It will look like Guinness but it will actually taste good.
