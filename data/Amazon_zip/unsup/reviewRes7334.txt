Oh, how I love Sapori! I used to come here at least twice a month for years until I moved. I'm so glad that I've now moved close to the Brown Line and can start coming back here on a regular basis again. Everything I've ordered here has been delicious! I usually start with the caprese salad, and for entrees I love the home-made rigatoni, gnocchi with pesto, and the lasagna mia (very filling.) And Sapori has one of the best desserts in the city...bread pudding with raspberries! They have a reasonably priced wine list and all the bottles I've tried have been very good. I can't wait to come back again!
