I must say, I was mistaken in my other review. I went back to Piece for a friend's birthday party and it was superb. We ordered 5 pies (I highly recommend the green pepper, banana pepper, pepperoni) and all of them came out perfectly. The crust was nice and crispy but not burnt. The beers were superb, my favorite is the Dysfunction Ale but the Wing Nut (double IPA) was awesome as well. Service was outstanding as usual.
