Wow...I had a fabulous meal again. We started off with soup....vegan chikin rice Oh My God! Our server hyped it so we went with it...they need to bottle this stuff or keep it on the menu everyday....I closed my eyes with a mouthful and it took me back......oh to be a kid again. It was simply fabulous. After the soup we dove right in to the mushroom appetizer...it was lightly breaded and dipped in the magic sauce made my mouth melt. OOOH that SSSauce! The entree was also mighty tasty..some rolled tortilla thing with killer salsa. The name of that one escapes me now but was a bit over the top. I wonder who writes the descriptions on their daily menus....its kind of queer...in a bad way. If its the chef..they should stay in the kitchen making that soup! Ok back to the food. The tortilla thing was really good flavor BUT it looked like hell.......they shouldn't try to be fancy food arrangers...they obviously don't have the talent....So after stuffing our faces we moved onto desert....it was ...almost out of the park but then desert. They make such great food why can't they find a way to make a cake that tastes fresh? The cake is so inconsistent. This one was at least flavorful but it just tastes old.....Please go back to the drawing board and make us a cake that will send us out on the street screaming....MORE!I do love you Chicago Diner..don't forget who you are.
