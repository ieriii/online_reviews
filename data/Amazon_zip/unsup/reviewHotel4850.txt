Very rude staff, particularly the manager at the front desk. Completely inconsiderate of their hotel guests. Thin walls between rooms, so much that we could hear our neighbors at the middle of the night. WiFi was expensive, staff was rude, worn-out rooms-- overall do yourself a favor and get another hotel.
