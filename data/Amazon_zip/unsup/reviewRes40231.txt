Went there yesterday for lunch with the office. The hite and sake were flowing. The food was pretty good, but like others said the service was less than accommodating. It took some coaxing for the waitress to bring out extra fire. She did keep the drinks coming when needed, but it took some negotiating for her to accommodate our large party as far as the food order went. We wanted to order a lot for everyone to share and she was insistent we all order individually. After much cajoling, she let us order family style. The chicken, beef, steak and spare ribs were good. The squid was tasteless and chewy. But that may have been my fault- I was cooking it!
