Garcia's is cheap and it's good. If I could live on their horchata and margaritas I would. Portions are big, great majority of food is tasty. I will admit I loved Garcia's a bit more before the remodel, with its cozy interior and cheesy but lovable paintings everywhere. I also think the food may have suffered a bit since the remodel. But the beans and cheese are still delicious, the taquitos are always tasty, and OMG the horchata and margaritas! (Just not together).
