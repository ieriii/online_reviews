This place is great.. If you are looking for some good falafel you have got to come here. The people are so nice and very helpful. The place gets busy and there is always some sort of a line but it moves so fast it doesnt seem like a wait at all!!! Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great. I was introduced here by my friend and now I go back all the time whether carry out or dine in... it is awesome!!
