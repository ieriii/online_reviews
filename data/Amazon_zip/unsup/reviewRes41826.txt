I get it...steak places in the downtown area are expensive. Super expensive. I knew that going in, but jeez I really had a hard time swallowing that bill. The food was very tasty. However, it irked me that you had to order a side for about $12. The meat came with nothing. Nothing. All the meat is cooked in butter, so needless to say it was mouth-watering. Tasting the butter on your tongue though just makes you realize that what you are eating is soooo not good for you. I don't usually dwell on that when I eat, but the buttery steak made it difficult not to. It was def. a nice place and the food was good, but some things made me not want to go back.
