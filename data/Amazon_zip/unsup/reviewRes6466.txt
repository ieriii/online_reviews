First, I want to say that food here is AMAZING!!! I love the pasta, the squash and goat cheese salad, pasta and the burger (best burger I've had in my life). This review is mostly about the waitstaff and hostess. The waitress was very rude and came to our table only 3 times. As she processed our bill she stopped to text. This wouldn't be an issue if she was consistent and attentive. We had to keep her at our table while we made decisions so we could eat! She wasn't helpful when picking out a wine which is odd because they advertise a huge list and make it seem as if it was one of their specialties...then help when we have questions! Our service was so poor and because of it we missed a friend's final performance and graduation. So disappointed. When we told the hostess she gave us a nasty face and was extremely rude. It's a shame that the waitstaff and hostess are so rude and unaccommodating, the rest of the staff and food was great. I don't think I'll ever go back though. This has been the case both times I've gone and don't think any food is worth awful service and being made to feel like a jerk for voicing my opinion.
