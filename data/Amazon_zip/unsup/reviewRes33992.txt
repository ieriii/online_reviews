Sunday is the ONLY day I have time to go out to dinner. I cook most if not all of my meals at home, so I REALLY enjoy when someone else gets to cook, and it's gotta be something that I can't make or don't want to spend the time making. I was in the mood for italian, and the place we were going to go to had a long wait, so we trekked over to Mia Francesca. The dining room was incredibly busy, packed and loud. You better be 175lbs or less, or sorry, anywhere you sit will be uncomfortable. That's how tight it's packed. So I requested a seat on the patio. The meal started off well, we had the Carpaccio, which was good, but was extremely light. It would be nice if they put 2 layers of the beef down since they're SO paper thin.  Anyway, I had my heart set on the mussels in "spicy" tomato sauce as my main dish. My fiance ordered spaghetti fungi and added chicken.  Here is where it started to go downhill... We received our meals and one look at his dish and I was like, babe, there's no chicken in there. He fished around and, nope, no chicken, I had one of my mussels, and "What?" This sauce isn't even the slightest bit spicy OR seasoned. It tasted like they dumped a can of crushed tomatoes on the mussels and forgot to season it.  So the waitress takes the pasta dish back, and of course blames it on the kitchen (I've been a waitress and it's the easiest cop-out). So while my fiance was waiting for them to bring his dish back with chicken in it, I was trying to eat my mussels as SLOW as possible so we can eat SOME of our meal together. So I was 3/4 done with my meal by the time he got his pasta back and the waitress acted like it was no big deal and didn't even try to accommodate us at all nor did she give us any discount on the bill. We would have been happy if she at least removed the cost of the chicken. So I won't be back here for some unseasoned Italian food and poor service.
