My wife and I have been lucky enough to dine all over the world at some great restaurants this year. We took a European honeymoon that allowed us to eat in Germany, The Czech Republic, Austria, Italy and France. Also, we live in Las Vegas and have the opportunity to try different world class restaurants every night if we could afford it.Yes, we are foodies. But, we're teachers. So, when we want to splurge on meals we have high hopes. We are from Chicago and were visiting family and friends over the week of New Year's Eve when we decided to give Sprout a try. We were able to book reservations in short notice AND when we told some friends we were going they wanted to join as well. I called to see if we could add a couple more people, the staff at Sprout said "yes" and we were set. As you have probably read, the menu was Prix Fixe at $60. It was worth every penny and we probably would have paid double. Each course was fabulous. There were five of us and we tried to order different things; There wasn't one complaint. The highlights for me were the Egg, the Pork, the Corn, and the Grilled Cheese! I've tried to emulate this grilled cheese at home and I'm making some great one's that aren't even close to Dale's. This meal is one of the first times where we experienced innovation from a "Top Chef." Many of the "Masters" and the "Contestants" showcase their innovative cuisine on the show but when one dines at their restaurant they seem to keep it safe in order to appeal to the masses as to not tarnish their reputation. Dale, and Sprout, delivered the goods from service to atmosphere to the party that went on in our mouths! Can't wait to come back!
