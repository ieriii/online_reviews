My parents are huge steak fans and this place came recommended by several friends. The atmosphere was great, with a nice open dining area and great open kitchen for you to see everything being prepared and carried out to tables. I had the blue crusted filet with mac and cheese side, my dad had the tenderloin pepper steak and my stepmom had the filet with bernaise sauce. Everyone was really happy with our meals. My meat was prepared medium rare and it was literally beyond delicious. Both of my parents were happy with their meals too, including sldes. The server was really nice but I have to say, the hostess was a little bitchy. Not a big deal but not the best first impression too. Anyhow, I would definitely go back. I was very pleasantly surprised by how great my meal was.
