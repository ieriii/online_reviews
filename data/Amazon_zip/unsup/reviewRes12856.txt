My company held our holiday party here this year. The salad bar wasn't as impressive as I was lead to believe. I've seen much better salad bars all over. They only had a few prepared salads, and two kinds of lettuce, it was mostly items that could have been from opened cans (baby corn, marinated artichoke hearts, pickled beats, olives, etc). My favorite part was the cheese & charcuterie! They do have the hot items and sushi as well..... Yes, it's meat riffic. Meat tastic even. The best meat I had all night were the parmesan pork chops oddly enough. Second best was probably the "specialty of the house". I wasn't too impressed with the lamb, and the chicken was dry. They are on you so fast when you have that coin flipped to green so be prepared!! I could never understand the Gauchos when they told me what they were offering, so I usually just said yes :) The desserts are good, if you save room-I'm not sure they are worth $10extra good, especially after the gluttony of dinner. I would go back, but not if I had to pay full-price. I've read others say sign up for the club, get coupons-I have a 15% off for my next trip. Even when I stuff myself, I still don't feel like it's $50 worth of food I just ate.
