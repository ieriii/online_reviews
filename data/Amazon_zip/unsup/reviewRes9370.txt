I went last night with a friend and was blown away. The restaurant was open, airy and bright. While waiting for my friend at the bar, I order the 'Watermelon' which was an amazing, refreshing drink made with prosecco, lemon, celery bitters, chervil. Once my friend arrived, we were promptly seated and offered the wine pairing with our Gilt tasting menu. We sat by the front windows with several other diners and it wasn't loud or cramped. The server, Mark G., was very nice, informative and attentive (not over bearing). I started with the scallop dish which was so delicious and paired with a delicious chardonnay. My friend had the licorice salad paired with a pinot blanc. In my mind I was questioning the combination of flavors in her dish, but when tasted, it was a combination of flavors that I had never had and it was delectable. Our main courses were the salmon and vegetarian ricotta dishes, both were fantastic. I was concerned that with the tasting menu the portions would be so small that I would be hungry, which was not the case here. The portions were perfect and I didn't even finish my salmon because I was getting full and wanted to make sure I had room for the dessert.   During our experience here we kept commenting to each other on how 'fancy' everything was without being pretentious. Mark, our server had an impressive knowledge of the dishes and wines. The pace of the dishes was timed to perfection, without being rushed or feeling like we were waiting for the next course. Between these courses they brought a berry sorbet with a sparkling wine - perfect.  The desserts were goat cheese donut holes with blueberries and a berry sorbet and a chocolate cake with a coffee infused spread and a chocolate ice cream type side with potato chips - which was to die for. The donuts came out warm and were covered in honey and sugar so yummy. We had coffee as well which came out HOT and was delicious.
