Quality sushi and SAKI! I usually don't like saki but when we ordered here it was delicious, earthy, with a hint of sweetness that really made the whole drinking experience enjoyable. It also come in a cool wooden vessel, sitting in a wooden ice cooler. Spiffy. There are a lot of interesting specialty rolls like the Sweet Potato Roll, the Peter Parker Spider Roll, The Dragon Roll and the Snow White. They were very intricate, probably slightly more intricate than your average sushi place, not to mention delicious. The vibe in there is fun, cool and relaxed. I didn't think it was pretentious, but just an excellent dining experience.
