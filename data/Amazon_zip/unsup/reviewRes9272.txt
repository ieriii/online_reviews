Only been here once, but this is the best East Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/Near Eastern food I've had. The best lamb, the best baba ganouj (after the stuff at Moody's Falafal Palace in Cambridge, that is), and (outside of Twisted Tea or whenever I punch up my own home brew) the best hard iced tea--pomegranate tea. My goodness. I wish they had one in Boston for whenever I get back there--this is one of the things about Chicago I will truly miss.
