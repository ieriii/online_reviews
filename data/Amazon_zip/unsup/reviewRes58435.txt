I've always liked the food at Glenn's but tonight the server was not good. I stopped in to place a carryout order. One item. She took the order, asked my name and then said it would be 20 minutes. I went across the street and waited, came back 20 minutes later, and she said Oh, I forgot to put your order in...you came in during the rush.. Well, don't take orders during the rush if you can't handle them. Sadly, I won't be making carryout order requests again in the future.
