Great pan pizza. My friend hates when I use this analogy, but I would say it is like a very very good pizza. Only as that is the style of za. It is wayyy better than an actual pizza hut.  They have a great selection of beers on tap and you can create your pizza however you like. The topping are really fresh and good! My favorite is pepperoni with jalapeos.
