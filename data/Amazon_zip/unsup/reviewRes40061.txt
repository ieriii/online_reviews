hands down, my favorite korean bbq place in chicago.  I've been here a few times and this last time totally blew me away. First, they've expanded!!!! No more 1 hour waits then crammed into a seat next to another party. They totally took over the lil strip mallish place and is 3 times its original size. we had a party of 12 on a saturday night and no wait at all. i love it! I really like the meat here compared to other bbq places. It's not all you can eat, but it's enough to fill you and then some. our party tried some kinda of combination party deal. they had a few options- we did the $19.95 for california roll, dumplings, chaep jae (?) and seafood pancake IN ADDITION to a plate of meat and lots and lots of lil side dishes. this was the cheapest option but i can't imagine it getting better than this. the seafood pancake is soooo good. i dont know what's in it but it was sooo good. Meats. we tried the bulgogi and kalbi and squid. the bulgogi wasn't that great. not marinated enough. we quickly got it replaced for kalbi- no questions asked. the kalbi was nice and tender and so very flavorful. the squid was a favorite too. i dont usually like squid but it was marinated so well here. service was ok. above most korean bbq places but that's not saying much. the "bus boys" were very on top of replacing our tabletop grills and refilling water. and like any other korean bbq place, it's always helpful (though not mandatory here) to have a korean person in your party.  one surprise, i didn't smell like bbq the rest of the day. or maybe since i was surrounded by the same crowd the rest of the night i didn't notice it. i will be back. hopefully in a party of 5 or more to get that combination party deal. *drool*
