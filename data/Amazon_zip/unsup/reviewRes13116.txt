We ate at Glenn's Diner over the weekend and sat outside on the patio for lunch this past Saturday. I took away one star from this review because they wouldn't serve us anything on the blackboards for whatever reason, even though they're posted up right in front of your face. There should be a disclaimer somewhere if that's the deal. We ordered the one appetizer they could serve us, which was a crab cake. It was really good. Very crabby, not so cakey, just the way I like them. For lunch I had the seafood salad and my husband had the lobster roll. Both were really good- however they don't use a traditional roll for the lobster roll. More like two pieces of bun or something. There is a reason why the lobster roll is what it is and Glenn's should use it. It's to sop up all of the delicious drippings from the lobster salad stuffed inside, instead of allowing it to pool into a mess on the plate. Just my two cents; if the lobster roll capital of the world, Neptune Oyster in Boston, MA uses it, along with everywhere else that serves a lobster roll, there's a good reason to follow suit I think.  No other complaints, I'll definitely be back to try some of the items from the blackboards (I assume I have to come at dinner time to get those) and the all you can eat crab night.
