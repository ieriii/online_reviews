We stopped by to check out the remodel. The remodel is great...the food is best left for 4:00 am. I had a garlic shrimp dish. The main issue I had is that they should put the shrimp in a separate dish. It was bathed in butter. Now I like butter as much as the next guy, but I like the ability to shake the butter off, or dip it in. Instead, the butter ran across the surface of the dinner plate. So, the iceberg lettuce and my rice were sopped in butter. A little harder to shake butter off rice. The quesadillas were also strangely, seemingly dipped in butter before fried. The side of beans, had oil (or perhaps butter) pooling on the edges. The margarita tasted like it came out of a slurpee machine. The taco meat on the other hand was lacking flavor and was a bit dry...not buttery at all.On the plus side - the place looks good and is clean. The bathrooms were nice. The waitstaff was attentive. The portions were large. The drinks were not watered down.
