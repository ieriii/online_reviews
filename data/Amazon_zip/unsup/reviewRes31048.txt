Here is a little insight onto just how much of a mad-vegan-foodie I am: 3 years ago, I purposely chose a 6 hour stop-over in Chicago from Ireland (over a non-stop), just so that I could try the Chicago Diner. Yes. I *chose* to mess with O'Hare, a car rental, AND Chicago traffic, all for a Vegetarian Diner. That is an illness, lads. No, seriously. It *was* an illness: I was one tunnel of light short of dying the day before leaving Dublin, but not wanting to change everyone's plans, I stupidly flew anyway. I was so grateful when we landed in Chi-Town; I thought that some relief would be near. No such luck, but since I was apparently about to meet St. Peter anyway, I figured that I ought to go ahead and get some food for the walk up to the pearly gates. We completed the pilgrimage to the Diner, and out of mortal defiance, I ordered the Dagwood. I then hid in the adorably claustrophobic wee toilet -splashing water on my face to keep from passing out- until the food arrived. I had one bite. -And it might have been the best sandwich of my life, but it is hard to accurately judge with one foot in the grave. Our sweet waiter gave me a free sweet to take on the plane -should I survive the journey, and he routed us around Downtown and Lake Michigan to see all of the sights. We returned to O'Hare. And if nothing else, I could then die with one more check on my list, and one more taste of the good life on my tongue. Happily, I lived to tell the tale, and dream of the day when I can return to the Chicago Diner. Like I said, it might have been the best sandwich of my life. One more bite, and I think that I could be sure. -Oh, and watch that front step. It's a killer.
