yes, it's pricey. yes, it is a great experience. yes, the food is interesting and the staff is amazing. yes, it is worth the money. no, i don't feel the need to ever go back again.  it was an interesting culinary experience ( I recommend doing the full tasting menu with the wine pairings- just dig into your wallet and get the full experience), and actually very fun and unpretentious.  I think everyone should go to Alinea once.
