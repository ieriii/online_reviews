Some things in life are a treat. -getting a weekend pass to the South Asian Film Festival -getting to go with arguably the handsomest man in all of Chicago -having lunch at The Gage Because we were out and about in the loop for the whole weekend, watching Indian films, we knew we'd have to fuel our engines well. My uber attractive partner in crime for the weekend casually suggested The Gage. I'd never heard of it before. When I found out it was on Michigan Avenue, I cringed a little. I was imagining hoards of hungry tourists a la Applebees. Boy was I wrong. I ordered something simple. A burger and fries. I was delighted when I sat down that the waiter brought out a wine/beer menu and a basket of freshly baked bread and home made butter. I ordered a pumpkin flavored seasonal beer - it was fall after all. Then the food arrived. A fresh baked bun for the burger?? WOW! A huge dill pickle spear, and hand cut fries. My dining companion had a duck sausage - which was served like a hot dog on a freshly baked long roll. We splurged and also got the goat cheese grits. For real. They were just as delish and decadent as they sound. All of this was served in a restaurant with such ambiance that even I was impressed. White cloth napkins, silver ware with a nice heft, and heavy wooden tables. Despite the fact that the table behind us was a cougar birthday party...it was wonderful. The funny part was when the waiter brought out a bottle of wine for the cougars. The people dining next to us said "Oh Great. They are going to get louder!" and we all had a good laugh. Definitely a great place to have lunch - or bring out of town guests. The menu was unexpected - and I was pleased to have eaten there. Check it out! Its a great experience.
