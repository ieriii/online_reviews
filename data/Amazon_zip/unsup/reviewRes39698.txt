I wish I could give this place 6 stars! A group of myself and 5 friends came here for dinner last night and were blown away! The food was phenomenal! They offer both small appetizers and "plates" which can we shared among large groups. We ordered 3 plates for the table. 1- a ricotta dish that was to die for 2 - scallops with ox tail that was scrumptious! 3 - sweetbreads, which I didn't try because I'm not a sweetbreads person, but everyone else loved. I ordered the Kobe burger for dinner. HOLY COW - this was the best burger I have ever had. It's served on a brioche bun with duck fat fries (YUM). I feel like I can;t even call it a burger because it was really so much more than just a burger. Hands down the best I've ever had in my entire life. My friend ordered the Wild bore sloppy joe, I got to taste it, the quality of the meat was top notch and I almost wish I ordered that instead.  The porkbelly (servered on pumpkin risotto AMAZING) was also spectacular. We ordered 1 of each dessert and there wasn't a drop left of anything, we all loved it! They also have a great beer selection and a pretty awesome whiskey list as well as a whiskey tasting special. GO HERE, OR MISS OUT!
