Love, love, love it. Having visited Chicago for the 7th time, hubby and I decided it was now or never and rented a car to try out Doug's. Waited about an hour and a half, all the while wondering whether the long wait in a nothing-happening neighborhood on a rainy day was really worth the food inside. The verdict? Worth every 'effin bite of utter ecstasy each of the four specialty dogs offered. Never imagined mere encased meat with toppings could have such amazingly complex and complementary flavor s that explode into major food-gasms with each bite. Doug, move to NYC and set up shop somewhere- can guarantee you will become major food icon and retire as foodie mogul somewhere in the Cajun islands. And DO get your own radio show and entertain us with that beautiful voice of yours. Coming back next time I'm here. WIll be dreaming of foie gras duck dog in the meantime. A MUST-VISIT location if you are in Chicago and want to taste the very best.
