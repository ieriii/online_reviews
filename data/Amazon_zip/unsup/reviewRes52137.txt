I am actually not a deep dish lover. Its something I enjoy once a year or once every two years. But Gino's East is the best deep dish you can find. Took a few friends to Gino's East who were visiting Chicago, and they wanted to taste Chicago Deep dish pizza. We came later than the lunch hour, so there was no wait at all. The pizza speaks for itself. The crust, the sauce its all delicious.
