The husband and I decided to try this place since our first greek dining experience in the states was just okay. (We originally dined at Santorini across the street but noticed a whole bunch of people at Greek Islands.) We headed over to Greek islands recently to check it out. What a great experience! Free valet, about a 15 minute wait (no reservation), and the bread/olive oil was delish. The flaming saganaki (opa!) was salty, but i think that's normal. The melitzanosalata was amazing! I got the Keftedes (beef and lamb meatballs) and the husband got the special white fish of the night. Both were great. Honestly, I was so full from gorging myself on the bread, saganaki, and melitzanosalata that I only ate a few bites of my entree, but it was good nonetheless. If you haven't had greek food or haven't found a good greek restaurant in chicago, try this place!
