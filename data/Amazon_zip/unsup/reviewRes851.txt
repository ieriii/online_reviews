I'm not a huge sausage fan but I had to see what the hype was about. I've been here twice in the past year and have loved everything I've tried! I happened to go at the right times and never had to wait more than 15 minutes in line. Doug himself is right there behind the counter taking your order, which is pretty cool. He's a nice guy! My most recent visit was last week and I tried: -The Mountain Man - I don't remember exactly what was on this but it was good! I had it last year as well. I like the mix of game meats in this sausage -Spicy Alligator- my favorite! This had cajun shrimp remoulade and goat cheese. This is also on this week's menu so if you go, get this! I can't remember what else I had in the past but I remember it being DELICIOUS. I love the unique combinations of sauces and cheese. Doug really knows how to pair them well with the meat. I also like the exotic meat they use. Where else can you have alligator or rattlesnake sausage? (If you do know of another place, do tell!)
