Xoco is anything but the "authentic Mexican" fare it advertises. I went to Xoco on the recommendation of a friend who said it was the more casual, less expensive sister to Frontera. I went thinking I would be able to enjoy some authentic tacos or perhaps some tasty tostadas. Boy was I in for a surprise. Xoco should advertise itself as a tortaria. There is NOTHING else on the menu. When I asked for some corn tortillas I was told that they only use corn tortillas to make chips. We were then sat next to the kitchen. I was sitting next to the oven pipe which very nearly burned my arm. The atmosphere was also abysmal. The acoustics are horrible, so do not count on being able to hear your dinner companion that is less than a foot away. I will not be returning to this "authentic" soup and sandwich shop. Sorry Bayliss, you struck out with this one. You've got nothing on any restaurant in Pilsen.
