I been here a few times for lunch at this place, and it was GREAT -- almost like we were sitting around chatting in Italy, thanks to the food! Excellent, tight wine list, knowledgable service and imported ingredients from Italy, natch. The Buffalo mozzarella was wonderfully fresh. The cuttlefish special appetizer was plentiful and simply prepared. Eggplant appetizer is tasty and plentiful also. The pizzas are stella, from the simple margherita to a special pizza that had fresh mozzarella, prosciutto and a cracked egg on the top -- deelish. The room is spare but rustic and comfortable. Wooden tables and chairs, high ceilings, open. The kitchen and oven are on view for all. One caveat -- the place gets VERY crowded for dinner, so the owner suggests you get there early (think 5 o'clock hour) on the weekends if you don't want to wait too long. Go anyway -- I think you're going to like it!
