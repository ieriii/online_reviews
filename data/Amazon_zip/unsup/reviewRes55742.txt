For a time, I had been ordering pizza from Calo (thin crust sausage and onion), but decided to stop because they were too hit or miss on quality. Some days it was excellent, other times it was fair at best. The last time I ordered from them, the pizza was worse than a store-brand frozen pizza, and the delivery man left about 20 menus on my front lawn. There are too many quality pizza places around.
