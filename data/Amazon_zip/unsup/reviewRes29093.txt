Ok, I live in Morton Grove, and there happens to be a Pequod here. However, I wanted to go to Lincoln Park, and hang out there. When I was entered there, I was wondering why the lights were off. That was weird. I guess it must be a recession or something. But anyways, the first slice I ate was a 3.5/5. But for some weird reason, the second piece was a 4/5. I guess I'm used to eating UNO's or Gino's East. I don't know. But it's still pretty good.
