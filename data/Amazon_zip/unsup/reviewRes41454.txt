I had a great time here. The food was sooo good! Though expensive, it is worth it.  What did I have? -Lobster bisque -8 oz. filet mignon -mashed potatoes -chocolate mousse cake with a cookie crust.  Everything tasted wonderful. My only concerns were that the mashed potatoes seemed to be soaked in butter and I like my mashed potatoes less soaked. I didn't end up finishing all of my chocolate mousse cake as it was a bit much for me, but from what I did finish, it was delicious!  As for drinks, I stuck with having a mojito before dinner and shiraz with my dinner. My boyfriend ended up trying one of their cocktails that had strawberries, vodka, and basil -- similar to a mojito. Boyfriend said it was pretty good, so if you're feeling adventurous, you might want to try that. The atmosphere is rather dark with a small candle. This makes it rather difficult to read the menu or sign your credit card slip, but other than that, the ambiance is rather romantic.
