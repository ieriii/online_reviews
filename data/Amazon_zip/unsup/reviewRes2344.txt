Oh man, since I moved to San Francisco I have missed Hot Doug's something fierce. The regular menu is excellent, but the weekly specials are the best. Always worth the wait, no matter how long the line is, rain or shine. Small inside, but Doug manages the customer flow really well so there are always tables ready when your food comes.
