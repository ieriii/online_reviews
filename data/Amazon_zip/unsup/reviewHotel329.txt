Budget budget budget. The horrible isn't the worst I've stayed in but for the price it was pretty weak. I was here this past wknd and much to my surprise, this joint was $135 a night. Now for the location alone, being one block from Millennium Park and walking distance to Magnificent Mile, I could put up with the price. But this place just seemed dirty and out of date. The staff that I dealt with was nice, friendly and helped with directions but service alone doesn't make up for the lack of aesthetics of this place. The elevators took forever and make questionable noises, the hallway to the room reminded me of something from The Shining and the room was not nice. Thank god we were only staying there for one night because I don't think I could've done longer. The bed needed to be replaced, along with the pillows and itchy comforters (blue light what??), the curtains on the window weren't even long enough to cover the window so we couldn't get total darkness when we wanted to take a nap. The shower was decent but the window to the curtain in the bathroom ended up falling down and it looked as if someone put it up there with bubble gum to fix it previously. Plus, you could open the window with no screen from the 11th floor. Thank god I was in a right state of mind the time I was there! The L runs right across the street so that may bother some but it really didn't bother me too much. Good location and nice staff but they really need to do something about the hotel itself if they want to get more than two stars which seems to be the majority vote here on Yelp. PS-Free wifi!
