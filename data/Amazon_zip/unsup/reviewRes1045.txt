i freaking love this place and will go out of my way, rain or shine, to get my hot doug fix whenever i'm even in the vicinity of Chicago. nothing makes me happier than going to that little suburb and joining the line winding around the corner, because that means in just a short while i will be smacking my lips on a delicious foie gras dog and whatever other specials appeal to me. i've now been three times now. during my first visit, i had an unrivaled garlic pork dog that was bursting with flavor. today i sampled the rattlesnake dog, the pork n ale cheese dog, the sundried tomato and burrata dog, the lamb sausage and the swedish potato dog. other than the foie gras, i really liked the swedish potato. the only one i found somewhat was the lamb, as it was a bit dry, but overall any dog from hot doug is heads and tails better than its competitors. love the friendly, diner-like, casual feel and how doug mans the counter daily. and triple quadruple love the sausagefest!
