Great execution, great service... I write this as I'm lolling around post dinner at Publican. Standout dish was the Pigs Head (which is exactly what you think it is), a very rich rendition of pork served with excellently pickled vegetables and a nice sweet/spicy mustard. Beer selections also very tasty, with a secondary shout out to the frites. My brother-in-law and I also had the scallops and cucumber salad, as well as the oysters, which were all very good (oysters had the nice briny tang) but paled in comparison to a pigs head delivered on a plate. Definitely not for the faint-hearted, but if you are adventurous, a truly nice reward. Definitely would come back with my carniverous friends!
