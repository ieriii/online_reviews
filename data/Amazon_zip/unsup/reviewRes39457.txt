I don't know too many sit down places open until 5 AM but this place is. So basically, after last call, you can STILL come here. And many drunk people do. For $20, u get about 20 delish unnamed plates. Someone made a comment that they don't tell u what it is. Who cares? It was all good. If you care about what stuff is named, you probably shouldn't be in this side of town at 5 am. Then they put this grill on your table and plates of meat. And then you grill and eat until you can't grill or eat anymore. The service is nice. Its pretty much self serve. They bring out your food in about 10 minutes. Sometimes the woman seems really tired. But then again so is the security guard at the 4 am Taco Bell in Wrigleyville. This is better.
