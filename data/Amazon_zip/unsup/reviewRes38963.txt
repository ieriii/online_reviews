We live in the neighborhood and often order pizza from here which is always decent. We eat in the restaurant a few times a year but we hadn't been here for over a year so decided to give it a try. Ugh! The salad bar is weird, iceberg lettuce and creamed herring?? What is that about?  I ordered pasta siciliana, the garlic/olive oil sauce was pretty good but it came with little tiny salad sized shrimp. It would be so much better wtih larger shrimp and less pasta. Who can eat that much? The veal marsala wasn't much better. I will say the service is excellent.  We'll stick to take out pizza from now on and go to Sabatino's for old school Italian So much better and only a little more expensive.
