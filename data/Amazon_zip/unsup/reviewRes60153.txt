First off, when we moved back to Chicago from Seattle my husband and I were hunting for a real good Pho. So I got on yelp and immediately read the reviews on Tank noodles. Got to this place and was packed so we knew we came to the right place to eat some real nice soup. After a little wait, we sat down and ordered. Our food came shortly after and enjoyed every bit of it. Ever since then we've been coming to this place for about 3 years now. Never been disappointed. The only thing is it's always packed but that never bothered us because the food made up for it. Did i mention that this place is kid friendly? Well my little one eats everything but if he doesn't like it then he would just spit it out. Everything we give him he wants more and more. Now as for my older one, he's very picky and doesn't try out new food unless we give him some thing to drink. So we've tried some meat dishes and fried rices, and guess what he loved and ate everything. So overall you get the point, you want good Pho or even just want viet food? go here you won't be disappointed!
