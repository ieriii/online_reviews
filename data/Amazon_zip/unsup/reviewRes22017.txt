A group of us recently went to Irazu for dinner and sat on the patio. Since there were 15 of us, we went with prix fixte option (http://www.irazuchicago.) Everything was delicious and food was plentiful. Our favorites were the plantains and the chicken breast casado. Note: if you plan to bring a group, be sure to call well in advance.
