(Dancing Bollywood style)  India house, I dance with Joy when your food touches my lips! Delicious, delicious, delicious! I tried everything there at the Lunch buffet and I was amazed by how each dish, complimented one another on my plate. I suggest you go there for the lunch buffet, you will NOT be disappointed.  I enjoyed the tandoori chicken, the pita bread and the curries. It is also a great place for vegetarians because most of the dishes are vegetarian.  Desserts! All the desserts were wonderful. They had Mango Ice cream--best ice cream ever! It was creamy, but not too creamy and had a condensed milk like taste to it. Rice pudding--delicious! Donut-like desert but in a sweet sauce=delicious! Tasted like a donut, but softer and in a sweet sugary sauce that wasnt too sweet, but perfectly flavored. I recommend you folks go! YEAH FOR INDIA HOUSE!
