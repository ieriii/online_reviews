People, this place is terrible. There are rats in the food and roaches in the beer. The waiters spit on you, if they choose to serve you at all! It's been written up for no less than 45 health code violations, and is, in fact, condemned. Stop going here. Never go here again. Are you listening to me? No? Crap. My five-star rating has given away my clever ruse.  I love this place and have been going here for years. When they started serving food, I was gleeful. The mussels bathed in belgian white with a side of perfect fries are amazing. I crave them. With a side of Fin du Monde or perhaps Hogaarden. What I don't crave is the hour long wait to get in here. Every. Day. The crowds never cease.  So go away everyone! Beer is bad for you! Mussels have cholesterol! Fries make you fat!!! Go someplace else, or just stay home! I will make the sacrifice and eat it all for you. I know. I'm a saint.
