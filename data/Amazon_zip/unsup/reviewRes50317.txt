Great bacon--everything else is just so-so. I'm a well-known lover of all things bacon (I'm head of http://bacondujour.blogs) and because this place has salty pork strips all over the menu, I HAD to try it out. Indeed, the side of maple-kissed bacon was awesome--cooked perfectly, cut thick, tasty as all get out--and the bacon-cheese omelet was good. Everything else, though, was a bit of a disappointment. I'll enumerate a few: 1. I ordered extra bacon in my omelet--instead, I got a semi-paltry amount. I'm not asking them to stuff an entire pig's worth of bacon in the middle of some eggs, but I would like plenty, and not just a few, bacon bits. 2. The sweet-potato hash browns were WAY underdone--almost raw, in fact. And while I did a little 'yay' dance to find hunks of bacon stirred into the hash browns, the vegetarian in my group did not--the menu makes zero mention of bacon bits in the mix. 3. Our waitress was perpetually confused by every request. Maybe she just had a bad breakup, maybe she hadn't gotten any sleep that night, maybe she's really that fuzzybrained--I don't know and I don't care. If you can't get any order right, if you can't check and see if we need anything, if the slightest question about the menu causes you to disappear for 15 minutes while you sort the answer out, maybe you shouldn't be a waitress. Try the DMV. 4. If I wanted all the waitresses to be lil' girls in skin-tight tanks--some altered via scissors to show maximum boob-canyon cleavage--I'd go to hooters. 5. Broccoli, spinach, and other greens should be washed and cooked properly, so they don't taste like mushy, RoundUp-treated grass clippings. 6. If you make your own bloody mary, it shouldn't taste like watered-down tomato juice. Horseradish, worchestshire, hot sauce, etc.--put some oomph in it. A little fine-tuning and this place could be awesome. It's got a way to go, though.
