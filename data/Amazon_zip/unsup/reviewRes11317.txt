Finally made it. And I wasn't disappointed, though Piece is unfortunately located in Wicker Park's vomit triangle. Our large group assembled on a Saturday night and was told we would have a 3 hour wait. Some folks immediately retired to a lesser pizza place, and the rest of us went to get Piece takeout pizzas which we proceeded to eat in a nearby parking lot. High-school antics aside, the pizzas wouldn't have been worth much of a wait. Unique, fresh toppings combinations are a plus, but the inedible and doughy crusts were a turn-off. When we got back to the front an hour later they were ready to seat us, which is good because we needed our beers. The belgian-style Swingin Single had a nice golden color and citrus nose, but an unfortunate metallic aftertaste. I can only assume this batch was not up to standard. A pint of pub inspired Worryin' Ale, however, was just delightful -- perfectly malty with Earl Grey and caramel notes. I can see why Piece gets the beer cred, but the pizza reputation is overblown. I'll still be back -- on a weeknight this time.
