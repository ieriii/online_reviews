Very busy loud large space, diner atmosphere with modern interior. Good selection of omelettes; I had the Iron Man with egg whites, avocado, onion, tomato, and green peppers. No espresso machine, minus 1. Too many crying babies that come with the neighborhood, -1. Otherwise a good place to go with a rowdy group.
