I have only tried this once, and based on other reviews I think I'll give it one more go. But tonight I got a 'burrito' that was a brick of meat--good meat, but only meat. As someone else already mentioned, WTF? I didn't know that I should have specified wanting rice and beans. I checked out their website and there are three separate La Pasaditas as it's a family run business that grew over the years. Apparently the nuevo one (black sign, western side of st.) is the more 'Americanized' version and has what I think are real burritos (you know, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans). So I'll give it one more try but otherwise I will stick to Picante up the street on Division. That place has been nothing but spectacular and I'd even say that their Horchata was better than La Pasadita as well.
