If you're looking for a chill setting, generous helpings of class and style, perfectly crafted drinks and a great spot for drinks with your date, this is the spot. I like the fact that this place is a little hard to find and somewhat snobby with their policies (no cell phone use inside the restaurant). If you're looking for accessible to everyone and anything goes standards for customer behavior, McDonald's rarely has a line. Went on a date here Friday night for a few drinks. Waited in line less than ten minutes and were promptly seated and served. The drinks are superb (I had two 'Brooklyn's', their version of a Manhattan) but I can't comment on the food b/c I didn't order any. I'd give this place 4.5 stars if I could just because they serve Founder's Brewery products. Dirty Bastard beer is everything you'd expect from the name.  I will def be coming back here and may raise my score to a 5 star if the food is as good as the drinks.
