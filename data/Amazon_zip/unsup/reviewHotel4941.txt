Great hotel in downtown Chicago!Stayed at the Avenue Crowne Plaza in October and had a great time! Right in the heart of downtown close to everything you need to do. Rooms are spacious and they have these really cool theme rooms -I got the Tech room which came with a computer..printer which made it convenient for me. They have a bar on the 40th floor that gives great views of Chicago. Food is artfully presented, staff is very friendly. Oh and I LOVE the zebra chairs.I'll be back to the Avenue hotel on my next trip to Chicago for sure.
