Ok so I have mixed emotions on how to approach this review. Having read other reviews and compared them to my own experience I have come to this conclusion. Hot Doug's has not let me down. Yes there's a long line often, and perhaps Doug should open another location to alleviate the congestion but then again who am I to decide what the man should do with his time and money. The man had a great idea and wanted to open a small quaint place that became overwhelmingly popular due to his brilliant idea. I've been there about 6 times now and have gotten 2 different dogs each time and have partook in the duck fat fries as well. The fries are rich but otherwise no big deal however the dogs have always been phenomenal! Definitely worth a stop..at least once.
