My husband and I went there at 4pm on a Saturday, just the time when they were swapping their lunch menu for the dinner one. We were very happy with whatever we've ordered - soup of the day, mixed greens, scotch egg, duck fat nuts and Hanger steak. Our waiter was also pretty 'cool', on top of being super attentive without being annoying .... We'll surely be going there again ....
