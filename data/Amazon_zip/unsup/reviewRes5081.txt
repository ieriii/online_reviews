Second visit and compelled to share my great experience - if you truly believe everything's better with bacon get to the purple pig now! We visited in June and again this week while in town from Portland. First visit tried the beets, peppers and three different pork dishes - including the pigs ear and the milk braised pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was a memorable dish, melt in your mouth comfort food. We also had the Lardo - my definition is kinda like the foie gras of the pig - rich and a little goes a long way! This trip I was solo and my server steered me to her favorite, the pork neck bone gravy "smear' - a small dish of wonderfulness that was like the very best marinara with on thick cut grilled slices of yummy bread. That along with the fresh raw corn with heirloom tomatoes and an 8oz pour of a crisp white wine made my afternoon worthwhile!
