Great experience. The service was good. The food was really great and very interesting, and fair-priced. We ordered the ham & cheese toast, which was really good. Their toasts are actually several pieces of toast with a plate of something to spread, great to share. Then we ordered the pork belly (great) and a side of cauliflower (also great). A great spot, I would recommend it to anyone
