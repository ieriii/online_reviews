Yum! Yum! Yum! Wilde was perfect for the DISGUSTINGLY rainy day yesterday. I had been researching what I wanted all day through the numerous Yelp reviews, but once there I had a hard time making up my mind. We started with the shrimp & crab cake appetizer. Both were vvvverrry good, but I especially liked the shrimp. It looked burnt so I was expecting that charred taste, but no no no it had so much flavor I was amazed. We then ordered our entrees. Ryan's sister & mom split the chicken pot pie with the asparagus & green bean sides. I went for the chopped salad with no egg & dressing on the side. Our entrees were brought out within 15-20 minutes, which was perfect. We were all very hungry, but didn't want to be rushed. I devoured my salad & absolutely loved the garlic herb dressing. A word of warning, however. If you do not like dill, do not get this dressing. It was so dilly (is that a word?!), but I like dill & felt like it made the dressing so much more refreshing. Megan & Peggy said their pot pie was the best they had ever had, including Peggy's homemade pot pie. Egads! The sides were not an afterthought at all. The asparagus was alright a bit limp for my liking, but the green beans were outta this world. Sauteed in garlic & olive oil and served with tomatoes & blue cheese chunks. If I may steal Rachel Ray's words, yumm-o! We also ordered 2 desserts (please don't judge) The tres leche cake with strawberries was alright (homemade whipped cream btw), but the coffee/chocolate ice cream pie was to die for. It had toasted pecans, chocolate syrup, coffee ice cream on top of chocolate ice cream, and homemade whipped cream. I was a bit full after eating my HUGE salad, but took a couple bites & wished I could have handled more. I will most definitely be back since everything on the menu looked delicious, including the molasses corned beef sammie. Um, hello! Also, I'd like to come & drink a pint & maybe sing some Irish tunes if the opportunity ever presents itself.
