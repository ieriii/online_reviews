awesome place for vegans, hands down. entertaining my vegan friend, she had eaten here the last time she was in town and ordered the ruben again. it was great. i have to say, this is the best place to fake it. i ordered the avocado tostadas - nothing fake about it - just veg. yum, though. slapped some siracha (cock sauce) on that puppy and called it a day. my other friend got a salad with some bbq fake meat on there. it was good, too. ooooh, the fake ranch is awesome. there's only one thing, and this is totally a personal thing. every time i eat fake meat, i get gaggy afterward. i dont know what it is. while im eating it, it's great. the next minute, i feel sick. i no likey. one of my other vegan friends, who was vegan long ago but is no longer, always introduced me to fake meat, and same thing - gag. i dont know if it's psychological, but i always try to embrace it and then 2 minutes later, i feel sick. anyway. same thing happened here, but dont let that steer you clear.  the diner is cute and the service was excellent. we sat in the back patio, although it was covered. eat here. the veggies and the fake meat are a great treat. that rhymed.
