I had food delivered from this place, so I don't know what it's like dining there, but I didn't like the food, or the service. When I placed the order, the person said it would be a half hour, and it took about an hour and 20 minutes. Also, I ordered and paid for spring rolls, that they forgot to bring. The food they did bring sucked in my opinion. I had shrimp fried rice, which was super greasy, with only a few mooshy shrimp. I had an order of the mongolian beef, which was skimpy with greesy sauce, making the vegetable super soggy. The few non-scrappy beef pieces were pretty good though. We had the garlic chicken which was also skimpy, greesy, and soggy. I won't have food delivered from here again. If dining in the restaurant is better, or if they were just having an off-day, I guess I can see giving them another chance. But if this quality of food and level of service is consistent, I wouldn't waste my appetite, time, or money.
