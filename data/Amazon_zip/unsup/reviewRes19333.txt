I have a love hate relationship with Chicago sushi restaurants... Love sushi, hate the snobbery and expense! Coast delivers high quality, unique sushi choices, at a fair price. Being BYOB (and around the corner from my house) helps too! It has that laid back, but high class vibe that's perfect for date night
