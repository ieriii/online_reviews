First time we went here is was great! Loved the food and the atmosphere. Went back the following weekend with friends from out of town and they were running way behind schedule. They did not honor our reservation and made us wait 45min for our table. We had to wait in the bar and we were starving. It was not an enjoyable situation and we ended up leaving and eating somewhere else.
