I came again, I found a groupon and planned a little dinner out with a few friends. I love the food here. Let's not get confused. But tonight, India House failed at service and I have to take away a star. The last time I went before this was during a very quiet, tame night for them. This time around, they were almost fully booked in the entire restaurant. I've worked at a restaurant before, I've worked at a couple actually. I understand how it gets when it gets really busy. But I have been a server and never have I been rude to a diner or walked away after I felt like I was waiting too long for someone's order. This is what happened! It was so weird! He stood there, got impatient and didn't even ask if we still needed a few minutes, he just walked away! He hated our guts and I could tell the entire service. They didn't allow any replacements or substitutes... he didn't try to give me another option. It was just straight up rude. I will come back for the food, not the attitude. Sheesh.
