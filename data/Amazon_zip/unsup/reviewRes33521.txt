I had made a reservation for lunch at 12:30 on a Sunday. The place only had one table occupied so you probably don't need a reservation if you're coming for lunch. Our waiter didn't really do anything than smile at us the while time which was a little odd.  We started out with the Bruschette with Prosciutto. This was great! Nice chucks of tomato and the cheese they use it not too over powering. They have a great beer list and some amazing prices. This was definitely a highlight of our experience here. We split the caesar salad ( I didn't care for the parsley or whatever they put on top) and ordered the Napoletana pizza (with sausage and no arugula). The pizza was pretty forgettable and nothing great.  Although this place was decent, I probably won't be coming back. N
