This is BY FAR may fav italian rest in the city. Their food is non-traditional Italian and I really enjoy their specials. The outdoor patio during the summer months is pure heaven. The only drawback to this place is that their bar is jammed up against their seating area and it is really annoying when people can' t get through to their tables. The place is popular so I understand but man it gets croweded in their. One time we had a private party upstairs and it worked out really nice.
