Everyone raves about this place, but frankly, it is completely overrated. I have been there many times and tried different things off the menu each time. I have never found a menu item which is worthy of the good reviews that everyone gives this place. Low price for sure but low taste and meh options. Delivery is hit and miss as well. Save yourself- make your own pasta at home or go somewhere else. This place is not worth it.
