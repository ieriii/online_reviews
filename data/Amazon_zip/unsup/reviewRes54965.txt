This place continues to deliver! We've never had a bad experience here, we have been going here for over 2 years. Love the fact that it is BYOB. The chefs are focused on flavor, not presentation (not like Alinea). And the flavors really work well together (not like Graham Elliot). We consider it one of, if not the best restaurant in Chicago. You will spend a couple of hours savoring your courses, and don't worry, you won't leave hungry!
