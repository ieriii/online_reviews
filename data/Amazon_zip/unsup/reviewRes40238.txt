A real treasure in this neighborhood! An eclectic mix of people and food, customers and staff. A fun laid back crowd - this logan square hot spot shows that the neighborhood has a lot to offer and is becoming what Uptown could have been. Very fairly priced, the menu has many selections from venison comparable to Blackbirds and drinks made by mixologist as talented as anywhere else in the city. Expect a worthwhile wait and they even serve till 1AM. More of a 2 top spot but the back room does accept larger parties. I am told they will be opening a cute little boutique 7 room hotel upstairs as well. Parking is a little tough as many of the side streets are permit but the logan square blue line stop is only steps away. Coming upon their year anniversary expect this place to stay on the map for some time.
