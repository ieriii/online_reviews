This was a stop along the cupcake crawl yesterday. I wasn't inspired to say the least. I had the red velvet cupcake. The cake part had absolutely no flavor, I know it's red velvet and it doesn't have any particular flavor that one can describe but come on! Why take in all those calories to have a piece of flavorless crap? No thanks. The frosting was blah and the red substance drizzled on top was putrid. It tasted like pure chemicals, you know like the fake strawberry sauce used at low-par ice cream shops? Yeah that kind. Oh and the wrapping was quite possibly the most annoying thing to try to take off before consuming your treat. The appearance of the pastries overall, is pleasing. Nothing spectacular but pleasing. It definitely had a cozy, comfy, old fashioned bakery feel to it. The cakes are absolutely gorgeous and I highly recommend it for a special occasion cake as they seem to have a wonderful grasp on the proper usage of fondant icing. Make sure to check out the pics on the walls as well as their cake book for options. The staff there was, by far, the friendliest of all the bakeries visited yesterday. They look like the typical crunchy, grungy bunch you will find working at most Wicker Park establishments but they were informative and helpful. And, dare I say it, they smiled at us when we first walked in (ok maybe that was my overly optimistic, delighted mind at work playing tricks on me).  The other bone I have to pick is the cleanliness. It just wasn't up to my standards. I felt as though at any moment I could be sharing cupcake bliss with a friendly neighborhood roach. Not very appealing. It's definitely not the worst I've seen and it wasn't horrible but I would havepreferred it to be a bit more tidy. It wasn't a bad experience and if I have the occasion to order a cake this is the place I would go back to hands down. If you are just looking for a sweet I would say to skip it, get your calories somewhere else.
