Unfortunately, perhaps the worst experience I've had at a hotel in the US (not the world). First, a few good things: -Location is superb -Can't beat the price -Desk staff was helpful and nice And now the litany of bad things: -Room smelled horrible (like sewage of sewer gases) -Made a NYC hotel room look huge. -Was not clean or cleaned very well. -Had a couple of roaches -AC didn't work in my room -Toilet wouldn't reliably flush -Shower water pressure was what I would describe as a dribble. -Room didn't have a Iron or ironing board in it (weird, but I did get one on request) -Room layout was not well done (i.e. no desk, just a bed, never seen this before) -No amenities of any kind besides really slow wifi, not even coffee and donuts in the AM. Bottom-line, you get what you pay for and this place is cheap. As others have said if you're not going to be in room and just out and about it's probably passable, but just. Incidentally, after two nights in a simply awful room I explained my plight to the manager and she promptly moved me without any fuss to a new room which was much better.
