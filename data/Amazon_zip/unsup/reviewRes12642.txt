The food here was absolutely delicious. After reading the reviews here before I went I had high expectations and Texas de Brazil definitely lived up to it. There is a pretty extensive salad bar. My friend and I started out with that and everything I got from there was outstanding but definitely don't fill up on the food there. Texas de Brazil is all about the meat! I don't think I have ever eaten that much in one sitting! Servers walk around with giant servings of meat (medium well or medium rare) and deliver as much as your hearts desire to your table. Each diner has a card with a green side and a red side - green means you are ready for more and red means you are done or taking a break. The filet mignon was to die for. Even after I was getting full I kept my eye out for the server walking around with the filet mignon. My friend and I went for our "anniversary." On the Texas de Brazil website if you register your email for your anniversary and your birthday you get coupons in your inbox for buy one get one free meals. Between groupons, birthday discounts, anniversaries and other deals that frequently pop up in my inbox there is no reason to ever pay full price here so definitely research a deal before you go.
