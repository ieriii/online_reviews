I've been a customer of Glenn's since they opened up. It's definitely the place to go for fish in the Lincoln Square/Ravenswood neighborhoods. But lately it seems like they've become a victim of their own success. The food has become inconsistent and the service mediocre at best. My last experience included a very offensive comment made by one of the staff at the restaurant. Something I might expect uttered at a restaurant in the south, but not in Chicago. That along with the ridiculous if not impossible wait times to get into the restaurant have me looking for a new destination for fresh fish in Chicago.
