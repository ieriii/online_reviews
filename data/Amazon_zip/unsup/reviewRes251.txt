BEST MEAL I'VE EVER HAD! We did the Tour menu which consisted of 27 courses! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and we actually got a tour of the kitchen. They have 23 chefs working at all times--- the restaurant is only closed from 4AM - 6AM every day--- the other 22 hours are for prepping, cleaning, and cooking--- I thought that was pretty amazing. It's hard to start with "highlights" when I would say 15 of the 27 courses were the best dishes I've ever had in my life. I think the three that stood out were the prawn wrapped sesame stick, the pork belly spring roll, and the venison served on a cherry infused fireplace log. Everything is great though--- I thought that I would have a little trouble enjoying knowing the bill that was coming at the end of the meal, but as hard is it may be to believe, it's worth every penny for the experience. They create amazing flavors that truly challenge your pallet and are served in such creative ways. Some dishes come out with hidden food encapsulated within serving dishes, some require self preparation, some you think are merely table decoration until you end up eating them!  I would recommend the tour menu- we originally were going to do the tasting, but it's kind of silly to save $150 when you are already talking about $600-$800 meal for 2. Do the tour, enjoy the extra 10 courses that include lots of amazing deserts.  I will say they have a good variety of wine bottles in the $45-$75 range, but even with 1 bottle of wine you're looking at $700 for 2 on the tour menu. Will I go back soon? Probably not unless the economy drastically changes, but I definitely will be remembering the experience with my fiance forever.
