My friends took me to Hopleaf during my last visit to Chicago. Actually, we were going to eat somewhere closer so we could walk, but those among us who were Chicago residents insisted on Hopleaf so hard that we decided it would be worth it to cram six of us into a tiny car and drive across town, with one passenger in the trunk. In the end, their persistence was fully appreciated.  In short: this place is everything I want in a restaurant / bar.  The sandwiches are incredible. Although I had heard good things about "the best ham sandwich in town," I ordered the CBJ on a whim. I could not have been more happy with this grown-up version of the peanut butter and jelly. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory, and surprisingly filling. I was also lucky enough to sample both the beef brisket and ham sandwiches, which just made me want to order everything on the menu.  The beer selection is phenomenal. I mean, I've been to Belgium, and I saw a larger selection of Belgian beers at Hopleaf than I did in the country of Belgium! The beer menu descriptions were thorough and accurate. Although I cannot remember the beers I tried by name, I was happy with them all. Hopleaf's interior is cozy and warm, with exposed brick and running fireplaces. Although our server wasn't very attentive, everything was so good that I didn't even care; I figured she was probably just having an off night.  My only gripe is that Hopleaf is so far away from me! I will be eating here every time I visit Chicago, that is for sure.
