Yelp hasn't let me down with this one. We'll keep this short, because I want to save you time from sitting here reading through 800 reviews. Your time is better spent heading to The Bongo Room and indulging in their excellence...ASAP! Pros: 1. Pancakes- try one, try all. Share. or dont. Either way, they are like heaven in your mouth. Definitely more of a dessert flavor going on with them...but I am 100% okay with dessert for breakfast. 2. Eggs Benedict- one of my favorite brunch items ever, and they do it really good. 3. nice servers 4. good prices for the serving sizes. Cons: 1. The space can be a little tight on the weekends during brunch...no where to wait inside. BUT, we only waited 35 minutes on a Saturday and there is a bunch of really cute shops next door to keep you busy. GO, GO, GO...what are you waiting for?!
