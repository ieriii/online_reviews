I've lived practically next door to this place. Let me tell you it is not only AMAZING, but torturous to have this place so close by. Our street smells so freaking good. My favorite thing is that I can go and get a slice of pizza and a massively large soda for about $5. An amazing slice of pizza that fills me up and a soda I don't need a refill for about $5. Best deal ever. I've eaten so many other of the "famous" Chicago deep dish.. they're fine. Just average. But this, this pizza is truly great. It's the best tasting pizza I've found in the city, and one of the best deals for pizza. The guys who work here are great too. One word of warning: their Meaty Delight is uber meaty. Probably the most meat-packed pizza I've had (that's still taste awesome). Even some of my big macho guy friends agreed, it's a lot of meat to tackle. Thinking about this pizza is making me crave it... good thing it's steps away! If you want good pizza, don't pass up this place. The line moves fairly quickly, and it'll totally worth it.
