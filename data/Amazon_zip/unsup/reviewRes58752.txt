We went to this restaurant this past week and were pleased. Like many others, we had heard mixed reviews ranging from "tries too hard" to "inventive." After a lengthy dinner I'm some where in between, but would definitely recommend people go and see for themselves. The atmosphere was wonderful and the bartender extremely personal. We tried signature drinks and they were worth the price. The waiter bordered on slightly obnoxious, but we let that go. The starter popcorn with truffle oil was amazing. We had two appetizers. The beef tar tar was standard fare with little special about it. The kung pow sweet breads, however, were incredibly flavorful with a much appreciated playful addition of peanut brittle. For main courses we had the halibut, which was beautifully cooked and flavored and the pork loin, which was done well, but again standard fare. We had to try the famous foie gras lollipops, which were incredibly salty, but an interesting transition to dessert. The strawberry shortcake was deconstructed and the best plate of the night. Incredibly tasty and left me wanting to return just for that. Overall, the night was a mixed sampling of great and standard. Nothing was poorly done. The atmosphere helps. The price is a bit high not to have your socks knocked off, but if you do some research before going I think you can figure out what the really winning plates are.
