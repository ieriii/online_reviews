We'd been talking about going for awhile and we are really really glad that we finally got around to going to Graham Elliot.  Overall, we were pleased, just not as pleased as we were expecting to be!  The sashimi was ok, the corn bisque was great fun and my entree just overall lacked flow and flavor. My husband was a teensy bit more impressed with his choices than I was...but at that price level and reputation we were just expecting so very much more. Like I said, we're really glad we went, but we won't be racing back to try out more at Graham Elliot...maybe our expectations were simply too high, I'm not sure, but we definitely left a bit hungry and a bit unimpressed.
