Great consistent steaks! Our regular waiter, Mason, is very friendly, helpful and entertaining. When I want to go to a steak place and want to "know" what I'm gonig to get I stop by here. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is because its a chain. If it was a stand alone, it'd be perfect.
