I am a massive fan of sushi, and by massive I mean sometimes eating it 3 times a week for lunch. Coast is in fact a favorite of mine for sushi in the city.  They have a great ambiance and the prices for the sushi aren't so bad. The place features many, many rolls most of which aren't truly traditional Japanese, but still good. Their Dragon Roll was quite good, and their nigiri is great and fresh. They have some "wasabi from Japan" option for a few dollars extra on the menu, but to me it tasted exactly like fake wasabi FYI. Also FWIW, I had balls enough to take a girl from Japan here once and she approved.
