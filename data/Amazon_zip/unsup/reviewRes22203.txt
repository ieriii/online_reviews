After seeing Ralph's World at Old Towne we headed over to the Superdawg for some grub. Never been, but always told it was a top notch dawg place. It was the warmest of days, in fact it was chilly so that was a bit of a bummer. I still enjoyed the charm of the drive-in none the less. We had a dawg, fries, and a shake. Most impressive was the shake. The dawg was good, but didnt blow me away. Can a hawt dawg even do that?? They only accept cash, no debit or credit cards. If you are in the area I would recommend this place on a hot summers day.
