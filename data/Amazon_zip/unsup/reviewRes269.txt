My date brought me here a little while back. Everything was absolutely perfect. As soon as my date parked his car, he was greeted by his first name. The great service started from that very moment, considering most establishments would never simply know one of their client's names from the moment they step out of their car. We were then escorted into the restaurant, which was beautifully appointed. The food and service were out of this world. I was presented with flavors that I never experienced. The presentations were ones I would never imagine. The servers were incredibly courteous. Our wine pairings were incredible. My entire experience was one of my best overall restaurant experiences. For the guys out there...if you'd like to impress your lady...this is certainly the place!
