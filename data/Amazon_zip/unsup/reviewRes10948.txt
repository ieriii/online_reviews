LOVE LOVE LOVE PIECE! This is my absolute favorite pizza place in Chicago. I am huge fan of the New Haven style red pizza and had a "Piece Month" recently, during which I went there once a week. Different events, coincidentally @ Piece. W00T! This is one place I don't think I will ever get bored of. Imagine the possibilities of combinations of toppings on your personal piece of heaven. I have tried some crazy combo including - "Mashed potato and Chicken", "Basil, Ricotta and Sausage" Barley wine, Camel Toe, Baby Vaugh Awesome, Banana Beer... I have too many favorite among their microbrewery selection... Oh My God. I am wanting it from jus typing this review out....
