Another stop on my quest to try every place in Chinatown. We came here for a late night dinner after a Sox night game and damn, what a great idea. After spending about 20 minutes reading their novel of a menu (I think it had about 800 items on it?) I finally decided to go with the salt & pepper prawns. They were alright. Not nearly as good at the head/shells on version from LTH, but good enough the entire plate got devoured. Also at the table: Salt & Pepper mixed seafood (the best dish on the table), Sweet & Sour chicken (yuck - too cloyingly sweet), and a beef dish that was tasty. Don't get me wrong - everything was delicious - but it just wasn't as delicious as some of the other Chinatown eateries. But, a decent night in a Chinatown restaurant beats Northside Chinese food any day, so it'll still get 4 stars. If I hadn't been to Kam Fung or LTH, it'd have gotten 5 stars, and rave reviews.
