So I really like the beer here. Really like it. The Working Man Ale is just fantastic and reminds me of a good English lunch beer, a great session beer as well. The Anti-Hero is a great hoppy IPA and recommended for all you hop-heads. The Eugene porter is rich and robust and would make an excellent winter warm-up beer. Good beer, really good. Now the food didn't live up to the beer unfortunately. I have tried a few pricey dishes from here and have been disappointed every time. The burgers are your best bet for something decent but the entrees are overpriced for the quality you are getting. Just haven't been wowed by food that should be well...wowable. The service is usually good once you can get a table and the place itself is cool and hip looking. Just a bit disappointing. But great beer, I mean great beer!
