I think this place is lovely and quite yummy. I'm a bit skeptical of the communal tables that are in the middle, but I sat at private tables both times I went and it was quite lovely. They have this honeydew drink that is so delicious with real honeydew made with it. On to appetizers: oxtail potstickers were pretty good even though I'm not a huge fan of oxtail. The lemongrass lollipops looked so cute and they were yummy. I loved how they really made it look like a lollipop. My favorite appetizer is the wild mushroom and asparagus toban. It's not too salty and all of the flavors complement each other very well. The crunchy asparagus pairs well with the soft mushroom. Yum. In terms of sushi, the super white tuna sashimi was by far the best sushi I've had in a long time. The service was really great and I felt like they were quite attentive and ready for any questions. I really enjoyed both experiences at Sunda and would gladly return.
