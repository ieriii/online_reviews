Love this place! Lots of great non-meat options, amazing staff with terrific knowledge of the menu and wines in the store. The bill is ALWAYS less than I anticipate and it's just a great spot. Doesn't take reservations, I've always come "early" -after meetings in the area and always had great luck w/immediate seating.
