Awesome new joint in the neighborhood - I'm coming back for sure! I'm a very picky beer drinker - I tried the Willie - it was dark, strong but still a light and awesome beer! Also tried Duck Confit Pizza with Gorgonzola cheese - never heard of a duck on the pizza before but this was sooo delicious! It was no problem to get a table and got an amazing service.
