It's hard to get authentic, cheap Mexican fare by the Lake or the Near North Side, so I was excited when a friend suggested we hit Pilsen for a good BYOB dinner. We arrived before 6 on a Friday night to no wait, but it was super packed by the time we left. Loved the free app (taquitos the night we went) and bottomless chips & salsa with plenty of free dips and sides. The guac was creamy and soothing against the muy caliente complimentary sides for the chips. My friend is a vegetarian and has always been in love with their veggie burrito. I had the carne asada, which was thick and tough. It seems that other reviewers feel that the beef and pork tend to be overdone, too. Nuevo Leon is a great extended lunch counter type of a place, and other people I know seem to love it. I'd give it another chance, but will stick to non-meat fare.
