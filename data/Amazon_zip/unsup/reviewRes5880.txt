LOVE this place. I always recommend this place when friends visit town. No reservations, but the wait is worth it (Friday night about 40 minutes for 2 people). It is best to come here with a group of 4 so you can taste everything. Must haves: 1. Truffle egg toast with asparagus - great combination. 2. Davanti burger - perfectly made patty, toasted buns....just get it! 3. Polenta + ragu of the day - someone from the kitchen brings out a warm pot of ragu and mixes it with the polenta in front of you. When they first opened, they had an artichoke ragu that was amazing, but I haven't seen it since. Now it seems they only serve pork cheese ragu. Still good, but not as good as the artichoke. 4. Ricotta + Honey comb 5. Chicken liver pate 6. Focaccia bread - pretty large portion, super cheesy :D 7. Octopus - small portion The cured meats and cheese are delicious. The prosciutto pizza is good, but not amazing. The other dishes were good, but not as memorable as the ones listed above. Great beer and WINE selection. Ask to see their wine selection...they bring out a ginormous wine bottle with the menu taped to it. Pretty neat. Good service. Really well priced ~ $20/person without wine. It's a bit loud, but not to the point where you have to scream to talk. It's just lively inside :D Love the ambiance. I have yet to try their brunch...can't wait!
