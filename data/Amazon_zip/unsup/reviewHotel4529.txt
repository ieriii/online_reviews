I attended a wedding here last weekend, and it was gorgeous! The room was beautiful and the sauteed garlic shrimp appetizer was to die for. Seriously, that was probably the best thing I've ever eaten at a wedding. I want to go back for more! It was a pretty big wedding of over 300 people, but I dont think that is an excuse for nothing but exceptional service. Our corner table was forgotten a few times, and I even had to get up to ask someone to deliver our pasta dish. All in all, the food was good even if the service wasn't. Plus, I loved the room the wedding was in. I'd definitely recommend checking it out for your wedding.
