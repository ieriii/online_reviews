I visited for the first time this week. The restaurant is very nicely appointed, with copper/tin ceilings, very elegant large bar, and quaint stage area near the bar. There was a semi-private event there when I visited on 12/11 and a jazz trio was playing from this stage, a part of the semi-private event. I really wanted to have dinner at Wilde, but for some reason, after 3 requests and a 1+ hour wait at the bar, I was NEVER GIVEN A TABLE!! But, the place was packed and there was a fine assortment of beers, and the live music was very good. My table request just got lost in the shuffle. Half-starved, I paid my bill and went next door to dine at the Bamee Noodle. The Wilde B&R is a welcome addition to East Lakeview. There are a lot of dining choices here, but none are as nice in appearance as this place. I will visit again tonight with friends, and this time I hope to be given a table and have a fine meal too.Brian D
