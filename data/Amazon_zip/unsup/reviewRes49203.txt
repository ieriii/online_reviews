i want to hire a clown to smash their cupcakes into my face all day, are you kidding me? they're "da bomb" like the young folks say. on my way to work, i often stop in to eat one of their filled croissants (the turkey and cheese or the spinach are my faves) it is a little pricey, but well worth it! the cake display in the window is so cool! a cake art gallery! why anyone goes across the street to the starbucks (except to peep the cute bearded barista there) is beyond me!
