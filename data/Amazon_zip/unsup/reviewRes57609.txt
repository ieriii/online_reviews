my girlfriend and I went here last night. I loved everything about this place except for the seating. When you are spending over $100 on your meal I would like not be rubbing elbows with the table next to me. If you are able to get a table for two on the wall or in the booth do it. I would have given 5 stars if not for that. The service was unreal. Our waitress was great. The food was awesome. I loved the beef and lobster. The cheese fondue was soooo good. By the time dessert came I didn't think I could take another bite but I'm glad i did. The coffee was even excellent,
