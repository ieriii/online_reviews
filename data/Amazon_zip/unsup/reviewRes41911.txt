once i found this place on broadway, i stopped trying new places to get pho. rumor has it that this place has been closed due to health code violations in the past -- believe it if you will, but frankly, i don't really care. if rodent droppings are what it takes to make the beef broth that my tripe swims in taste so good, so be it.  i have yet to try something not wonderful here. at first glance, the menu was extremely overwhelming, but now i see it as a challenge. until i encounter a bowl of pho that does not spread my mouth into a grin and make me rub my tummy with delight, i will not repeat entrees. WILL NOT. the only "complaint" i've ever heard about this place was that one of the broths was slightly fishy -- but hello?! you ordered pho with sardines, ya dumb. did you think it was going to taste like cotton candy? there are so many things i love about this place. i love that they bring you an overflowing plate of pho accoutrements immediately after you order. i know it happens everywhere, but here it is extra fast. it's as if they know that i am always extremely hungry but didn't order an appetizer. nobody looks at me when i eat the sprouts and thai basil dipped in hoisin/sriracha as a first course. i love that when it gets busy on the weekends, they seat you at longer tables with separate parties and you can eavesdrop on conversations while you slurp.  i really, really love the army camo t-shirts that the servers wear. it's as if i were to a chinese restaurant where the menus were shaped like little red books, or a german restaurant where the cake is shaped like a crumbling wall. genius!
