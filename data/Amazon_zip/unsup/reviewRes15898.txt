This is a really cool place. Downside: you have to wait in line, usually for quite sometime, to even get inside (there's no inside waiting room, just a sort of hallway/vestibule place, and the line usually spills out onto the street, giving away its "secret speakeasy" location). There are always a few douchebags who try to gladhand the bouncer and bypass the line, but the man won't budge, and said douchebags are appropriately reproached. Once inside, the ambience is nothing short of magical - Alice in Wonderland meets Reservoir Dogs, with a Louis XIV flair. The cocktails are pretty amazing - if you're boring and always order Miller Lite everywhere you go, these drinks are not for you. They include everything from house-made bitters to raw egg whites. And man, will they get you shitfaced, making the $11 flat cocktail price seem pretty darn reasonable. I ordered something to snack on: a peanut butter and bacon (thank you God) sandwich, fried in some sort of sweetish honey crust and vafdglkergasfjaraaejl...oh, sorry, my verbal abilities melted into nonsense at the recollection of it. I was really nervous that the people who go there, not to mention work there, would be typical Wicker Park snobs, but the servers are amazing, and really seem knowledgeable, and the way the tables and chairs are set up you basically don't have to deal with anyone. It's definitely worth a trip.
