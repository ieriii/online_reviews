Tough to tell what's going to happen here. My first experience with Garcia's was post-renovation on a busy Friday night and I'm not exactly sold yet. I arrived a little later than my original party and was promptly warned about the service. I'll give the waitress the benefit of the doubt as she looked a little shell-shocked at the crowd that had gathered for the first "big" night since it reopened. Other tables looked to be getting their drink and food orders no problem, but it took a little while for my margarita, which had been ordered before I got there, to get to the table. I'm from the South and we do margaritas frozen down there and I had hoped that this would be a decent margarita. The first was pretty good, but the second went way overboard on the mix and was way, way too tart for my liking. The other person at my table who was drinking margaritas agreed. Too much mix. The burrito I split with my fiancee was pretty good. Nothing remarkable, but it was HUGE and we split it and both came away full. It was a "good" burrito. Not great, just good. I'm looking forward to going back once the initial crowds subside, hopefully on a Saturday afternoon or Tuesday night to try a little bit more of the menu. For now though, it's 3 Stars for Garcias.
