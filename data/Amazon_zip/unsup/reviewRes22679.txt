I saw this place on the Travel channel before I moved up here, and was excited to try it. On my third day living in Chicago my brother and I made the trip out there, and we loved it. We both had the Superdawg with everything. I was stuffed, but my brother went for a second. We brought one back for my boyfriend, and even after the long car ride, he thought it was excellent. We've taken out of town guests there since, and will definitely be going back again.
