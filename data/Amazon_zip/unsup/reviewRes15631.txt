I hate to give Calo a 3 star review, I really do. I've been a loyal customer for a few years now after a friend turned me on to Calo, but I had a bad experience on Sat. night. Every visit I've had to Calo other than last night has been wonderful. I've generally gone with a small group of friends and enjoyed the price-conscious, yet delicous, menu. The ambiance is great... very Sopranos-esque with lots of dark wood, candles, etc. HOWEVER..... I went to a b-day party at Calo on Sat. night and I was not a happy camper. Our server was less than attentive. We had to wait almost an hour after we were seated to order or meals and our drink refills were not tended to very well. I ordered the lasgne bolognese, which was excellent at the time, but not so excellent in the hours after the meal. I think I may have caught a bit of food poisioning. I know I'll give Calo another chance. I love Calo and before Saturday, I never had a bad experience.
