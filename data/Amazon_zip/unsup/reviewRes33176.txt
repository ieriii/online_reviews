So yummy! Randomly came here for lunch while wandering around Wicker Park thanks to the fantastic Yelp reviews. I had a falafel wrap which was solid and along with a can of coke, was a really great value. It's definitely a better option than American fast food and has some good vegetarian options. There's also a dessert shop next door which I will have to come back and try for sure. Keep in mind that it's cash only!
