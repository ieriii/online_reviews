Green Mill. I like it tho I don't love it. I like the decaying exterior with its multitude of flickering lights which entertain the drunken eye. I like that the interior is all dark, sad, and messy like a tough, aging torch singer. I'm not big into poetry slams, but I do enjoy piano jazz. The drinks are only decent. The crowd is only regular (with the exception of spoken word events). It could be worse.
