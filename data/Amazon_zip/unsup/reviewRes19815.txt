We had a blast at Coast and I'm not sure if it was the company or the food! It just so happened that in the same week I found myself at two of Chicago's sushi joints and I have to say, Coast was the better. Everything was fresh and well made. I tried the White Dragon (thanks to a review on here) and the Philly rolls as well as sharing edamame and a potsticker like appetizer that I wasn't paying attention to when it was ordered! Everything was very good. One of the best things about Coast is it's not just sushi. My fiancee, who does not like, and won't eat sushi, was about to order a teriakyi New York strip and was very pleased! I love that it's BYOB because I knew I was getting a wine I enjoyed! I guess they say one bottle per two people but we had a bottle of champage and a bottle of wine for three of us and no one said anything! The only negative I can say is the atmosphere. It is very hard and thus very loud. Even with three of us at a smallish table I often found myself having to repeat or ask my friends to repeat what they were saying.
