Small rooms and bathroom. Outstanding customer service, we got in late, about 11pm on a Thursday, im gluten intolerant so i packed food knowing i would not be able to find anything to eat at that time of night. My food required warming up in a microwave. The room had a mini-fridge but no microwave, my husband called to the front desk staff to see if there was a microwave somewhere which we could use. They said there was not one in the hotel, when my husband explained the situation, they said they would see what they could do. Shortly after making the phone call, a staff member showed up to our door carrying a microwave which he left in our room for us. I've never experienced such a thing and felt so grateful!
