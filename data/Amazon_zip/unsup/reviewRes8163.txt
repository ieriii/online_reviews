This was the first place I had filet mignon and now I can't stop. They do have a fabulous salad bar with manchego (my favorite!) and serrano ham, but the highlight is really the meat! Each piece of meat that I had was delicious and true to form, it kept coming until you tell them to stop... Except, I stopped way more often than Joe and they still asked me if I wanted some lamb/pork/beef. Then we got dessert... And I wouldn't recommend it because we didn't know how full we were... The dessert wasn't that good anyway, ha!
