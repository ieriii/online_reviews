My first question: why is it called Ruth's Chris Steak House? For years I've wanted to know who this Chris was and what he is to Ruth. I'm sure a Google search would provide the answers, but I prefer to live in a state of not knowing and perpetual asking. Now to the restaurant - I loved it! To be completely honest, this is a very belated review so I don't remember all the food, but I do remember it being very delicious and well-prepared. The ambiance was great as well and the service exemplary. I remember thoroughly enjoying the meal and appreciating every bite because it was that good.
