This is one of my boyfriend's favorite places and when we first went there, I immediately understood why. Beside the cool ambiance of a bar but yet a restaurant, the hugely extensive beer list (delicious dark brews mmm) and locally produced (i think?) meals.... this place is the best. The burgers, the sandwiches, the beers... everything here makes my heart warm. And the best part is... this place is actually AFFORDABLE. Now, you'll understand why the Bad Apple so easily fell into place in my heart.
