Starting on a positive note: the potato-chicken balls are TO DIE FOR. I should just get three of those and fall asleep for 14 hours. The pizza is also fantastic: interesting and quality ingredients on delicious crust and oven baked. Here's the but: The first few times I've ordered here, I've loved it, even recommended it to others. The last two times I've ordered, the pizza was wrong. The first time, I called and they offered $10 off the next order. Fine. The second time, I didn't bother calling since I didn't think I'd be back anytime soon. Another issue that seems to plague this place is that order time quotes are messed up: I'll show up at the quoted time and the pizza seemed to have been sitting for several minutes, or it won't be done for 15 more minutes. Conclusion: when they're on, they're on: 5 stars. But they've been off more often than not lately.
