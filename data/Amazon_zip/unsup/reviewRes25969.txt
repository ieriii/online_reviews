Very surprisingly good. I didn't have huge expectations, but I was very happily surprised with both the food and service. I went during lunch, which was not crowded at all. All three of us choose to go with their "Catalan Express" two-course $18 menu that comes with an ice tea or soda. I choose the split-pea soup with truffle oil (delicious, and generous portion) as well as the hangar steak sandwich with caramelized onions and a balsamic reduction. The sandwich was perfectly European, and having been to Barcelona twice, was a very Spanish portion...and perfect. It tasted delicious and I would recommend both dishes. I hope to make it back for dinner, and see if that menu will be equally as satisfying.
