If you love New Haven style pizza, or pizza in general, you will absolutely want to try what Piece has to offer. I ordered the red pizza with a variety of delicious toppings and was more than pleased. This restaurant can get busy, especially on the weekends, so I would get there early. Also, Piece has a well respected micro brewery, so make sure you get a pint with your pie. If you like pizza and beer, Piece is the best spot in Wicker Park.
