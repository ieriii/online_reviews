It doesn't look like a "diner" in the traditional sense like the Golden Apple, Salt & Pepper, and Mitchell's diners. However, it has diner food on the menu (tons of cereal) and it serves breakfast all day long. Breakfast is well above average; however, I would recommend Glenn's for it's chalkboard menu fish selection...it's awesome. Sturgeon, marlin, sea bass, swordfish...pretty much you name the fish, they got it. Plus its very. very fresh. Service is good and it's somewhat more spruced up than a regular Chicago diner. Overall it's a cozy enough place with outdoor seating to take a date to. Order the fish and give it a try.
