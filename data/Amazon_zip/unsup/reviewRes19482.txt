Had the same experience as a below poster - I was warned about the spiciness of ordering the cochinita pibil torta "hot," yet I found it not too spicy at all, but nonetheless pretty tasty. Was disappointed that they were out of my first choice of torta - they explained they were busy (hmm I could have predicted this, though I am not a master business chef giant!). I would check out XOCO when there's not a line... maybe for a late lunch or breakfast on a weekday. It was good, but not worth a long wait... or any wait at all.... I'm guessing that is what the concept is, and in fact it will be a very cool option once the initial hype dies down.  If you're a little more daring and willing to wander out of River North, just hit up a mom and pop taqueria (I'm guessing Rick Bayless wouldn't object to this idea) or if you're going to wait anyway, wait for Frontera.
