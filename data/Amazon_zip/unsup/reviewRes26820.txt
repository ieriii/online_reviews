5 stars doesn't quite do GE justice anymore. Stopped in on a Tuesday to see what this whole new menu thing at Graham Elliot was about. First, I still can't get over the wonderful atmosphere here. It's so great to be able to walk in and just sit at the bar in such a cool setting, have fantastic service and even better food. The new menu - I'm going to have to work my way through it. Everything we tried last night was 5+ stars - the deconstructed caesar is always a favorite of mine; the crab was To Die For and the lobster risotto...oh and then the amuse-bouche (how can so much flavor be packed into the tiniest little taste??)... I can't continue because I am seriously considering stopping in again tonight. I should expand my horizons. Or maybe not. VERY excited for the new cocktail list as well - the guys behind the bar here are not kidding around. I'd go so far as to say some of the best mixologists in the city. Needless to say, if you live in Chicago: get yourself in here, like, yesterday. Just don't eat 14 bowls of popcorn, like I do. Save some for the rest of us.
