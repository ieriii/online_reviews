This review pertains to our wonderful wedding reception that we had at the Westin (Michigan Avenue) this fall. Annie was our wedding coordinator and she was fabulous. She worked closely with us and listened intently to all our visions and needs. She promptly returned e-mails and returned phone calls and was never too busy to have an impromtu meeting with me. As for the food--the food was seriously excellent--especially the buttermilk poached chicken with artichoke ravioli, spinach and mushroom confit. It was not your typical "wedding chicken." It was scrumptous--our guests raved about it! Our room was awesome--the Consort Ballroom is a private room on the 16th floor with windows on three sides with views of Michigan Avenue, Water Tower, Lake Shore Drive and the Lake! Overall, our wedding was wonderful and I couldn't imagine changing a thing.
