My all-time favorite restaurant in Chicagoland is back in business. New location, more spacious and same excellent Cantonese cooking. Quick and friendly service, and very affordable too!  Came here for a quick dinner Saturday evening before work. Had my usual seafood soup (very satisfying!), roast pork (deliciously crispy skin), baby clams in black bean sauce, and steamed yu choy veggies. Everything tasted good! I always leave here with a full stomach and a happy face. :) Can't wait to go back for that famous duck dinner which is an amazing dinner package in itself.
