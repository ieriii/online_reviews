Ehh. That's all I really have to say about this place. I came in expecting a much better meal, considering the famous chef (Rick Bayless?) owns this place. Never really been a huge fan of Mexican food, but decided to give this a shot since it's technically "Nueva Latino" and my friend loves brunch here. I ordered the recommended special of Mahi Mahi, which wasn't bad but the tomatina sauce was too strong and overpowered the fish... there wasn't a right balance. Plus, it felt more like a heavy dinner than light brunch. Our waiter was gracious about giving us more of the spiced nuts (which, sadly, were much tastier than my entree). I tried the Sapitas too, but they failed to impress. And I would have appreciated if the waiter told us that the special was double the price of their other dishes... which I found out the hard way. So, ehhh. Would I come here again? Unlikely. I'd rather try other places in Chicago next time I visit.
