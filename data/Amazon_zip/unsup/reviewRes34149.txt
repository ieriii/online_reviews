Sultan's is a great spot when you need some cheap and delicious food that actually makes you feel like you won't be hungry less than 3 hours later. I ALWAYS get the lentil soup. It's vegan (so no cream base) and is the most delicious soup that you can get for the price. I would also recommend the cheese and egg pie, because it's like a portable breakfast and goes well with the lentil soup. My fiance has had the Tilapia dinner combo and it was HUGE and under $10. He loved every part of it, but I only tried the hummus, rice and tabbouleh that came with it, all of which were delicious. We have also had the falafel sandwich which was flavorful and moist, yet the falafel managed to maintain its crispy exterior. Service is instantaneous, so you can definitely be in and out with your food in less than 10 minutes.
