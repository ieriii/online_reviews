If you happen to have a day like me where you ended up eating dessert(frozen yogurt) first, then AYCE sushi lunch, which the fro yo made you too full to really partake fully in, and then for whatever odd reason, the fat guy inside you decided another dessert was in order after the sushi.... come to Alliance Bakery.  You can indulge your sweet tooth without going too crazy with fullness. How is this possible? By getting an awesome nearly giant macaron! Of all the macarons I've eaten in my lifetime, I believe Slurping Turtle and Alliance have the largest ones I've seen. And props to Alliance for carrying my favorite flavors, Pistachio, Red Velvet, Hazelnut Chocolate and my newly found friend, Blueberry Cheesecake. I think their cupcakes are lovely as well, and fairly priced IMO.  And if you're in need of liquid consumption to go with your cavity makers, they have a great selection of loose leaf tea on the shelf behind the counter. Don't want either? Just check out the art, inside and in the window display. The cakes look too good to eat. Seriously. If I ever bought one of those, I'd pretend I was going to cut it up for the guests, but I'd also have some genero Costco sheet cake that I would actually allow people to eat, while I'm getting the cake bronzed in a super double secret ceremony.  Inside, check out the elevation drawings illustrating just exactly what goes into a Marie or an Ellen, layer by layer. The former architecture major in me is in love... Come on down to Alliance. Like me, it's small but packs a punch.
