My first time dining here and I enjoyed my time. If you are a big meat eater, this is good for you. I tried my hardest to try all the selections possible. Didn't make it. The salad bar was amazing. The selection wasn't extraordinary but great. I saved my tummy for dinner but couldn't fit it all in. There was a bit of a wait even though we made reservations. (It is friday night) The servers are all so friendly, fast, fantastic. I really enjoyed tonights dinner and I plan to visit again!
