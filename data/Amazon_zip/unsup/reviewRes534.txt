so I've been to Alinea...tried the 12 course tasting menu. to call this place a restaurant, to call the experience there "FOOD" wouldnt do this place a justice. for good and worse. they dont offer food at Alinea. they offer a once-in-a-lifetime-experience. an experience that will shock your five sense, and will constantly challenge you, as time goes by. one can not simply go there and savor a specific flavor or texture. every dish is a creation, pushing the limits of conventional ingredients to the stratosphere. so, why doesnt it deserve 5 stars? because its not a restaurant (imho). its a circus. and call me old fashion... but when i go to eat, i expect food. yes, Chef Grant Achatz has taken ingredients into a whole new level, perhaps that level is more entertaining to the mind, and less to the taste buds.
