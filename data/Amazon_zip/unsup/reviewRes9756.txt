A great dining experience. Dale has really taken things up a notch in the short time since his initial control of the kitchen. Bear in mind, I didn't ask for any substitutions, order too much food a la carte and act like I was the only person in the dining room. That kind of fussiness should keep some folks home where they can control their own environment. Maybe that's why I enjoyed myself so much. When you go to a place of this caliber, you're better off to take the staff's suggestions of how to eat the chef's food. :) BTW, I highly recommend the wine pairings; their wine director is a wizard.
