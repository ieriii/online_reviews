The good: Super cute interior, and very very friendly waitstaff. The not-so-good: Food is terribly bland and WICKEDLY overpriced. My son ordered the child's pancake. It was ONE pancake the size of a CD and cost $5! That's crazy. And the kicker? The high price was JUST for the pancake - no kid's drink was included like every other restaurant in the city. In this economy, $2.25 for a small glass of milk and $3 for one coffee just doesn't cut it.  There is nothing impressive about the food. I had the home skillet were the eggs where dried out and the potatoes cold and mushy. Very, very small portion. While our waiter was very friendly and pleasant, we had to flag him down on a number of occasions for simple things - jam for our toast, the bill, etc. Minor annoyance. I don't think there are a lot of other brunch places in Bridgeport, so that might bode well for Nana's. However, with SO MANY other awesome brunch places in the city - with a good concentration in the South & West Loop, as well as Little Italy & UIC, it's safe to say we'll never be back.
