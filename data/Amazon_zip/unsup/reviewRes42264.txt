March 31, 2012: Wow! I went here for dinner with 3 girl friends, and we enjoyed every bit of our experience. The ambience is intimate and the service was great. The server and busboys were very attentive. We ordered the bread with garlic and the cornbread special for appetizers. Three of us ordered pasta and one order the chicken, and our dishes were delicious. I had the Pimm's Cup for a cocktail, and after one sip, I was hooked. I complimented my pasta with some Malbec. For dessert, I had coffee (which was brewed French-press style) and the carrot cake, which was big enough to share with 3 other people. I definitely plan to return!
