Most recent visit: 7/17/12 for dinner. Food is a 3.5 really to give them credit but the service is not appropriate to the price they charge and the space is quite loud. Lots of wine and lots of cheese---what they lack in excellence they make up for in sheer variety. To drink we had the Rose flight as it was too hot to contemplate drinking anything room temperature. The first wine on the flight paired well with the lighter fare and the last was the one I chose to order in full glass form--more full bodied and went better with heavier dishes. FOOD: Cherry tomato with watermelon, feta and pesto-This was probably my favorite dish. Its a 5 star item for sure. It was fun, refreshing and yummy.  Ahi tuna carpaccio-I wish there was about 1 more slice of tuna on the plate and that they would spice it up. Hint to Bin 36--create some wasabi with citrus oil/sauce and drizzle it. Stuffed mushrooms-These were salty and tasted okay. I wanted more from them as they didn't blow me away and I am a mushroom fan. The stuffing was a bit dry and crumbly so they fell apart. Roasted corn-The corn was good and the aioli was fantastic.  Peanut butter chocolate mousse-very good. Not crazy about the sorbet pairing--the flavor seemed more of a gimmick than a well thought out contrast. Note: Bin 36 is good for groups and gatherings of no more than 6 people so long as you have patience and a bit of money to spend. It stays in my rotation because I live in Chicago and its usually not as crowded as more trendy places BUT if you don't live here, go somewhere else! Many better restaurants in that area for the same price and a bit more of a wait.
