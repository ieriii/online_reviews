Probably my favorite Chicago food. A liitle more direct than girl/goat, tastier than avec, both of which i really enjoy. Too loud and perhaps acrobatic for older friends/family (tall tables) & too pricey for some. But for me the turkey leg and bean salad put me in 7th heaven w/ great wine assortment. Now I want to go back tonight.
