This place fooled me with the packed crowd and glowing recommendations but I was very disappointed. The free little vegetable pastry they brought to our table didn't look appetizing at all more like cold pizza. The bread was great that they brought to the table with no oil or butter, we had to ask.. isn't this an italian restaurant? I actually had a hard time picking something off the menu so i chose the dusted grouper which was a nightmare, it tasted like it had been just taken out of a freezer bag and deep-fried, it was fried on the outside but still mushy and overly salted??? I don't know why a place charging 19$ for this entree would serve something so horrible and tasteless. My boyfriend had a squid steak with garbanzo beans, which he said he could have made it at home and saved some money. The goat cheese ravioli was the only delicious item that stood out. The lamb shank another friend ordered tasted like pot roast and was a little chewy. I don't think we were even asked if we liked our meal at all, the hostess was great but the server came to our table maybe 3 times. I regret going here but I guess I know now that if you want good seafood in Andersonville you have to go to the Hopleaf.
