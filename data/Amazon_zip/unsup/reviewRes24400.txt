I love fondue. I grew up eating the stuff. In our household it wasn't considered fine dining. It was more like a quick and inexpensive way to feed the whole family when mom didn't feel like cooking a huge dinner. When I found out that Geja's was a fancy fondue spot, I was really excited to see how they might elevate such a simple dish. Sadly, the experience and food just do not justify the price. Before I get into the specifics of my experience, let me preface my review by saying I came here during Restaurant Week. If you've never heard of it, RW is simply a week in February when many Chicago restaurants create special price fixe menus. For $33 or $44 (per person) you can sample signature dishes and try new places you wouldn't normally eat at. First the good news. The fondue is savory. From the cheese appetizer, to the meat-heavy main course, and chocolate dessert, Geja's left nothing to desire. The highlight of the meal were the 8 different sauces, each one better than the last. The other thing I found Geja's did well was to create a romantic atmosphere. The place is seriously dark, and the flickering blue flames of the fondue pots make for an intimate and beautiful setting. But everything came crashing back to reality when we got the bill. The total bill for two was $75 after RW discount. Drinks not included. Yikes! I am all about paying top dollar for a chef to prepare a world class dinner. But... this was just sliced up raw meat and veggies on a plate. Mom was right, fondue is not that fancy.
