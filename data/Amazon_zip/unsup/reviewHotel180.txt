I am a fan of the Hilton chain of hotels and this one proves no different. The rooms are large, it's an all suite hotel, and as a single traveller I had plenty of room for myself. It was really nice to be able to spread out. The bed is soft and the sheets are comfortable. The heating worked and I had a great view of the lake. The people who work there were helpful and knowledgeable about the local area and how to get around. I felt safe in the neighborhood and walking around at all hours. It is close to places to eat and shopping. It's off the beaten path so you don't hear traffic or the noise of the street. The heated pool and the hot tub were a much enjoyed added bonus. I felt spoiled as I sat in the hot bubbles and watched a blizzard fall outside. This is a great hotel and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It is good for families, singles, couples (although it's not overtly romantic) and business travelers. There is a charge for internet (which I don't ever agree with in hotels) and they have room service, but no breakfast. There are better places to stay in Chicago, but this is a good choice if you're given it. Enjoy!
