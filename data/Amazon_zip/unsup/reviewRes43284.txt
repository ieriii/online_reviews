A friend had recommended this place for breakfast and had to check it out. Real cute place with chalkboard signage and a nice outdoor seating area. It can get really packed and hard to find a seat at certain hours of the day but the line moves rather quickly for people just grabbing something to go. No waiter service, just order at the counter and take a seat and someone will bring it out to you. Don't expect much of a selection to choose from on breakfast items. They usually have a pancake special, a breakfast special and the usual bagels, granola and panini breakfast sandwich. Don't get me wrong they are all good! I got the special pancake of the day which was a coconut mango pancake. It was good, but a bit too nutty for me. I should have gotten the breakfast burrito since it looked really good when it came out of the kitchen. The granola is homemade and its awesome and you can buy some to go. Oh, they don't serve potatoes...your meal will come with potato chips instead. One thing I did not like was the scrambled eggs. They had a weird texture and you can tell it came from a carton.  Best thing...the coffee!!! Had a naturally sweet flavor to it and what's nice is that you can buy the coffee to take home with you. I wish they had whole beans though since I only use a french press.  Great local neighborhood stop!
