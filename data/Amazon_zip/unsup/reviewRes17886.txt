Frankly, The Bad Apple warrants about 4.25 stars, given a few misses on the left side of the menu [the cheese plate is lacking; but then, what should one expect in a cheese plate at a burger bar?; but then--again--why have a cheese plate if it's not going to be a very good cheese plate?]. However, given the tendency of many inordinately negative reviewers to reflexively deliver one-star ratings, I am happy to do my part in bringing the average rating up to a more accurate level. All that said--I think the burger and beer lists are the best for miles around.
