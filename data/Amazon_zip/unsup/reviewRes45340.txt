I recently moved to the area and really needed a good local pub. Unfortunately, Wilde is not the place. The beer selection is average (good for novices, but a beer novice I am not) and the food is nothing special. The veggie burger isn't bad, but I feel the toppings are the only thing making it edible. My S.O. has had the burger and won't be having it again. That says a lot considering he devours burgers regularly when going out. I've been here twice and probably won't be back unless desperate.
