For being a very old hotel--this place looks great and they did a fantastic job remodeling. For being as expensive as the room was, my boyfriend and I were displeased with some things, but were generally happy with what we got. Pros: -BIG TV, and I don't know what the person below me is talking about cause there was definitely free TV. -BIG comfy bed -Decent sized room, the bathroom was tiny, but the room was very well laid out -Quick check in -Great location on Michigan Ave. -Bath and Body Works shampoo and conditioner -Nice shower Cons: -You get charged if you use the fridge (I am noticing this a lot in Chicago hotels, starting to tick me off) -View was the fire escape -NO COFFEE MAKER! -Lights had to be manually turned on, no switch -No continental breakfast -Tiny bathroom All and all, not a terrible place by any means. The room is very swanky and the price wasn't terrible, but we would've at least liked free coffee in our room and the ability to use our fridge without a price attached. I had a wonderful dinner at Tavern that I couldn't bring home cause I wasn't about to pay $25 to use a fridge.
