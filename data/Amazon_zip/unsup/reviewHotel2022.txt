This is a fabulous hotel! I had friends that stayed here over the weekend, and it was perfect! (I didn't stay here, but I did visit them, saw their room, wandered around the hotel, and used the concierge service with them). I think the hotel is in a great location. It's easy to get anywhere downtown, in river north, or off the brown line. This place has amazing views! The views from the rooms are stunning, the views from the bar are incredible, the views from random areas in the lobby are outstanding. Really, the view is that great. The room was nice. I think what makes this place amazing is the staff. I got a flat on my bike on the way to visiting them. Since there are no gas stations particularly close, I thought I would see if the hotel's garage had an air compressor/some type of pump. We asked the concierge. The concierge called the engineer, but didn't get a response, so he called the nearby Ace Hardware and quoted me 2 pumps. We didn't get to Ace until they had closed. So when we returned from dinner we asked the concierge to ask the engineer again. He called the engineer down to meet with us. The engineer was able to blow up the tire. The staff were so friendly and so helpful!  My friends had a great time, and plan to stay here again anytime they need a hotel in the city in the future! Oh, parking is $40 per night, while that's a lot, it's not crazy for the area.
