You had me at lobster corndog. Then, I checked out your establishment. Graham has made fine dining fun and cool. From the inventive drinks and food (his use of corn nuts and Cheez-its in gourmet dining is commendable) to the nostalgic (for me) 90's punk rock (I mean, what restaurant do you hear Jawbreaker played during dinner?!) Loved it.
