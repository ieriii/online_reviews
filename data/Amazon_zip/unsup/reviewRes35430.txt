Came here on a Saturday night without reservations since hubby had a craving for oysters (we had just watched a Mad Men episode where they were downing oysters and martinis). We sat at the oyster bar (no reservations on a Saturday night in Chicago = take whatever you can get). Having our meal at the bar wasn't a bad experience at all; the food and drinks came quickly! Although we were surprised that there was a child sitting at the bar with his parents (um...) We had: 1. Bloody Mary's: Perfect amount of alcohol to spicy tomato content. At other places, the ratio is usually wrong. Also it came with 2 olives, a pickle, and a cocktail shrimp. Hands down, the best I've had outside of New Orleans. For $11 per drink, it was well worth it. 2. Dozen oyster sampler: Very good, tasted fresh. Satisfied hubby's craving. However the cost sucked ($24/dozen) compared to New Orleans ($12/dozen). 3. Oyster Rockefeller: Okay, too much spinach and not enough cheese. Also only 4 oysters came out, for the cost we expected at least 6! 4. Lounge Sampler: 3 shrimps, 3 scallops, 1 crab cake on a bed of rice and spinach. The scallops were perfectly cooked and sweet. The shrimp had the shell on it still, which I didn't cared for. The crab cake was good, but the ones I had in Baltimore were better. The rice was dry and the spinach was standard. The platter was not worth $30 for what we got. 4. Raspberry pie a la mode: yummy!!! Perfect tartness to sweet vanilla ice cream ratio. All in all, a good experience. Service was good for the bar. Would come back for Bloody Mary's, oysters, and dessert. Don't know if the cost of the entrees are worth it. Had other entrees at Shaw's in the past and it has not impressed thus far.
