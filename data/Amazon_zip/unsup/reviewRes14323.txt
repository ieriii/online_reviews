I really wanted to love this place because I have a friend who rants and raves...but not so much.  Ordered soup...got through 2 slow rounds of drinks before we had to ask about it. Our waiter then was like "oh, sorry. Yeah about the soup. We are out of the soup of the day and I was meaning to ask you if roasted red pepper and tomato soup is ok" Yeah sure, fine. I'm starving, bring me whatever! Soup took another 15 minutes to get to the table. It was delicious, but that was the highlight of the meal.  It took another 45 minutes AFTER the delayed soup to get our fish. The server actually came out to tell us that our food was on the line under the heaters waiting for a runner and he was sorry it was taking so long. If you have the time to see the food and come outside and tell us it was ready then why wouldn't you just bring it out??? It took another 10 minutes for them to bring it out. Mine was very fishy, my boyfriends was very dry, his mom's fish had NO flavor at all, and his dad ordered chicken and ate about 1/3 of it. It was served with a side of mac and cheese that he took one bite out of. It was just horrible and the server knew it was bad. He never asked us how our food was, and if we hadn't waited over an hour and half for the food we would have sent every dish back. We were starving and none of us finished our plate, and we are all big clean plate people!  I would have given them 2 more stars had they discounted the bill. But $200 for a knowingly shitty meal...not ok in my book. I will NOT be back for dinner. Sorry guys!
