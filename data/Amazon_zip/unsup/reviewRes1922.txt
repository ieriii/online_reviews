One of my favorite places to eat.... EVER. Ok, so maybe I just love hot dogs, but this is seriously one of my favs. I take as many out of town guests to this place to truly experience the Chicago dog plus amazing surprising hot dogs. My favorite is the Rib Eye sausage. We were lucky to try the fois gras topped dog before the ridiculous Chicago ban. Duck fat fries really are worth it. I've had them side by side with regular fries, the duck fat ones win hands down Go on a week day if you don't want to wait... or go on those random holidays like Presiden't Day. I love Hot Doug's. Just thinking about it makes me drool.
