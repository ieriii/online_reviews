My experience at Bin 36 can only be described as divine. Their House Smoked Salmon was rich and decadent and their recommended pairing of Bin 2 - NV Vouvray, Demi-sec, Vigneau-Chevreau, "Petillant," - was perfect, the bubbles beautifully cleansed my palate and the crisp juicy flavor was a wonderful counterpoint. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and, best of all, passionate. I noticed their cheese-monger restocking the cheese chill chest and struck up a conversation. In no time he had brought out a cheese plate with his favorites for me to sample, on the house. Log off the computer and go!
