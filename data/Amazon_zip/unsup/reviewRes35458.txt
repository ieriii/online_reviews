Shaw's has very good food and service, but not quite good enough to justify the price. The crab is great, the family-style course menu is a lot of fun, and the wine list has very good selections, but I think the menu is tilted toward too-large portions for too much money. There are places with better, more creative food for the price in Chicago. At the same time, the menu includes a lot of classics, so if you are looking for something without a lot of risk, maybe for a first date, Shaw's could be a good pick. The same goes for dinner with a group, where you don't know how many picky eaters might be with you.
