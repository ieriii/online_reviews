Went here for lunch today around 2pm. Even then it was about a 20-30 minute wait for a table so we ended up just getting take-out. The place is small but cute and smells delicious. We ended up getting 2 different sandwiches and splitting them - Chicken Tinga and Jamon. They were both great but I REALLY enjoyed the Jamon. I could probably have another one right now. The meat was just so tasty and soft. Definitely a great place to check out and worth the wait and price. I know I'll definitely be back. Everything on their menu looks great!
