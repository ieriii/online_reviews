I like brew pubs. I mean, really. As a single mom I like them even more when I can cruise in with my daughter in tow and nobody bats an eye--believe me, it happens. This was *so* the case with Revolution Brewing. Not only did I come in with my daughter, but I supped with a friend and her three children. Yup. Four kids, a booth right next to the pizza oven, and a number of vegetarian options left me with all sorts of warm fuzzy feelings. Ok, perhaps some of that warm fuzziness was due to a very tasty cider--yeah, drinking with kids in tow, don't judge--or our mega adorable and tattooed waiter (I'm a sucker for boys with ink). Still, the sweet potato cakes were a huge hit with my daughter and I and the smoked and grilled tofu was a whole lotta yum. My daughter assured me that her sausage pizza was tasty which is high praise from the rather picky nine-year-old set, but not as good as Piece or Louisa's...but, really, what is?  Overall, our visit to Revolution Brewing was pretty awesome. No wait--the advantages of going on a Sunday afternoon--and the guy baking the pizzas was super sweet and very nice about answering all my daughter's questions about the baking process and whether or not the almost 500 degree oven was hot enough to melt his bones. I'd go again in a heartbeat though I would probably try it without the kidlets so that I may partake in sampling more than one beer.
