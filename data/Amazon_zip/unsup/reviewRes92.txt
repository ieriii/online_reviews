Going to try to keep this short. Alinea is an experience with food like I've never had before. Every course was magical...each one escalating into taste bud ecstasy all the way until the finale. Everything was so artfully done; beautiful to see and taste. I have never seen or tasted anything like the food here. Not only were there delicious foods to be eaten, but curious scents and lovely wines to be had. (we did the wine pairing with the food, and I'm glad we did!) I loved the lengthy meal, conversation and atmosphere. I didn't want my 4 hour eating extravaganza to end. My taste buds and belly were left in awe, not wanting to try another food again. Some food highlights: Everything was so festive for fall! -Pheasant + apples + fried dough + cinnamon--a bite of heaven I wish I had more of -Venison and cabbage burrito -Black truffle explosion -Hot potato Cold potato -Chocolate pinata...and epic dessert served to us by the man himself! The service was also a big part of the evening. Everything was choreographed perfectly. Dinner had an excellent rhythm. Each server brought their own personality to the table, and it was fun to hear their explanations of the food and wine. They kept the service playful--nothing was taken too seriously. Made the whole situation of dining at an expensive restaurant more comfortable. One of our earlier food courses that involved driftwood and shellfish was messed up 2 times (dropped a piece on our table) and they had to redo the presentation for us to make it perfect. I thought this was silly, but they insisted. Third time was a charm! Anyway, I wish I could afford to come back here again during a different season. I hope to be back in my lifetime! I recommend this place to anyone who loves food, art, long meals (3+ hours), and a truly awesome night.
