This hotel definitely isn't family friendly. If you're in the bedroom, you can look right into the shower (glass window from the ceiling to the ground). Why they have this setup I'll never know. The remote control didn't work, and after saying something to the front desk, they said it's a problem with the TV. The phones didn't work either (the cordless phone was a PITA). The breakfast restaurant downstairs is a complete joke - don't go here hungry because you'll leave the same way. I'd suggest finding another hotel to be honest.
