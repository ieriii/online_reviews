HIGHLIGHT OF THE NITE: FIRST EVER 5 STAR RATING. mm mm how a sausage should taste like and then some. being so far far far in LA how i miss the delicious gourment sausages that NO WHERE have i found that compares. first off. the sausage. ain't no plain jane all beef vienna sausages that be there specialty (yet they do have them and are good) but it's all about the specialty sausages. i always tend to get one of their game of the week. we tried the duck sasuage, buffalo and some jamican jerk sausage. now some places use these as gimicky tricks and then you take a bite and are like oh laa laa but than realize it don't taste any different. but hot doug's does it right pairing the meat with cheeses and sauces that make each sausage very distinctive. also a must is the fries (have tried the duck fat fries before but quite honestly you can't really tell the difference) with cheese and ghardinera and it is awesome. decore is kinda divey hot dog joint and very casual. be warned the line gets quick long during peak lunch hour times but trust me it's worth it!! LA hotdogs just don't compare..my tummy is growling jus thinking about these delicious bites.
