Architecture defines the "boutique hotel" experience. Staff extremely friendly and accomodating. I left some items in my room, and hotel staff went out of their way to find these items and ship them to me. All the while, they kept me updated by phone. In-hotel dining (Atwood) is of quality. The room itself was beautiful, corner windows overlooking the busy Chicago streetscape. This would make a great place for a couples getaway. I would stay here again and recommend the hotel highly.
