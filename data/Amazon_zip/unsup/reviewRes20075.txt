I once gave this place 5 stars. After having now been 4 times, I had to seriously downgrade my review. It's only gone downhill. I went over the weekend and the place seemed dirty, the service was slow and atrocious, and the sushi was just not good. The fish special that the waitress urged us to get was not fresh at all. The only good thing we had was the Gyoza, but, being fried, that's hard to screw up. The rolls were like bricks. Also...the bathroom situation is ridiculous: one toilet for each gender making it necessary for the men and women to line up AMONGST the tables of seated (eating) guests. Just not good. My 4th time here was my last time here. Bummed.
