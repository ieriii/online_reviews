average. They don't offer as many options as another place we've gone (i.e. they only give you hot oil, whereas the other place gave you a choice between oil and broth and offered seasonings.). The food was average and very expensive. The sauces were pretty good.. nothing spectacular. The place itself is very dark.. great for a date night. I would come again, but not without a groupon or http://restaurant.com giftcard. I liked my time here, but I preferred another known fondue place much more
