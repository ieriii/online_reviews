Sometimes vegetarian food can move mountains with its flavor and taste, other times it can be the villain in a culinary nightmare. The Chicago Diner falls in to the former and not the later. When I visited Chicago over Memorial day weekend this place was on my list of things to experience in the windy city. I had read wonderful things about this place in VegNews and was not disappointed. Every element of my dining experience was above par from the the decor to the selection and creativity of the menu selection everything was delightful. The service was also attentive and quick. I ordered the crab cake appetizers and the biscuits and gravy scramble with eggs (wasn't feeling tofu at the point of the of the day). The crab cake were warm, moist and flavorful and did remind me of the real crab cakes that my Mom use to make. The portion was just enough and I was almost finished them, when my biscuit and gravy arrived. I love biscuits and gravy and am a fan of every and all of its reincarnations, the biscuits and gravy I got here were excellent. The best vegetarian biscuit and gravy I have ever tried. The gravy was not to thick or grainy, also, the biscuits themselves were wonderful, light and wholesome. My only fault with this place is that their ice coffee is terrible, but I live in Seattle and am a complete coffee snob. I hope to be back soon.
