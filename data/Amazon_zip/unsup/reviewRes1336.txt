Next time I decide to write a business plan, I'm going to kidnap "Doug" and gank every idea from his genious brain. Honestly, I really don't get it. Granted, this place is good-but, not THAT good to stand out in the snow and ice for 90 minutes. Yesterday, I just happened to be driving on California, and noticed for the first time, that there was no line outside. Oh wait, did I see a parking spot right outside the front door? Oh, yes indeed! Now, I should say upfront that I am no fan of Chicago dogs. Actually, I think they suck. But, I do like brats, and opted for the "Dave Kingman." Now, this was a really good brat-but, once again, it wasn't orgasm in my pants amazing. Very friendly, and quick service. Tasty brat, fries, and reasonable prices. I would return-but, I sure as hell won't wait more than 10 minutes. *Budakis on Damen is just as good, sans long lines.
