So during the summer when the bf was actually in Chicago, we had this Taco Tuesday tradition. We ate Mexican food every Tuesday! Anyway, week 3 was XOCO. The line was way too long for my liking. I really don't have any patience, but he insisted that we wait. After waiting forever (actually about 30-45 minutes), we got guac and chips, a XOCO salad, the Carnitas torta, and the agua fresca del dia (it was quite tasty, but I don't remember exactly what was all in it!). I ended up liking the torta a lot. I thought I wasn't hungry at all that night but actually ended up wishing that we had ordered 2 tortas instead of sharing one. The guacamole and chips were a bit too salty for my liking, but I don't like salty food in general (see my other reviews). The salad was good, but the torta was definitely the star of this meal. I don't know if it's worth waiting in line for again. Hopefully it gets less popular, or maybe I will order to-go from now on!
