I loved this place! The art is quirky. I had the New Orleans crab cakes with black beans, Cole slaw and corn bread. Loved it! Very good food. My husband had the fresh salmon patties and it was excellent. I really loved everything I ate there but I must say the Cole is one of the best I've ever tasted - really good! I'd def go back here to try something different.
