It was party central on Friday and Saturday nights but Sunday night was (apparently) back to the norm of reasonably calm and quiet. The owner changed my friend's room when told of the super noisy air conditioner. The room was clean and neat, pleasant because the "no smoking" ban was for real. Average-adequate furnishings include TV but no frills. Good for out of town guests looking for a nearby place to stay. Main drawback is parking space; on a full-house night it's doubled up parking with just enough space to turn around at the far end. The Continental breakfast is typical for this genre motel - cold cereal, instant oatmeal, doughnuts and coffee. Reasonable price.
