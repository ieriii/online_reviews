You know, I heard such great things about this place that I actually waited the hour and half to get seated. What a disappointment. The service was horrendous, the restrooms were disgusting, and worst of all the food was mediocre. This would have been passable if the price was cheap, but this Rick charged us literally double what the dishes were worth. Also the portions were small with hardly any sides or veggies. Take my advice and go to fuego instead.
