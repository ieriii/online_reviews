We went for "Dine out for Life" an HIV/AIDS fund raising dinner. The Food was excellent and the table was ready in a more than a reasonable amount of time from the stated reservation. The food was excellent and prepared just right!! The grilled octopus was excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone trying the restaurant. The waiter could have checked on us maybe a couple more times and the person bringing out the entrees misplaced the dishes.....pretty minor in my book, but I can't give it 5 stars. I look forward to trying it again.....Highly recommended!!!
