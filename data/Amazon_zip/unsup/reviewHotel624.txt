One Liner for those needing a fast read: Good choice if you get a GREAT price (under $100). Excellent location and great service at the front desk. They even let us check in early (11am)! However, the rooms were not the cleanest that they could have been. For example, we dropped something under the bed and were surprised to find all kinds of trash and "remnants" from other guests. Yuck. Additionally, we got the ONE room on the 5th floor that is by the ice machine...not good. Very loud all night...not just people filling their buckets, but also water running in a pipe to fill it. It should be noted that the pool is OUTDOORS, so to use it in March wasn't possible. The description should make this distinction. There is an indoor pool to use for a $15 fee per person. Overall though, for the Hotwire price of $77 ($88 with tax), this was a good stay and the location was right. Note that overnight parking is $41 with in and out privileges.
