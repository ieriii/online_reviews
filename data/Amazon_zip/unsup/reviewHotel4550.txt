Oldest hotel in North America. Truly Chicago's Landmark! Handpainted ceiling in the lobby by French Artist, all the bronze and crystals bring the charm of 19th Century. Rooms are clean, comfortable and cozy. The bedding is the top notch, flat screen TVs in every room and the best Bloody Marys served at the lobby bar.
