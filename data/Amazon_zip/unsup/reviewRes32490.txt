Sunda is a great place to go when you're looking for a trendy spot to grab drinks with girlfriends and get some not-too-heavy fare for dinner. The restaurant is gorgeous and is usually packed - very scene-y. The menu is a mix of various Asian cuisines ranging from Phillipino to sushi.  This food is all very good... I'm giving it 4 stars because I'm not sure I've ever had anything here that has blown me away. I usually show up and can't remember what I ordered the time before, just a vague sense that "it was good." It's also fairly pricey for what it is - the entrees are pretty small for family-style sharing, which is what I've usually gone for.  But all in all, I like this place and keep coming back... but a lot of that has to do with my sick obsession with things like sushi and shishito peppers, which Sunda does very well. I also LOVE any place that offers mochi in 5 yummy flavors for dessert!
