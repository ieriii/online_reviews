What a rip off! I took my wife there for a nice meal and here is what we had: we split the calamari which was very good, I had the lobster bisque which was nothing more than tangy tomato soup with no hint of lobster, the seafood sampler that came with a good (small) crab cake, scallops that were bland, and 3 grilled shrimp that were so over cooked they tasted like leather. My wife had a shrimp cocktail, hard to screw up, and the crab cake appetizer for $15!!! For a single crab cake! Then we split the moosetracks ice cream which was soooo frozen that we had to use a knife to cut through it. With 2 drinks each it came to $120. I wouldn't have paid $40 for that meal. Next time I'm going back to Bone Fish.
