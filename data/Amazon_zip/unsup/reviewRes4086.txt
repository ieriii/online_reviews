YUM. We did the large tasting menu and everything was creative and delicious. I did become rather full about halfway through, so I would recommend going on a VERY empty stomach and pacing yourself somewhat. The environment is chill, but still nice. All of the employees are laid back and tons of fun. I love that we can BYOB and bring our favorite bottle(s) of wine. As for reservations, we actually haven't had that hard of a time. We left a message in the end of March for April reservations and were contacted within a couple of weeks. Recently, we called for September reservations and someone actually answered! We have decided that we'll go once a season. It's that good.
