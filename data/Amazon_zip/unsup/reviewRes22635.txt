3.5, actually. The food was a 5, but unfortunately the service was a 3 at best. My boyfriend and I visited Irazu at about 8:00pm on a Wednesday night and it was crowded. The only place available to sit was inside, which was actually ok since it was about 88 degrees outside. Here's what was great: I ordered the skirt steak with scallions and my boyfriend ordered the tilapia. The steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection, the fried plantains were perfectly browned, and the coleslaw made a nice tangy addition to the dish. I did not try the tilapia, but my bf enjoyed it very much. Here's what was not so great: As soon as we sat down, a busser asked us if we would like guacamole with some chips. We had not even looked at the menu yet, and we thought it was complementary (like how you get free chips and salsa at some restaurants). Of course it wasn't, and it felt a little like we had been tricked into paying for something we might otherwise not have. Of course, it's a good thing we did order it because we also waited for over an hour for our food, and so did several other tables. Our water was not refilled once and the only time we saw our server was when he took our order. Overall, it's worth going for the food, but be prepared to sit for a while...maybe bring a book.
