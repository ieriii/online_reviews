My bff and I came here once and had a good time. My neighborhood has vomited all over the place with BYOB sushi places, which isnt a bad thing. We order anything that has the word "tempura" or "mayo" in it and we havent had any problems. Why? Because you could deep fry my dirty fingernail clippings and serve it with a dipping sauce and Im sure it would be delish. (that was pretty sick actually). With the byob the even put the bottles on ice for you and if you have extras (which we always do, are you kidding me? one bottle for two people, we arent amatuers here) they put it in back somewhere, Im assuming to keep cold for you. I love the gummy candies they serve at the end of the meal too. The interior is very zen like too. I think there was a pond in there with koi fish, but I usually see things after drinking three bottles of wine. Lovely.
