If you are going to attempt to try this restaurant for lunch or dinner, I would suggest arriving about 45 minutes prior to their opening time to get in line. This will put you at about the halfway point in the line that will have formed outside the door. As for the food, the ceviche is to die for! However, the rest of the food was good, but not great as I expected. My boyfriend had the duck tacos and greatly enjoyed them and my toquitos were decent. The smokey taste in the toquitos was so intense that I didn't enjoy them as much as I thought I would. The salsa is fantastic and so is the mexican water drink that is made each day. I would highly recommend trying that. This is a good restaurant,but for the price, I wouldn't highly recommend it. There are equally good mexican restaurants in Chicago for a fraction of the price. The waitstaff was very well versed with the products on the menu, however the noise level was pretty high and felt very crowded. I will not be going again.
