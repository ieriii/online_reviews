favorite restaurant in chicago! Such a nice place, great service. So good that we went twice in a week! hard to go wrong with anything, but our favorites include: pork ears and crispy kale cauliflower spearmint, spring peas and bacon good, but overshadowed by the above fava beans, hardboiled eggs pork shoulder octopus
