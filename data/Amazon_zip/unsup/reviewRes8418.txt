Not sure why I continue to write reviews since I somehow landed myself on the "filtered" list ... by anyhow - This place was a HUGE disappointment. Our server treated us like we had the plague - maybe because we have two kids or maybe because she is a huge B. To begin we were not offered drinks. Nope, she must have assumed that we were water people and would not waste her time asking. We started with the antipasto misto and that was a mistake. What a sad, sad plate of food. I love three things in life (okay more, but for this post let's say three): CHEESE, OLIVES and MEAT. Fail. The presentation did not even look nice. The pizza: was okay. I gave an extra star for the decent Salsiccia. Even though when I ordered it and had trouble pronouncing it the server looked at me like a moron and did not help me. The other pizza that we had, and the name escapes me, was not good at all. For my husband and I not to finish something (especially pizza) it had to of been bad.  I really thought I was going to love Spacca but with such rude/terrible service I will not be back. *Busboy was very attentive and nice.
