First time at Revolution was so good! We ordered the pretzel and the pork tenderloin skewers (special) for appetizers and they were both amazing! For entrees, I got the bacon cheddar burger and my wife had the beef stew. I thought the beef stew sounded good, but I didn't get it because who's ever heard of a $16 beef stew? Well, there is so much tender beef in it that it is worth the price. However, we both would have preferred that it had more broth like a stew. To give you a sense of how unlike a stew it was, it was served side by side in the same bowl as the garlic mashed potatoes (which are great). Wonderful flavor, I just wish there was more juice/broth to go around. Now let me tell you about the burger - Oh man, what a burger! This $11 bacon cheese burger might be the biggest single-patty burger I've ever seen! I ordered it medium, as I always do, and it was cooked perfectly. If I had a dollar for every overcooked burger I've had at other places, I could probably buy a flight to Vegas. But they know how to cook a burger! The menu doesn't brag about how big the burgers are, but it must have been 3/4 lbs. And the caramelized onions that came on it are ridiculous. I went with the Eugene Porter and it was so good that I had to get a refill. Service was good. A couple other things: They don't take reservations and they won't seat you until your whole party is there. We got there at 6:45 on a Friday and got one of the last tables available. By 7:30 there were people standing around everywhere waiting for a table. By the way, I liked Haymarket until I tried to Revolution. There is no comparison.
