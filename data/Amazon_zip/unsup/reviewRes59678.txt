Hostess: TERRIBLE. Advice: If you don't enjoy your job get another one.Seating was awful. Had to request reseating since we did not want to sit in the bathroom.Wait staff was good.Enjoyed the food.If you want to have a good time with friends do not go here. There are so many other restaurants that want your business and will be sure you have a nice evening. Not this place.I repeat.....the hostess is terrible.
