Although I am not a huge fan of southern food, I really enjoyed Big Jones! Went there on the weekend for brunch and was very pleasantly surprised at all the options on the menu. I had a hard time deciding between the shrimp and grits or the cheddar corn cakes. Actually, there were a few other things on there I wanted to try, as well! I finally decided on the corn cakes with a side of okra. (Talk about a heavy meal!) The corn cake dish was HUGE and was good. Next time I would probably split it with someone. The fried okra came with a yummy sauce and was lightly breaded and fried. Very delicious! The atmosphere and decor was really nothing that impressive but nothing to complain about. Our server was just okay, though. She was a little flighty and wasn't the best with our table, but nothing horrible. I definitely do want to go back and try the dinner. Maybe Big Jones can change my views on Southern Food!
