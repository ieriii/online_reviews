Was super excited to stop in for lunch and not have to wait for a table. The guacamole was amazing!!!! So yummy! I had the enchiladas de mole poblano based upon the server's recommendatino. I'm ususally not a huge fan of mole sauce, but this was delicious! Also had the gold margarita which was perfection. Only downside to this visit was that I didn't get a chance to see Rick Bayless. Will definitely be back again!
