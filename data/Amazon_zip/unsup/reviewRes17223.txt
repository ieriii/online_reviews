This is simply the best Indian Buffet downtown. Close enough to the loop that you can jump in a cab and be there in 5 minutes, have lunch and back to the office within 1 hour. The dishes selection are good for both carnivores and vegetarians. I didn't try the a la carte menu though. Why did i only give 4 starts?! Because if i go there during the week, trying to get back to work without a siesta first is not possible!!!
