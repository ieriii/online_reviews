Phenomenal!!! This is the best Hotel I've ever stayed in. I went from the curb to my room (on the 18th floor) in a matter of minutes! The valet service is amazing. We left a pair of shoes in the car and they were brought to the room in less than 5 minutes. We needed to put stuff in the car and it was brought around very fast. I didn't need help, but the hotel staff seemed very friendly. Awesome decor...makes you feel a little better about yourself haha...that sounds weird.
