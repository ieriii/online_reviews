Very good Korean BBQ. Service is a bit iffy ("ready? ready? ready?"), but I also think you can chalk a good amount of that up to cultural and language differences. Marinated beef is excellent, and if you're a rookie the waitress will help things along on the grill. One of the few places in the city to use actual charcoals in their grills, as opposed to the gas at most Korean BBQ joints. I'd just like to go with a Korean friend or three to help decipher the 20+ condiments that come along with the family-style meal. Good, loud atmosphere. Easily accommodates big groups, and prices on par with similar places in the city. I'll be back.
