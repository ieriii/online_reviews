Decent brunch place, interesting interior design, a little crowded, but large enough to accommodate quickly. The bloody mary is a great choice for those waiting to be seated with a hangover. Unfortunately, after we were seated, it seemed like the whole experience was put in slow motion from drinks- ordering-to finally getting our meal (which seemed to be about 40 minutes later). This was a rough experience for some of us who were hungry & hungover. The food was decent, but I'm pretty sure that something out of the garbage can would've tasted amazing to me with as long as we had waited for the food. They could have at least thrown some bread or biscuits our way as we waited. Anyhow, I'm pretty sure they discounted our bill, which kind of makes up for it, and I have heard that service is usually better, so you should probably go see for yourself.
