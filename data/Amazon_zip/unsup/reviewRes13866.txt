I love Glenn's. Had my birthday dinner there and have always considered Glenn's a simple, easy choice for any meal and time. It's located just below the new Montrose Brown Line stop, but you never notice. They have a nice, wide outdoor eating area on Montrose. They have a huge selection of fresh fish every day (specials before 6pm). The steamed muscles are amazing. The french bread side will make you ache for more. Try dipping it in the muscle juice. (That sounds perverted, sorry)   I don't have a favorite dish, but we do show up quite a bit for the all-you-can-eat nights for BBQ ribs and jumbo alaskan crab legs. (Not the same night) The shrimp are HUGE! Like mini lobsters. I think their $10/each though. I'd have to say the only fish I haven't liked was the sturgeon. But who the hell eats sturgeon?!!! Not me, anymore.   As Glenn's is a diner, they serve breakfast any time. They also have a huge selection of cereal for your retro-pleasure. The artwork looks to be local artists, but doesn't change much. Its gets the high marks from me because the staff is great. The kitchen help are all culinary students. The wait staff are regulars, like us and always treat us well. Waiting for tables on weekends can be a crap shoot. Don't complain, just get there earlier. And, it's BYOB. Check them out. You'll enjoy your stay and your food, I promise. See you there.
