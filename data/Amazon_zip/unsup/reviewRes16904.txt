My first experience at India House was somewhat rigid in that it was Valentine's Day and they had a small selection of fixed 5-course menu selections. A few of the items on this menu were not items I would have normally ordered. If I could do it over I would have asked for a regular menu. Anyways... Here's a glimpse at my experience: FOOD Each came with a cup of soup, salad, a veg or non-veg samosa and a couple of entrees. I went with three people, so we ordered a Curry prix fixe for 2 and Tandoori prix fixe for 1. The soups were decent, samosas standard. I wasn't real big on the condiment tray they brought out, each selection didn't have the explosion of flavor I've come to expect from Indian cuisine. This turned out to be the theme of the night. Our entrees included a sizzling hot tandoori chicken, lamb curry, masala chicken, lentil dish, a palak paneer (fresh cheese in spinach sauce) and rice. Wish I could remember the names of half what I ate for reference purposes/ While the Masala and the lentils were good, the rest was remarkably lacking in spice and taste. Not that any of it was bad, I just expected more from an Indian restaurant that came so highly recommended. Considering its pricier than the average Indian fare, this isn't so easily forgivable. Portions were pretty standard. SERVICE This also lacked a bit for us. Complimentary naan is supposed to be served with a tomato sauce (which tasted almost exactly like the masala sauce incidentally) preceding any food you ordered. We saw it at every other table. Ours did not come until we were finished with the salad and soup. The server also forgot a tea we ordered. None of this is really a big deal but it didn't help their case. CONCLUSION Little mom and pop's serve better food at a cheaper price. What else do you need to know?
