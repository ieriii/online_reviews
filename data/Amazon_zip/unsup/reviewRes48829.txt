What's not to love about The Publican? My family and I have been going here AT LEAST 4-5 times per year ever since they opened a few years ago. The food here is absolutely incredible. You honestly can't go wrong with anything you order here. Sweetbreads and pork belly are the two things we ALWAYS order, regardless of the preparation. The last several times I've been here, they didn't serve the crispy pork rinds in the way they originally did (the prep with the cheddar powder), which is kind of a downer, but it's ok. The brunch here is fantastic as well and very affordable given the portion sizes and quality. The prices for dinner have definitely gone up by a few dollars over the last year or so, so it's not as much of a good value as it used to be, but the food is still worth the prices. Service wasn't 100% perfect a couple of times I've been here, but for the most part, service is great. Kimberly, the manager, knows my family by face and name only because we've been there so many times. She ALWAYS thanks us for coming again and again.  I cannot rave enough about the food at The Publican. The food is creative while still having a strong element of homeyness. We'll always be coming back for more.
