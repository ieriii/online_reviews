This place is terrible for large party dinners, especially on the weekend. It can take hours, if you actually get a seat, and reservations are basically worthless. There - I got the bad part out of the way.  Come to drink, not to eat. This place gets too packed on Friday/Saturday night, but otherwise it's a good north side option for fantastic beer (especially their European selection).  The atmosphere downstairs is small and cramped, but it's fine because the customers are a great mix of ages and generally friendly and talkative (and not the hitting-on-you type of talkative). Upstairs is a little more chill and roomy, but there is a trade off as they don't have as large of a beer selection.
