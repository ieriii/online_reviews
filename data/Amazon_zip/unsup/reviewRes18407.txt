This small BYO Italian spot is ok. The pastas tend to be a bit heavy and overloaded with sauce and cheese. However, the appetizers are great! They serve a traditional Italian soup that I cannot remember the name of but it has noodles and eggs in it and it is out of this world!!! If you in the area and are looking for some basic Italian food and aren't too fussy, perhaps this is the place for you.
