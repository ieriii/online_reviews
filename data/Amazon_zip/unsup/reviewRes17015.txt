Went here on a date with my boo and found the experience very disappointing. On entering I definitely liked the whole vibe of the place. Plenty of beautiful people, nice salsa music, all made me very optimistic. We had a 9pm reservation and ended up getting seated around 930. To make it worse there was no place to sit while we waited. If you're going to not really honor reservations, be smart enough to keep some bar tables open for people who made reservations. The drinks were all very good, no complaints there. The food was forgettable, nothing special. There are definitely better places to go for Latin food.
