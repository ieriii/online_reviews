Truly the most amazing experience I have ever had at a restaurant. It was also one of the most expensive meals I have ever had, but well worth it.The combination of ingredients used in the many dishes are unique and creative and often sound like they would not fit together, but are complete taste sensations. The various wares they use to serve the courses are mini works of art and not like anything I have ever seen.As long as you are willing to spend the money don't skimp by not doing the wine pairings. It does add to the already exorbitant price of the meal, but the wine pairings truly compliment each dish. I have been to many fine French restaurants, but none of the wines in those restaurants complimented the dishes as well as what I experienced at Alinea.This is an experience worth having!
