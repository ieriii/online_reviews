Since writing my review last year, I have been back twice and stand by the 5 stars. I do recommend that if you go here, either with another person or a group of people, it's a good idea to get one egg-based savory item to balance out any of the sweet stuff on the menu. OR, ask your waiter if you can get one pancake instead of three. We had an 8-year-old with us last week and that would have been helpful. We ended up taking lots of stuff home but lucky us! Who knew that day-old pancakes taste great after 30 secs in the microwave? Also, the service here is very good. I get the feeling that everyone here has worked here a lot time because everyone seems very synchronized.
