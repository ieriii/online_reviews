Huge fan of the Peter Parker roll! Also, the little 1940's looking bar attached is the perfect little hideout for drinks while waiting for our table. They do offer BYOB, but I'm fairly certain they charge a cork fee. I'm not sure, I was pretty blitzed by the time the bill arrived. The dessert menu is bust, but good thing Phoebe's Cupcakes is right down the street! Also, the outdoor seating is fairly uncomfortable. I felt like I was sitting with the table next to my date and I.
