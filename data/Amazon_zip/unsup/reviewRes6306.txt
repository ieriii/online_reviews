This is our favorite neighborhood spot. Service is always outstanding. The raviolo is a must try. Also recommend the burger, the riccotta and honeycomb, the polenta boards, and the escarole salad. For dessert we usually stick with the sottobosco (a mix of cheesecake, graham crackers and seasonal fruit compote in a mason jar) but tried the little pudding last night for the first time and it was really good. Love the portion sizes and the atmosphere.
