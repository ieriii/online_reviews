I was really excited to go to Frontera. After realizing that reservations are made 3 months in advance and booked up solid, we waited 2 hours and finally made it to a nice spot outside of Frontera (even the fact that it was 9pm by then). Just be wary trying to "walk-in" for dinner here. We started off with the chips and salsa ($3 is a good value, but I'd pass here, the salsas are very normal bottle water like). Then came the Shredded Beef over Corn boats with avocado and a out of control sauce. I would order 3 more orders of this. Then the trio ceviche (tuna with mango, scallops, and calamari). All three were light, well seasoned, and perfect. I only wish I ordered bowls of it. Lastly came the enchilada mole. Ok, so I may not be a Mexican expert, but I grew up in California, and have had my fair share of Mexican food. I found the mole to be a bit underseasoned, and not as robust as I would expect a mole that has been cooking for hours. The chicken seemed a bit dried out, actually, a lot dried out. I found the beans to actually be the best part of the dish. Seriously I was a bit underwhelmed by the dish. But, overall, given the prices, the decent service, and the idea behind the restaurant, I really enjoyed Frontera Grill. I would try it again, with a different combination of foods, but hopefully with reservations.
