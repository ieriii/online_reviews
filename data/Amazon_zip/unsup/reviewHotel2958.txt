I stayed at this place at least once a year, almost 4 years in a row. I think what made this place for me were location and service. The rooms weren't all that spectacular, but the view was. I could walk over to Michigan avenue in a mere matter of minutes. I also had no problem getting a taxi or shuttle to the airport. When I came into town it seemed like this hotel was easier for friends to find than a couple of the others I booked rooms at. If you want a nice room at a fair price, the Sheraton is one place that won't let you down.
