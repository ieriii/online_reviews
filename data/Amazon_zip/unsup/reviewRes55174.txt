The classic clean design makes you feel at home immediately, like you're visiting your favorite southern aunt (not the one that smells funny and has lots of cats), and the staff was friendly, informative and eager to please. The real star, however, is the food. The salads were fresh, with a nice variety of leafy greens, and the cornbread croutons were a tasty and clever touch. The sauces could use a leetle bit of variation, but this may also come from the unfortunate side effect of having only one spoon to go between the three. The barbecue flight appetizer would be enough for a meal for a smaller person (like me), and gives you a good sense of what the entrees have to offer: the pulled chicken was flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth tender; the pulled pork was smokey and well-complemented by a buttery pretzel bun; the kobe...okay I didn't try the kobe, but my colleagues seemed happy. Of the desserts, my favorites were the red velvet, which was light and moist with an excellent and delicately flavored lemon zest cream cheese icing, and the sweet tea granita, a terrific lighter follow up to a heavy meal. It's great to have southern-inspired barbecue in the Gold Coast. Check this place out, for real for serious.
