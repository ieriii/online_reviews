So it's crazy to call a restaurant in February to secure reservations for an April visit right?!? So glad I did though!! The drinks were delish, the service was great and the food was even better! My guy and I are Rick Bayless fans (watched his shows, have his books even had the pleasure of seeing him in our hometown during a Macy's cooking demonstration) so we had to eat at his restaurant of course during our trip to Chicago. We know great Mexican food because we live in San Diego, we were pleasantly surprised with our meal at Frontera though! We enjoyed: Frontera Guacamole; Street Food Trio: Two pieces each: potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamazula), duck flautas (tomato-cascabel sauce, arugula salad), sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile); Carne Asada "Brava" : Serrano-marinated, grass-fed Tall Grass flank steak, salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapeos). Grilled knob onions and sweet corn tamales with crema & fresh cheese; Fried Plantains: Homemade sour cream, fresh cheese & Shredded Beef Enchiladas: Chile-spiked shredded beef, roasted tomato sauce & Samuel's cheese. Crispy onions, cilantro; Rhubarb-Cassis Margarita. Our drinks were: Cazadores blanco tequila, Torres orange, Creme de Cassis, rhubarb, fresh lime, jamaica sugar & Cascabel Margarita: Espolon blanco tequila, Orange Curacao, fresh-made lemonada, homemade lime bitters, Cascabel salt; We finished the meal by sharing the Frontera's Chocolate Pecan Pie: with Kahlua whipped cream! All so very yummy I know it sounds like alot of food but we shared and the portions are small to moderate so we took a nice trip around the menu with great suggestions from our friendly server. I would never think I'd pay so much for Mexican food but I have to say it was our favorite Chicago meal and worth the price! Thanks Frontera!!
