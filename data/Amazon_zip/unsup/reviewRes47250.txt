I don't know why people are going crazy for this place. I thought the burgers were really dry and they didn't have much flavor. I asked for my burger to be medium, but instead got well done. The service was mediocre. Honestly, I've had better burgers from burger king. But I'm only one review out of over 250 others. Maybe they were just having an off day when I was there.
