Get the mussels! I know it sounds cliche since you can get mussels just about anywhere, but the addition of creme fraiche and pancetta and marjoram made this dish amazing. I was literally sitting on my hands to restrain myself from drinking the sauce like a soup. The other rock-star dishes are the homemade sausage with cannellini beans and the burrata cheese with mushrooms and balsamic was delicious as well. The only thing I wasn't as jazzed about was the olive oil poached tuna with these giant beans (I think they were some kind of Greek bean). It was cold and the tuna was not as melt-in-your-mouth than you'd imagine for something poached in olive oil. For a born and raised Chicagoan, the wait didn't stress me out as much as it seems to have frustrated others. You do have to be aggressive and hover over people in their bar stools, but I really feel those are the best seats in the house. You can watch them add all those delicious pig parts to each and every dish, and finish every dish with a drizzle of olive oil or even better, a spoonful of butter. :)
