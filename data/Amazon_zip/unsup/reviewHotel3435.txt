We got a king suite through a really good deal on Expedia, but wow would I have been disappointed if we had paid full price for what we got. The hotel itself is OK (but very small - it's easy to see it's from a different era). When we checked in, the worker said, "I'm going to put you in a suite with two beds." I replied, "King suite?" as that's what we had booked, and she said yes. We got up to our room to find they had put us in with two doubles! When we called the front desk, they said that was an "upgrade" because the room is slightly larger. Yes, it was, but a double bed is no substitute for a king. Eventually we got a new room. It's a cute boutique hotel, but nothing about it screams luxury to me. The front desk was snotty both at check in and check out, the room service was very limited (although that worker was extremely nice), the bellhop/doorman/valets all wouldn't help us find a taxi, and it took almost 20 minutes for the valet to get us our car!! It wasn't even like it was busy or check out time, and the parking garage is right next door. If you can score a great deal, it's might be worth because it's in a good location, but I would never go back.
