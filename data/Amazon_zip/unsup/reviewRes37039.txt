Came here on a weekday around 530~ My guy friends and my brother both recommended this place to me, so I was looking forward to seeing what the hubbub was all about. I think guys would def love this place. Okay caveat: I don't really like beer... (i know i know.. you can stop reading if you like. Lol it's like when I read sushi reviews, and someone says they ordered a california roll.. I def stop reading...) Anyway, that being said this is a review more for the food. The mussels were so-so... sort of presented in the classic french moules-frites sort of way with delicious crispy fries and addictive aioli on the side. I just felt the mussels were not as flavorful. I prefer more garlic and wine flavor with some butter.. but it was more brothy. Also had the brisket plate with side of mac and cheese. Solid mac and cheese but wasn't impressed with the brisket. On a side note: a crazy man (maybe on drugs or something) came in and tried to start a fight with the bartenders!! I was scared..but thank goodness this place was just packed with dudes who handled the situation :P
