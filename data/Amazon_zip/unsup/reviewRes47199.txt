Food: 4.5 stars Ambiance: 1 star ** please read full review Service: 3.5 stars So, the food is here good. I mean, really good. I consider myself somewhat of a burger baron, if you will -- and these burgers do not disappoint. It's not easy to cook a 10 oz burger perfectly, but they seem to do it every time. The menu is extremely limited, but for what it is (a burger joint) the execution is spot on. The fried stuff was fried to perfection (fries, and fried pickles, and the wings). The mac 'n cheese was perfectly creamy. And the burgers... yum-o. On to ambiance. I mean... who cares in a burger joint, right? WRONG. The MUSIC... kill me now. I have no issues with most music, but seriously, stop blasting the death metal. It's just obnoxious, and it's constant. You can avoid the ear-torture if you eat outside, in which case this place is just great. But if you have to sit inside, be prepared to barely be able to hear the person sitting right next to you due to the very angry vocalist tearing himself a new set of vocal cords to the soothing sounds of power chords and bass drum. Crap I just turned in to my dad.
