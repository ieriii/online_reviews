There are no surprises here. The food is excellent. The drinks are wonderful. A very nice restaurant to go to if you have the cash. The salad bar is exquisite and quite delicious. The meat is wonderful. They have a nice touch with the lady "flying a la Tinkerbell" to get the wine. The mashed potatoes and plantains were amazing. All in all a wonderful experience.
