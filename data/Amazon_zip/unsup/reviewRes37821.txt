I plan on writing a second review for HopLeaf once I'm able to get in without a 1 1/2 wait at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night, but my initial visit turned a fan out of me. Most of those I've spoken to who have been here, speak very highly of the mussels, of which I am sure to try next time.  The space is nice and surprisingly quite large with a front area, back area, and upstairs, with each section commanding it's own bar. The beer selection is tremedously intimidating and is a stiff competitor to MapRoom, but with the added benefit of a full menu. The crowd was lively yet laid back with a good mix of age groups. Only con is that it's a pretty far drive from the downtown area.
