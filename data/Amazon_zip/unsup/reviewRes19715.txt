I was treated to dinner at Coast this past Tuesday night, and while we both had a great time... The server described an amazing special sushi roll that we both agreed would be great. It had a lot of fun things included in it and the main fish was yellowtail, I believe. So when the waiter returned, we agreed to order the special as well as a white tuna roll. A few minutes later the waiter returned to inform us that they had run out of a few key ingredients of the special roll, but the sushi chef could make another special roll consisting of "white tuna and ginger" for us if we'd like. So my complaint is mostly with the waiter because we'd already ordered a tuna roll and he offered to serve us another one instead of the exciting variety that had previously excited our minds and tastebuds. The food arrived promptly and on pretty platters, so no complaints there. The pseudo-special roll was great with a surprise crunch and a perfectly finely graded tuna. It send the "sushi happiness high" chemicals straight to the brain and down my arms. If only the waiter had been a bit more educated. Ambiance is pretty good here, but a little crowded and a little loud. The lighting is quite nice as the candlelight danced right out of my date's eyes. I think Coast should invest in a liquor license and create a cocktail menu to compliment a sophisticated sushi experience.
