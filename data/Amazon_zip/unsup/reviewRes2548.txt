I just don't get it I had the famous Foie Gras Dog and found it disgusting my 18 year old son found it disgusting too. He also had the turdunkin dog which was better but nothing great. The service was great even though they have a line out the door they treat everyone like they are important and do not rush you at all the fries were good but nothing amazing. Maybe I am not sophisticated enough to get this place but the dogs were a drag.
