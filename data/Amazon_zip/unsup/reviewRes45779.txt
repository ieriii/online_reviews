i'd been meaning to try wilde since moving in the neighborhood. this past weekend seemed perfect due to the crazy cold weather. wilde was the perfect meal. the portions are huge, so we shared an entree of roast sirloin of beef with mash potatoes and a side of green beans. i'm a mash potato snob and loved them! it was like my mom was in the back cooking. i felt like i just had a home cooked meal! i kept checking out what other people were eating to figure out what i could get next. the mac n' cheese looked really good . . . actually everything that came by looked delicious. i will definitely be back! there was a good mix of people. older couples, families, dates, groups of friends. my only complaint is that it's a bit loud, but other than that i can't complain!
