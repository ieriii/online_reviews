My husband and I came here on a Friday night after receiving a gift card from friends. We weren't able to get a table but were happy to sit at the bar. The place is cozy, comfortable and well-decorated. The food could not have been better and we enjoyed the 'quartino' serving size off the wine list. The bartender seemed a bit frazzled and while attentive was not as friendly or welcoming as I would have liked. Never having been there before we had some questions about the menu and I appreciate being treated graciously when dropping a pretty penny on food. The rest of the guests seemed to be having a great time and while the crowd seemed a bit older and well-to-do, we will be back, with a reso for a table, to partake of the wonderful food.
