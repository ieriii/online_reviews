This is such a nice hotel! A couple friends and I had a girls night out (er, night in, since we were all a little tired on a Fri. night) last weekend. I will admit I used the wrong set of elevators, and I felt like a huge dork. Well, I wasn't paying attention to notice two sets of elevators (on opposite sides of the hotel). Oops. We didn't check out the restaurant/bars in the hotel, but they looked pretty interesting to try at another time. Our room was nice, and we had a decent view of Michigan Ave. Is it weird to comment that the bathroom in our room was well lit? I will, anyway, but it's only because I like a bright bathroom, esp. in hotels. A good hotel to recommend to out of towners....well, also to those in Chicago!
