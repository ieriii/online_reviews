Baba Ganoush and char grilled pita on the table within 5 minutes of sitting down? While Noon O Kabab is not a small restaurant, the waitstaff succeeds in making it feel that way through their warm attentiveness. Upon sitting down we were welcomed with a spread of creamy feta cheese, fresh onions, and char grilled pita. We immediately placed our appetizer order for a small baba ganoush and hummus. Almost instantly both arrived at our table. The baba ganoush was well seasoned and the deep flavor of the eggplant was showcased without any of the bitterness eggplant often brings. This was definitely the better appetizer; I liked the hummus but it wasn't too robust of a flavor- a delicate hummus if you will. I personally prefer a stronger flavor with more seasoning but it was still good, but compared to the baba ganoush it was no contest. Everyone at the table ordered kabobs- chicken, rib eye (!), ground sirloin, and shrimp. All were seasoned and cooked very well, with the shrimp being cooked just a bit too long, but still delicious. The rib eye really stole the show. The velvety cutlets were cooked perfectly and had a buttery texture. The chicken with a squirt of lemon was tangy and succulent. The sirloin did not dry out as this dish often will. Again, all dishes were perfectly seasoned- which makes the lack of seasoning in the hummus all the more confusing. Now I would have been happy with the kabobs alone, but the dill rice brought the dishes to another level. Get the dill rice, not the regular rice. Seriously, the dill adds such a deep, somehow subtle, flavor that makes this more than a rice side dish. One area of possible improvement is the plating. The kabobs, a nice pile of rice, and roasted tomatoes are gorgeous but there was an empty portion of my plate that would have benefited greatly even from some cilantro or parsley. Other than that and the hummus, I am a huge fan of Noon O Kabab.
