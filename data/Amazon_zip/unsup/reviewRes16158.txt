If you're looking for high quality, classic cocktails served to you by informative mixologists, this is your place. There are no reservations, and there is no standing at the bar, so I usually go earlier for a few pre-dinner drinks and beat the crowd. Some people feel it's a bit stuffy and reserved, but if you're into great drinks, or you're looking for something intimate, this is a great spot. It can be expensive, but you really get what you pay for.
