Excellent old world wine, great selection. Staff is knowledgeable, helpful and ask them for advice when ordering. I loved my ceaser salad with anchovies :) Their toasted bread with garlic and olive oil is so delicious. I ate two trays of that! Just be prepared to sit in a crowded table, and very noisy. it's hidden, but definitely a great late night joint. I highly recommend it.
