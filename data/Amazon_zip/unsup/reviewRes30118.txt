I like going in for a breakfast, lunch or dinner with a book. Sometimes I meet a group there. It's a very comfortable cafe and so close to my place that I think of it often. The service is spotty, so much so that the only reason I don't go there weekly is the service. The waiter disappears or walks by without seeing the water glass is empty or there is no silver or you stand there at the register while the staff finishes their social conversation. Don't order martini's. The beer and wine choices are very good. Every meal I've ordered has been delicious and some memorable. Street parking, 151 or Clark St. bus, garage at Indigo, parking lot at State and Goethe, easy NE walk from Division stop on Red-Line. They play great Cd's all day long. No matter your age, the feel is terrific. They keep the sound just right, not loud. If they could get the service fixed I'd give it 6 stars. It could easily be perfect.
