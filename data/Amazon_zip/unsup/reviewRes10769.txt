Will I ever be welcomed back into the Windy City if I do this? Most likely no. But I gotta. I wasn't blown away by anything. Looking at the menu to describe what I had is a little surprising. Feta shrimp benedict? Where the hell was that when I was there? I digress. I had an artichoke, veggie omelette, tasted a friends bloody mary, another friends burrito and we tried the red velvet pancakes. It was all kind of lackluster except for the super sweet pancakes, which of course, stole the show. The Bongo Room itself was really pretty, well appointed inside and our service was fantastic. After all of our meals in SF, I need the Bongo room to step up to the drum cause I'm choosing Birchwood every time.
