My friend brought me to this place for some "real chinese" food. I was really hesitant because it was the first place I had been to, and he brought his Chinese friend with. His parents own restaraunts in China, so his standards for food are incredibly high. We opted to get some really spicy dishes and share them. I think they were rib tips, white fish in a spicy broth, and a shrimp dish. The rib tips weren't that great, but that's cause I hate fatty foods. The fish, which was my first time ever eating fish, was incredible. The shrimp was also just as tasty. The spiciness was flavorful, not just mouth destroying, which was amazing. Overall a fantastic place for some real Chinese.
