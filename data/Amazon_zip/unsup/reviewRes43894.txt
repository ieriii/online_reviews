During lunch, our waiter rattled off 5 different specials they had going; so either this place had a lot of food going bad that day or they like to give customers a good selection. Let's hope for the latter. edit: I've talked with several friends who've been to Kinzie, and apparently they *always* have tons of lunch specials. This is one of my preferred places to take interview candidates and other guests who can't be subjected to the 'regular' (gasp) food available in the office. I had scallops and a side of risotto; everything was quite good. Clearly some careful attention was paid to the preparation. I wouldn't come here expecting to have a life-changing culinary experience, but it'll do for a nice lunch.
