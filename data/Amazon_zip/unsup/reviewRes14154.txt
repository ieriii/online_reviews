First I'd like to say I love beer, moreover, the process of making beer. I have never been more disappointed in both food and beer in any restaurant in Chicago. I had the pulled pork and the cheddar ale soup. The soup was good, but made me sick. The pulled pork was sub-par considering the grandiose atmosphere.  We got the muscles and the bacon popcorn for the table. The popcorn was a novelty but the small bits of bacon on top of bland popcorn really made it not worth it. The muscles were ok, not good, but not bad. The best part was the blue cheese potato salad. I could eat that all day. Now on to the beer. The beer was bland, watery, and felt like it was a practice batch. I don't know if the wort was too thin, or if the grains were just too expensive after finishing the tin ceiling, but it needed more. I expected much more Cascade in the IPA and it tasted more like a Noble. It had 0 bite and was disappointing. The golden cross was ok, but I'd almost rather have a Pabst. The porter was better, but still an average beer.  I don't understand how the beer here is so bad, with so much good brewing experience backing them up. Go down the street to Piece for a better micro. Don't waste your time on this water downed version of a micro brew.
