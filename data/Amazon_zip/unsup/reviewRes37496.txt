Do get the mussels, and make sure you examine the contents before inserting in mouth. There was a baby crab hiding inside of my friend's mussel- a little cute, a little creepy. Pomme frites are a must. That garlic mayo is unbelievable. The CB&J looked realllly good, too. While the food is very delish, people mainly come here for the extensive beer collection. I don't drink much, but ordered frambois to experience this place to its fullest. It tastes like half raspberry juice, half beer... not a bad choice if you're used to drinking more of those girlie drinks. Service... well, the hostess made a big deal about not having our entire party there. why? There were tons of open tables, we were short 1 person... I just don't get it.
