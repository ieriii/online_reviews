We went there for dinner without reservation. They were nice enough to accomandate us. We took the courses with paired wine. It was nicely paired. Each course likes an artwork. Nothing more to say. I have waited a few month to write this, especially after a bit traveling around. I finally come back to think about this dinner, it is probably one of the best meals I had. I have mad respect for the people respect food as they do. Even I may not justify spend so much on one dinner, but life is short after all. It is really worth it if you run into it.
