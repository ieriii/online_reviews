This was the first time that I had been to Shaw' Crab House. I had reservations for 6:00 pm on a Friday and I arrived about 5:45. I had to wait until 6:15 to get seated, but it was worth the wait. I saw the ugliest Black gay guy in the world, he was wearing a gray tartan skirt, calf-high furry boots, and a cape. He was going bald, but had the nerve to have his hair in a ponytail. I am not a homophobic or anything, but his attire was quite funny to me. I then saw two gay hispanics waiting at the bar for a table and they were holding hands. I work in the Western Suburbs and I am not use to seeing this. My wife works downtown and she says this is a common occurence. I should have known better, we were on the Near North Side. Getting back to Shaw's, I had the crab cakes and hash browns. The food was excellent and I got a free show to boot. The service was top rate and they gave you plenty of food.
