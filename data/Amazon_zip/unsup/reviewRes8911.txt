awesome place for pizza! i was told by an italian friend that this is authentic pizza from naples and he also agreed it was top-notch. they had this spicy olive oil that i wanted to drink, it was so yummy.  on your way out, everyone gets a mini-cannoli. i wanted to steal the whole plate it was so yummy. also, if you find yourself waiting (i got lucky and seated right away), they hand out fresh foccacia bread to quell your gnawing hunger pains.  great place, i am def coming back!
