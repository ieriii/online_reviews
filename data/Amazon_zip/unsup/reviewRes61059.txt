I have only been here a few times for dinner, but I love Wishbone. It is so different from the other restaurants I've been to in Chicago and I don't have to dress up. The southern specials make great comfort food and the staff is laid back and welcoming. The prices are very reasonable and the cocktail prices are fair also.
