Bought the Groupon like many other reviewers. I had never been here before (only passed by it on my way to show visiting friends Navy Pier :/), so I didn't have much to go off of other than my fellow Yelpers' reviews who all said this place was good, but expensive. You guys are so right. I didn't go into Fox & Obel with a plan, and I think that was where I went wrong. I was pretty overwhelmed by just how big it was (that's what she said) and how confusing the layout was. So I took a lap around the store and made a note to not buy anything I could find elsewhere for cheaper. I got truffle butter, brie, chips, Italian sausage, baguette and prepared foods like a mini cheesecake, chocolate turtles, chicken salad and a Margherita pizza. For $50. Yeah, you read that right. My mother would've had a heart attack, I'm sure. The staff was a bit hit or miss. Between feeling watched because I'm brown and a cashier telling me she was closed only to open up a minute later, I'm not sure. But the actual cashier I got was super nice and helpful. Would I go back and pay non-groupon dollars? Maybe for the pizza which was super good (perfectly crispy crust), but not for much else.
