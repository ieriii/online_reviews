I used to live a block from this place on Dearborn. Now that I've just moved away for school, I've found myself wishing I could walk in and plop down on one of the booth seats and order some cajun chicken fettuccine and pretend to study. Sometimes the chicken was a little dry, but oh that sauce was fork-licking good. Their burgers & appetizers are pretty good, too. The staff is friendly, if sometimes a little bit 'more hipster than thou'. I can take it, just give me the pasta.
