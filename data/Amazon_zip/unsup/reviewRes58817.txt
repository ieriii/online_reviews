I had a b-day party of 15 people last night and the food was phenomenal (hot and spicy)! The waiter was great in accommodating everyone including 3 kids and making some food suggestions. The tiger cry was exceptional (like always) along with the chicken larb, tom ka kai and the pad thai noodles- outstanding flavors! Opart is the only thai restaurant we go to including the one on state street, but by far this one has better flavors and you can't beat the prices! And it's BYOB!!!!!! great savings when you're hosting a party.
