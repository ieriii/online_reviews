Okay, so if you're like me, a petite Asian female and on a weight-loss plan for the past year where you now eat 4-6 small meals per day, even having the 12-course tasting with the wine pairing is an absolute challenge. In our case, it was more like 15 courses. By the time we had our last savory course (the bacon hanging on a wire), I was ready to fall asleep/keel over. I would go to Alinea again, but probably opt for no more than two glasses of wine (one red and one white) and stick with the 12-course tasting menu. I've read on other blogs that the 24-course meal has smaller portions, but that didn't appear to be the case when I was there. There were two tables (one party of two and a larger party of six) that were going the "tour" and I just marveled at how they could even handle it. I was more impressed with the savory courses than the sweet/dessert courses. The presentation of all the courses was beautiful and surprising (although not too surprising since I read a lot about what to expect from various foodie blogs) and the service was excellent. I honestly could have ended the meal with the palate cleanser (guava). Of the savory courses, the one that left me confused was the lamb course. I think that it should have been named "English pea" since this was the predominant ingredient/flavor for me. But do take my comments with a grain of salt, so to speak...I was quite "toasty" by the 12th course. Maybe if I weren't so drunk, I'd have a different opinion of the sweet courses. This was definitely the most expensive meal we've ever had ($500+ for two--that's the tasting menu plus wine pairings, tip and tax). We were there for at least 3.5 hours.
