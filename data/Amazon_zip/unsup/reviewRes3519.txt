Two words: Seoul Sassy.  So they use organic free range chicken wings. If Crisp did not make that disclaimer on the menu I would have thought I was eating freaky mutant steroid injected wings...because they are gigantic! Seriously though, the wings were so delicious. The buddha bowl was pretty good too, but honestly, after eating 3 wings, I was almost full. The only negative was that I was abnormally thirsty after my meal...MSG?
