Over the past 2 years, I've been a frequent visitor, and all I can say after tonight is this place is Coast-ing downhill fast...walkins on a Friday around 7pm, we didn't mind a 45 min wait (that ended up being 1.5 hrs) and were seated at the sushi bar. On a busy night, it looks like they run out of wine glasses, so we also did not mind the juice glasses for our wine - European, our server said (?). What we did mind was the following: *My dirty wine glass *Forgetting our edamame *Our server disappeared for 20 min mid-meal and for most of that time, what looked to be our sushi was sitting in the window where multiple servers and customers eyeballed it, smelled it, and passed it by. Not knowing if it was ours, we didn't say anything, but sure enough, when Houdini reappeared, we were served. We were the first two chairs at the sushi bar - any server or sushi chef could have handed it over without going out of their way at all. *The case of the missing sushi - the fish inside the rolls has disappeared! The white dragon - always a solid choice - was half the size it normally is, and in the popper, I would have needed a microscope to see the smoked salmon. *The one time my water glass was filled, I also got a bonus - floaties. Yum... *Wrong mochi flavors (which were still good - I'm not too picky about my mochi) *$100 for that (!) Remember, this place is BYOB (with multiple limitations, and you have to open it yourself) Overall, a solid 1.5, but I have to up it to a 2 because I can't get enough of the spicy miso soup! I won't be back for a while, until my spicy miso soup craving conquers my dislike of bad service, the need to actually taste sushi in rolls, and my fondness for clean and appropriate glassware.
