I went here with a group of friends and was not impressed. It was here or Fogo de Chao and I think we picked the wrong place. I always heard the salad bars at all-you-can-eat places offered a large selection of great tasting food to fill you up on anything and everything but the more expensive cuts of meat. I was wrong. I sampled a variety of items from the salad bar and it actually forced me to eat more meat. The "fresh" mozzarella tasted worse than the cheap store bought kind you buy at Dominicks and the vegetables were cold and flavorless. I was extremely disappointed here. Onto the meat. I've had great lamb and bad lamb. This place had bad lamb. It was almost chewy and greasy which is the sign of poorly cooked lamb. I would have to say my favorite cuts were the rib-eye and the non-bacon wrapped filet. Both were good but nothing I couldn't put together at home for less than half the price of my dinner. I'd suggest spending your money elsewhere. Plenty of steakhouses in Chicago that offer up better tasting cuts. I came for the experience of this place and left disappointed. I won't be back
