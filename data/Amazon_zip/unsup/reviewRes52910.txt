The food was fantastic!!! We did have to wait which I of course expected since it was on a Friday night but the best thing was they have this secret hidden waiting lounge that they take you to with sofas and tables and chairs where you can uncork your BYOB wine or have a few beers while waiting. This was my first Cuban food experience and I must say I cant wait to have more!
