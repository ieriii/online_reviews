My cousin and her husband recently visited Chicago from Dallas and we (along with three of their friends) made a dinner reservation at Sunda. I had not heard of the restaurant, but I like sushi so I was game. We ordered a variety of rolls and beverages. I was very happy with my beverage selection. I don't remember the title, but I do remember that it had blackberries in it. It was DELISH! And, typically, I'm more of a nigiri/sashimi kinda gal, but I went with the group and tried all of the rolls. And my favorite was the caterpiller. I definitely plan to order another one on my next visit.
