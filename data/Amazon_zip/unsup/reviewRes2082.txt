Excellent. I had never heard of this place, but as a Chicagoan and a carnivore, i am ashamed i havent and i will be returning soon. I had a Don Rickles which was so tasty and cooked so perfectly i barely had to bite it. The guy who takes the orders was funny, nice and generally a good dude i think. The staff was nice, it was clean, i am going to try everything on the menu. Good spot.
