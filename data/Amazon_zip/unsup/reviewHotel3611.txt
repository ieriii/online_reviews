It's hard to do this but I have to take away some stars from The Drake. Their service just isn't what it once was, unfortunately.  My last experience was horrid. There was a social event for a group right off the lobby. It was so loud that I could barely hear the harpist and just heard a group of 50+ people socializing.  Sadly, I won't be coming back to the Drake until they make some major changes.
