Over 300 reviews for this place...i'll keep it short. Server with the never-endnig coffee refills...*jitters* Friend had Eggs benedict, thoroughly enjoyed. Friends BF had build your own omlette...seemed VERY satisfied. The Breakfast Burrito changed my life. Lemon Ricotta pancakes induced coma. This place should be illegal in most states, because that's how I feel when I leave...like I've committed a crime again the greatness that is brunch.
