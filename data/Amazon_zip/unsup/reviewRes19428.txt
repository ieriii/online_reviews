I just cannot get enough of this place. And apparently neither can a number of other folks, so try to get there early in order to avoid a super long wait. Don't be too afraid of the line (unless it's around the block). If confined within the restaurant, it moves decently well. Alternative is to get take-out - you get to hop the line and go straight the register by the door to place your order and get out.  The Milanesa is my favorite. The chicken is fried and the sauces are amazing. Plus, who doesn't love a pressed sandwich? I've also dabbled with the Chicken Tinga, also delicious, but I can't seem to expand beyond the Milanesa.  Don't forget to eat some churros. If you have to take half your sandwich home, do that - churros do not do well on day two, whereas your sandwich will. Also, try their agua del dia - you will not go wrong with whatever the flavor is. All of them are incredibly good.
