Food was good what we actually received. Service was terrible , our server forgot the 3 appetizers we ordered and tried to put in the order after our main course came and we alerted her that appetizers were missing. We went on Monday May 30 and restaurant was only 20 -25 %^ full. What must it be like when it is full? Non apologetic stuck up staff. Much nicer Italian places every where else.
