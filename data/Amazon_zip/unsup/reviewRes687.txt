I think most of it has been said. The food is creative to the point of being a bit ridiculous. I ate so many things that came with instructions of what to do, that I had to laugh. But the compositions are thoughtful. The tastes are almost uniformly pleasant. The wine pairings are spot-on. The service is casual yet professional. And the atmosphere is tasteful and mature, without being stuffy. Come here for a special occasion, though I would not call it "romantic," as it's a bit too austere for that.
