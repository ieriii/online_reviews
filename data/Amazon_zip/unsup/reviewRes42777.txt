Got delivery and it was a pretty seamless process. Ordered online, which always makes me nervous, but the system updated us on each step of the way. I got the caprese salad the italiana salad. The Caprese was good, although I am not sure I needed the spinach underneath. You're given the option of a bread bowl or pita. The bread bowl got very soggy and the pita is less bread. Also had some of the pizza and it was very good.
