We were all really happy with this place. I got the Chickn "Bacon" Ranch sandwich, which was good, though my very favorite thing about it is the side of sweet potato fries, which were perfectly crispy and sweet. Friends got the chili and avocado tostadas - everyone was happy with what they got. For dessert: Vegan peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough shake. How this is vegan is beyond me - you would never know! So rich and delicious. As far as the service, it can get crowded, but we were seated right away. Also, our server was great. She bent down to our level to take our orders, provided suggestions and information when we asked and did a great job overall!!
