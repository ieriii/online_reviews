I was recently at Wildfire for a wedding reception and was once again in love with their chopped salad. This is my favorite salad of all the restaurants in Chicago.  In the past, I've tried several of their fish dishes and they've never disappointed. Deserts are always great. The triple chocolate cake was wonderful. I highly recommend Wildfire.
