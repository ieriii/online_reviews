Of all the pho places on Argyle, in THE Viet-town of Chicago, Tank is the best. This mayyyyyyyyy or may not translate to its having the best pho in Chicago. I don't really know where else to get good pho besides at Argyle.. is there another street in Chicago where everything and everyone is Vietnamese? It's hole in the wall enough to make it legit AND clean-ER than the 777 888 or pho 999 down the street. You might have to wait a little bit if its during rush, but I don't mind.  They have lots to choose from on the menu. I usually get the same exact pho tai chin, which is the noodles with just rare steak and brisket because I don't like any of the funky other parts of the cow.. plus delicious spring rolls. And whenever I'm there someone at a table close by always orders a delicious looking drink that prompts me to ask the server what they're having. Usually he/she doesn't speak enough English to first of all understand my question let alone answer it. I'll never know. Anyhow, I looooooooooooooooove pho. Therefore I love Tank Noodle.
