I went here with my fiance and mom for her birthday. She is very very picky and we needed a veggie friendly place near work. Everyone is so incredibly friendly and accommodating here. We did have a to wait a bit for a table in the restaurant instead of the outdoor seating area. We ended up ordering a empanadas (all the veggie ones), veggie taco, the famous burrito, and potato tacos. I was slightly disappointed that they forgot the hot peppers in my burrito, and it didn't taste the same having them on the side. The two highlights were definitely their house salsa (which is fiery and delicious) and the oatmeal shake. I would go back again and again for their shakes alone.
