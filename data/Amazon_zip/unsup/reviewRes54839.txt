Superb!!!The smoked ham sandwich put me in heaven. It's the best ham on dark rye with provolone served with thin french fries and garlic mayo! The menu has a variety of flavs to choose.What ever your palate wants, get it. There are many choices of different hops from all over the world to drink!There is main flr seating for the ones who like a quick seat, outdoor seating for the wild and 2nd flr seating for on lookers. It's one great loft party with strangers without candy.This place rocks!
