The beer, the beer was so delicious! I had the gommorah and the Coup D'etat from the in house beer list. Environment was loud and exciting on a saturday night, service was on point. They are table runners everywhere waiting to take away empty plates, fill waters etc. I had the bruschetta with goat cheese and beets, and the tofu sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes. Couldn't be happier, I will come back. P.S. The wait for a Saturday at 8 pm was 45 minutes which really turned into 20. Grab a beer and quit whining about waiting for a table.
