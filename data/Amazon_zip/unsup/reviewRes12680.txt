Came here on a Friday late night and the place was still moderately packed. Unlike most Cuban restaurants I've been to, the atmosphere was pleasant and wasn't too loud and bustling. The margharitas were fairly big and pretty tasty. We ordered the Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops and the Pistachio crusted chicken both came in huge portions and tasty. The meat was just right, tender and juicy. Since the portions were huge, we have to pack home some and couldn't try their dessert. I would definitely go back to try their other entrees.
