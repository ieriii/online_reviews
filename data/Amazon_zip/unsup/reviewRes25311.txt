This place is tucked into the lobby of the Blackstone Hotel, which worked for me, as I was staying here for 6 weeks straight for work. I found the food to be very good but not cheap. A couple of things that really stood out included the flat bread, sauteed shrimp and marinated anchovies. Yes, anchovies! I never would have believed it either but it was amazing. I really can't say a bad thing about the food but only a few things stood out given the number of tapas we had.  The wine selection was good and I found the wait staff to be attentive. The atmosphere was okay but nothing that would knock you over. Plus it is the lobby of a hotel. I would go again but would have trouble explaining the bill on my expense account. Did I mention it wasn't cheap?
