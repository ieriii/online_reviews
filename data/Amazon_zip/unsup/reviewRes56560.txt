This place is great!! It was our first anniversary and the staff couldn't have been better. We had a nine o'clock reservation, but when we showed up we were told there was going to be a bit of a wait. We weren't thrilled about this, but the hostess offered us drinks while we waited. 45 minutes later, while enjoying the music from the piano bar in the background, we were seated.The dining room is dim, very romantic. The wait staff wears white jackets. We had two servers who went into detail about the menu. We ordered the bone-in ribeye and the swordfish. OMG... they both were so good. Even the bread basket was good. We shared a side of gorgonzola mac and cheese...Yum!!!The servers surprised us with two glasses of dessert wine and the most fabulous, flavorful white cake with cream cheese center, Mastro's signature warm butter cake, that I have ever had...served on a plate that said Happy 1st Anniversary. And the best part of it all was the pre-dinner drinks, the dessert wine, and the cake was all on the house! Great job Mastro's!!!
