Best cheese fries... EVER. Ask for a side of their ranch to go with... it's homemade and delish. The buffalo wings are amazing. Apparently they age their sauce for over a week, so if it's close to the end of the week they are super spicy. Nothing a glass of milk can't fix. Service was tremendous! Street parking kind of sucks, but the valet guy will find a spot for you no problem... and their valet doesn't cost an arm & leg like most other places.
