If you want authentic Chinese cuisine in the heart of Chinatown, stay on Archer Avenue and find Lao's! Anything you order is out-of-this-world! My regular meals here are the mayonnaise shrimp or the eggplant with garlic sauce. The portions are smaller than what most Chinese restaurants provide, but the quality can't compare!  If you only have one night in Chinatown, go to Lao's!
