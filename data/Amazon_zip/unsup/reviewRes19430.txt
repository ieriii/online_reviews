I had the selection of sausages, pheasant & something else (I forgot) with potato and Brie cheese. Wonderful stuff! My friend had the Gage burger with the best fries we ever tasted!!! On weekends, the tourist set comes down Green Bay, or wherever they emerge from, but weekdays are safe here on Michigan Avenue at The Gage.
