It's definitely not authentic Mexican food..but since I don't live near Nuevo Leon..it's the next best thing! Price is decent and the drinks are delicious. My only complaint is the service...it's sometimes great then way too many times bad. But it's in my neighborhood so I can deal with the not so great service since the drinks are good!
