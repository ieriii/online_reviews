This place is what tapas should be everywhere. I went with high expectations and they were certainly met. If nothing else, the lunch that Garces puts on is better than most anywhere in the loop area. We ate the mixto of queso which included Cado Urgelia (cow's cheese with apple and lavender), Gorrotxa (goat's cheese with garlic and dulce de leche), and Ombra (sheep's cheese with orange marmelade). Then I moved on to the Serrano and Fig salad. This salad was completely awesome. The salty serrano and the sweet fig worked so well together. Wild mushrooms and shallots were up next. They were great, but I was getting filled up by this point. We finished with the chocolate souffle that was spectacular. One of the best desserts in the loop. Perfect with a little sherry. I look forward to coming back to try the entire pig.
