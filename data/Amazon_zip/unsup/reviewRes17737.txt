Soooo one of my friends had a tiny birthday party here. I'd never been before. I loved the decor and the atmosphere, but my food was eh, the server was eh (he seriously laughed at me [and not in any sort of nice way] when I asked what the less-spicy choices on the menu were -- yes, man, I realize where I am but it's not like I picked the restaurant) - I don't know, maybe it's just because I've never had Latin American food before but I just wasn't super impressed. We ordered the guacamole for the appetizer (holy huge! and very lime-y), and I liked all the platanos everywhere. I had the pork chop (I apologize for not remembering the actual name of the dish) but it was a little bland, I felt like I could have made something very similar at home. It came with mashed platanos with bacon...which was really interesting, I liked it. Kinda pricey (for 4 of us, and only 2 boozy drinks, our bill was about $160) and I felt like we were paying more for the decorations than the food, if that makes any sense. At any rate, my birthday-celebrating friend loves the place, though, and he had a great night so I was happy.
