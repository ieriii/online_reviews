I should start off by saying that all I ate was the fries and they were quite delicious. I was here for the sole purpose of drinking a good beer, something I hadn't had much of since leaving Portland several days prior. I was definitely happy with the selection and ended up having a couple of drafts that I hadn't tasted yet. I started out with a Hop Stoopid from Lagunitas: had this in bottles but never on tap, it was quite satisfying. After that I moved on to the incredibly delicious Imperial IPA from Avery Brewing in Colorado. My only complaint is that they served this in a half pint because of the ABV.. Whatever. The place was packed and had a great atmosphere. A little on the pricey side but I think this is normal for good beer when you're not in the NW. Definitely stop by if you're looking for a couple of good IPA's or some tasty Belgians in Chicago.
