I don't remember the last time I ate food this delicious. Truly phenomenal. We were there for a private party and had a room to ourselves, with a fixed menu. We chose the smallest amount of food offered in the fixed menus, and still had more than we could eat. Service and atmosphere were also top-notch. Price is high, but you know that going in. Bacon-wrapped dates? Incredible. Butternut squash dumplings? So good we asked for more Paella? My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Wood-fired taste, tender chicken, tasty rice Chocolate croquettes? The person who thought these up should get a medal. Really, really exquisite. Chocolate, marshmallow, gooey, full of flavor. Thanks to all of the people who made our dinner memorable.
