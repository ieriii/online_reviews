This is one of the places that a person just has to try out when he is insuring Chicago. It is a bit touristy and the lines are long but it's also novel and fun. My wife and I shared the foie grad dog, the rib eye hot dog, the Bridgette Bardot, the corndog, and the fries cooked in duck fat. Everything was pretty solid. The duck fat fries were tasty but a bit greasier and soggier than normal fries.  Portions were big so I recommend sharing these with about 4 people. The foie gras hot dog was delicious but it was so rich that my wife and I found it hard to each finish half. The rib eye had a nice meaty texture but was somewhat dry. More chimichurri sauce would have been nice. The Bridgette Bardot was solid but otherwise unremarkable. If you don't come around often, I would recommend sticking with only the special menu. The line is long but it moves rather quickly. Tables open up often and service is very kind.
