Re: Opart's Pad Thai I still like opart a lot, but I'll agree with the people who say their pad thai leaves something to be desired. The noodles are a little too starchy/sticky, there's not enough flavor or crunch.  For the best Pad Thai I've had, get Thai Bowl's on Taylor St. if your by UIC (go flames!) or Sticky Rice if you're up north (but don't go there just for the Pad Thai!).
