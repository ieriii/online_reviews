A friend and I stopped in for a quick bite before catching a movie at Landmark Century. It was our first time and my friend didn't know what she wanted or what to expect. Based on reviews, I was all about the korean fried chicken. The manager (perhaps owner) was very kind and helpful in explaining the menu, flavors, and sauces until we decided to split a half order of Seoul Sassy Chicken (drenched in a ginger, soy, and garlic sauce) and a huge basket of fries that came with two spicy dipping sauces. Wow! It was so tasty that we couldn't focus on our conversation as we devoured the chicken while periodically sucking sauce off our fingers. The half order with fries turned out to be perfect for us. When finished, we were neither stuffed, nor hungry, but very satisfied. I can't wait to go back and sample the rest of the menu!
