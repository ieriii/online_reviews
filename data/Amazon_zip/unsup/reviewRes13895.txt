Since everyone & their mother was waiting for this place to open, this place is CRAZY BUSY. Do yourself a favor & bring only one buddy and sit at the bar. That's what I did. That allowed me to avoid the 25+ minute wait times (although I'm sure they fluctuate depending on when you go). I went on a Wednesday night. MUSSELS WITH THE HARD CIDER. Get 'em! Absolutely delicious. My only complaint is you don't get enough bread to soak up all dem juices! You can certainly ask for more but I found they didn't give you much then, either. My friend and I both ordered the Workingman Burger, medium rare. It definitely needs more seasoning. The most flavorful thing about it was the bacon that's on it. That's too bad. A bit of seasoning goes a long way...I hope they take this into consideration. The waitstaff at the bar are very friendly and attentive. A friend made the observation that even though they have been open for about a month (if even), they operate like they've been open for much longer than that. I had the Workingman Mild. Not bad.  I'd recommend this spot more for casual dining. Be prepared to shout at each other, especially with how busy it is now... There's street parking available. Or you can do it the easier way and get off on the California Blue Line stop.
