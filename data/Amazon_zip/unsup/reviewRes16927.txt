We recently had a mini-post elopement party in one of the small private rooms and wow, what a night! The event planning staff were incredibly helpful- from Kristen in the office to Mario the night of the event, everyone went out of their way to make the night go smoothly.  And the food... oh. my. god. I dream of the food- that's how delicious it was. From the Churrasco to the Seafood Paella, I could have that meal over and over again. And our 50 guests... all happy campers!
