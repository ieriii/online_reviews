A bit pricey but we take our out of town guests here and they love it. The decor and ambiance is great - seems like a place that would be located in Lakeview or Wicker Park. Great good, great portions, attentive staff. Getting a seat here can be hard so make sure to call in advance for reservations. Get the lamb shank and have your friends get the kabob's. Share, because there's plenty to go around.
