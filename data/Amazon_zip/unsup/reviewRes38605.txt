Let us start with the beer. There is plenty of it. And it's all delicious. The beer tap list is almost biblical, so I could spend my whole night here. But last I've been here, I was there for the beer AND food. The food was pretty good. The limited menu shouldn't dismay anyone, because the brisket sandwich was so delicious, as were the frites. How can anyone not enjoy those two foods with a cold glass of high quality beer?
