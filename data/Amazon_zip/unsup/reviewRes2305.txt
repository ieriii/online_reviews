It's a very popular place and if you go on a nice day, especially a Saturday, you should expect a long (~2 hr) wait. Stop your whining. The website is extremely up-to-date and accurately reflects the day's menu. The duck fat fries are good to try once, but they're really nothing to write home about. I don't feel compelled to try them again after the first time. Obviously, you can go there to get a regular hot dog or brat, but that's really a waste of a trip. If you're going to wait in line for over an hour, at least get something you really can't get anywhere else. They're great at incorporating really unusual meats into their sausages. I've had rattlesnake, kangaroo, ostrich, bear, alligator, etc. Some of the aiolis/mustards/mayos are kinda weird (strawberry mustard is definitely a no-no), but overall the food is solid and Doug is awesome.
