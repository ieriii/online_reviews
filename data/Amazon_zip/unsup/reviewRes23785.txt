More like a 3.5 stars. Our friend introduced us to this place on Saturday night. There was a wait, but well worth it. We shared the fried yuca (nobody ever orders the boiled), plantains, and guacamole=all tasty. Especially the yuca and garlic aioli--no complaints whatsoever. My husband had the special, boasting of all 4 tastes of Costa Rica, and how tasty all 4 were. My veggie burrito, split with Justin, was great. So my experience, although meat free, was recommendable. Best of all Irazu is family owned and run, which translates to: from the heart. You won't be disappointed. BYOB
