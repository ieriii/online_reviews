There are so many treats in this building.  I really like the hipster neighborhood bakery vibe they keep pace with.  The staff is expressive and they communicate the diversity of the bakery. The cakes are so ornamental and ultra creative.... but can resonate a little flat on flavor.  The best cupcakes here are the white-cake coconut and red velvet cake. They're moist and the coconut cream is super sweet with coconut and the red velvet has thick cream cheese frosting. Key Lime Tart.... if you like key lime, I think this is the best one that I've had in the city by far. The crust is dense and crunchy and sweet and buttery. Worth the drive across town if necessary. And keeping the simple things worth the mention, the coffee (Alliance roast) is so good. I really enjoy this bakery.
