I am more of an independent restaurant kind of guy, but as far as chain steakhouses go, Ruth's Chris is the clear #1 in my mind. The steaks are fantastic. the drinks well made and the atmosphere is great for a romantic dinner or a business lunch. The sides are huge and great, with the Potatoes Au Gratin being my favorite. If a truly great independent steakhouse is not in the area I hit Ruth's Chris no matter what town I am in.
