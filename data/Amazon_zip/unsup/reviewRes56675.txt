The people were very friendly, from taking the reservation to the host to the waiter everyone took the time to make our dinner a nice experience. A two piece band played great background music. The room/decor is nice, but not as fancy or dressy as i thought it would be for a special occasion location. Food was very good. I would definitely go back.
