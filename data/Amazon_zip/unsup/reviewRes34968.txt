Shaw's Crab House is awesome! I always have a guilt factor when eating foods out that I can make myself, such as crab legs. Cooking crab legs is easy... throw them in a boiling pot of water, remove, eat with melted butter. But boy, Shaw's crabs are so much better than mine - and rightfully so! The texture of each leg was perfectly flakey and peeled away from the shell and itself. It was so easy to crack. We also got the oyster sampler. There were two out of six that were particularly tasty and smooth, but unfortunately, we are not renowned oyster eaters and don't know and can't guess which oysters were which. But regardless, they were delicious! We loved our Shaws experience and cannot wait to try out their Sunday brunch to eat our hearts out.
