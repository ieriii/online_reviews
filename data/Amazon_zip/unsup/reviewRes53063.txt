I've been to here a few times now, and it has clearly become way more popular over time. For the most part, I think their success is well deserved: the food is tasty and the environment is really fun and aesthetically interesting. The only reason it doesn't get more stars is that I have the impression entre prices have gone up considerably. $17 for fricasse? $18 for pargo en mojo? It seems a little high to me, but then again I'm perhaps more "cost-conscious" than your average man on the street. It's worth pointing out that the appetizers are delicious and a great value and that the BYO factor is in play. All in all, I think it's more like 3.5 stars but I rounded up based on the nice setting, the good value on apps and being BYO.
