Cheesecake factory on a bigger scale. According to our server they are owned by the cheesecake factory, hence similarities in decor and menu items. Large servings which I actually wish wasn't the case especially with the desserts because I feel like you end up wasting so much food. We decided to go just for desserts and coffee as it was near our hotel and open later. We got the rustic apple pie and beignets. Be prepared to share with more than one other person as there is no way one could finish let alone after eating a meal on top of that. The beignets were yummy as others have said, thats actually why I decided to try them. The sauces were a nice option but not necessary. Those who tried the apple pie said it was delicious but again too much to finish between 2 people. We only finished about half the beignets as well (came with 6 or 7 I believe). I also had the honey vanilla latte (nonfat) which was nice but a little too sweet for me, I couldn't even finish it but I'm also not used to having that much sweets. Overall service was fine but it was rather noisy where we were seated (for some odd reason they thought it was a great idea to seat us near a large and very loud group even though it was late and the place was half empty). After requesting they did move us but that should be common sense to begin with. Desserts like the ones we ordered take 30min so be aware if you arent eating a full meal, we knew ahead of time so had no problem waiting. Overall was ok but not necessarily something I would do again as its a very generic place and I'm sure there are much better alternatives.
