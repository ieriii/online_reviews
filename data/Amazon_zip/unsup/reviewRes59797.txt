This is the best pizza in Chicago, possibly the world. They have amazing marinara. The prices are great, the food is ready fast and they have some of the best customer service I've encountered in Chicago.My only complaint is that they should make there dining room more comfortable, but that's okay I'll just eat their pizza in my living room. Thanks for feeding me Art of Pizza! Keep cooking up the cheesy bubbly greatness!
