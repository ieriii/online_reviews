I'm not one who would typically opt for deep dish pizza, but at Pequod's, it is an absolute MUST. We got there pretty early on a Saturday night, around 5:45, so we had no trouble getting seated, and it was just 2 of us, so they sat us in a little booth against the wall.Took our drink order and they had one of my favorite IPAs (half acre daisy cutter), so I was happy as a clam. Not to mention I was absolutely famished, so I could not wait for our pizza to arrive. And arrive it did...eventually. Like 1.5 hours later. Basically, the story goes that they accidentally served our pizza to another table. They actually cut it up and serve the pizza on plates, so I guess the other table did not realize it was the wrong pizza until it was served up, at which point they could not give it to us. So, they said they would give us 50% off of our pizza...gee, thanks? 50% off of a $10 pizza? Wow, so glad we saved $5. Well, at least that's what was going through my head. BUT, thank god they redeemed themselves and gave us 50% off the small price pizza but actually gave us a large. Which was, in my opinion, a much better deal and much more worthy of the inconvenience we had to sit through. Because.... We were on our way to see Hunger Games and I absolutely hate being late to movies. They made it work though and it was all good. They even stored our left overs for us so we could go to the movies and then pick it up on our way home. I subtracted a star because of the wait, but they made up for it, and I would not hesitate to come back here. Totally a splurge since I think 1 slice has got to be like 1,000 calories, but worth it every once in a blue moon :)
