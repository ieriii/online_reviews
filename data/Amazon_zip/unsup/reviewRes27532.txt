My husband and I were shocked -- SHOCKED -- that this place didn't have 5 stars on Yelp. Shame on you reviewers for giving 1 star because you're too lazy to plan ahead with a reservation or because you didn't check to see if they could accommodate an allergy. I have to say that this was probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Ever. My husband made a reservation a couple months in advance and it was totally worth the wait. The salsas that came with the chips were amazing. Margaritas - so delicious. Each drink was great in its own way. Highly recommend the carne asada... I am drooling remembering it. The duck in mole sauce was also incredible (but the mole is very subtle, so don't destroy your mouth with the habanero salsa before eating it, like my husband did). It was a pricey meal but amazing for a special occasion.
