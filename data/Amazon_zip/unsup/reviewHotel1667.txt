Stayed here for the 4th of July weekend. PROS - - PET FRIENDLY (at no extra charge) - walking distance to a 7/11 (that sells hard alcohol!) - 10 minute walk away from The Bean and Willis Tower - cabs are always available - free wine everyday at the lobby from 5pm to 6pm - friendly staff - easy to find - 2 blocks from the O'Hare train line (Clark/Lake station) - decent room prices (we paid $110/night) via http://Hotels.com - free internet access - they have a "recyclables" trash can in the bedrooms! go green! :) CONS -  - the non-suite bedrooms are notably small. - bathroom mirror area is very small as well. only one person at a time.  - Room walls are very thin. We were able to hear our neighbors' conversations and their tvs! we were also awakened by people having conversations in the hallway. good thing we weren't in the room that often! - no mini fridge - ice machines NOT available on every floor - on demand movies are $18.99! I'd stay here again, but I'd definitely book a larger room (i.e. a suite)
