This is the place where I found out I like sushi, and it's still my favorite place for sushi in Chicago. Their tuna nigiri beats all. They also have an amazing selection of seafood appetizers and entrees, and this chocolate-ladyfinger-mascarpone dessert that is to die for. Along with my tuna and yellowtail, I usually get either the garlic griddled shrimp or a Maryland crab cake (Shaw's actually knows how to prepare them well!). The boyfriend usually tries some type of the fresh fish, but is also known to get the lounge sampler--the garlic shrimp, scallops and a crab cake (I believe). Expensive, but worth it.
