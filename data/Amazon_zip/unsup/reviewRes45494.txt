Love the library with fireplace and my first dinner there we were lucky enough to be seated in the library. Steak was excellent, as was the wine. Service is always friendly, fast and attentive. Great place to meet friends for drinks and appetizers before going out or heading home. The Good: The decor is surprisingly spacious nice. The place is huge and you will never guess this from the outside. Good selection of bar foods, great Ribs and burgers, and a pretty broad selection of beers. The Bad: Loud as a rodeo. VERY crowded at times. Don't come here to propose but it could make breaking up easier. LOL.
