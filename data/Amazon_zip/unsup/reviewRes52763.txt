90 Miles has just become my new Cuban favorite (sorry Cafe Laguardia, we had such a good run....I think it's time we see other people). Delicioso! Great ambiance, authentic food, intimate setup....I'm sold! We started with the Empanadas (which you get a nice list of options). I had the shrimp dinner plate and my date had the chicken. The plantains were the best I've ever tasted. Hearty portions, and most important, BYOB!!! The staff was great, super attentive but not pushy or hovering over my table. I don't have too many other descriptive words to say but if you haven't been here yet, you are doing your stomach a disservice. Love!
