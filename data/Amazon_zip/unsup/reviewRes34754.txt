Sushi X is now my fav sushi establishment!! I took my 12 year old son who loved watching the anime movie projecting on the wall and he enjoyed the miso soup, edamame and spicy tuna roll. We also had the Megatron and spicy shrimp roll..all incredibly tasty! This place is a must visit! Amazing food, vibe, decor and music! Go today!
