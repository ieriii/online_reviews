I went here EXTREMELY hungry at 10:00pm...NOT a good idea. Although the food was excellent, it was soooo slow. I am not sure if that is because I was starving or because everything was made fresh but even our sweet server could not keep our wine filled or check on us enough!  I did enjoy the fresh pasta dishes very much and would definately go back for the patio because inside seating was nothing fabulous.  Also they had fresh figs. Rare and I love that. But when I go to a restaurant I want my water and wine filled constantly and frequent checking on's- but maybe that's just me! Regardless, food was delicious.
