The chocolate cupcakes were dry! I was so excited to try this place because of all the great reviews, so I picked up a bunch of cupcakes for dessert for a dinner party I was attending. I was embarrassed as I bit into a chocolate cupcake and it was very dry. I worriedly looked around at the other dinner guests' faces and apologized. If you're a bakery and you can't give me a good chocolate cupcake, and there are a lot of other bakeries in Chicago... well, I'm glad you appear to have enough loyal fans that you don't need my business.
