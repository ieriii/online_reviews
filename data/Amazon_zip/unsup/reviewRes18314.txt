I'm writing this review to add to the 1300 plus reviews it's received. Xoco is truly one of the best Mexican restaurants you'll ever go to in Chicago, not only is the food organic and FRESH, you can taste everything when combined and continue humming 'mmmmmmmmmm' forever. I can't tell you where to begin- practically ALL their sandwiches are beyond delicious, my mouth is watering thinking about it! The combination carb, veg and protein is spectacular. The menu is designed by a celebrity Chef Rick Bayless and that tells you why you're in for a treat. If you plan to visit, don't forget the following: 1. The chocolate drink - you'll never find it anywhere, it's raw and beautiful! 2. The Chimichiri sauce - you'll never find anything this good anywhere either! 3. For a sweet tooth, try their vanilla sundaes- oh my god! 4. Don't leave the restaurant without an order of soup and sandwich, share if necessary. Their food portions are also quite healthy and they don't waste on food decoration like salads or fries- stuff that people usually leave and waste.
