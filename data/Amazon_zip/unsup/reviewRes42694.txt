Been here three times so far, and all three times were absolutely fantastic! The food is wonderfully priced, and full-on delicious. Duck liver pate? Un-freaking-real. I die, literally from the duck fat clogging my arteries, and figuratively from the feeling of self actualization that washes over with each bite....oh God, I can't talk about it anymore. The drinks are creative and the bartenders/mixologists are educated and passionate. They are actually cool convo too. Great wine selection, too. Loving the dark ambiance, and lots of good looking patrons.  Make it a point to have this place on repeat.
