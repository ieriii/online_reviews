One of my favorite burgers in Chicago. The veggie burger is insane - definitely try the Sage Francis. I've been to a lot of places that boast a beer list, and I honestly think this is the longest one by far. They even have beer cocktails (too nervous to try one yet). My hint would be to go on a weekday, I've never had an issue getting great service or a nice table on a Wednesday night. Tried to take my boyfriend on a Friday night at 8ish - what a joke, line was almost out the door! Good for them, not great for us who were too hungry to wait. I think Bad Apple is doing everything right, keep it up!
