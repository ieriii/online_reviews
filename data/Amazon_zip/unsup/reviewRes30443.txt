I called to make a reservation. The guy who answered told me no, they wouldn't take a reservation for 2, and that they open at 5 and I should probably line up outside by 4:30. The way he acted was so douchy that I won't go back here. The food and drinks are fine, just fine. Not good, great, etc. I think Zapatista and Zocolo are just as good if not better.
