Even though this place is big..it looks so cozy. I walked in and instantly fell in love with the atmosphere. A restaurant/bar but it has fireplaces and cute booths and of course the library/book area. They had plenty of space for big groups. The place was completely full and definitely a variety of people & even families. Because we were a big group service was a bit slow...but we didn't mind since we knew the place was packed. Their food options are a bit limited. Regular bar food like appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta & burgers. Their drink list was longer...haha. Their soups come with irish soda bread which was delicious! I ordered a side dish of their Mac & Cheese (Oh my their side dish is huge!) after hearing about it....it was good but too greasy for my liking. I also had their grilled asparagus side dish which was amazing!! Their steak salad was well liked by most of my friends. We all enjoyed our food but didn't think it was anything special. Overall this place is fun to be at..however don't expect to have a nice conversation because it was pretty loud and the food is just average.
