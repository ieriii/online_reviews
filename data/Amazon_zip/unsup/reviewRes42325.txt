Finally, I HAD IT :) I was so skeptical when Time Out had it as their #1 deep dish last year because I had never had it and was having a love affair with Peqouds last year. Top 3 deep dish on my list after Gino's East and Peqouds; all of which I enjoy for different reasons. AOP is amazing. My bf liked it so much that we ordered it twice in one week. The best part it that they give you a lot of toppings. I also appreciate that even when you have it delivered, it comes steaming hot. The cheese is good and it has just the right amount of sauce. The supreme salad (I think that's what it's called) is also very good with the Italian dressing.
