There were four in our party and all of us were impressed. For starters the truffled egg toast was outstanding. The anchovies were good, which made them second best. Not a bad start to the lunch time meal. The entrees were all four very good. We had the Riccio, the risotto, the giant ravioli, and the spaghetti with pepper. We also had an order of the Focaccia and it was amazing. None of us have ever seen bread dough rolled that thin and it was delicious. There were very good wine selections (and we had several quartinos) and the pricing was fair for a restaurant. I'm not sure the bottle pricing earns the $7 dollar mandatory corkage fee and this probably deserves some research. I think I will go open a bottle now!
