LOVE!! Cute atmosphere, attentive AND friendly service, hot hand towels pre-dinner, reasonable prices, and GOOD sushi (nearly impossible to find). Mexican, Kani Chung (LOVED), spicy tako, & something else, plus several nigiri. Excellent flavors & presentations, and the rolls were small with 8pieces, not gargantuan slop that fall apart or loaded with cream cheese & fake shit. And you can TASTE the flavors! Most sushi is loaded full of garbage that sounds like Americanized deliciousness (we're so fucking ignorant), but tastes like nothing. Not here! Only drawback is $5 corkage fee for 6pack of beer.
