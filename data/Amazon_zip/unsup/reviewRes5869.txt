The food was absolutely delicious. My whole group and I were eating off of each other's plates the whole time. Get the pizza della terra. It will blow your mind. One downside: im not sure if they were short staffed or not but the service was lacking. Other tables including ourselves had to wait to get noticed by the server. But the food is worth the wait.
