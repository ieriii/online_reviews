I went to Frontera years ago and was not impressed. However, I thought I'd give it another shot. My colleagues and I recently went for a celebration lunch. We started out with appetizers and ordered our entrees. The appetizers came pretty quickly. However, after 15-20 minutes, our appetizers were removed from the table. Although we still had food left, we assumed that our entrees were about to be served and the staff needed to make room. Twenty minutes later, I approached the waiter and asked about the status of our food. He said he put in our order right away and had no control over the kitchen. I told him I understood and asked about the status of our appetizers that were taken away. He said he didn't know about that and was busy. When our food did come, half othe dishes seemed to be rushed as the 3 fish orders were rough and did not seem cooked enough. Since we had already been at lunch for an hour before receiving our entrees, it did not seem worthwhile to ask them to re-cook our dishes. Due to that, most of us left our food untouched. The waiter did not even bat an eye and rushed us our check as our plates were cleared. I am more than willing to wait for good food and understand that restaurants become very busy and it's hard to please everyone. However, I think our servers could have easily made our experience a bit better than feeling like I just wasted $150 on lunch.
