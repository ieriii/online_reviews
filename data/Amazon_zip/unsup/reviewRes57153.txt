I loved it, such bright colors!I had the ropa vieja appetizer which was amazing and then the pernil which was pretty good as well. My friend had the guatamalen-chicken and it was delicious as well. Definitely going back to try some more dishes. PLUS they're green! They use sustainable products and try to get most of their ingredients from local vendors.
