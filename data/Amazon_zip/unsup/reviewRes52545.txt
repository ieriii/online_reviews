I love the salad bar at this place just as much as the meat. The mushroom risotto is right up there with risotto I've had in Italy. I usually end up eating too much from the salad bar and not leaving enough room for meat, but that's ok because there's only so much meat I can eat without having something else to wash it down with. My favorite meat selections are the top sirloin, the filet wrapped in bacon, and the chicken wrapped in bacon, you just can't go wrong when meat is wrapped in more meat! Also love the cooked pineapple. Salad bar has great deli meats, cheeses, olives, garlic, salads, etc... You really can't beat the lunch price-$20 for all the meat you can eat and anything you want from the salad bar. And valet is FREE during lunch! Haven't been here for dinner yet because I can't afford their dinner prices, but they have some added selections including lobster and shrimp for dinner. Service is friendly--the gauchos who bring you the meat are super friendly and love to please, all you have to do is look at them and they come running to you. Frankly, they should get rid of the waiters, I'd rather tip the gauchos directly. I've had more than one pushy waiter there who tried to get us to order drinks or dessert or something else on top of the lunch buffet. As if eating a whole buffet is not enough--I'm not ordering anything else so you can get a fatter tip!
