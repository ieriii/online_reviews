I would not stay at this hotel again. I can't believe that this place is still actually considered a hotel. The decor of the place is very similar to the decorations at the tower of terror at California Adventure in Disneyland. Only it looked more rugged. Random bleach stains on the carpet. The place was cheap but not worth the price. There was no water in the pool. The website does not even mention anything about the closing of the cafe that is supposedly on the site. All the amenities were older than old. The bed was more than uncomfortable. It was actually dipping in the middle. Pillows weren't fluffy. There is wifi only in the lobby. There are no places within the hotel to print boarding passes. On the upside, though, maid services were very thorough in keeping the hallways and the rooms clean. Fromt desk personnel were nice, too. And it was only minutes away from the airport.
