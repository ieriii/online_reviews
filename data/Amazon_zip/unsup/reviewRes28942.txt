I just recently moved and this is one place I miss the most. It was our Sunday night staple - I would always order the cappelini pomodoro (sp?) with extra mozzarella along with the mixed green salad. I've tried to order similar entrees at other restaurants, but they all disappoint and don't hold a candle to Pasta Bowl! They have great thin crust pizza and my husband loves their chicken farfalle. I've tried a few other things - but I always go back to my usual. The staff is very friendly and their delivery is always served hot - even if it takes 45 mins from when you order. I would definitely bring any friends here that want a cheap lunch or dinner!!
