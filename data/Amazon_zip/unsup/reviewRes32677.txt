Sunda does not live up to the hype. Hostesses were extremely snobby and rude. Dining room is so loud we repeatedly had to ask our waitress to speak up. Our group is full of twenty-somethings that eat out and go out a lot, and Sunda falls short to so many of the other "Hot Spot" restaurants on Open Table. There's probably a reason you can make a reservation one day ahead. Billy Dec of Rockit falls short on this one. Food didn't make up for the awful service.
