Came for the first time for brunch. I liked the decor; really funky but not too bright for those hangover mornings! The wait seemed like it would be really really long but we were seated within 5 minutes (about 20 people waiting but we were a mere party of 2) Lots of typical brunch choices; I had a special which was red velvet pancakes with some sort of creme anglaise on top with strawberry sauce drizzled or something...it was pretty but VERY rich (which would have been expected). The creme seemed to be slightly cream cheese based which made it thick and sort of tart. Of 2 pancakes I could only eat one. Smoothies seem to be their thing--choices of mango, blueberry, strawberry, banana etc. and pick up to 3 of your choice. Lots of people around us getting them; had a sip of my friend's and it was good. I could see coming back for a later meal but because I don't live in the neighborhood I think theres a lot more similar places for brunch.
