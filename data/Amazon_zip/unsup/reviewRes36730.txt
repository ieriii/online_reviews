Ill start with saying i would have given indie 4 stars if i had reviewed it before they switched to serving instead of being byob no fee. im sure some people will like the new alcohol menu better but not i, spent one friday night there with the girlfriend, brought a bottle of wine ate 60$ worth of sushi, walked next door to dominicks and grabbed a second bottle to continue and round it off to a nice 100$ sushi meal. It was an expensive meal but we were there for almost 2 hours. The food is great and the sushi is well above average.  They have large windows lining the walls that face the street, so if you go in the winter be prepared and have a sweater.
