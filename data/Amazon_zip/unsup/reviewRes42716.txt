Why doesn't every pizza have smoked gouda? The crust was perfectly crispy even after re-heating, the delivery was right on time, and the sauce is quite tasty. And the variety of their pizzas will definitely keep me coming back to try them all. I got the five cheese, which after being vegan for a week reminded me why I could never be vegan for real. I also tried the garlic knots which were amazing and super garlicky (which I love) but they were covered in oil, which was super tasty but make sure you have napkins and aren't on a diet! I can't believe it has taken me this long to finally try it and I will most definitely be ordering again.
