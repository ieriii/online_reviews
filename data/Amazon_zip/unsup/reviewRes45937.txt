Why do I love Grand Lux? I know it's just a massive tourist restaurant, but the food is actually good. It's a bit pricey, but you'll get tons of food for the amount of money you spend. I can never finish anything that I order because there is just too much food.  The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated - there are a lot of dark colors and velvet everywhere. There's really great window seating that overlooks Michigan Ave., which is great for people watching. There's always a wait for lunch and dinner (at the rush times), so prepare to stand in the lobby for at least 20 or 30 minutes. Honestly, though, it's worth it. I've never had an issue with the service - their servers have always been very professional, nice, prompt and they remember everything. The food is absolutely fantastic. I especially appreciate their vegetarian dishes (like the Portabella Mushroom Sandwich or homemade Black Bean Veggie Burger - mmmmmmmmmmm). The desserts are also excellent. They have everything from cookies to cake to creme brulee to cheesecake. They're owned by the Cheesecake Factory, after all... The Dolce de Leche cheesecake is by far my favorite (and you can get it at Cheesecake Factory, too).
