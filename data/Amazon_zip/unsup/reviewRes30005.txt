This is a 5+ review. I have been coming here for years since one of my best friends from high school went vegan. It has become our go to catch up spot. They just serve great food (not just great vegan food). The sandwiches are tasty (reuben and dagwood leading the charge), and the shakes are to die for (cookie dough peanut butter!!). That said, the "steak" and eggs at brunch may be my favorite thing on the menu...I really need to head back again soon.
