I went last night using a Groupon. I was meaning to check it out anyway -- who doesn't like burgers? As far as ambiance, the place is pretty small; but we went at 7:00 on a Friday night and had no problem getting a table. The prison theme is pretty stupid. They play heavy metal music, and have some heavy metal videos and sports games playing on the flat screen TVs that line the walls. There's a little lofted area with some dolls/puppets set up to look like corpses sitting at a table ??? Definitely not a girl place. Drinks: Beer. (thank goodness I could get a Magners) Service: Good. Waitress was attentive and pleasant (at least she didn't have to follow the theme and act like a prison warden or something). Food: Good, not great. Appetizer menu seemed pretty standard - chicken wings, cheese dip, sliders, etc. Everything of course has a prison-themed name, or something related to crime. Each burger has the option to be made with Angus beef, turkey burger, veggie or buffalo. My husband and I each got a buffalo patty. I would go back just for this option. He ordered the Buffalo Bill - topped with a quail egg. It must have been pretty good, because I wasn't even offered a bit. I ordered the Punk Bitch - which was topped with prosciutto and Gruyere. I ate the entire thing. It was cooked perfectly. And served on a pretzel bun (swoon). Sides are either fries, mac 'n cheese or salad - I went with the salad, which was basic mixed greens and a ginger vinaigrette. I'd go back for one of the daily specials, since this place isn't too far from me. Not sure that I would make it a regular thing though. I'm not really into metal, sports or beer, but I do like a good burger.
