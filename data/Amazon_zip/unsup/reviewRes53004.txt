This location is the bigger of the two locations that they have - definitely come here if you have a bigger party or want more of a real restaurant experience (versus an order and eat at the counter type of place like the other location on clybourn). My friend and I decided to split the Media Noche sandwich and the Bistec entree. Both were pretty solid but nothing too different from other Cuban places I've been to. The yucca fries with garlic sauce on the other hand was unbelievable! Not as heavy as regular fries and the garlic sauce was muy delicious. Just wished they gave a bigger portion with the sandwich though. Definitely recommend getting the guanabana shake (I think its a mix of guava and banana?). This place had good food, cheap prices and a great fun environment for a girls' night out! Would definitely come back and try something different! :)
