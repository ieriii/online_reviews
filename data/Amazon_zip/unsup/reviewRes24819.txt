I've given this joint 2 tries. I loved the food the first time (dinner tasting menu). The dates are AMAZING, and everyone at the table really liked or loved everything we had. Second time around (same 2 people with me), we really liked the food as well - the dishes are perfectly cooked and seasoned, and are interesting. The thing that made all of us resolve to never go back is the service. We easily waited 45 minutes to even get things started at dinner on our first visit, and easily waited 30 minutes today for lunch. In both of these instances, the restaurant was half full, at best. Add on top of that the issues we've had with advertised specials. On our first trip, my friend checked in with foursquare and was told that a sangria special for $1.99 was available. She ordered that, but got nothing but attitude from the bartender. The same thing happened today. Don't advertise an offer only to have your staff impose a number of conditions that are not specified anywhere in the offer. Similarly, on our first visit, there was a special menu of which our server (and apparently the chef) knew nothing. That menu was also advertised as available online. We ended up having a really good meal, but not until we sat there and waited, and waited and waited for the server to figure things out. The service is seriously sub-par here, and on neither occasion have our servers had any excuse for being as inattentive and uninformed as they have been. Chicago is full of so many great restaurants where both the food and the service meet expectations. The three of us will not be back to Mercat, which is a serious shame because the food deserves better.
