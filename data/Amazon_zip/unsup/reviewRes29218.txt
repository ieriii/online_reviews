Seriously, food was amazing. Took a while to get seated - but it's Rick Bayless' restaurant... Anyway, they have some excellent beers and wines to go with their amazing food. I had slow-roasted pork and the wife had one of the special steaks. We both loved them. Most surprising, however, were the desserts. Wonderful. Don't forget them.
