I ordered the sea food plate... let me just say, it wasn't just a plate. It was a big gigantour platter of seafood and another plate of angel hair pasta. It was delicious and lasted for about 3 days, from bringing back the left overs we couldn't eat.  I kind of wish the waitress could've told me how many that platter could feed. I was expecting enough food for one. It was enough food for 5, maybe 6. Will go again, to try their other plates (for a single stomach, that is).
