Since I am Italian and have experienced authentic food in Italy, I am really hard on Italian food. I almost never eat it at restaurants because it's typically the usual lame, boring pasta. I have to say I was impressed by Caro Mio. Its main detraction is the price (~$20 for a pasta dish is a bit ridic, IMO), but the dishes my friends and I had were full of flavor. The portions are HUGE, so the fact that you get another meal out of the leftovers almost makes up for the cost. I ate some ziti with tomato-based sauce with pancetta, onion, homemade meatballs and Italian sausage. It was absolutely delicious. I am pretty sad that the bussers mixed up my leftovers with my friend's...I got stuck eating her pappardelle with bolognese the next day (it was okay, but not as good as mine). A friend had the gorgonzola gnocchi. Too rich for me to order, but it tasted excellent just the same. Anyway, the place is small, so make reservations if you can. We were fortunate to be seated without one, but the folks behind us weren't so lucky.
