This was the first restaurant I visited when I moved to Chicago back in 2007. It had the perfect atmosphere for a European gal's heart: coffee, bakery and spanakopita smells all combined into one, housed in a very comfortable and homey setting! It is still to this day one of my favorite hide outs, and I can highly recommend it.
