Opart is one of 10 Thai places in a 1 mile radius of Lawrence and Western, but it is the only one you need to know about. Affordable, delicious, and fast food is served, covering an array of classic Thai dishes. It's ambience is surprisingly cozy and welcoming, considering the street view coming into the restaurant. This is a great place for a quick meal, a weekday lunch, or all-around great value Thai food.
