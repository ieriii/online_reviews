I've been here for dinner and brunch, and both times left with a happy stomach. The first time around the fellas and I came here for a pre-bachelor party dinner. After initially being told we had an hour wait for our group of 10, the host was able to work some magic and sat us at two adjacent booths in about 35 minutes. Sweet. The crew had nothing but rave reviews about their burgers, and I thoroughly enjoyed my tasty, perfectly cooked pork chop. We also had a few fantastic pizzas at the table, very flavorful topping combinations and a perfectly crisp crust. Their beers are a must try, I was partial to the Cross of Gold and Double Fist. My brunch experience was just as good. This time around I had the awesome Pork Belly Sandwich. There was a generous helping of tender, tasty pork belly and it was topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg. Now that's what I call the breakfast of champions. My wife's Pancetta Biscuits and Gravy was another great breakfast dish. The spice from the Italian sausage was a nice flavor twist from the traditional use of breakfast sausage.   Service is excellent as well. The wait staff is attentive, and keeps a relaxed and casual atmosphere. They don't take reservations, so I'd definitely recommend coming early if you have a large group. From the food to the craft beers, Rev Brewing continues to grow as one of my favorite gastropubs in the city and is definitely worth a visit.
