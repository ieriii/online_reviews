It was the first time I would take my husband to Irazu to eat Costa Rican Food. Per my husband, the waitress was great, but it took 45 minutes to get a "shrimp" meal prepared and delivered to us. We had ordered Yuca (boiled) for appetizer and that was under cook. When the Shrimp dinner came to the table, the rice was under cook also. We did not eat and left our food there. My husband asked for the owner but a manager listen to his complaint. How would you try to keep your customers coming back? Sorry sometimes just doesn't cut it. You would think they would want to make it up in some way. Each time I have been there, it was always busy. People get tired of "The kitchen is backed up" (remember that quote when you go there..I've heard it each time I've been there.). Will my husband go back, I doubt it. Will I? Probably to talk to the owner and let him know face to face of my experience.
