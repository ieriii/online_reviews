I'm a little surprised this has been ranked the best Neapolitan style pizza in the city. While the sauce and cheese (and sausage) were all pretty good, the crust did not get it done. I remember Italian pizza being much crunchier and less, as the GF put it, pita like. Granted it's been almost six years since I was lucky enough to be in Italy, but it didn't seem as authentic as I remember (and yes I know that memories are fickle). While I wasn't expecting a cracker like crust, it was still too chewy for me. However, I did like the fact that I had to use a fork and knife for most of the pizza, just as it should be. And if I'm back in Italy in the near future and realize that my memory has failed me, I'll change my raking to four stars. Another issue is that the place feels a tad too big and almost chain like, while it was only half full being a Tuesday night, I thought the atmosphere was generic. This is bad, it just is what it is. They could also use a few cheaper bottles of wine on the menu... I didn't want to spend 40 bucks on wine and then 13 dollar a pop on the pizzas. The math didn't work for me.
