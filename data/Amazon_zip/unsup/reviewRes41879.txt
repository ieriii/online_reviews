Took my wife there for her birthday. We hadn't been there in years - we live in the city but just had forgotten about these guys. OMG - we won't do that again. Went on a Monday evening about 5:30p - quiet so we could enjoy our dinner and actually hear one another to talk. Booked the reservation on line--seated instantly, service was excellent--attentive, courteous, helpful but just enough distance to not be obtrusive. I had the Kansas City Bone-In Rib Eye while my wife has the NY Strip.  Both were incredible. Cook to order, and were like butter. Gotta have the sides of Garlic Mash and Creamed Spinach. They even surprised my wife with a little chocolate dessert complete with candle--we had to take half our entrees home since so much food. We were there about 2 hours and it was a perfect evening. Highly recommend--great bar too.
