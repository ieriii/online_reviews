Neat king room layout with the bed in the middle of the room and a desk behind it near the window. I liked the iPod/iPhone speaker/charger dock. The bathroom was very nice, with a large edge-lit mirror that made it seem really upscale. My room had a safe and a mini-bar fridge. The TV was a decent LCD but the channels took forever to change there wasn't much variety. It felt like a 2011 TV with 1992 cable. It looks like all rooms offer a great view. The location is fantastic with lots nearby, including Navy Pier. There are two towers so make sure to go to the main entrance to check in (east tower). A pedestrian bridge connects them.
