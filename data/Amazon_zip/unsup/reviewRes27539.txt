I would recommend this place for anyone to try, but there are definitely better eat in the city. I actually like the previous place (Allen's) food better, and the decor was more interesting. I can't believe they destroyed all that wood work.  I had a great time trying the variety of dishes they have to offer. It definitely gets a 10 for originality . I was not impressed with the wait staff though. BLAH is the best description. The best thing that this place has going on for it is the popcorn that tastes like garlic bread, although I think we got last nights batch bc it was a lil stale. The scallops were cooked to perfection, but a few other things were just ok. Don't get the risotto (only Italians should make this dish) or the foie-gras rice krispie-At first bit I though it was good bc of all the flavors being thrown at you. Then it just got weird. The desserts was good (snickers bar), but nothing really jumped out at me. All in all, I really like the concept. I'm all about branching out and trying new things. I just think the hype for the place made you expect more. I don't doubt for one second that Graham Elliot is a wonderful chef...this one just didn't hit it out of the ballpark for me.
