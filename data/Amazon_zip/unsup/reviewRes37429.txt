Really? I am so the odd man out here. Maybe its just me. Well, I think it's apparent that it is just me. I work across the street from here, so I do maybe a once a month drop in to re-evaluate the Fox + Obel situation and give them another shot. Ok. Salad that has brown avocados. And brown lettuce on the edges. Tuna that is mostly liquid. Sauteed vegetables that taste like there is Windex in them.  Really? I just don't get it. Ok, I'm not going back anymore. I just wish I had an experience where spending that much money would be a "treat" rather then a regret.
