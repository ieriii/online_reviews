Really great. We went here for our anniversary. The service was outstanding. We had the five course tasting menu with the wine paring. We were going to go for the 10 but one of us is allergic to wheat so the waiter checked with the kitchen but unfortunately it could not be adapted to wheat free. That's ok though because the 5 course turned out to be perfect. They even specially printed a menu of what we had to eat, for our anniversary. Lastly the cocktails were superb. Would definitely go back!
