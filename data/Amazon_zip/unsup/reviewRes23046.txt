As my companion said their slogan should be: "Lao Szechuan: We'll ruin every other Chinese food experience you'll ever have." I'm never really satisfied with my chinese food experiences in Chicago. I have to say that I've tried not to venture far from the experiences that have pleased me and now I'm glad that someone made me go somewhere that wasn't on my radar. I love spicey and Lao Szechuan totally delivered. The Orange Chicken was intensely spicey the potstickers were amazing and the Szechuan String Beans were really delicious. I have to rave for a moment about Tony's Chicken with three Chili. It is the most amazing thing I have put in my mouth in a very long time. It's spicey popcorn Chicken.. it's heaven in your mouth. YOU MUST GET IT. I order you.
