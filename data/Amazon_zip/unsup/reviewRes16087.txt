I don't know how to feel about this place. On the one side, it reminds me a little too much of Hollywood. I appreciate the hand-made concoctions (even though at $12, they are a bit steep), and I appreciate the silly tall chairs and tiny tables, but.. who cares? On the other side, I am glad a places like this exist for when you really have something to celebrate, or a super special occasion and you need a $12 cocktail or two to commemorate. Its nicely done, and I'm glad I've experienced it, it just seems soooo not what Chicago is about. I feel like this place takes itself too seriously. Although the sign in the bathrooms with the "House Rules" def. should add a half a star. It needs more humor like that. Also, Jesus Christ, its difficult to read that gigantic menu with a tiny candle light. The waitress luckily was able to recommend something that I enjoyed (although she was a little spacey.). They put this gigantic block of solid ice in your drink and when you pull it out to examine (because you're 3 years old like me) and realize that you're paying $12 for about 4 oz of liquid, you feel a little dopey. Ha! For me, its a place like Kuma's or Giordano's. I'm not going to hang out there but its nice to know about in case you have to take someone there for a change of pace. Or a client. Or you want to impress your bourgeoisie in-laws.
