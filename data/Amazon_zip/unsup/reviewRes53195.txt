Just went here last Monday as I now live right down the street. Decor was fantastic. The patio is amazing, and the order-takers are supremely friendly. On to the food: gotta love the cheap prices, and the great sides. However, I was a little disappointed with my main dish. The Ropa vieja tasted like something my Mom would make..but don't get excited..she's German! I felt like it was a crock-pot recipie from the 1970's. My fiance loved the Cuban sandwich, on the plus side. I loved the plantains. I'll just have to try something different next time when it comes to the main course. I'll definitely give it another chance, as I enjoyed every other aspect of the restaurant. I think shoud you wander into this neighborhood, it's worth the time. It's about as inexpensive as the McDonald's nearby, and unlike McD's, you can bring beer to this place.
