I cannot say enough about their food. Many different varieties of delicious burgers and sandwiches to choose from.(The Pork-ketta and The Frenchie are a couple of my favorites.) Fries are wonderful, with all the different seasonings you can add to them. Cheese curds and the charcuterie are always solid options. The beer list is phenominal and always changing. Everytime I stop in there is something new and exciting to try on tap. The people behind the bar have a high beer IQ; so if you are unsure what to get, ask them and they'll steer you toward a couple of good choices. They have a nice little side dinning room as well where you can hang out and play some board games or shuffleboard when it is not too crowded. The only things to beware of is that it will get quite crowded on the weekends (but the wait is well worth it.) And they make their own ketchup; which I think is wonderful, but it may come as a little shock to the taste buds if you are only used to Heinz.
