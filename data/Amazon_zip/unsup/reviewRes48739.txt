Had brunch here when I landed in Chicago on a recent trip. I sat at the bar with just me and my iPad, and had wonderful service and a great meal.  The bloody mary was tasty, and the 4 oz kicker of one of their great beers didnt hurt at all. Try the kolsh, which goes really well with the spicy bloody. At the recommendation of the waiter, I had the soft-shell crab sandwich, with a great Remoulade and a couple slices of slightly sweet, crisp bacon, and some roasted fingerling potatoes. Really good...but the roll probably overwhelmed the smallish crab a bit.  All in all, I'd like to get back...no real time while I'm here but will try again in the future.
