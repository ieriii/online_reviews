I am a beer guy and this place definitely caters to someone like me.... A friday afternoon after work a buddy of mine said hey you wanna grab a beer...of course I was game. He had a bad day @ work and so did I so we thought we needed to get away from downtown. He told me about this place and how him and his girl enjoyed themselves here. Walked in and it was crowded as hell. It was a nice day out so the windows were open, but no window for us due to the crowd. We got a table near the back, by the window where the beer is being brewed. We started out with the wings which were mediocre @ best. For my actual meal I got the Tempeh Rueben which basically means not real corned beef...was good though. The beer selection was cool as I went with the Coup D'Etat ( Dry, spicy French-style saison abundantly dry-hopped with Spalt hops)...had 2 of them, good stuff!!!! Next I went with the Cross of Gold (Golden Ale) which was not as good as the Coup D'Etat, but still effective. My buddy is a member in some sort of club they have here. He was able to drink from a bigger mug than the rest of us. I intended to join this club as well, but was too drunk to remember once we left. I like this joint and definitely plan on returning!
