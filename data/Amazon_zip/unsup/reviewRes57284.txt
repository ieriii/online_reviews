I am continuing to review places I like in my new neighborhood. I like this place. Very good beer menu that is able to compete with other neighborhood bars. I have been there twice, and once the food we had was excellent! Great burger! The second time, the aps we had all seemed too salty, maybe it was me or an off day. I like the wine prices, and like that they have some French selections. The staff is fairly friendly. There are a lot of pretty impressive bars around this area so it is hard to really stand out. Bad apple is one of the better joints I have checked our recently and I will definitely be back even though last time I thought the food was just OK.
