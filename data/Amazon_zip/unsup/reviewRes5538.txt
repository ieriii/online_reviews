I really wanted to love this place. It sounded like a place I would frequent. Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience and a terrible meal - top ten of all time. I ate here during the summer around 630pm on a Monday, hot and humid w/a slight breeze. My friend and I got to the entrance of the restaurant, walk in, and the restaurant was full. Good sign, right? After looking around, we finally found the host stand which was home to a very rude hostess - not a good start. We sat outside. Our server finally came a little while later (we were considering leaving) and we ordered quite a bit of food. Our water glasses failed to be refilled for quite some time - usually not a problem, but with the long wait for everything in addition to the hot weather...it was the least that could happen. The people next to us left b/c they had waited so long for a server to attend to them. As for the food, it looked read well on the menu but was poorly executed. A lot of the dishes we got were pork - good right? Unfortunately, there was too much vinegar in the dishes...which kind of ruined them. That in addition to a lack of seasoning really made this meal lackluster. I plan on trying this place one more time and hopefully I can re-review this place a higher rating.
