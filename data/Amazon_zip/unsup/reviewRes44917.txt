The spinach stuffed pizza is by far my favorite pizza ever, however this location's wasn't as good as most of the giordanos I've had before. I don't know if that's bc of the sometimes crazy wait times or the pre ordering, but I ate a very average pizza here last time. If you get a chance, head to different Giordano...the ones in Oakbrook and Willowbrook are fanastic.
