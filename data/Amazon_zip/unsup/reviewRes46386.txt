Awesome! I went during the tree lighting festival and the wait was only 50 min plus they let you leave and come back, nice!! I ordered lemon chicken piccata and my friend had a BLT. Both dishes were excellent and they also have the best ranch EVER!! I liked the BLT better. The sandwich wasn't huge, but enough for one at least. The prices were like 10-12 per entree for lunch, about 5 bucks more for dinners. They have a cheap appetizer list which was nice. We also had the molten chocolate cake. BEST DESSERT EVER!!! Yum yum yum. Ask for extra strawberries!! WOnderful experience, you need to try it. I have to say though, it is just like the cheesecake factory on the inside but the food is much better :)
