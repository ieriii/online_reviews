My wedding has happened. It happened at the Carleton and it was fantastic. The most fantastic wedding I have ever been to; I am so proud to say it was mine. Annie Parker, special events coordinator extraordinaire, oversaw this event with care and love and attention to every detail - as if it were her own. Annie and I have gotten to know each other pretty well over the past year or so. I have emailed her daily for weeks at a time with silly questions and requests and advice and she has always responded with clear, thorough responses and always with our best interest in mind. The staff at The Carleton deserve some recognition. I had quite the crowd -- the most bottles ever consumed at one event. Yup, that's us! We had a few scenarios that would've thrown the average banquet staff off their game, but not this one! I can't say enough about the conscientious effort to make my wedding the best it can possibly be. The food was amazing -- we had chosen honey mustard crusted chicken, rib eye and salmon. All deserving high marks. All the guests that made mention of the food were pleasantly surprised with the quality AND quantity of these dishes. The rib eye was the most consumed entree and this piece of meat was something to be expected at a high end steak house. Very nice. Our room was beautiful, clean and large. We had 12 other guests booked at the hotel and all were pleased as well. Poor Phil's is the bar and grill which I have reviewed in the past, but will mention that they serve a great breakfast! Several guests enjoyed the morning after here.
