The best fried calamari in the city! Steaks that melt in your mouth! Fish that make you wonder why you ever eat anything else. Amazing salads, silky vegetables, potatoes that you will dream about. A great wine list at fair prices and expertly mixed cocktails. Desserts to die for, if you can save some room. Wonderful ambiance and an incredible aroma that is only Wildire. If I could eat at only one place for the rest of my life, it would be Wildfire.
