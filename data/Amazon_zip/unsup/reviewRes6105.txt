Take note: This review is by a non-meat eater. :) We went to Wildfire on our last night in Chicago on a recommendation from a friend. We got there around 8:30 on a Thursday night and it was packed! We were still seated right away and immediately served some yummy warm bread. Our server was super friendly and offered some great recommendations to these two out of towners. Appetizer: Cheese Crusted Portabello Mushrooms- Two huge mushroom caps filled with spinach and a nice crusty cheese Meal: Swordfish London Broil- Great flavor on the tomatoes and onions. The swordfish had a little too much char on it for my taste but it was still pretty tender and yummy. Bone-In Filet- I didn't eat any of this but I watched as my partner in crime re-enacted the scene from The Great Outdoors. He ate all of it and loved every minute of it! No review on the dessert because I felt like any minute I was going to explode from our meals. If I lived in Chicago, this would be a regular stop for me!
