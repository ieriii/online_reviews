I used to live 4 blocks down the street from Hopleaf. One of my fondest bar-hopping memories in Chicago is going to Hopleaf at 2:30am, right before closing, with a friend who had just flown in from California. The Hopleaf ain't that place anymore. I haven't spent any money there since about 2008, but I've tried to go back a few times. Last time, I was told that there would be a ***SIX HOUR WAIT*** for a table. What's up with that? Not worth the effort, crowds, and attitude. Beer list is still good, but, thanks largely to the influence of the Hopleaf, many other bars have started carrying decent selections of Belgian beers. So there's that, at least. Hopleaf has some tough business issues that they should confront if they care about their long-term patrons. Are you still a bar, or are you an elite dining establishment like Alinea? You can't be a *BAR* if there's never space for your patrons. And you can't be *FINE DINING* if your customers have to elbow through a crowd to get to the restaurant. But the national fame has gone to their head, apparently. Who needs to satisfy the neighborhood customers when you have the entire city willing to wait hours?
