Overpriced, mediocre service, Salad bar had many items but was lower quality. Lobster Bisque was off. On a positive note the Goat cheese was delicious as was the baby tomatoes and mozzarella. The sushi had an ammonia smell, yuck. The meat. I really liked the bottom sirloin(skirt steak) everything else was WAY over salted and I like salt, believe me. I did eat a lot of skirt steak, it was cooked perfectly but I came here to try a lot not just one thing. The server brought cheese bread, fried bananas and garlic mashed potatoes. Bread was very dry, garlic mashed was dry and over garlic-ed, and the bananas were wonderful, had 3 helpings. This was our first and last visit. We will NOT be back again. After eating i felt like i cheated on Brazzaz, i won't cheat again I promise.. The inside is beautiful and the wine angel is cool, but aesthetics does not a great restaurant make. Good food is needed, sadly Texas De Brazil is severely lacking. I have been to Brazzaz 20+ times over the last 4 years. I won't stray again. Service one star (good at first, quickly waned to bad) Food one star (quality and value) Decor and ambience 4 stars. (it's really nice in there)
