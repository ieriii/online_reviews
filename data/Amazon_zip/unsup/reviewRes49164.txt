After hearing all about those stupid red velvet cupcakes I was obsessed and had to have one. So I made my hubby drive up there tonight with me, I bought 2 of them, and also a carrot cake cupcake and a lemon bar. So far I've only tried the one red velvet cupcake, and it was great! The cream cheese frosting is divine! I don't know about the rest of the stuff in the box, but I'm sure it will be great!!
