This is a microbrewery & pizza place, that gives it 3 stars before you even go in. They had about 8 of their brews, between us we tried about 6, all were good. We went with a couple of small pizza's a red & a BBQ. They were both very good. We had the goat cheese appetizer that was very good as well. We were there on a weeknight so no real wait. Very good beer & za! I will be back.
