I'm really stoked on this place. I walked over here with my girl after dinner in the area. This place is pretty much perfect. Dim lighting, very old style Chicago vibe, fantastic bartenders (Joe is pretty much the man). We sat at the bar and perused the menu for a second and then, half joking, I asked Joe is he could make an Elk's Own. Challenge accepted. He not only knew the cocktail I spoke of, but he also made it fantastically. In all seriousness though, the bartenders are all great and this is, fur sure, a cocktail bar. Don't come in here and order a Stoli red bull, because they don't have Stoli and they surely don't have energy drinks. Do yourself a favor and get a sazerac or negroni or something.The food was also really good. I highly suggest that you try the cornbread. It's amazing. I can't wait to go back and try this place again on a weeknight when it's a bit calmer.
