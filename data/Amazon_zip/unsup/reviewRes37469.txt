I went here and greatly enjoyed my time here. The food is great, and you can drink wine and beer in the cafe, paying grocery store prices. Sweet! However, due to a mix up on this issue, my credit card was fraudulently overcharged. Now, it was only $2, but still. This was my first time here, and I wasn't sure if this was a common thing or not. After contacting management, the issue was quickly resolved, and they sent me a $35 gift card. Due to that, I'll definitely be back. And I would probably be going back anyway.
