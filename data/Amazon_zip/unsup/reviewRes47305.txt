It was a rainy Sunday and bloody marys were calling our name. Fortunately, we had a Groupon and Lockdown had $4 bloody marys. Perfect! Our server, Michelle, was really nice and took it in stride when we switched tables to avoid the iceberg conditions near the front window. Since our Groupon stipulated that we order some food, we decided to check out the menu. My husband decided he couldn't pass up a burger called Cruelty to Animals, and well, the Punk Bitch was calling my name. I have 2 words: Pretzel Bun. So good! My medium rare was cooked perfectly and the bloody marys were delicious. There's definitely enough food to take home for another meal. I think we'll be back. The burgers were as good as that other place on Belmont and we didn't have to queue up around the corner to get in. WIN!
