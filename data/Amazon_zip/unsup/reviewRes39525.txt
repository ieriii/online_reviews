I was really not excited about eating here - all I had heard about Korean bbq was that you end up smelling terrible and the food is strange... San Soo Gab San however, had such tasty food that it easily made up for it! We came with a group of 15 people, and the service was extremely accommodating - they had our table ready, and were always attentive to our needs (beer, water, napkins, etc...) Because we had a large group, we let the waitress just bring us the group special, which included all sorts of small plates (mostly veggies and seafood), a seafood omelet, some sort of wonton, and glorious, glorious meats. Let me take a moment to talk about the meats themselves: 1) Marinated Beef - this was absolutely amazing. Small strips of tender beef, that cook very quickly on the hot grill 2) Spicy Pork - This was our group's favorite item. Unfortunately, they only gave us two plates worth, so there wasn't exactly enough to go around 3) Marinated Chicken - Very tasty, but again, only two plates for the entire group. 4) Short Ribs - Forgettable - even the ethnic Korean group next to us left them off the grill. These were not meant to be grilled. Okay, back to the small plates - they hand out a ton of small plates, the only problem is that you have no idea what anything is. Now, personally, I'm all for exploring, but I think a sheet of paper helping to explain everything wouldn't be the worst idea in the world. Overall, I gave this place 3 stars, mainly due to the fact that our large group all left hungry, due to the small portions of meats. We paid $40 each (including a few beers), so our bill wasn't exactly small either. In addition, I would have liked a bit more info on what we were being served, so at least I know what it was that I really liked/disliked. I would certainly come here again, as the meats were all delicious, and our group had a lot of fun...
