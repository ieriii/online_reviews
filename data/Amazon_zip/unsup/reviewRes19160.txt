Imagine the best Mexican street food you ever wanted, plus ridiculously efficient, friendly, five-star service with a smile. A smile! Like the people work there on purpose! Everyone will tell you about the great food at XOCO, and I absolutely agree!  What stands out for me, however, is the quality of the people who greet you, take your order, prepare all that delicious food and...now get this...seem to enjoy themselves! Cudos to Rick Bayless for bringing this jewel...and this wonderful staff... to River North.
