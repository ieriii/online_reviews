Although a bit out of the way (i.e. Greek-town), Meli is well worth the trip from Streeterville on a Saturday or Sunday for brunch. Parking was a bit complicated, but plenty of metered parking about three blocks away. Try to be any lazier, and you'll have to pay for parking in the lots which can damper this otherwise great brunch spot. The service was prompt and VERY EFFICIENT. Within 10 minutes of ordering, my Rocky Omelette was right in front of me. The potatoes were perfectly cooked and the eggs they used made the omelettes so fluffy. Even the toast and jam was something to savor. As long as the roads don't ice in the near future, I will be headed back.
