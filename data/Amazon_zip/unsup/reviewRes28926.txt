I forgot I had negatively reviewed Pequods in the past. Their delivery continues to be horrible but eating at the restaurant is amazing. Their pizza is one of the best in the city. Both the deep dish and the thin crust are so good (although I dont love the burnt cheese edges like everyone else does). So good. Love eating at Pequods. Worth the wait.
