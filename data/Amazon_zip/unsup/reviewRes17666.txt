good lunch menu, reasonable price, but seafood's not as fresh as I expected from the fine dinning restaurant, may be ..lunch here's quite cheap, as a designer, I was surprise with the decor, amazing colors, reminded me to Opera which is from the same owner, anyway, it was a good time having lunch there, I'd go back for dinner.
