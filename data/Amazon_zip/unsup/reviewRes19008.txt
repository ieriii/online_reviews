I'm totally on board with the reviewer who said he wished there was a 2.5 stars rating. We went here last Friday night for dinner and were just plain underwhelmed by the whole experience. Coming in at 6:15, we were treated to the squeeze through the bar full of people happy houring - there has to be a better way to seat people than to make us do that mess. Then we get to basically sit on top of everyone around us - at this point, just make communal tables and be done with the pretense. We settled down and ordered. I was thrilled to be able to get both Magners and a Sophie. I started with the oysters and the husband ordered the fried chicken livers. He remarked that these chickens must all have been in AA because the livers were like 10 times larger than normal and just weird - way too many in the order and just mushy. The oysters were fine, but no one explained which ones were which and there was no listing of the options on the menu. A bit too much green roe on them as well, but the yuzu citrus was nice. For entrees, we had the BBQ lamb shank and the pork chop with a side of brie potatoes (him). The lamb was really blah - seriously lacking flavor. He thought the pork chop was okay, liked the potatoes. At this point, we were ready to go, but I thought maybe dessert could salvage things. I got the cheddar biscuit topped with peaches and olive oil ice cream. Husband went with an aged whiskey. Even the ice cream could not save the dessicated dryness of this biscuit - but the peaches were yummy. All this, with 4 drinks, was $170 before tip. Not crazy prices, but not worth it when you leave totally dissatisfied. I have to say that our service was a lot better than some who have reviewed on here - not pretentious, just sparse at times, but that was more about having too many high-maintenance tables to tend than anything she was in control of.
