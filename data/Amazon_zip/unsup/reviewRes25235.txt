Friday we took our friends to Gejas. First, the traffic from Elgin was horrific -- we called twice to let them know we'd be late. Both times they scooted us back 30 mins. Very gracious; don't know if Rick Bayless would have done that. We got there, were seated and told them we had our promo coupon from the emails they sent us and we were off! it's kitchy, it's never-changing and it's Gejas. The quality is great and the service was attentive. We asked for wine offerings because we didn't want the house wine w/ the coupon. Shannon (or Leesah as we called her) was spot-on and both bottles were just about gone by the night's end. we'll be back -- but because of the price, we'll only go back when it's a promotion. As for ambiance, it's dark, it's dated, and it could be loud if it was crowded. Because our reservations ended up being 6pm, it was just fine and we like it that way. Earlier eating = easily heard conversation, comfortable, relaxed interaction with our waitstaff and an all around good time.
