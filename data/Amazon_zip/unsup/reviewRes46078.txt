I had some friends in town for the holiday weekend and we decided to have a late brunch at the Grand Lux. For a party of 8, we were surprised to only wait a few minuets before we were seated. The restaurant is impressive, with oversized booths and lighting. The service and food on the other hand was just ok. For a large group, this massive restaurant works and has a huge menu, a fit for any taste. Unfortunately, we got pretty poor service and the food was nothing special. I wouldn't recommend this place to my out of town guests.
