This is the spot to be for fantastic sushi and Thai cuisine. I came here on a Friday night with a couple of friends. We were told there would be a 20 minute wait but we ended up waiting a half hour. It was well worth the wait! The decor is very sleek with bright red accent walls. There are also interesting pictures on the wall. The one I remember most was a young girl wearing a hat that resembled a green brain... very interesting art. You must check it out. We had the famous crab rangoon and it was the best I ever had! It wasn't just a fried wanton with cream cheese. It actually had crab and flavor. The spring rolls are awesome! They are not fried, they are served cold. Kind of reminded me of a salad sushi roll. I will definitely get both appetizers again. We also shared 2 specialty rolls. The dragon and the spider. The fish was fresh and the rolls were huge! There were some other rolls I want to try next time like the sweet potato maki and the southwest roll. Indie has a huge sushi menu and they put pictures next to the items on the menu so you know what you're getting. Very helpful! Lastly we all ordered Thai entrees. I had chicken pad thai and it was really good. I could only eat about half because I was so full off the rolls and appetizers. My friend had chicken fried rice made with brown rice. That is a nice "healthier" option to have. You can get your sushi made with brown rice but it's an extra $2/roll. My other friend had beef pad see eiw and his came out 15 minutes later. The girl forgot to put the order in. That was the only problem we had that evening. All in all, Indie Cafe is the spot to for awesome sushi and it's also byob.
