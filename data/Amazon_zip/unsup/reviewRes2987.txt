I really enjoyed the food here except for the sable fish. There was something odd tasting about it. The staff was very professional and polite. They do go out of their way though to personalize the experience if you are there to celebrate a special occasion. Not sure if I would make a return visit, as there are many other places of the same or higher caliber, but definitely worth a try.
