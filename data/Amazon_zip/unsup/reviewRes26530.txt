I go here too often when I'm in pilsen but it's hard to resist. The food's always good. The service is fast and kind. I would suggest the burrito de carne asada or the vegetarian burrito. I've never been displeased as long as I was ordering them (though the mol enchiladas just aren't as good as the burritos but hey few things in life are as good as those burritos). Moral of the story is order the burrito. The horchata they have is very good.
