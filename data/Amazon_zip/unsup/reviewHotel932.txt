Disgusting. Came with my friend just for a place to stay....horrible. They were doing renovations in the lobby made it look rundown. The hostess at the desk logged like she may not even have worked there because she had no Id badge. They head A big creepy guy for their valet service. E elevators are incredibly small and old. My bathroom towels had a curly black hair in it. Two,of my three pillows had long black hairs on them which almost made me throw up. The rooms suck. Very small. Weird smell. Rooms are freezing. Would never ever ever go back.
