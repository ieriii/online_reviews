I walked in and instantly felt happy. There is an energy in this place that just sucks you in. My friend ordered a Banana shake and the whole crew behind the counter yelled "banana shake"...if you embarass easily, then don't order the shake.  The food is amazing. I had a goat cheese empanada and i might have shed a tear of joy the minute it hit my taste buds. As for the banana shake, it was made with coconut milk, which gave it a natural sweetness that leaves you wanting more.....in a word, DELICIOUS!   I love the patio at this place, you don't even realize you are in the city once you step back there. Its quaint and colorful and roomy. The mural on the wall is beautiful to look at and tells a story. YOU NEED TO GO THERE! The menu is full of delightful choices, the atmosphere is chill and the people are a treat.
