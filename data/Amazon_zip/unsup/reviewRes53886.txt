The food is good. The service.. the waiters are very nice and they really try.. but the place is crowded so its very difficult to receive a good service. The food is good.. original.. unique.. a little expensive... and the music is TERRIBLE.. it doesn't have anything to do with he concept of the Restaurant.. at all.. is like heavy rock.. it's annoying. The hostess are not very nice and I think they should try to look a little better or at least wear something that help the client recognize them, they are wearing normal clothes.. .. but the bartenders are very nice.. highly recommend the squash.. the pork neck.. and the pistaccio ice cream.
