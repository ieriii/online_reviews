4.5 stars. A meal at Alinea is an experience. It's not just the food, which is fantastic, but the presentation that makes it so great. Very few of the 26 courses we had even came on plates, but rather logs, pillows, test tubes, wires, and more. Out of 26 courses (+some), only a few were not to my liking. The squab was not my favorite, but my husband really enjoyed it. So many dishes were fun, creative, and painstakingly created. The effort shows and is worth it. I don't know that I would have the same experience if I went back, because part of it is the uniqueness of the situation. I would recommend it to anyone that likes to savor and enjoy their food, including creativity and depth of flavor.
