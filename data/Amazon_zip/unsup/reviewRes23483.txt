Maybe I came expecting too much. Maybe it had been to long since I've had really great greek and I built it up in my mind. Either way, I left this place a bit dissapointed. My fiance and I started with the house red wine - eh. We had some of the bread they brough - eh. We started with the saganaki - again, it was just okay. I've had better, and I hate that pita bread doesn't come with. My fiance had the combination plate. The lamb was cold, and the rest was just standard, but maybe we shouldn't have expected anything more. I had two small orders of dips (again, why is pita extra?) - the skordalia and the feta with red peppers. Had I not been comparing it to my favorites, maybe I would have enjoyed it more. But the skordalia was nowhere near as good as I have had at Tom Douglas' Lola in Seattle. The one here was very clumpy and somewhat bland. The feta dip had a nice flavor but again was pretty lumpy and just not my taste. We shared a chocolate layer cake for dessert which was the most satisfying part of the meal. We ended up paying over $60 with tip for a mediocre meal. We left full, but dissapointed. I did really like the decor, and some of the other plates that people around us had (especially the seafood) looked good. I might be back eventually, after I try the other options in Greektown.
