I didn't actually stay here but met some friends here who were in townfor a conference. The rooms are fairly well appointed. It's located conveniently across from Water Tower and the Hancock building, right off of Michigan. The thing that sets this hotel apart, however, is the rock star pool, which is not only huge but on the top (30th?) floor with an amazing view of the Chicago skyline!
