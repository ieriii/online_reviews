The food was fantastic. Had the limeade (non alcoholic): good, tacquito pollo appetizer: good, Wife had the skirt steak tacos with s side of rice and guacamole good, I had the duck tacos with a side of fried plaintains with crema and queso fresco: good, had the duo flanes for dessert: the traditional was good but the one with lemon grass was terrible. Lemon grass flan? bad idea. Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 was waiter was not friendly...at all. Not mean but hardly spoke.
