Stopped at XOCO for an evening snack during a trip to Chicago and was floored by how excellent such fast, simple could be. Churros were ordered and enjoyed by all - absolute sugary, cinnamon-y, fried deliciousness. My boyfriend ordered the chipotle chicken torta, which he absolutely raved about. Solid spot for a quick bite!
