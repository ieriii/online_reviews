Coast always pleases me, we were hungry and it was late, coast was open! We forgot to bring our own drinks, don't forget this is a BYOB... The sushi was on point, really fresh and really good, we ate very light and left very satisfied, our server was so nice, I mean really cool! My only complaint was chipped china and glasses, actually had two pieces of chipped china and a chipped glass... I have a ceramics technology background and chipped china is a food-born illness hazard and chipped glasses can cause injury, so I strongly suggest that you kidz at Coast go through and throw out the old dishes maybe start over completely...
