I loved this place. It was my first time staying at something like this and it was first rate. Would recommend it to anyone. Food, service, cleanliness were all top notch. We had no issues and really soaked up the experience of staying at a Mansion. An awesome and memorable place to see Chicago from. Concierge were super accommodating.
