I've been to Davanti Enoteca many times and it never failed to satisfy and even more! The food here is delicious and I guess they have great Italian wine too! The burger there is amazing - my personal favorite. Also the Barrata with honey dish is very good, the beet salad, also we had a pizza there, forgot which kind - but oh so delicious!!! They also change the topping of their brushcetta every week or day, i don't remember, but it's always been delish. Too bad they don't make reservations, so you have to wait for at least an hour on any given day. But it's so super worth it! It is also very decently priced!!! In the summer time they have outdoor seating - which is so quaint and adorable!!! One of my favorite Italian places in the city! thumbs up...
