Had reservations for noon today. Glad I did.. wait time would have been an hour plus. Overall, Rick Bayless' food was fantastic! For an appetizer, I had flautas de carnitas. Disappointed about the portion/price ratio tbh. They tasted great nontheless, it reminded me of a Filipino eggroll. For my entrees, I ordered duck quesadilla with caramelized onions & a ribeye steak marinated in chili sauce w/ a side of sweet plantains. Holy cow, these dishes were fantastic! I had a chance to peak in Topolobampo, Rick's adjoining restaurant. Formal dining with more subdued decor compared to Frontera My only real grip was the men's room... 1 urinal while the next guy was waiting by the sink?! cmon son
