When we started going to this place a some years ago, it seemed so exotic and different. The servers hardly spoke any English and the menu was in Korean. The food was great, it wasn't terribly crowded and nothing was rushed. Now you are greeted by a hostess, the menu is all glossy with pictures and bilingual, weekend lines are long and you feel a bit rushed. The food is still good though, love the kalbi and kimchi assortments. They say they are open 24 hours but we found the place shuttered at 5 am. I know 5 am!. We still go to the place often for the great BBQ but it just doesn't seem as unique an experience anymore.
