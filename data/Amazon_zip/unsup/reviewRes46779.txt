Went here tonight after seeing many good reviews and a few not so good reviews on here....decided to try it anyway! We didn't have a reservation but got seated in about 10 minutes....good start. We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos for an appetizer and I looooooved them. The buffalo sauce wasn't too spicy, but still had a lot of flavor and their ranch dressing is amazing. I got the Gruntburger (onion strings and blue cheese) and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the Yowzaburger (pepper jack cheese, lettuce, bacon, and spicy ketchup) and said it wasn't as spicy as he thought it was going to be, but the flavor was still good. The cottage fries (which are like homemade potato chips) were great! No ketchup needed :) We asked about the free ice cream and cookie for your first visit after reading a review on here about it and they were more than willing to include us on the deal! It was a delicious cookie with ice cream and hot fudge....can't go wrong with that! The only downside was the screaming kids at the tables surrounding....but overall a great meal and we are planning on taking any visiting friends there!
