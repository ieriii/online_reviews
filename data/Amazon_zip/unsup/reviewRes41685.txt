When spring break rolled around the staycation was officially ON! It started with a a trip to Argyle, a visit to Tank Noodle and it was worth every minute and dime. The menu is huge which is good because we brought others to the large dinner table. Appetizer(s): 2 orders of Vietnamese Spring Rolls Egg Rolls Entree(s) for the adults: # 86 # 88 # 87 # 84 Dessert: Pork Banh Mi Sandwich - people were still hungry at the table, what can I say... In retrospect, I should have gone with the pho because it looked so good and everybody else in the restaurant was eating it. Hindsight is 20/20, but there will be other days where the family and I will frequent Tank Noodle. The address has been input in the GPS and the red line stop has been duly noted by my son who loves trains.
