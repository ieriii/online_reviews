Worst delivery experience imaginable. My order was fairly simple, 2 small caesar salads, and 2 pastas. Ordered at 7pm, the order came an 1.5 hours later without the salads and my drinks. the funny thing is that this shitty pasta place had the audacity to charge me 40 dollars for some of the blandest garbage these lips have ever encountered. pasta bowl can suck it
