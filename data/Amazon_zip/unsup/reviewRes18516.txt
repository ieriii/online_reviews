I've been thinking about how to rate Bad Apple, and I've definitely been a fence-sitter. I think I figured it out. I've gone out a number of times in Lincoln Square in the last month. And, inevitably, every time, someone asks "Where do you want to go?" And, equally inevitably, I never suggest the Bad Apple.  However, if someone were to have suggested it, I'd probably shrug my shoulders and agree.  As a beer snob, I love the fact that the beer list is thrice as long as the food list. And, going as just a place to drink, it's pretty decent. But for food, I wish it were better so I were more willing to drag people here so I could try more beer.
