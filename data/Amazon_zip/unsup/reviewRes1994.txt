Best dogs I have ever eaten! There is a reason for the line that wraps around the building every day. Once inside though the service is fast and you can always find a seat since they do not let people grab tables until they have ordered. Despite it always being busy they do not rush you in ordering or in finishing your meal. A Chicago must!
