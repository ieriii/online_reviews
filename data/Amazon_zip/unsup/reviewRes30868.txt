I've only been to Nana twice (for dinner), but the food was excellent each time. The first time I went, I had the oyster po-boy, which was quite tasty. More recently, I had the soft-shell crab, which was spectacular. It was fried, but not so much that the taste of the crab was obscured. I had the white chocolate tart for dessert, which was also delicious. The friends I was with had the fried quail and the pork shoulder, which they said were superb. The only part of the meal that was subpar was the shrimp cocktail appetizer. It came with unpeeled shrimp (a pet peeve of mine), and the "sauce" was just strawberries, jalepenos, and endive that were arranged on a plate. The menu did not really explain this presentation, so it wasn't what we were expecting. The shrimp also tasted old. The service was very slow both times I've been here. Most recently, we had to wait 15 minutes for the waiter to show up at our table once we were seated. Overall, the delicious food makes up for these few misses, however.
