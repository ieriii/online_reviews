One of, if not my absolute favorite breakfast spot in the city. The food is always good, the staff is super nice, the crowd and environment are pleasant and I live within a block. On Sat. and Sun. mornings, this is my go to breakfast place to meet up with friends or family. Their lox and bagel is delicious as are all their omelettes. I've also been in for lunch and loved their big salads. The burger is my hangover cure when I stumble out of bed in the early afternoon. I highly recommend this casual, cozy and inexpensive Gold Coast spot!
