All i have to say this is a must go to in West Town. Minus the hideous building, the food is great. We went for dinner on Saturday night, we sat right down and gazed their extensive menu. I fancy myself as a big eater, and am always a little skeptical when a place boasts of a "mega" roll, but they got it right, hot damn these rolls were huge. Before i ordered i found the 13-17dollar rolls a tad steep, but you will get your moneys worth. The fish was fresh, inventive rolls, i mean who puts bacon and prosciutto with sushi. If you are looking for a change, and want to step out of the TORO, or Coast box, give this place a try. BYOB is great, my only qualm is have proper stemware, not a fan of drinking a great bottle of sake out of a small bucket glass.
