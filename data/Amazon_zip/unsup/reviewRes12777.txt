Came here on my first night in Chicago, and what a welcome to the windy city it was! The wait for 2 people on a week night was about 30 minutes. We sat in the waiting area by the bar after grabbing a few drinks. The decor is really nice; it takes you out of the urban atmosphere and into an exotic luxurious one. Once seated, we were promptly approached by servers with all kinds of beefs, pork, lamb and chicken. Since it's all-you-can-eat, I sampled just about everything, and revisited my favorites: the signature brazillian-style sirloin, anything with filet mignon, and the pork ribs (see other reviews for complete menu). You can ask for the rarity of meat you want, and if they don't have it immediately, they'll go make it the way you want, so that was very accommodating. I also sampled from the salad bar area, and I highly recommend the lobster bisque. SOoo good. The grilled red peppers and roasted garlic complemented the meats well. They also give you a bowl of mashed potatoes and fried plantains that are a pleasing contrast to everything else you eat. At $45 for dinner, I would have to say it is worth it, just barely. Note that dessert is listed on the menu, but it is NOT included. We made that ($7.50) mistake but the creme brulee was still very good, but I was too stuffed to finish it all. Still, I would recommend visiting this place once you get tired of the deep-dish pizza.
