I'm so glad I finally made my way here and it is completely worth the raves that everyone else writes here. The good: YUM, get some aqua fresca, and then get the super-solid chipotle chicken torta. I don't like the caldo, it might just be that it's not up to my taste, I think it's a bit too salty for what soup should be. The bad: The line. What would you expect though? also, the pickled pigs' feet tostada was also very sour.
