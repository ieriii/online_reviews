I just visted Sunda last night and let me say it was AMAZING!!! I am not one to venture out of my comfort zone with food but I am glad I did last night. I had the duck salad which was to die for. The walnut tempora shrimp was a hit as well as the dragon roll. Everything was so fresh and the service was surprisingly fast considering it was very crowded. I'll def. be back again.
