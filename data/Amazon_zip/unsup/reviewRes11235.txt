This place stole a piece of my heart!! As you walk towards the place the smell of delicious pizza fills your nose. Before getting into the details, here are some cool facts about the place. The owner I believe is Rick Nielsen. He's the lead guitarist for Cheap Trick, us young folk know them as "those guys who do the colbert report's theme song." So the place is decorated with multi-neck guitars, which is pretty cool.  The pizza is delicious. There are three ways to get it, red, white, and another type (i don't remember). Plus they have awesome toppings such as mashed potatoes and bacon. The beer is also pretty damn good, and with the quirky names such as camel toe, and dysfunctionale is what made me fall in love with the place.  During the weekend it does get crowded. So if you plan on going there during this time plan on standing around for a while before getting a table. On the bright side you can drink beer and watch one of the many sports games on the big screen tv's surrounding you.
