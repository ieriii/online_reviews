I saw a feature on this restaurant on one of the many Chicago food TV shows I watch, and it looked great so we checked it out for ourselves. Despite heading out for an early dinner, there was a line when we arrived. While we waited, we checked out the ducks hanging in the windows and the butchers behind the counter, all the while getting very excited for our dinner. We could not get over how cheap everything is here! Average entrees were under $6 -- ridiculous! We ordered waaay too much food for the two of us but couldn't help it with the low prices. The roast duck and roast pork were delicious! In my opinion the roast duck was really the star of the show. My husband insisted on ordering some more Americanized dishes, which I warned him not to, and as I expected they were mediocre at best. Definitely stick to what this place is known for! Service here is pretty whacky but not all that different than what you would expect for a fairly authentic place. We can't wait to come back with a group to try the Peking duck dinner -- it looked delicious!
