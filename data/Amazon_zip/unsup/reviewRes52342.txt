Ginos is very yummy, they tell you up front the deep dish will take 45 minutes and our waiter was great and full of recommendations for what to get while we were waiting. My mom & I both had a bowl of Italian Wedding soup which was huge for the $3.95 price, and FULL of noodles and meatballs, I was expecting a brothy cup of nothing at that price! I caught a glimse of the minestrone which looked like it's made with white beans and looked hearty and yummy. The pizza arrived sooner than we expected and cheese was melted to perfection but too much cheese for me. Sauce was great too, crust was just slightly crunchy for me...I've been here before and was blown away so this is probably a one off! Either way u have to Come here! I came during the week and didn't have to wait in line...on the weekend same time and a huge line out the door.
