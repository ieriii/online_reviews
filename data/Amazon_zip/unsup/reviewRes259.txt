Yeah, it was alright. I snagged the grand tour reservation with 3 days notice, dining 2 days later. Don't give up on the wait list, baby. I probably enjoyed the chicken liver pate with bacon, caramelized onion paper, and vin santo in terms of tastiness. I probably enjoyed the duck, foie gras and mole flavors surrounded by the warm fragrance of heady nuts and spices in terms of interestingness. Environment and food seemed "yang" to me. So I had to balance that out by making constant references to licking beef curtains with the wagyu beef presentation. The dinner, maybe it could use a course called "promenade," where a favorite server would take us for a walk around the block to break up the pace of four and a half hours of gastronomic self-indulgence. The wine pairings were excellent with fine verbose explanations. The menu composition, Edward Tufte would be proud.
