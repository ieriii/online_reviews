I had my birthday party there on a Sunday evening and from the moment the FREE limo came and picked me up, I knew that I was going to be treated like a queen. The limo was very nice inside,with beer and champagne included. The wait staff was very helpful and attentive. The owner, Branko, made my night a success. He kept makeing sure that everything was great. He gave me a free shot and let me SMASH a plate on the floor. He also gave my mom and I aa free botthe of Romanian wine. Pretty Cool! There was a live singer who wished me Happy Birthday a bunch of times, and even got some of us to dance. Branko is such a gentleman and because of his great food, service, and warm heart, I will definitely be coming back...and I suggest you give it a try as well.
