We had a quick lunch here so I would love to come back and linger... and also eat more... But what we had was stellar! I was a little scared at first, when we saw a huge line before the place had even opened and thought it might be a bit too touristy... but all the reviews were pretty good and it was recommended... Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette... "JLT" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg... Prosciutto di Parma. Mmmm!!! Great service... comfy... love all the communal tables.
