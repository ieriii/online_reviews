This was my second time at Le Colonial - meaning that I had a pleasant enough first visit to return again. I'm not sure whether it was because it was Chef's week and we went off the Chef menu, or whether it was because it was a very slow Tuesday night, but the food underwhelmed and we will not be returning. The service was impeccable - friendly, just enough information, professional. However, the food was in short, for the most part boring - and in particular not worthy of the hefty prices ($31 for a bland Bouillabaise). We had 4 starters - the Lotus Root and Tofu Salad was superb - the ribs, spring rolls and spinach crab soup were all ok, but nothing special. We had 4 mains - the Bouillabaise was remarkably bland, the chicken was dry and likewise for the pork. The ambiance is great though. But ambiance and service will unfortunately not make up for lack-luster food at relatively hefty prices. It may have been an off night, but we will unfortunately not return.
