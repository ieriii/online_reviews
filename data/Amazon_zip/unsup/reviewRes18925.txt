If you dont have appreciation for these sandwiches......just shame on you, shame on you. The menu has endless choices that sound delicious. I went with the sandwich with shortribs on there. Just awsome, and incomparable to any sandwiches i had as of yet. Went there on a saturday around 2ish and about 15 min later I was at home on my couch having one of the best sandwiches i have ever had in the comfort of my own living room. I am sorry for the rant, but I just moved here so I was pretty awed in the moment. If you dont like this place, then you got something wrong with u. Giving it 5 stars cuz anybody can leave here satisfied with that menu if they simply stick to the things they know and like.
