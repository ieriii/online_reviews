Silly me-I was under the impression that Deep Dish was what Chicago is known for, but apparently it is Hot Dogs, Hot Dogs Hot Dogs. We drove by Hot Doug's the other day and my sister explained to me that they are who to see for a real Chiacgo Dog. I have never been much of a hot dog fan but wanted to give these a try. It was explained to me to bundle up and plan on waiting in the cold for awhile. I prepared myself and headed down there. Luckily, we hit Doug's at a pretty good time, only waiting about 10 minutes. I was told that it is the type of place that you should know what you are ordering before you arrive or you will piss off the locals by holding up the line. Because of this, I studdied the online menu and to figure out exactly what I was getting. (I am a local now and did not want to piss off my own kind!) When we got closer to the front, I realized this is not the case. The man taking the orders truly takes his time and helps with any questions and sugestions his customers may have. He was to the point, but did not make his guests feel rushed at all. I think that this is what creates the line... I had the the Jalapeno-Cheese Sausage, topped with Jalapeno Mayo, Pepperjack Cheese and fresh Cilantro. It was WAY RICH and WAY DELICIOUS. Next time I think I would opt for less mayo and cheese and to add fresh tomato and extra cilantro instead, to make it a little less rich. The dog had a perfect kick to it and left a great spice in my mouth. We also shared a large order of fries which were equally wonderful. I had heard about the Duck Fat Fries and was sad to see that they are on weekends only. I guess i will have to go back!
