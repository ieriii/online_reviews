Hands down, without a doubt, the absolute best hot dogs in the world! These are gourmet dogs made with every type of tasty protein imaginable (duck, gator, chicken, pork, lamb, beef, snake) and paired with the most perfect cheese/toppings you could ask for. I wish I lived in Chicago just so I could eat there weekly! Doug, you are doing a terrific job and I appreciate the hard work and time you continue to put in along with all your employees! There's no line that is too long to wait in for your wonderful establishment.
