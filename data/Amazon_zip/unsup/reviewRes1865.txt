Maybe I just have more basic needs when it comes to hot dogs. Don't get me wrong, I liked Hot Doug's but something is holding me back from giving a full-fledged recommendation. Long lines and wait times? Yes. Unique selection of meats and toppings? Yes. The yin and the yang.  My question to any potential newbie: Is ANY hot dog worth an hour-plus wait?
