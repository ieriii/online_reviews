Absolutely delicious. Best meal I've had in Chicago by far. A little pricey, but worth every cent. Great oyster selection as well as oysters rockefeller. Tried a combination of 8 oz filet and king crab legs.. which came pre-cracked and ready for dipping in clarified butter. Great key lime pie to boot. You can't go wrong here..
