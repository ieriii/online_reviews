I just ate here and I wonder what's with these Brazilian Steakhouse Salad bars? I'm not complaining but is it me or does it look like the vegetables should be included in the Mitchell Report? I swear they are on Growth Hormones or something, because the asparagus and all the other vegetable treats are way bigger than the ones you find at Jewel!Anyways, this place rocks! It's been consistently great everytime I've gone there. If you are a first timer, I must warn you that once you go orange, the guys will come by every 5 seconds with something to offer you! My advice start with 2-3 meats you want (plus the pineapples, my favorite), then flip the thing to black so you can enjoy eating in piece then flip it over again to get more. It's quite hard and almost disturbing to eat with a constant flow of dudes waving knives and skewers of meat in front of you! And it's perfectly normal so don't feel bad when saying no to the meat dudes. At first I thought I hurt their feelings too but they told me they are used to people saying no, so eat what you want when you want!Oh the bread is simply addicting. I now wrap my "cold meats" from the Salad Bar around them for added flavor, as a tip!
