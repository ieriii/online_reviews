This is one of my casual tea hang outs.. sometimes i'll go alone and take books or sometimes I join friends.. I always get a British Man who serves me.. Oooohh la la .. The tea is nice.. and very inexpensive for a legendary hotel. .for it to be downtown. Valet parking is only $10 when having tea so well worth it.. it's not the Peninsula but it's still a nice hang out ..
