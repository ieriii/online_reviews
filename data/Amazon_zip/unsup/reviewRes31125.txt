Definitely, a great place for people watching. Very nice modern decor. The service was pretty good too. The sushi was all very very fresh but pricey. I did like the the crispy rice and the crispy Pata was really good too. The toast and Jam sounded really good but it wasn't what I expected. I was hoping it was going to be sweet like jam but looked like Jam. I wasn't a fan but great idea.
