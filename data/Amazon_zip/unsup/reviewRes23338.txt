So as you can tell from other reviews, the wait here is long...always. Whatever the host/hostess tells you, be sure to add another 20-30 minutes because this place is popular. I had the vegetarian burrito and was underwhelmed. It was kind of soupy and soggy and didn't hold together well. The service was slow and they ran out of clean silverware so as food arrived, we had no way to eat it (for like 15 minutes). I would maybe go again and give it another try, but upon fist visit, things fell short.
