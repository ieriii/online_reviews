Cheap good old Mediterranean food. Easy street parking. -Baked spinach pie. Thumbs down. It was cold. $2. -Lentil soup. Okay. Seemed a bit powdery. $2. -Lamb shawarma dinner. Good. Comes with rice and salad and humus. I I've had better hummus, but it was still pretty good. $7 Service needs works. The employees seemed a bit rude. When I placed my order, I said "Can I have a #1 please?" Server's response: "I don't know what a #1 is." Whatever. Cashier gave me a bit of attitude when I asked for water, utensils, and if they had any desserts. Whatever. The food might be worth 4-stars, but the service was 2-stars. So I guess it averages out.
