The Shaun have never had an experience like the one he had at this restaurant. First of all, bring your appetite because if you don't get stuffed here, you didn't really come to eat. The host are friendly and more than willing to assist you with whatever you need. The wine selection is quite nice as well with personal decanters to place at your table. The "salad" has a broad selection with even sushi as an option. It's pricey but worth it in everyway!!
