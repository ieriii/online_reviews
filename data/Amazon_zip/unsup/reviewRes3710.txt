Quick serve restaurant, serving tasty korean favorites, including tasty fried chickent and bi bim bop. The Seoul Sassy fried chicken was terrific. Next visit I will be taking down the bi bim bop and hopefully have room for another serving of the chicken. Bright, clean restaurant with friendly service.
