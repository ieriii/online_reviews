Easily one of my favorite restaurants in the Loop. The soups are phenomenal. The service is almost always good too. Great for a before concert dinner. My personal favorite is the pork belly sandwich, and I'm not someone who even likes sandwiches. I've had several of the fish dishes and loved those too. Not a huge fan of the fish and chips, but others seem to enjoy it. I even love the Gage mint tea, which is quite different from any other mint teas I've had. The only negative is that the restaurant is quite noisy, so it is hard to hold a conversation there. Otherwise, a terrific place!
