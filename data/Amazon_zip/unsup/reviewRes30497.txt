Went to Nana's last Sunday for brunch. There was not too much of a wait time - just about 10 mins. Loved the food - I ordered the Garden Omelet and the hubby ordered the Wild Strawberry Pancakes. I am not a big fan of pancakes, but boy this was good!! It was accompanied with lemon curd and whipped cream. The lemon curd was dreamy!!! Fresh strawberries, fluffy pancakes with lemon curd and little syrup - it was the Perfect Bite!! My omelet was also very good. They use organic ingredients and the food is fresh and tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone in a heartbeat!
