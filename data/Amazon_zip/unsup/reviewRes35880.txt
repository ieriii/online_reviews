This is the best Chinese restaurant I have experienced in Chicago. It is also clean and offers a full Peking Duck feast! The group I was with was not feeling the Peking Duck, so I had duck and ribs over rice. I was also able to pick off my wife's plate who had what may be the best cashew nut shrimp ever. The service can be a bit slow at first and be careful to watch the seating list at the front door. The woman sometimes doesn't check the name properly.
