A group of 9 of us went to Bin 36 after seeing a play on a Saturday night. We were hoping for a few appetizers and some nice wine to finish the night. What we got was awful service and bad attitudes! When we arrived, the lounge area could not accommodate our large party, so we sat in the dining area. Our moronic waiter came by and hovered over our shoulders while repeatedly asking "do you need another minute, do you need another minute, do you need another minute." He would give us 45 seconds in between asking us if we needed more time. Immediately, I thought that something was wrong with him (mentally). Then, moronic waitress enters the picture and she is even worse than the first. They tell us that we are going to have two waiters? During the whole process they were incredibly rude, and at one point when my friend wasn't ready to give her order, they stepped aside from the table (maybe 3 feet away) and proceeded to talk about her. The whole situation was really strange. I am convinced that they were snorting coke in the back. Their behavior was just WEIRD. As I mentioned above, we were a table of 9. The waiter then brings ONE itty-bitty loaf of break for the entire table!! I asked them to bring additional bread, only to be given attitude and no bread. So we then provided specifics and asked them to bring two or three more loaves of bread with butter so that everyone could enjoy a piece. The wine was good and we enjoyed the ambiance with our friends, but the experience was "off" due to the staff. I will never return to this place again. I live in the city and know that there are many other places to enjoy a nice glass of wine and cheese.
