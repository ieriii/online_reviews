Wow, what an amazing experience. First of all I have to say is if you really want to eat lots of meat, this is the place to go. Although the Salad Bar has exceptional selections (fresh mozzarella, tuna, olives, sushi bar...) I would recommend only going up once, if you really want to eat the loads of meat they serve. I went up twice to the salad bar and didn't have room to eat the many meats available. We went on a Friday evening, and the service was amazing. Once you flip over your "meat" card, you are bombarded with several choices from the wait staff. Our waiter was exceptional, and it was an amazing night!
