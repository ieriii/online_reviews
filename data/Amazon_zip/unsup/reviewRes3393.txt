Here's my problem with yelp. I've lived in Chicago just over 2 years, and have known about Yelp the whole time, so I typically ventured only into the 4+ star places. Now that I'm finally getting around to reviewing everything, my distribution will look like: 5 ******* 4 ********** 3 ******* 2 **** 1 ** I HATE YOU ALL! Unless you're hot, then we have a chance of working out. P.S. Workers were cool and the Seoul Sassy chicken was great. Still remember it!
