In my mind this is a 3.5 Been here a number of times and their entrees range from 4 start down to a 3 star in quality. Had their pizza for the first time last night. Ordered for delivery. the thin crust was tasty, pretty decent and would probably order it again. But their pan/deep dish was below average. I'd much rather eat Giordano's or Aurelio's or Uno/Due's over Calo's deep dish.
