I had the opportunity to eat at the Chicago Diner since I had to start my gluten-free diet. They have a gluten-free menu. (You may have to ask for one at the table, since it's separate from the main menu they hand out to customers. It has the same dishes on it, but it highlights which food are sans which allergens. Thus, it's not only a gluten-free menu, but also a dairy-free, soy-free, corn-free, or whatever-you-need-free menu.) You can also view it online in advance of your visit, if you want to get a sense of your dining options. I ordered the Soul Bowl, which was really nice. And even though I was pretty full, I noticed they had a vanilla gluten-free cupcake on the menu. So I had that, too. It was on of the first vegan/gluten-free baked goods I ever had, and it was the first I ever had that didn't have the texture of over-cooked cornbread. (Some of that stuff is so dry it's sinful.) I wanted to weep for joy, but, the place is a little small, and I would have made a scene. It was just so nice to sit there with a cup of good coffee and a fabulous vanilla cupcake and realize that, yes, there is life after celiac disease. So, props to you, Chicago Diner. Again, I'll be back whenever I'm traveling through the area.
