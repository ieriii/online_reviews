Excellent food and service! Our party opted to trust the chef and ordered the chef's choice menu. We received three courses, each with at least four different tapas. All dishes were not only prepared to perfection, but beautifully plated and served in a timely fashion. Our server, Doc, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to our party's preferences. We will definitely dine here again in the future.
