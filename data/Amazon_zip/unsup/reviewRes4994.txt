The place was packed at 10 pm. We were seated outside, a little chilly but with the gas lamp, it was nice. Food: Pork neck bone rillette, too rich. Portion was big. I wish they would serve this with crostini instead of toast. The shaved brussel sprouts were good, the feta cheese with cucumber was ok. Overall, their food went well with wine pairings. If you are not going to have wine with your dinner here, you might be disappointed with the food. Service: the server needs a little more training with customer service. She was so hurried and did not even show us the wine bottle that we ordered. She just poured it in our glass and off she went. How do I know I got the right one? So, they only get 3 stars.
