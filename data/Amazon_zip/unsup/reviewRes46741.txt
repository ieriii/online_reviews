Went here to try another LEY place in Chicago, since I love burgers and it was their first concept place. A Saturday night wait for 2 was 45 minutes, consistent with what other yelpers have reported. Started with the salad bar, since it's their other claim to fame. As others have mentioned, they have a few odd items on there (choc chip cream cheese, chicken liver spread etc) but nothing that really makes it stand out in my mind -- perhaps places like Sweet Tomatoes have spoiled me. That'd be okay, I was able to make a pretty convincing pre-dinner salad and I liked the lemon potato salad, but the price is too high for just okay. Went with a Gruntburger for my entree. Now, I love a cheesy burger and I love blue cheese with red meat (yum) but I didn't love this burger. There was a lot of blue cheese on it, and you couldn't taste much else (the flavor of the onion strings was completely drowned out). I usually try to avoid faulting places for my food preferences, but I don't think I ordered incorrectly, I think the execution was just poorly done. The burger was cooked exactly as ordered (medium rare) and the bun was a great fit, which means that there is some burger knowledge in the kitchen, which makes the overall outcome that much more disappointing. My girlfriend got the chicken wings. These had perhaps the best batter I've had on chicken wings in a while which gave each bite a nice crunch. Yet the wings were pretty small compared to what a good filling wing should be, so once again - good start but not enough.
