So I read about Irazu months ago but never got over to the restaurant. About two months ago my friend and I went on a saturday night to grab dinner but they were super crowded and there were 3 groups of people waiting to be seated so we decided against it that night. So today after getting rid of some recycling on the way back I thought of Irazu! So stopped in with my friend and we both got the Vegetarian Burrito, I got mine with Spinach instead of lettuce also with sauteed Mushrooms. She got the same but without sourcream. We shared the chips brought to the table as well as one Empanada. All of the food was great. We both only ate half of our burritos because they were so filling. Great service great meal..I will definately go back;)
