I've only eaten here for brunch so I can't comment on dinner. But, this is probably my favorite sport for brunch. The eggs are always cooked perfectly to order, the bacon is not too crispy (i like my bacon soft) and they have THE BEST MIMOSAS. My favorite dish is the New Orleans Scramble but you have to have a damn big stomach to finish it all. If you aren't feeling that ambitious, have the egg sandwich or the eggs with parmesan and chives. Service is always friendly and prompt too.
