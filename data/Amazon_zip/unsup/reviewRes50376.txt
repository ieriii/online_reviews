I almost always have a good time here. The food is awesome and the portions are huge, there a good drink specials, and a lot of seating. My friends and I have have thrown a couple parties here and we ended up getting a bottle once, which was reasonably priced (considering what you would pay someplace else). The only drawback is that sometimes the crowd is lame. Guys/girls trying too hard. I was there one night around midnight and a couple had their infant with them AND they were sitting next to the speakers. Good job parenting. I had to leave, it was too weird.
