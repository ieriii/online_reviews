Wow. If this is what authentic Italian cuisine is, I want to have its babies. Who knew there was more to it than red sauce, white sauce, lasagna, or chicken parmesan? It's like the whole concept of Italian food in America has been a joke until Davanti Enoteca came along. Start with the focaccia di Recco; the tangy cow cheese pairs beautifully with the sweetness of the Michican honeycomb. I honestly can't seem to get the light yet creamy marscapone polenta with lamb/beef ragu out of my head. But the star of the whole show was the RICCIO DI MARE E GRANCHIO. Translation: perfectly cooked linguine tossed in the most luscious (but not heavy!) sea urchin sauce and huge chunks of sweet crab. The seaweed-looking green stuff on top is just scallions, but man oh man, that added just the right touch. End with the torta bacio and the dreamiest chocolate cake will never live up to your memory of this rich chocolate mousse ever again.
