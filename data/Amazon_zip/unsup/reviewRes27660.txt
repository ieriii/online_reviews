Came straight here from the airport. Sausage and pepperoni deep dish pie. Perfect, caramelized crust, owing, no doubt, to the generations old cat iron pans. Best tomato sauce I have ever had on a pizza - not to sweet, not too tart, not to thick - just right. Tasted like tomatoes. Skip the chains and come here.
