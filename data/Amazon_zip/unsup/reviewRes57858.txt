Great first time experience with Ethiopian food! Minus 1 star because I could have used more direction from the waitress but honestly, we loved 5 of the 6 choices. It's fun to eat with your hands too! DO NOT leave without trying the sambussas- we had the variety and each flavor was better than the last. I want to go back for those right now thinking about them!
