Just what the neighborhood needs. Great food, chill atmosphere, awesome drinks and honest to goodness reasonable prices. We went last night and had three different dishes; the meatballs and brussel sprouts were great. I also enjoyed a PBR in a frosty goblet for a mere $2. The mixed drinks were great, too.
