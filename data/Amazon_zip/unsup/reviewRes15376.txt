I went on a Sunday night (New Years Day) and discovered that this hidden gem in andersonville was amazing! It has great food and a cool environment. One side is more romantic with dim lights and the other side by the full bar is a little more casual but still cute and dimly lit. There are also tvs for the games. We ordered chicken vesuvio which had an amazingly rich sauce. We also shared veal which was tender and delicious. The flourless chocolate cake was sooo rich and indulgent. SHARE IT! Definitely recommend this for a nice or casual dinner.
