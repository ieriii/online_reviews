My take on Grand Lux is that it's supposed to be somewhat classier than it's sister restaurant, Cheesecake Factory. The menu selection is smaller and not as overwhelming but the dessert menu is more expansive. Favorite desserts include the creme brulee, the deep dark fudge cake and the strawberry shortcake. The chicken pot pie isn't bad and you can usually find me munching on the Asian chicken salad or a burger/sandwich. The food overall is probably 3.5 but the dessert is definitely a 4. Being on the top floor of their building affords a nice view of the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue while feeling removed from it all.
