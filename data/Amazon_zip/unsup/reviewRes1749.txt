Is it a shame that I have to bring Chicago natives to this place, and I'm not even from Illinois at all? I'll admit, I found this place one late night on the Food Network, and since then, I've been asking all my Chicagoans to take me here. They always looked so puzzled when there's a line -- and they should know, when there's a line, something must be good! I'm a plain jane (sorry, can't stomach the Chicago style hot doug), so I usually get the corndog to reminisce my childhood days or the Foie Gras if I'm feeling a little ritzy. Both are great, and Doug's a sweetheart. Definitely worth the wait!
