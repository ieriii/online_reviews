This used to be my favorite place and I've been to this place many times and I have to say.. they have good Korean BBQ with horrible service. We asked for more side dishes and waited and waited.. they won't come back to our table and when we asked them again, the server brought the side dishes at the end of the meal when we were done eating. They have many different side dishes and that's what I like about this place. But after that service, i would not go back there again. There are other Korean bbq places that I know serves the food I like better.
