I'm visiting a friend in South Bend and he was nice enough to take us to Chicago. I asked him if he could please take us to Pequod's since it had so many reviews and I love love love pizza.  Hands down, the best deep dish pizza ever. I loved it. The service was good too. I even bought a shirt! I love these hole in the wall pizza places. They are the best. I can only hope of coming here again.
