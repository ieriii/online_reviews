Pizza adoration. I just loved it. The toppings are all fresh and authentic, I was with a large group and everyone loved what they ordered, but the thing that makes a pizza a great pizza for me is a great crust. A super thin, chewy, hot oven charred savory crust. Not the dried out too-dense crust you find all over Chicago, honest to god great crust. That said, the toppings are great too- San Marzano tomatoes, bufala mozzarella, crisp arugula, tiny ripe tomatoes, fresh sausage... Get here early to snag a table on the patio, and you won't regret it.
