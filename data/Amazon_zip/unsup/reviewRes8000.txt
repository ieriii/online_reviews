Imagine every good food on the earth that should come from Brazil.  You would picture meats served up by attractive men in Brazilian outfits, you would picture cheeses, wonderful roasted vegetables of all sorts, you would picture all sorts of exotic side dishes like fried polenta, plantains, and little freshly baked bread. You would build up these expectations, and then you would enter Fogo and they would exceed them. Incredible service, they treat you like gold. The place is beautiful, I would live there if I could. The food is amazing, and it never seems like my stomach is quite big enough to fit all of the things I want to try. I would live here if I could. But I can't. :0(
