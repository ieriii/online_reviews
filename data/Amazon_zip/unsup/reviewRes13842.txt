I'll just get this out of the way--the fifth star isn't there because the restaurant is too loud. It wasn't even as busy as it could have been, and I felt like I had to shout across the table. And at first, the service was a bit rude (we weren't acknowledged when we walked in and stood there while the host and a server had a more important conversation). Ok, that's over with, onto the food and beer. Everything else we had was pretty great. DO THE BACON POPCORN. DO IT. Popcorn, with yummy bacon grease, perfectly crunchy bacon, nutty parmesan, and fried sage leaves. This, my friends, is the definition of "can't stop eating it" food. I think I could eat pounds of this, endlessly. It is just addictive, delicious flavors, genius idea. I had the mustard herb chicken sandwich which was really great, and the boyfriend had the "forest burger" with gorgonzola, mushrooms, and shallots. Mmm. We tried a few beers, all delicious.   They have a bar with tvs, an open kitchen, and I like the decor. You can see through the dining room window into their brewery. They have some interesting-looking brunch options, too, which I plan to try.
