Everything here is delicious. I love this place. So far it's the best falafel I have found in the city. The chicken is super moist and full of flavor.  The prices can't be beat and if you get a platter that's definitely enough for two meals. Everything is very fresh, service is great.  Definitely a must-go if you are into falafel.
