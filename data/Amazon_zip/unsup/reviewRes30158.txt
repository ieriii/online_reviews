Tried this place for the first time on Saturday night and was really impressed. Sampled a variety of dishes, the brussel sprout salad was amazing! The sushi and pad thai was also very good. Didn't try any dessert, there wasn't room. :)  Sat at the sushi bar and was very comfortable with low sitting chairs and was able to enjoy the full menu. Service was also very good and the server was very versed with the menu when making recommendations. If you want a great ambiance with good food, give it a try.
