Tank Noodle is arguably the best place in the city to find pho (Vietnamese beef noodle soup--be a little adventurous and get the version with beef tendon and tripe). It comes in huge portions (one order is enough for two lunches, at least for me), tastes great, and it's cheap ($6). And you'll get a large plate filled with basil leaves, bean sprouts, and lime to add to your soup. The spring rolls--both vegetarian and non-vegetarian--are fresh and minty. They're cheap too ($3.50). Don't expect anything fancy--the restaurant is completely free of frills. Expect hard plastic chopsticks and soup spoons, hard seats, and more condiments on your table than you could possibly use in one dish. The service is fast and the restaurant is usually busy, which is always a good sign.
