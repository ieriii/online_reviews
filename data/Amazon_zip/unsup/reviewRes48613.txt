Having spent some time at Big Star, I was really looking forward to trying out another of Kahan's joints. My only reservation was the fact that my wife is a vegetarian, and the pork-centric menu sounded (from Yelpers, at least) not to have many meatless options. As it turns out, the chefs always have a vegetarian concoction available, and it was totally delicious. We ordered an appetizer of roasted squash, and the kitchen made sure to not include that on the veggie plate entree, which was a really nice touch. I was in meat lover's heaven, starting off with the spicy pork rinds (gotta order them), and having the country ribs as my entree. Outstanding. We'll definitely be back.
