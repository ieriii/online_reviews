Cafe 28 is a well-established family owned restaurant that, according to them, aims "to provide service in traditional Cuban and Mexican style with an electic latin twist." They definitely succeed. I've eaten there a number of times over the years--I started going there back when the menu was written on a blackboard and the restaurant was quite small! I've been mostly for dinner, and a couple of times for brunch. (They are also open for lunch Tuesday through Friday. The restaurant is closed on Mondays.) On my most recent visit, I started with a fantastic mojito, followed by a great pear, baby greens, and crumbled blue cheese salad (complete with champagne vinaigrette). For entree I went with one of my favorites: the Cuban roast pork, served with delicious congri (rice and beans), and yucca fritters. Yum yum yum! The pork was incredibly tender and flavorful, and I adored the yucca fritters. My friend had the salmon, which he said was good. Dessert was another mojito and a shared scoop of burnt caramel gelato. A great dinner, all the way around. On that most recent visit they were experiencing electrical problems in half of the restaurant, but had accomodated their patrons in the other room and on the covered patio. (Cafe 28 started out as one or two small storefront rooms, and has expanded into adjoining storefronts.) Although it was a little crowded and noisy, I admire the way they just carried on and made sure everyone was happy. Well done. Other menu items to try include the honey jalapeno pork chops, the ropa vieja, and the comal. Cafe 28 is great--don't miss it!
