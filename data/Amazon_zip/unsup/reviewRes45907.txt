I really have no complaints. I came here today with 3 other students for a lunch meeting today. I had never been before but figured it'd be good since it's the same company as Cheesecake Factory. I was not disappointed. The waiter was extremely friendly, and since we told him we had never been when he asked us, he explained a bit about the menu (including that the portions are large). Indeed, my salad was HUGE! I ate just about half of it while we were there, and took the rest to go. I probably could have finished it, but I wasn't starving and we only had a total of an hour from the time we left class til the time we had to be back. I had the Manhattan Salad - an excellent choice. It's a chopped salad with fresh beets (which I had never had before, but I like a lot), asparagus, huge cheese cubes, peas, red onions, lentils, white beans, and their insanely good vinaigrette. It also came with this crazy toasted thin bread slices, which were really good too (see photo). I had half of the leftovers with some pasta I made tonight at dinner, and I still have more than enough to take for lunch tomorrow. One order, 3 meals out of it. Win. Unfortunately since we were taking a prospective student out for lunch, we couldn't try any of their specialty drinks. But next time I absolutely will. Other thoughts: the place is pretty big, and the decor is super luxurious. All the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly. I would ordinarily think the prices were a little steep, but given the size of my salad and that I got 3 meals out of it, it's not unreasonable for being in the city (I think my salad was like $13). I will be back.
