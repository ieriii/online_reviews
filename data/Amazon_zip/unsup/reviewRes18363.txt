We had decided to go to Glenn's Diner on a whim and even though we got there at 8:20PM on a Friday night, with no reservations, it was an 80 mins wait!!! So, we looked up Yelp to see what else was in the area and decided to go to Caro Mio. Since we hadn't plan on going to a BYOB, we didn't bring any wine with us. Although there is a liquor store about 2 blocks away, we really didn't want to go back out into the rain. We didn't know what to expect but the place is quite small and very dark. We were seated right away and from what I heard from the table next to ours was that usually you would have to wait if you don't have a reservation. We started off with the bruschetta with fresh mozz and that was delicious. What a great way to start the meal! The table next to us recommended that we try their green bean salad and share an entree as their portions are HUGE! The green bean salad was very refreshing, light, and crisp. Most places tend to over cook green beans, but this was prepared perfectly. For entree we decided to split the shrimp in a spicy red sauce with linguini. WOW, it was probably one of the best spicy red sauce with shrimp I've had anywhere! The only downside is that we waited forever between each course. We had spent over an hour there and had to flag someone down to get our check. The couple of waiters that were there would just walk by our table and not ask if we needed anything else and it took them a long time to clear off our plates. I think the food is good and a place that I would frequent if I lived in that neighborhood. Since I don't, I don't think I will be going there again unless there was a special request.
