While it is a little pricey for pub grub, the ambiance and charm of the place help justify the spend. The area outside is bustling. You walk through the door and couldn't imagine you were still in the city. Warm, cozy and inviting, you feel whisked away to a quiet and charming pub with glowing fireplaces, roomy booths and comfy four-tops. I've been here twice and was happy both times. First time out, I had the Caesar salad which was giant. You really did need a fork and knife as the title declared! Returned for my birthday celebration last night with the family & everyone enjoyed their meal. We started with the Whiskey Wings and they were finger-licking good. Dad even tried to finagle the recipe for the rub out of the waitress, no luck! My sister is a picky, vegetarian, ex-chef with food allergies who is hard to please at a restaurant. She had the Blue Cheese burger and substituted a veggie burger with no hassle. She loved it. Whew! I had the Bison Burger which was delicious and cooked perfectly as ordered. Fries, sweet potato fries & mashed potatoes all got rave reviews. While the prices are high, we all took leftovers home to enjoy a second meal.
