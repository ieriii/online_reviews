Quite good food. Better, even, than you'd think based on first impressions. Came here for Chef Week. Will be back. This is a hip, young restaurant with a predominantly hip young crowd in Fulton Market. The food is excellent, pork heavy (artisinal hams, fried pig's ears on your salad), locally sourced, with a large selection of seafood items that were likely added for Lent. The servers are all hip and young, but totally know their food: knowledgeable, attentive, smart.  As a not young, not hip person eating alone, I had a lovely meal.
