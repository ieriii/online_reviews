Listen, if you go here...you will have to wait. For probably around an hour. Why? Because it's good and thus, it's popular. This seems to annoy a lot of people, and it often annoys me too. However, you can't blame the restaurant for this! It just is what it is. Moreover, there is nothing vegan offered (as mentioned by someone below). But guess what, breakfast is basically the most difficult meal to offer anything vegan for, and since they don't claim to have anything for you, you shouldn't expect them to! Someone with strict dietary restrictions needs to take responsibility for the bizzare choices they have made in life, and call ahead!!  That said, I love the food here, and since I am a regular, the hosts always recognize me and write my name down without me having to say it. I find that touching. I also think that contrary to some other people's comments, the service is pretty darn good considering how busy this place is. The food is consistent and the brunch beverages are amazing. This place isn't cheap or fast, but the food is delicious if you have time for it. So take a deep breath and head over there to get your name on the list BEFORE you realize you are starving.
