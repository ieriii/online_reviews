Love the ambiance! If you don't eat beef or pork, then u have a very limited selection of dishes to choose to from, however, the garlic shrimp are very good. For those who don't know, (I just found out at the restaurant) Tapa means small plate. Therefore you have to order at least 3-4 plates to get the equivalent of a regular meal. The potatoes are great (basically smooth tater tots with spicy cheese) and the bread they serve is divine! Overall, I love the place, but it is not a place to go when you are starving, because it can be on the pricey side.
