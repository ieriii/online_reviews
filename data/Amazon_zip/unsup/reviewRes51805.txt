"What to Expect When You're Expecting...Deep Dish Pizza" "Inadequate service, Deep Dish Pizza can better be described as a type of Lasagna Pie" I was told that only Chicago could serve truly great deep dish pizza and so I waited till my first trip to Chicago to indulge. I love pizza. Pizza quality varies from place to place but I am just as likely to enjoy a $1.50 frozen pizza as much as I would enjoy a $20 pie from Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. I've enjoyed the (surprisingly sub-)standard pizza in Rome and dined on the "tacky" Calif. Pizza Kitchen. That said, what does Gino's bring? SERVICE SUCKS. Well, I happened to go on a weekday and was 3rd in line...took 1/2 an hour...can you believe it? It probably would have been faster if I sat at the bar but I wanted a table...so when I got to the front I mentioned that and they said it'd take another 15 minutes for a table. Guess what? After calling my name, the hostess STILL sat me at the bar. Waste of 45 minutes. Can the service really be THAT bad with only 5 people in line? After asking for a medium deep dish pizza, the waiter recommended I order smalll pizza; Warned me that most people who go solo find the small pizza filling. I disregarded that and proceeded to order the medium and GLAD that I did. I mean really, how many times am I in Chicago? The pizza was every bit as monstrous as people told me....for first timers, it's LIKE LASAGNA BUT WITH A CRUST. You have layers and layers of toppings. Was it good? It was okay. The quality of toppings was decent. Better than any delivery place but not as fresh as any of the premier NYC pizzerias. It amazes people because it really just is a really heavy and thick pie; I mean truly, deep dish pizza is a tomato, cheese and meat pie.
