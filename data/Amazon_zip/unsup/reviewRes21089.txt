I came for breakfast again today. No line!! The cashiers were very nice and informative. I ordered a original bean to cup chocolate drink, a churro and a ham & cheese bread pudding since they ran out of egg empanadas =( The chocolate was very rich and delicious. The churro was good but not as good as the 1st one I had, I felt like it was sitting for a long time. The bread pudding took awhile to come and when I received it it was a bit warm and wasn't really what I was expecting. It was flavorful but nothing really stood out. I probably wouldn't order it again. The chorizo and egg tortas thought, those looked amazing! Im definitely going to try that for breakfast next time. And there are also serving an open torta with a poached egg with tomato broth, I saw a lot of people order that, the portion looked tiny but still good. What I really want to try is the chocolate cake flan!!! I shall be back!!
