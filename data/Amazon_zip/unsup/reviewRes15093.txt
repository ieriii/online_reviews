I really want to love the Violet Hour because I have friends who work there and they are all great at what they do. Unfortunately, there are other people who work there that make going there into a terrible experience. When it's good, it's very good; but when it's bad, it's horrid. And with all of the other great bars with great drinks, friendlier ambiance, and cheaper prices, the Violet Hour has truly lost its allure. I think that they should focus on making this bar a wonderful experience and lose the pretense. A bar is not a hipster record store...It's a place where you go to enjoy cocktails and the company of your friends. There is no need for employees who are condescending, insulting, and downright mean to customers.
