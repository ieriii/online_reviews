Very disappointing. Fancy overpriced versions of traditional tapas with a poor understanding of Spanish gastronomy. Olives portion is extremely small, jamon serrano was probably cut yesterday and a bit dry already. Croquetas were fine but romescu sauce on the side was a sad interpretation of the original and fantastic Spanish version. Overall yo do not get what you pay for. Average tab per person with a glass of wine is over $75. If you ever tried an authentic Spanish tapas place this one will disappoint you.
