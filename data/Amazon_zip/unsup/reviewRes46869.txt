My dining companion and I arrived at 6:30 pm and the dining room was virtually empty, which was pleasant. As the room began to fill up patrons were seated shoulder-to-shoulder for no apparent reason other than to accommodate the wait staff, certainly not the patrons. When there are many, many empty tables, why seat patrons shoulder-to-shoulder? We ordered meatloaf. Pricey at $18 and mediocre. It would have been a nice addition if a crust of bread had been offered. Nope. Bread is too expensive to be offered with meatloaf? The room has a delightful ambience that is attractive. I used to live in the neighborhood and returned for a nostalgia trip. Alas, the food has gone down in quality, but not the prices. The neighborhood needs a restaurant like Uncommon Ground, however, but management needs to be more patron-friendly. Give patrons some space when the room is virtually empty and toss them a crust of bread, please?
