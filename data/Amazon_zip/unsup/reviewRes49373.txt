alliance is my stop most mornings. the thought of that intelligentsia espresso is what drags me out of bed. i'm a fan of straight up espresso over ice with some half and half thrown in (to widen the waitline). but now that it's cold weather i need to find a new drink of the day. most of the people behind the bar recognize me at this point...and are even offering suggestions for my new warm drink of choice for the bitter mornings. i like their suggestions. maybe i'll just mix it up all winter. i like the attention.
