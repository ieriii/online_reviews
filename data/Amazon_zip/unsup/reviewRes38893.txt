Doesn't get much better all around package than Longman & Eagle. The food is top notch (don't miss the bar snacks), the beer and whiskey selection is of the highest quality and pretty deep. The bloody mary for brunch is excellent and the desserts (don't miss the Fernet Float/Fizz if they have it). Basically everything here is really good and tasty. Another gem here is that there is a hotel / B&B above the restaurant. The rooms are really cool and all the amenities are excellent. So in theory you can basically live at Longman & Eagle and be forever happy.
