Every course was absolutely delicious. Our waiter was exceptional. I had bone in porterhouse with 7 oz lobster tail. The lobster was sweet, tender, and cooked to perfection. The steak was tender and extremely flavorful. Probably the best lobster and steak that i've ever had. Would highly recommend.
