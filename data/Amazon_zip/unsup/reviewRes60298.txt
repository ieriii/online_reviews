I'm still not sure I'm that impressed with this place. I moved around the corner about 3 months ago, and I'm constantly seeing lines to get in here on weekend mornings. I'm not sure why. The service isn't friendly, that's for sure and that's a big factor in my return. The menu items are kind of bland I think, so there's no need for me to be waiting in those lines on the weekends. I bet it would be cozy inside during the winter months to have some coffee and read the paper, but I don't see the hype here. I did try the Panini with Hummus, Grilled Zucchini, Roasted Red Pepper, and Spinach the other day and that was pretty decent, but I just feel that they lack in selection. Most of the other sandwiches I have tried here are pretty boring. They lack creativity. They do need friendly service. That's a must.
