Well this was an interesting place. I went to Chicago for one night with a group of friends (six of us) and we found the Inn at Lincoln Park by chance. Managed to book a room with two beds for just around $60 after fees, with a military discount. The hotel is really quite charming in an old boutique sort of way, but it is by no means fancy or super clean. Our room was very cool - used to be two rooms, so it had two walk-in closets and two full bathrooms. Since we are young and were just looking for somewhere to sleep for one night, it worked really well. I don't think I'd go back there with my family, though. Downside: I don't think they had cleaned the comforter OR sheets in a while. There were some interesting stains on them and the wall. We avoided these by using our own blankets and pillows. Perk: They have free breakfast downstairs every morning. Pretty decent. And they didn't seem to care that six of us were staying in one room.
