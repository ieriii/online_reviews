TWO HOURS. I would give this review five stars if not for the wait. I get that there's a wait, but when you pick the only day of the week to NOT accept take-out orders...*sigh*. Doug was there to receive everyone's order. When I was up, he managed to make me feel like his total undivided attention was on my order. Not the five cooks behind him or the three servers/bussers roaming around. Of course, I had to get one of the specialty dogs. Checked out the buffalo version topped with blue cheese. Yeah, I also got me some duck fat fries. Did you know they serve Gus? That's Grown Up Soda for those of us that either dine at a Thomas Keller establishment *or* find themselves chillin' at Whole Foods. Dry pomegranate was a perfect counter to my meal. Oh yeah, this is embedded in residential. Take a taxi or rent a car. DO NOT WALK. Take it from someone who should've known better.
