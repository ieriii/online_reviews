I give Brazzaz 4 stars overall. First, they have the best corkage price of the Brazilian Steakhouses at $20/bottle. While they did amend it sometime last year to only allow corkage on bottles NOT on their list, since they don't have a list actually posted online, it should be pretty easy to complain your way out of it. However, they may find other ways to tell you to go f*** yourself and not come back. Last time I went was with 2 friends to celebrate a birthday and I brought a magnum (1.5L) of Duckhorn and while I emailed one of the managers ahead of time that I'd be bringing this (since I knew it was on their list) which he said was fine, another manager came to our table once we got there to tell us that it was illegal for them to open a bottle that large for only 3 people because it was too much alcohol to serve at one time, but they had already opened it so they would flaunt the law in this instance. While this is technically the law (as was explained to me while I was golfing with a manager from Wildfire), managers have discretion in applying it. It was the first time I had encountered this and it was really a way of them telling me to piss off with my wine in the future. The best thing about Brazzaz by far is the shrimp and they love sending out Buy One-Get One coupons a few times a year (although the limits on them have increased a lot the last couple years). Overall, I give them 4 stars for their awesome shrimp, cheap corkage (although occasionally problematic), and high number of coupons. However, after my last experience with that manager, I'm only planning on going when I have coupons and certificates in hand so I can put another dent or two in their bottom line!
