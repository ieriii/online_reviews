I like my sausages--you know bratwurst, polish, the occasional hot dog during a nice hot summer day bbq...but Hot Doug's really bring sausage...aka encased meat....to a new level. I was told that you wait in line outside. Hmmm...waiting outside on a 25 degree day in Chicago in December? All I could think was, this better be worth it. So, you wait in line, you get inside and peruse the menu. I kinda felt like I was in the circus with all the bright colors, and wondered if the normal looking picture of Britney Spears meant that she had been there pre-baby/craziness? BUT---on the menu---all different kinds of sausage that you never could imagine. I had the pork cheddarwurst--which was a special sausage of the day. It was so good, it had cheddar oozing out of it, white cheddar on top of it and some sort of delicious sauce/mayo on top. Also split the duck-fat fries--yes that's right--duck fat. They only have them on Fridays and Saturdays, but they are good. Pretty much you shouldn't eat anything the rest of the day because a sausage and fries complete your daily allotment of fat and calories...haha Three people could definitly split an order of fries. The staff was friendly. I know I appreciated the fact that there was a place to sit when the food came out. There was one guy who quickly wiped off tables and directed waiting people where they could sit.
