Be weary of the servers. I had my phone stolen here - a $600 phone. Out with family enjoying ourselves. I walk away from the table for 2 minutes with my niece, and I come back and my phone is gone. There was no one else around and the servers would not admit it. Management would not even ask their servers. They told me their servers would not do anything like that. My entire family (6 of us) saw my phone on the table. 2 minutes later it was gone. They claim they have security cameras. Even corporate apparently "reviewed" the tapes and said they did not see anything. I have been calling for 2 weeks and have received no cooperation from the staff. Keep your phone on you at all times and any valuables at this restaurant!
