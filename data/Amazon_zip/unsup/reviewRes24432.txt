Great bakery and beautiful interior!  You can buy specialty bakery/dessert items at the bakery counter to go or to have inside. There is so much to choose from and they are all delicious. I went in today and ordered the Mango Mousse Cake. It's a steal for under $3 and went well with my iced coffee from the bar. It was fluffy, airy and not overly sweet. Definitely a treat! The employees are really nice and the place is always kept clean. It does get pretty full in here but if you can, check this place out next time you're in greektown!
