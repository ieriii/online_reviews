This pizza place is certainly one of the greatest of Chicago. The place is well located, the menu and the variety of the pizzas are very good and the stuffed Pizza is amazing.Another good thing is that you can pick the toppings that you want and if you want to eat different pizzas every time you can !I went there with my family and after that with my girlfriend, and in both occasions we had delicious food with great treatment, so I recommend !
