JACKPOT - How can this NOT be 5-stars?!?!? This has everything you could want, Kobe Beef, amazing sashimi/sushi quality, great drinks, and a fun scene! I usually get scared when I see Asian Fusion - usually that equates to over priced poorly conceived trendy food - fortunately, no fear needed at Sunda. A group of us came in and opened a can of whoop-ass on the menu - I mean we explored the space! From the chips with sauce they bring before you order to the RIDICULOUS (aptly named) dessert, everything was "O"- Tastic.  Some key highlights (i.e. DO NOT MISS): Everything... and: -Seared Kobe on crispy rice - literally just melts in your mouth -Truffled Tataki Sashimi -Lobster & Wagyu Roll -RIDICULOUS dessert - don't care if you are allergic to chocolate - order this!!!! Make sure you come hungry and with some deep pockets, but it won't be a meal you soon forget.
