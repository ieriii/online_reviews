Xoco does fantastic tortas! My favorites: -Carne Asada: flank steak, green garlic chimichurri, mushrooms, crema; seasonal. -Ahogada: pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions; available daily. -Pork Belly: dark salsa negra glaze, bacon, arugula, queso anejo; available Wednesdays. The flavor combinations are thoughtful, and you can tell the sandwiches are put together with care. The tortas don't rely on copious amounts of oil, butter, or cheese to taste good. The bread is remarkable, crisp outside but yielding within. The ratio of bread to filling is good; almost all bites but maybe the last will have some of the tasty filling. The salsa that's served alongside is also great; the sandwiches are strong enough to stand alone, but a little salsa never hurt anything. I'm pretty sure no one can argue that Rick Bayless knows what he's doing when it comes to sandwiches. Take advantage of the complimentary sparkling water with lime. Prices range from $9.00-$12.75 per sandwich, but I feel that the flavor and quality justify the price. The sandwiches are filling but not monstrous. When I don't mind spending a little more, I really love coming to Xoco for lunch. Although I've heard the waits can be long during peak meal hours, I usually arrive between 2pm and 3pm and am able to order and sit right away. While many rave about the soft serve and churros, I liked them but wouldn't make those items the reason to come to Xoco. I like the soft serve at nearby Pinkberry (salted caramel!) and Grahamwich (cinnamon apple pie!) much more. And the churros filled with dulce de leche at Navy Pier receive an 'A' from me. Xoco's Aztec hot chocolate was nice, but I prefer the hot chocolate from Mindy Segal's Hot Chocolate. I've read the pressed sandwiches and soups are excellent so I'll have to branch out from the tortas at some point. I highly recommend Xoco's tortas!
