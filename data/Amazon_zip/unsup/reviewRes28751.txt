Ordered a deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, and onions. This pie was OUTSTANDING. The big chunks of sausage and thick slices of pepperoni were really delicious. The gooey cheesey crust was great was well. Delivery was on-time. Price was a little stiff at $28 for a large three topping. I only wish they would have been as generous with the onions as they were with the pepperoni.
