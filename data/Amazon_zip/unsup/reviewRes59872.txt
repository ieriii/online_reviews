I've written about Kinzie Chop House last year and gave it 4 stars. This place DESERVES a 10~! It's to bad I can only give it a 5. Let me start out by saying Elyse Cowles is hands down the best host one could have. She has always made my stay there seem like I was home. When friends and family visit, Kinzie Chop House is always one of the place we stop to eat. I would like to thank Elyse for making me and my family feel welcome even when I forget to make reservations. I had one bad experience where I make reservations at another restaurant (GILT) and the other restaurant (GILT) had the days mixed up and weren't very apologetic.. If you are on Kinzie, stop by the Chop House and receive a warm welcome.
