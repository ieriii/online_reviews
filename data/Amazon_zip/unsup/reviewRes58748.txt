Let me say that the "haters" can stay home... take it for what it is, and don't deconstruct what they are trying to do at Graham Elliot!As I told the manger on Sat night, "Your staff are charming and nice. The food is exquisite. The prices are fair, and the ambiance is awesome. I just don't know what else you can do right."If you are considering going to Graham Elliot, just go, enjoy it, don't let the hype ruin this fantastic dining experience. It really is unique!High lights:- Cheese its on top of my risotto- A waiter showing me where the restroom was (weird-but a nice touch; most people point in a general direction, not what you want if your drink is $6)- Sat us right away, with seating options- Excited, and entertaining staff- Amazing food- Great music- I didn't feel alone wearing my Chuck Taylors
