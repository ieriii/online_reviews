I love San Soo Gab San!!! Usually I come here for the do-it-yourself bbq (you have to order at least two dishes to cook it yourself), but the last time I was here I got the Cold Noodles and it was very tasty. You get tons of the side dishes (about 20; sometimes not all of them come out - but if you go with a Korean person, they never forget one, plus they are extra nice and attentive to you). Be forewarned though, you will come out smelling like everyone's dinner!!! So bring a change of clothes, or make this the last thing you do before a shower.
