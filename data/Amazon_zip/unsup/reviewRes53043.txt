Nice cuban cafe/restaurant. BYOB factor is always a plus.I LOVE cuban food with a lot of flavor. This place is good, but not great. I had the pork special dish-similar to lechon. Some of the pieces were more flavorful than others. I haven't had excellent lechon since Ibi's went out of business. =( Overall, prices are pretty good, food is average to good and the BYOB would make me a repeat customer. Someone compared it to Irazu. In my opinion, the food is better at Irazu. For Cuban, this place is at the better end of OK.
