Stopped in at the Chicago diner for a quick pick up order and upon walking in and being greeted I couldn't believe how friendly the staff was! I was so delighted everyone was so helpful I felt right at home just waiting for my food to be brought out. I really like that they have sweet potato fries, sometimes hard to find but a personal favorite. we just got a few sandwiches but they were pretty amazing, I tend to eat mostly vegetarian and vegan and this place is perfect for all the above. I would say a perfect five but I will have to go a few more times and actually eat in but so far I have been pleasantly surprised with everything! Will be sure to get back soon!
