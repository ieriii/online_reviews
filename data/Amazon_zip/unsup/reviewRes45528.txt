Wow, what can I say! I had been wanting to try this place for awhile now. I actually studied abroad for a bit researching Oscar Wilde, so it only seemed fitting I try the restaurant inspired by him in lakeview. I took my man here for a tasty dinner. The atmosphere was great, it was so cozy and warm feeling and the gay men who made up the serving staff were very friendly and helpful (even though they all looked like a clone of the last). We had the Potato Rissoles for an appetizer. YUM! They tasted like fried mashed potato bites! For my entree, I figured Shepherds Pie would be the fitting choice. It was great too, but definitely a heavy meal. Overall, everything was more than satisfactory right down to the "I can resist anything but temptation" Oscar Wilde Quote etched on the ceiling. The one thing that could improve could be the drinks, I probably had the most watered down vodka cranberry I've ever had in my life that night.
