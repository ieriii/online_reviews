Killer milkshakes, great classic food, but sometimes their faux-meat main dishes can go a bit overboard (some of their burgers are just overloaded with flavors, which can be overwhelming). The staff are all super friendly and interesting, but the noise level in there can be a little crazy. Really, a 3.5 rating, but I'll give them four because I've had good times there.
