Purple Pig did not disappoint, as good as when I went last April. The menu had a few carry-over items like the whipped feta and beets, but had a lot of new options as well. The wine selection is great, though the wine list needs a makeover as it is just too cluttered to read. Our waiter did a great job of selecting our wines though. The whipped feta was again delicious, the roasted cauliflower was good though a bit "pickley", beets were delicious as ever, the mortadella smear was rich. Another table had ordered desserts that looked delicious, will have to try those next time. Great service for a big lunch crowd!
