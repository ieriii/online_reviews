This place has excellent Italian food, and their menu changes weekly, which shows that they serve fresh, new creative dishes. I had Tilapia with tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers in a Tarragon butter. They serve you hot Italian bread with a side of cheese. While I dont recommend the Caesar salad, the bruscetta looked great.Also, I dont usually order dessert, but save room for their incredible Tiramisu!!!!
