Went for all you can eat king crab legs. Worth the $45-$50 price tag. Nice warm crispy and fresh crab legs kept on rollin'. The servers were attentive. Did not feel rushed at all. You can tell they appreciate the business. Just wished they had Corona...it goes great with crabs... I will be back. Be prepared for my eating frenzy, Glenn's.
