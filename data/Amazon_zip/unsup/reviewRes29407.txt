Excellent Mexican food with real good drinks to boot. Started with the half-sized grand platter which included ceviche, raw oysters, and some shrimp cocktail thing. Seafood was very fresh. I had the Carne Asada Brava as an entree, which was a steak marinated in a spicy salsa. Damn good. The person I was with had the tacos al pastor, which was also very good. Guacamole is a must try at this place too. We drank 3 rounds of their "Trago Bravo," which is a silver tequila shot with a salt-rimmed sangrita chaser (sangrita is like bloody mary mix). Be sure to get the tequila shot chilled (this is the ONLY way to drink tequila). I think I may have a new favorite shot. The margaritas were decent (not as strong as I like them). My only slight knock on this place is the service. It was a little slow and the place was really not busy, but the food & drink more than made up for it. Nice bar area too.
