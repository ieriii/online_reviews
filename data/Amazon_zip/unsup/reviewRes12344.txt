I really like Piece because they offer a big open space and great atmosphere. I have been there a number of times, but last Saturday night I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday before heading to the Double Door. We had a large raised area to ourselves which was great. Everyone started off with some of their self made brew which was very tasty. Then we ordered a bunch of different pizzas and started to settle in for some fun. The pizzas arrived and we all were digging in. I had a slice of white pizza with spinach and mushrooms as well as a slice of pepperoni. Both were very good. The crust was crispy but still had that floppy quality you like when you pick up a slice. By this time the place was really crowded, so we didn't happen to notice that a tiny older woman had slipped in behind our table. Unfortunately, she took the cash out of my wallet and another girl's wallet before one of the staff saw her from across the bar. He tried to catch her but she took off in a white minivan getaway car that was waiting out front! Myself and the other girl had no idea what was going on....talk about excitement and drama. We ended up sitting in a cop car out front while the manager gave a description on her. This was definitely a freak thing, and the manager felt awful. He was great though, and gave us both significant gift certificates for the next couple of times we came in. I know this is a weird situation, and upon careful consideration...I decided not to let what went down impact my review. So I give Piece four stars, with the knowledge that I will definitely go back.
