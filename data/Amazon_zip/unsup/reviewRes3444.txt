Oh, Crisp. How badly I wanted to love your chicken wings. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I may have set my expectations too high. A friend and I indulged in Crisp a few weeks ago after a rousing game of Scrabble. After battling below-zero temps, I was very excited to attack some celebratory wings. Per Yelp reviewers' recommendations, I ordered both the Seoul Sassy and Buffalo wings, while my friend sampled a Bad Boy Buddha Bowl. The wings themselves were pretty fantastic, I loved the overwhelming size of the actual wing, in lieu of a wimpy drumstick, and the meat was juicy and tender. However, I found the Sassy Seoul sauce to be lacking, and overly sweet. I was surprised to enjoy the buffalo sauce more. The Bad Boy Buddha also didn't meet expectations. The flavors were very bland, and only salvaged by piles of sriracha sauce. I'd try Crisp again, but definitely not my favorite chicken wing experience.
