Bin36 has a great wine selection. I've only tried their food once but its not the best. If you are a cheese fan, you must try their cheese flights! I only go here for their wine. I love their white wine flights and the price is not expensive at all. One wine I recommend is the riesling by Dr. Loosen, its orgasmic!! The first time I tried it there, I was able to buy 3 bottles too. I think it's great that they sell the wine bottles too. The staff is organized and nice which is a plus too. I love going here and I recommend this place to anyone who is a wine lover :O)
