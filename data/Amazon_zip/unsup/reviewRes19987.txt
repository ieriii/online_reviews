OHMYGAHHH. This place is delicious. I went here by myself for lunch and got the Torta Ahogada. It was amazing and extremely flavorful. They give you the option of choosing the spiciness level and the mild was plenty spicy. The torta comes sitting on a bowl of tomato broth. I wasn't sure if I was suppose to drink the broth after, but I did it anyways cause it was that good. I saved room for the churros and they were just the most amazing churros I've ever had. This might be because it came with ice cream and chocolate. I went back for the churros after dinner. It was that good.
