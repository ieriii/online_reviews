Amazing, amazing pizza with great staff to boot. Every kind of pizza I've had has been fantastic -- especially the 5 queso and the BBQ chicken. I wouldn't take Steve B's review seriously - a) there's no way he waited any more than 20 minutes for a pizza. The way the place is set up is wayyy too intimate for a crabass customer to wait that long leering, and b) 3 of his 4 reviews are one star. What an awesome guy..
