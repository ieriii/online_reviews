I love this place. I usually do pickup and my order is generally ready in 5-10 minutes. The sandwiches are fantastic, and the empanadas are amazing as well. The staff is always nice on the phone and in person. The manger is always helpful and available. Good service, good food, and reasonably priced. I recommend getting a sandwich (anything besides the Cuban...expand yourself) and an empanada or two. Their specialized Cuban coffee is great also, though I wish they were open in the morning so I could grab one before work.
