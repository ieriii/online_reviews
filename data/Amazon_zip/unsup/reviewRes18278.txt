Caro Mio is an unexpected gem in the heart of Ravenswood. It's extremely easy to access off the Montrose Brown Line stop, or by car since there is ample parking on the street. The Italian food is so good, I am embarrassed to say I ever went to an Olive Garden for Italian cuisine.  I suggest the gnocchi because of how light and pillow-like the little dumplings are. The spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola and red cream sauce is out of this world. And it being BYOB without a corkage fee is awesome! Caro Mio is a restaurant that runs at the pace of old world Italy. You go there to enjoy your company, wine and food. No need to rush, because you can't - the servers are very laid back. Enjoy the food!
