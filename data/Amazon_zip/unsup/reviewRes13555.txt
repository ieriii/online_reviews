MARRRTTTYYYYYY! My party of 10 came in this afternoon for beer and food after whirlyball. Marty, our server, was honestly the best server I have had in years. This is coming from a 5 year fine dining server downtown. He was SO informative, went the extra mile (brought a different kind of tequila for one of our guests just to try without prompting) and knew when to approach and when to back off. The food was off the chain. You cannot go wrong. Such a great experience I can't put it into words. Thank you Revolution!
