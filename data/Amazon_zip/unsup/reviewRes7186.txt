Um, yes, please!! This place is so delicious, from the homemade bread and butter pickles and "pig-spice" chips they start you off with, to the appetizers and cocktails... just fantastic. And the place is gorgeous, not the ambiance you would expect from a barbecue place. We got the bacon cheddar hush puppies to start because it seemed truly un-American not to. God Bless patriotism. They were fluffy and light with a great dipping sauce. I had the barbecue flight appetizer as a main, which was plenty of food for me, though I imagine a guy would probably want something heartier. The brisket was my fave on the flight. Comes with cornbread, which was awesome. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich, which she loved. The sazerac is delicious, if you're into whisky cocktails... which you should be if you're eating barbecue, they go quite well together. The service was totally outstanding, and I'm not just saying that because our server was hot (full disclosure: he was). Every person that worked at that place was cordial and friendly, and we had an awesome time. I saw some party rooms upstairs, I would def check this place out again with a big group.
