My first time trying Vietnamese food and I loved it. I ordered the rice vermicelli w/ beef only and added cilantro as well. It was too die for,cannot wait to go back. I also had a great refreshing drink especially good for the summer, it was a fresh squeezed lime juice with club soda on ice. It was all just perfect!
