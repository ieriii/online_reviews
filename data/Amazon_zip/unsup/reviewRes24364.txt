after eating here several more times and after they catered my friend's wedding (best wedding food ever), i am now in love with irazu. one of my favorite restaurants in chicago actually. i bike by it every day and it smells so so so good. and it's real tasty and reasonably priced. perfect guacamole. delicious sandwiches and burritos. go here!
