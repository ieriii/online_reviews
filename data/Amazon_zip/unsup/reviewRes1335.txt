three words: FANTASTIC, exotic, yummy. The line is a little much, but don't get there at 3pm or later (it closes at 4). Use that head of yours!  A smallish wait if you come at the right time (30 min) is definately worth your dollar here for the game dogs. The fries are not all that spectacular. It will have you coming back again.
