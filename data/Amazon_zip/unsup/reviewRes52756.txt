We set out to find this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and Guy Fieri sure knew what he was talking about! We started with some tropical raspberry tea and passion fruit conconction, which was incredibly refreshing. The empanada trio, of which you can choose any three was great! We chose chorizo and goat cheese, spinach, and ropa vieja. My boyfriend HATES goat cheese, but loved the empanadas! I had one of Guy Fieri's faves for dinner, the Puerco Rostizado, which was roasted, shredded pork with carmalized onions and several different fruits and seasonings. It was served with black beans, rice, and caramelized plantains. Yum! My boyfriend had the masas de puerco, which were braised pork shoulder and they were absolutely declicious! It reminded him of the pernil at Carnaval only way better. He is a tough man to please when it comes to Latin cuisine and he was definitely impressed! The patio is gorgeous and I love that it is BYOB. We will definitely be back! Oh, and also, my son's grilled cheese sandwhich with Yucca fries was to die for! I appreciated that they even tried to spice up the kids menu! :)
