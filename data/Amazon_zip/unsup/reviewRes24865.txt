The following is a conversation between my newly acquired Polish roommate and myself. Me: Where are we going tonight? What are you wearing? Roommate: We are top-o-less Me: WHAT? Roommate: We are going to ARE-TOP-O-LESS Me: What? Do you mean ART-TROP-OLIS Roommate: No, that's the art show thing. This is a food thing. Me: Um, okay. I'll go, but I am wearing a shirt... Aside from the misnomer (everyone wears a shirt including males named Art), and the loosely described cuisine (not traditional Greek), this place is great. The atmosphere is very "Euro Cafe" and the desserts are adorable and yummy...like the waitstaff.
