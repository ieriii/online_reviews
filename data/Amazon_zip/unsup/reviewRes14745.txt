Made it to Sabatino's with some friends for the first time this past Saturday. Man, am I glad I went. Old School Italian done unlike many places. I love veal (don't hate). Sabatino's has about 15 veal entrees. I elected to go with the Bracoile. It was very good. Started out with a Toscana salad (Tomatoes and Onions). It was great. Didn't have room for desert, but took a canoly to go anyway. Dinner for 4 ran about $100. You can't beat those prices. I'll definitely be back. On a side note, if you go be thankful for the smoking ban. It is easy to see how this place was probably, at one time, a dense cloud of smoke. They also have a piano bar.
