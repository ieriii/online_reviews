My girlfriend and I wanted to try XOCO since it opened, and we finally made it there yesterday directly after leaving the office at 5:00. It was a good time to arrive, since we waited only about 15 minutes to order and grab a table. We ordered chips and guacamole, the woodland mushroom sandwich, and the cochinita pibil sandwich. Everything was tasty. I had the cochinita pibil, and the pork was moist and tender, but what really stole the show was the habanero salsa. Rick Bayless captured everything I love about habaneros in that salsa, the bright pepper flavor, and the intense searing heat. It's difficult to capture both at the same time, the heat usually overpowers the pepper. Nice job, Rick! There was nothing unique about the guacamole, but it was as fresh and tasty as you can get. The woodland mushroom sandwich had a generous helping of goat cheese, and a nice roasted pepper salsa. There are several beer selections available, including Three Floyds Alpha King. We chose a 750 ml bottle of Goose Island Matilda. There are more than enough reasons to make a return trip to XOCO, several hot chocolates, tempting soups, even a breakfast menu. Next time! The service was perfectly adequate for the type of restaurant. This is not a fine dining establishment, but everyone was friendly and the food arrived quickly. Rick has hit a home run with XOCO. If you're a fan, you must try it! As a side note, I refuse to dock an restaurant stars for a wait. If waiting for a table makes it an unpleasant experience, go somewhere else. There are some places that I love, but I avoid them when I am feeling impatient.
