Bland and boring. Even half price margaritas can't get me back here. I've been here quite a few times (I have no idea how I keep going back) but it's never been all that great. There is no spice or flavor in their food. I'm an enchiladas type of gal so that's usually my go-to dish. Last time we went there, my boyfriend got a steak dish recommended by the waiter. He wasn't impressed and slightly disappointed that he went with it. Oh well, our bellies were full so that was a plus. Just nothing to write home about so you're better off somewhere else....even though we're still trying to find that awesome Mexican restaurant.
