Proly my favorite food experience in Chicago. The line was an hour long but if you order take out you go straight to the front so that's what we decided to do and just took it back to the hotel. The frustrating part was that there were 2 stupid groups of 6 people that had finished dinner and dessert with empty drinks just enjoying there time together when we walked in (completely oblivious to the fact there was a line out the door that resulted in an hour wait). This is one of the reasons we ordered takeout and of course, 45 minutes later when I left with the food those two asian groups were still there chatting it up. Unbelievable! Anyways, the food was amazing. My girlfriend and I split the Pepito torta (shortribs, carmelized onions, mushrooms etc.). It was to die for. We also got a spicy pork belly soup that had noodles and fresh veggies. To top it off we got a churro for dessert that was so hot it almost burned my girlfriends hand. For only spending $40 for 3 people and to get that quality of food is ridiculous and only made the meal that much better in my eyes. Will definitely be going back next time I am in town.
