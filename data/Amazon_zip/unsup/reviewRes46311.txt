The first thing I remember about GLC is that everything on the massive menu looks contrived and commercialized. And also very delicious. Outsized portions, outsized prices, and excellent service marked my first and last trip to GLC. I like the location, and the interior ambiance, so it'll do in a pinch, but with a little planning and forethought I'm sure I could do better too.
