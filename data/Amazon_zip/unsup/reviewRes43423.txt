I wish there was a way to give two seperate star ratings.....one for the food, one for the service. First of all, the pizza is really good. I wouldn't say it's the best out there, but definitely worth the price. The thing that SUCKS about this place is the delivery. I will never order from here again. I continued to order because, as I said, it's good. After multiple consecutive times of late deliveries and cold pizza, though, my patience has run out. Couple that with the little gang banger sounding queef taking orders and I'm through. I called after an hour and a half yesterday to be told the driver is 5 min away. About 25 min later, he showed up. Two hours for a pizza is too long. A discount or an apology would have kept my business, but I got neither. If you're going to get pizza here, pick it up or eat at the restaurant. Good pizza, shitty service.
