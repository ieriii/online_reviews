Food = 4 stars. The chicken is the BEST. With every plate of meat that you order you can feed ATLEAST 2 people. However, the little things they bring to the table have no description. Service = 0 stars, if I could. They're unattentive and not friendly in the slightest. They'll also try to cook the food for you even if you opt to do it yourself. They also decide when you should take it off the grill. Pfft, please woman. I want my beef well done!
