Newly opened place off to a great start!Just stopped in for Brunch with my sweetie. She had the Marscarpone filled French Toast, which was excellent. A suggestion would be to tone down the gratuitous dollops of Marscarpone on either side of the plate. They're fine and tasty, but really not needed, and just add to the cost of preparing the dish without adding any interest. I had the Nanadict, their take on Eggs Bennedict. Very well (as in good) done eggs and just the right balance of flavours. The homefries were quite good as well. A side of scrambled eggs that we shared was very basic. Nothing bad about them, but nothing special. They could have used a little bit of salt. Service was very attentive and friendly, though some of the staff seemed almost shy, which was kind of sweet. The gentleman who seemed to be the proprietor went around to each table to make sure that things were to peoples' liking. He was very stylishly dressed and friendly.  As someone who's moved back to Bridgeport after growing up here, I'm thrilled to have an interesting restaurant open up in my neighborhood. Don't get me wrong... I'm all for the Chinese/Mexican/Italian/Greasy Spoon rotation that we have in abundance. I'm just happy to not have to trudge up to the North Side (gasp!) to have something cool and tasty for breakfast/lunch. I hope the menu expands (and maybe the hours too...). I'll be back!
