This is by far the most romantic place in the city I've been. I've been here several times for dinner. Live Flamenco music, dimly lit by candles and excellent fondue. The beef and lobster combo and chocolate fondue for dessert are my favorites. If you're looking to take someone on a date to share food and each others company in an intimate space, this is the place.
