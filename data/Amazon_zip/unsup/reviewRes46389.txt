Hands down one of my favorite tourist restaurants in the city. The food is absolutely AMAZING and the ambiance of the inside is great. I have never had a bad experience here and always have a great time whether I go for drinks and dessert or a full meal. Plus they don't take reservations so you are able to put your name down, shop a bit, and return to a table. I love it!
