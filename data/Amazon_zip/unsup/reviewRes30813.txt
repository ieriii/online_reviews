I seem to only make it up to this part of town for a special occasion or if someone is in town, and the Chicago Diner is always a win. It can get a little crowded if you go on a weekend, but it's worth the wait and the crowd. The food is fantastic, it really is a vegan or vegetarian dream. And their shakes (chai is the best!) and desserts are to die for, I'm such a sucker for vegan sweets! It's on the pricier side, but that's why it makes a great place to go to on an occasion. The location is ideal, I really like this part of town because it's close to the CTA and other nice hang outs. The food is amazing and the employees are attractive, sounds good to me.
