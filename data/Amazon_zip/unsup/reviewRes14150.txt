I went there last Saturday and was very pleased. It's nice to see more good brewpubs finding a home in Chicago. Revolution Brewing has a good atmosphere upon entering. The lights are orbs hung from the ceiling inside spherical metal frames, that give off a nice soft light. There is a large, wooden wraparound bar in the center of the room, and most of the seating areas are also made of wood, which gives the place a rather warm, older feel. Fists are a strong theme here as the symbol of the brewery, forming some pillars on the bar and all the beertaps. It works. Upon entering I was immediately helped to find a table, but opted to sit up at the bar. Bartenders were courteous, helpful and fairly prompt. I tried several of the beers starting with the Anti-Hero IPA (great name). Anti-Hero was probably the best beer I had there that night. It was well hopped and had a smooth malty background and alcohol level that served it well to finish it off. I followed it up with the Eugene porter which was a solid porter as well. I journeyed into their other beers a bit such as their 3 Floyds collaboration, Gomorrah, and their Workingmans mild, but found them to be a little too watered down for my tastes. To be fair though, I'm not terribly familiar with milds and I may just not be used to the style. In fact, many of their beers have a low alcohol content, which I'm not typically used to in my ales. I'll give the milds another chance some other time. As far as the food goes, tried the Margharita pizza and loved it. My friend tried the duck confit pizza and loved it as well. I'd like to try some of their other food options sometime as it looks they have some good food there. Revolution, keep fighting the good fight. I'll be back soon to throw some more money to your cause.
