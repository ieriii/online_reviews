Very nice looking restaurant from the inside. They definitely spent some bucks remodeling this place. Service is a bit a slow, which some people may actually prefer as it is unlimited meat. One knock I have on Fogo is they keep coming and coming with the meat that you feel bombarded. Zed is a bit more laid back in the regard. My favorite items were the parmesan crusted pork, chimmichurri chicken wings, and the sausage. The salmon, well, tasted like salmon. Nothing really stood out at the harvest table and I thought the sides were bland. I still prefer Fogo, particularly when it comes to the sides and the variety of beef. It seemed like Zed only had 2 or 3 different types of beef while I think Fogo has more. Also, Zed has no filet, which is a major negative in my book.
