The band that was playing was good, and that was about it.The bartender was a miserable old lady as my friend and I decided to order a bottle of wine, and she brought us an open bottle. When I complained to the manager AKA Chris the dick head (as I later called him) instead of apologizing for the bartender's stupidity he decided to join her in rudeness, asking me why I did not say something to her in the first place? My guess is that he was not smart enough to deal with such a gigantic issue. Next, we were also asked to be quiet! But obviously they say that to everybody just to feel important...?Last but not least, when we were ready to depart, I decided that I needed to let the manager Chris the dick head know how I felt about my evening's experience. So, I told him the place was great and the music was too but that I was terribly disappointed by the rudeness of the staff, and yet again he was not smart enough to deal with it and proceeded to tell me in a very sarcastic note yes... OK! and I am going to fire my bartender over two tourists Hence, I decided to call him DICK HEAD because he earned it!!! And he proceeded to tell us to LEAVE!The bouncer then rushed over to escort us out of the place because Chris felt humiliated I guess? What an unprofessional loser!!! I am sure he is very dissatisfied with his miserable life and he needs to find something else to do if that's the case. Maybe the bartender was his MOM?
