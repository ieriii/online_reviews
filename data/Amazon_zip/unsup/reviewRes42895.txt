Love it!! I would recommend going with a group that likes to share and is a bit adventurous. Great atmosphere and prices for a trendy area. We sat in the front, but after going to the bathroom and seeing the entire restaurant I wish we were seated in the back. They played AWESOME music--TV on the Radio, Radiohead--great vibes. We started with sweet balsamic roasted garlic & olive oil. Warm and delicious, but probably the least "special" item of the evening. Next was the beet salad. No complaints here, classic goat cheese and beets with a sweet crunch. For entrees we got the salmon, chicken, gnocchi, and truffle pasta. Each was absolutely outstanding. The chicken was cooked to perfection. Typing this makes me want to go back right now and order the same thing! The sides we got were great also-- cauliflower and brussel sprouts. We were there for a birthday, so dessert is a must. The brownie and apple cake were great--we all wished we tried the carrot cake.
