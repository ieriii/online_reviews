The food here is definitely wallet friendly, but oh so tasty. We had the lentil soup (HUGE portion sizes!), falafel sandwich (yum crisp tasty falafels) and the curry basmati rice. The highlight of my meal was the basmati rice - fluffy rice, tender peas, and great spice. They add the salad on top, I picked the Jerusalem and it was super. One of my top ten cheap eats in town now.
