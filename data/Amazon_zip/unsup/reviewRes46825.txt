This review is long overdue! I've dined here a few times, including last night, which prompted me to finally write about it. The cocktails here are stellar. I've had the agripolitan and lemon ginger martinis before, and they are some of the most pleasant drinks I've ever tasted that still pack a punch. We also had three bottles of champagne for the table; Korbel was their "best" offering, but no matter. Our appetizers were a huge hit. We shared two plates of artichoke, goat cheese and pesto dip, which disappeared within minutes. The flatbread (chipotle BBQ sauce, onion, sausage and chihuahua cheese) went down equally well, but less so the croquettes. They were just "fine," so said most of the group. At UG I tend to let my gluttonous side show: my go-to entree is the bacon-wrapped meatloaf, which is served with the most delectable garlic mashed potatoes. I've also sampled the crispy chicken, roasted whitefish, orrechiette and macaroni and cheese, all of which are worth ordering. Portions are plentiful, and flavors bountiful. It's too far out of my price range and travel radius to visit more often, but it's absolutely worth the trip for a special occasion (preferably on someone else's dime).
