Dammit! Thinking of pho, I think I forgot to write a review about this place when I visited Chicago. First time in Chicago and was craving for pho and didn't know anybody here so what do you guys think I did? That's right I blasted up my phone and searched on Yelp! This place had a lot of good reviews so it must be good right? Well the yelpers were right! This place satisfied my craving! Come on this place is called Tank Noodle and the bowl came out the size of a tank. Okay I'm just exaggerating, but it was pretty huge and delicious if I may add. Hot, flagrance and great broth if I may add. I'm a pho snob so I know good pho when I taste it.
