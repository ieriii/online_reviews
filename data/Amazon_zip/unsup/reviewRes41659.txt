This place has great service and friendly staff. This is always a huge plus for me when dining out and the main reason for the 3 stars. I had the Veggie Pho which was average. The Pho Tai (Basic Beef Strip Pho) smelled really good but my sorry vegetarian booty could not indulge. My dining partner said it was delicious however. I have had plenty of good Pho places in So Cal (Little Saigon A.K.A. Garden Grove) and would say the food at Tank is about average. If you are looking for good Pho try Pho 777 next door and compare. I know I will.
