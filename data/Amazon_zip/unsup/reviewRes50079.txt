Fifty/50 has the feel of a couple different types of establishments for me. Nice outdoor seating for casual eating and people watching. An indoor bar area that has the ceiling open up to an upper level for more intimate dining, but a bar area that is ready for clubbing as soon as the crowd arrives. There are enough TVs to shake a stick at........though why anyone would shake a stick at a TV isn't clear to me..........HEY....it was something my grandma use to say *wink*. Right along the strip in Wicker park, this is one place worth checking out for lunch/dinner or late night drinks.
