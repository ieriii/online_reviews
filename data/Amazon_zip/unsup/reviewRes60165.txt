We lived right down the street from this place and I was tempted to go everyday, especially since the street fills with delicious smells that taunt you every time you walk from the Argyle stop. This restaurant baffles me because it is crowded all day, every day, even during off-peak times.The food is great, there's no denying that. But, I can't say it's particularly better than the other Vietnamese places in Southeast Asia town. I think the atmosphere contributes to its appeal, it's very casual, affordable and quick. I recommend the beef vermicelli noodle bowls, I could eat that every day of my life!
