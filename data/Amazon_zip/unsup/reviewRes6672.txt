Went with co-workers. Valet parking and the inside has a plantation feel to it. They start you with complimentary homemade bread/butter pickles and BBQ chips. Service was great. Now the food. Our group was not crazy about the Mac and cheese side but cornbread, beans, spicy hush puppies, ribs, brisket, and BBQ shredded pork was so very good. When in Chicago definitely try this place. It will not disappoint.
