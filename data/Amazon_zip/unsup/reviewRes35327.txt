Sun Wah is one of my favorite places to chow down, the food is pretty cheap and your portion are big!! For around $6, you can get a combination plate filled with goodies like roast pork, roast duck, bqq pork, etc. They are pretty quick to take your order and it comes out pretty quickly. The only down part is their credit card min is $14, sucks when you're eating alone and have no cash but a debit card on you.
