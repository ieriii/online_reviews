Hmm, I liked it but didn't love it! After reading all the great reviews I was prepared to put this pie on my list of Chicago faves...but not so much. We were quickly seated in the middle of the room. The place is cute enough, just like a neighborhood bar that serves pizza. The beer selection is decent, and the service was prompt and friendly. The pizza came out relatively quickly, considering we got the pan pizza. Now I can appreciate the caramelized (burnt-ish) crust, but I just didn't love it, like I say. I really didn't care for the sauce all that much either. I typically prefer a more fresh, tomatoey sauce (like Lou Malnati's) rather than this sauce which seemed overcooked and tomato paste-y....just not my preference. Anyway, we ordered way too big of a pie, and server put in a styrofoam clamshell thingy to go (a bag would have been nice...maybe I should have asked for one and they could have set me up, but I didn't). The thing was cumbersome to carry around as we walked back to the El...so much so that we were sick of carrying it, so we left it on top of the Red Eye box outside the Apple store (if anyone wants to see if it's still there, there's 3 large slices left...). Perhaps I would go back if I was in the area and had a hankerin' for pizza, but I don't see myself making a special trip.
