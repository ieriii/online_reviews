I was very disappointed with my visit here. I ordered the meatball sub with beef fat fries and when it was walked over to me from 10 feet away, the sandwich was COLD, the break was luke warm and stale, there was maybe a teaspoon of sauce on it and the fries were cold and soggy. I politely asked if I could have my sandwich reheated and I was told they couldn't do anything about it except put it in the oven. When I got back my food, still cold, but not as cold as the looks on the faces of the 4 teenagers in chef uniforms. This place shouldn't serve food.
