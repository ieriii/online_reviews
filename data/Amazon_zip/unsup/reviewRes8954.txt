After reading rave reviews in a magazine I was excited to try this neighborhood pizza place. I have never in my life been treated so horribly in a restaurant - tall, thin, blond waiter (so if you do go, ask for someone else). We arrived at 8:45 and were told the kitchen closed at 9 so we would have to order quickly - fine, no problem. By 9:10 he had delivered the bill (right after we got our food), never returned to ask how it was (soggy, tasteless and haphazard), never asked if we wanted another glass of wine and never refilled our water glasses. It wasn't until 9:20 that he asked if we wanted anything boxed up - no thanks. He didn't even say thank you or make an attempt at basic service. And we were by no means the only people there. Don't waste your money - try Apart Pizza on Montrose and Lincoln.
