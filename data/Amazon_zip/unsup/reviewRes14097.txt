Meh.  Based on all the other reviews, I feel like we were eating at an entirely different place. First off, dinner for two at a one $ place should not have been $45. They were out of the first couple dishes I wanted. NBD, it was around 8pm on a Friday. I went for a pork option with dirty rice and beans. The meat was decent, but dripping with grease/oil. Beans and rice were fine, nothing spectacular. The goat cheese empanadas had a really good flavor, but there was very little cheese inside. I guess I just expected it to be way better based on all the reviews.....
