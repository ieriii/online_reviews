I am a real true Chicagoan born and raised. And as a Chicago girl I must say Superdawg is the best place to get a hotdog. Yeah Gene & Judes in River grove is a close second, but if I am in need of a delicious fat juicy hotdog with crinkle cut fries and let's not forget the green tomato I always go to superawg. I also love their milkshakes too.... I must be honest though I have never tried the hamburger looks good but I can never have anything other than superdawg come out of my mouth when I go there. I love when you go and they say on the intercom HIYA! that's awesome then even in the winter they will bring the food to your car. Now that's service!! My plea to everyone that reads this visit superdawg you will not be disappointed
