If you like beer you like this place but don't forget to have dinner here. The both mussels are good( thai curry & traditional) but i really like the grill cheese, cashew butter, and fig sandwich, it a unique and a change the from the traditional P& J. The slim fries with a aloli goes quick you can't stop eating them.
