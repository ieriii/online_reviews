The first time I came here they had just opened. The restaurant is incredibly charming but the overall experience was pretty average. I came here again over the winter with a large group of friends and I'd have to say we had an amazing meal and a very special time here. I'd say that not everything on the menu is spectacular--and I had some kind of fig tart for dessert that was perfectly awful--but if you ask the waiter for recommendations, you're sure to have a wonderful experience. I'd definitely come back.
