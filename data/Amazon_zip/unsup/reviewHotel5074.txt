I just got in from this place (Saturday), and I won't be going back. When I first arrived there with friends the place wasn't too crowded. The first thing that immediately caught my attention was trying to walk on the very uneven/holey/sticky floors. If you require women to wear heels you should at least have a floor to accommodate that ridiculous rule. There are supposed to be no gym shoes/boots/white t-shirts but most of the people who came after 11pm had on all of the above. Vale was 20$ which isn't bad I suppose but I've definitely had cheaper. To use your card it was a minimum of $25 which I think is completely fucking absurd. The DJ wasn't that awesome at all, played a lot of old music and played the same song maybe three times in the same hour. Once the club was packed they jacked the entrance prices up to 20$ for ladies and 35$ for men, there is no room to navigate, and it's hard to breathe in the stuffy environment. If you paid for bottle service you got let in faster. All in all, there are better places to go for a good time in Chicago. This is just definitely not one of those places.
