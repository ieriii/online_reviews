We stayed here two and a half years ago when we were apartment hunting before moving to the city. I can't say enough good things about it. Every night there is a happy hour buffet of delicious food appetizers - a lot of them Italian like fresh mozzarella and olives and bruschetta. They also have a server making drinks, including their specialty, the Amalfitini, made with lemoncello. When we stayed there we had asked at the front desk for a resonably priced restaurant recommendation. The concierge recommended a delicious restaurant and since she knew someone who worked there, set us up with 25% off the meal and free desserts as well.
