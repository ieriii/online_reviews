Like most Italian restaurants, Mia Francesca can accommodate large groups - which was perfect for a mini-reunion dinner for 10 people! The pastas and main dishes were delicious (and HUGE!). I enjoyed the gnocci and a pizza as an appetizer (it had an egg in the middle! +5). The desserts were also tasty, and the wine list was fairly extensive. Good reds. Service was attentive. Call ahead for reservations.
