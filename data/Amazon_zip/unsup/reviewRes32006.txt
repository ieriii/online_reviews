For my first time at Sunda, I was pretty impressed.  They have a sharing concept, that I wasn't too sure about at first. But, it turned out to work out very well because I could try all of the dishes. I was with a group of four and we got close to a dozen different dishes, including sushi rolls, appetizer of rocky tempura and a duck and egg dish. We also got a Cod dish, which was AMAZING!!! I would highly recommend this to anyone, it is a little pricey but worth it if you don't go all the time.
