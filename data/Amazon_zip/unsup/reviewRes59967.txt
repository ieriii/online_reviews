I purchased a Groupon to Las Tablas a couple of weeks ago since I wanted to treat a Colombian friend to a nice dinner. I drove 45 miles to the city and when we arrived at 4pm on Saturday, we saw a noticed on the window indicating that they only accept Groupon with a reservation. The restaurant was almost empty at the time, but they would not give us a reservation saying that they only accept a limited amount of Groupons per day and they have already met their daily limit based on current reservations. We had a drink at the bar and watched the soccer game, but decided to dine somewhere else. Granted, the Groupon said to call for reservation and mention the Groupon, but it never indicated that they only accepted a limited amount of Groupons per day.
