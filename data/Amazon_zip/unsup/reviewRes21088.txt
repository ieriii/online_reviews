Went here during Chef's Week - last weekend in March. All I can say is WOW! Food was delicious and the service was top-notch. Had a beautiful bordeaux with a very nice filet. Everything was fresh, cooked to perfection and properly portioned. We will most definately be back to take advantage of the outdoor patio this spring
