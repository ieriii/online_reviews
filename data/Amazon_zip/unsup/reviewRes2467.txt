Every time that I drive past Hot Doug's there is a line wrapped around the building, but for some reason the encased meat gods were smiling on me this day cause there was no line. Now I wasn't even hungry, but I knew that this was my opportunity. I ended up getting the Cajun pork sausage with cheese filled peppers and spicy mayo, and I AM HOOKED. On top of that the staff couldn't have been nicer. Next time I go I'll have no problem waiting in line. Good job guys.
