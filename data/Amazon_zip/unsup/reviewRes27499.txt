The deconstructed Wagyu Beef Stroganoff was A-mazing...both whimsical and extremely tasty!! The beef just melts in your mouth. The Duck Confit Agnolotti was also a hit with both of us! The bad: Cheddar Risotto was overpowered by bacon flavor. I love bacon and all things pork, but this was a bit too much of a good thing. Colorado lamb was slightly undercooked for my taste making it a little too chewy and the clementines were too tart; thumbs down on that dish. I wish I had gotten the thanksgiving-style squab instead of the lamb.  Their dessert menu is very uninspiring. You can get a really great meal if you choose the right dishes!
