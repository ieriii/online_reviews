Two friends and I just enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Graham Elliot. Our waiter Jeff was professional, pleasant and very helpful. The sole was delicious as was the salmon. The desserts were fantastic. We had the pleasure of meeting the very creative and lovely pastry chef Judy. Her creations were the highlight of what already had been a great meal.  Judy is a star!
