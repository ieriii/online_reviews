This is my favorite Indian restaurant. The bring out a naan type bread and sauce before the meal- YUM. Seriously, so delicious. The waiters are amazing at refilling water glasses. Every single dish I have ever got there has been to die for. The restaurant is so beautiful, I just love the feel of the place. I will go back every time I'm in Chicago. I only wish this place was closer!
