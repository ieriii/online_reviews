Underground tunnels, what?! Really? Cool. The drinks here are GOOOOODDDDD. Oh and strong. No watered down messes here. Bravo, bartender, bravo! As a former bartender myself, hats off to you ma'am. (Hey, wear some heels and some cute makeup and I bet you'd see a significant spike in tips, just sayin'). The atmosphere is different... I've never been in a bar quite like the Green Mill. The activity here is fantastic - great for anyone who likes music - oh, that's you... and you... and you... and you. Check it out.
