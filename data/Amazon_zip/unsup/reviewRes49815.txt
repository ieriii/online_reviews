Went here for a somewhat special occasion Saturday night meal. The two people with me were craving steak, and both ordered one of the combination dishes that comes with yucca, potatoes, and sweet plantains. They loved their food! I had the vegetarian paella. It wasn't the star of the table but it wasn't bad. I found it a little heavy on beans and potatoes, and I wasn't sold on the broccoli in it, but I would still recommend it if you're up for a jazzed-up version of the dish.  Empanadas appetizers were very good, as was the grilled shrimp and calimari. Our server Carlos was very charming and friendly, and the atmosphere of the place was happy, warm, and lively. Yay Las Tablas!
