how have i never reviewed glenn's!?!? i love everything about this place: right off the el, byob, great service, chalkboard menu, fresh fish with unique combos i've tried the clam chowder (my fave), oysters rockefeller, halibut, shrimp, mahi mahi, scallops, whitefish- all were great. would like to try the lobster roll sometime cuz it sounds delish, but i can never resist the fresh fish options. glenn's is the perfect place for any group- date, friends, family, out of towners, coworkers.
