I just moved into the neighborhood recently from Edgewater. While Edgewater has Argyle, Lincoln Park has Simply It! When I first moved, I was scared of not being able to find a place to dine that didn't put a hole in my wallet and was still up to Argyle standards.However, this place is much, much better than Argyle! Not only is it much cleaner and appealing in decor, but the food is nicely prepared. Their food also tastes like tangible heaven. I stopped by for lunch and enjoyed a nice table by the window. Although the weather wasn't looking too great this week, I was able to warm up with their soup and enjoy their appetizers.I'm definitely looking forward to coming by more often!
