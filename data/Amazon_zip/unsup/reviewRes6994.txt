I went to Sapori Trattoria the other night in pursuit of some tasty Italian food. I wanted something more sophisticated than you're local Italian joint, but not something that would break the bank. While Sapori Trattoria was a little out of my price range for a random Tuesday-night-out dinner, we downloaded some coupons off the website. We ordered the grilled calamari appetizer and the linguine and shrimp with broccoli cream sauce. I wanted to love the calamari appetizer. The balsamic sauce was fantastic and worked really well with the smoky flavor of the grilled calamari. However, I felt that the individual pieces of the calamari were hit and miss. When the squid was tender, it worked perfectly. When the squid was gummy, I felt a bit cheated. I really don't expect squid to taste gummy at a place this nice. The linguine and shrimp was quite good, although the quality of the shrimp was not as high as I would have expected. That said, the dish worked together very well. Maybe this is just an issue with their seafood, and I'd have to try some other items on the menu to confirm. Overall, it was pretty good, though I'm glad we had the coupon, or else I would have felt over-charged. I'd try it again, but if I had the same experience, I'd probably try someplace new.
