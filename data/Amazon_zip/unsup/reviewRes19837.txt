I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. I know it's going to be pricey being on Michigan Avenue but even I was a little shocked. We wandered in for lunch and even though it was pretty empty, they told us since we had no reservations we'd have to sit in the bar area, which was totally fine. Service was okay, nothing bad happened but kind of forgettable.  I had the brisket sandwich which is open faced and came with fries for $15. The fries were surprisingly great, being that I'm more of a fan of skinny fries than the big honking ones. But these were seasoned well and weren't totally potato-ey... you know what I mean? By the time we left, it seemed the bar was all tourists who didn't make reservations and the tables were all people schmoozing clients on business lunches. Overall pretty good but nothing so special I would rush back here to spend my money on. Except maybe the fries.
