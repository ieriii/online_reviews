When I heard that Mastro's was going to branch out form it's Beverly Hills origin, I was shocked. I've seen one too many teriffic steakhouses try to add links to the chain and end up hanging themselves with it. Not in this case! Fantastic experience. I've taken clients here twice and both times everyone has had nothing but great things to say. The wine selection is top notch and the bar scene is hopping. As for the steaks.......could be my favorite anywhere. If you want a treat, go to Mastro's.
