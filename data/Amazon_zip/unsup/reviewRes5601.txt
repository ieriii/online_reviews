This place is perfect. We went early on a Saturday night (6ish) and were seated pretty quickly at a family style table outside. I love that you can eat outside even in the cold fall. Everything we ate was fabulous, which is amazing because it is small plates so we ordered a lot. The wine was perfect. The waiter was efficient and friendly and knew the menu well. Coming from Boston, I found the people in Chicago incredibly nice. Here, we had a great conversation with the people we were next to, when they left we had a pleasant conversation with the next people who sat down. This would never happen in Boston. What a fabulous experience. I highly recommend this place. Also there were a fair number of kids there who were enjoying themselves, so I think it would be quite friendly for kids.
