I don't think I ever left this place dissapointed.And I had a lot of different things.A couple days ago,just out of curiousity,I got a corn dog.I despise corn dogs with all of my heart,and I can only remember having one corn dog that I actually enjoyed (that was back when I was a kid).Goddammit,Hot Dougs.I'm addicted to your corn dogs now.
