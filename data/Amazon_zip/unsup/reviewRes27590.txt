For Mexican food in the city it doesn't get better than this. Everything on the menu is great. Trust me I have had just about everything in the 20 years I have been going there. I was introduced to this by my father who religiously ate there while he was a resident at U of I med center. The service is still good, the food is amazing, its byob so its cheap to drink, the food is amazing, they have parking for customers with an attendant, the food is amazing, its cheap as hell, oh and the food is amazing.
