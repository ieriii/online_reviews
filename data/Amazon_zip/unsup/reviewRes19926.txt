MMMMMmmmmm the Shortrib Red Chile Soup was so good! Bursting with flavor, meat was soft and tender and the soup was just perfect. The Ahodaga torta was also really good, i loved the bread and all the meat inside it. After eating here, i already wanted my next meal to be at this place to try more the other tortas... i didn't get to satisfy my cravings! i must come back one day.
