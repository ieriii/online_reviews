Amazing food and at a reasonable price. Loved everything we ordered and the 'small plates' concept works well. Here's the menu rundown: Ricotta and honeycomb - Yummy. Make sure you really stir in the honeycomb otherwise you will think it's ok flavors until the very end. Roasted beet - great flavors, large portions of beets. Disclosure - you really have to love beets to enjoy this dish. Davanti Burger - cooked to perfection and the best part is we ordered it "medium well" and it was just that not overcooked at all. Torta Bacio - a fluffy chocolate-hazelnut mousse with a crunchy, candy bottom nestled up in a vanilla and hazelnut housemade gelato. Taste very much like a Ferrero Rocher candy. Winner!
