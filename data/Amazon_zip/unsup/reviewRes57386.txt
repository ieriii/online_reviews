Always great in my opinion and the White Dragon is amazing.....we practically lick the plate. With that being said, the only knock would be two things:1. one bathroom.....it's sort of annoying. And they should know better because it's byob.2. A tad on the pricey side. Just a touch. Still, that's just picking. We've been 20+ times and we will continue to go.
