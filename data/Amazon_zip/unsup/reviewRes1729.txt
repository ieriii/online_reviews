As I waited in the 45 minute line that stretched around the corner like a Disney park ride, I looked forward to trying out the hot dogs here. The owner that actually takes your owner, was really nice and liked how he helped out with deciding on a hot dog. The hot dogs were good, but I wouldn't wait in a line like that for them. I would 100% eat there again on a slower day though (if it exists). I will say that I wish I was a bit more adventurous with the hot dogs I had and maybe I would think a little differently. As a side note, they did not have the duck fat fries the day I went so I was not able to try them. :(
