Pretty Damn good spot. Bayless definitely takes the torta to a whole new level. The meats are always tasty and the bread is amazing! The churros are good as well. The one bad thing with this place is there is often a long wait and the seating area is kind of small IMO. Also not a fan of the process of ordering here, they make it more complicated than it needs to be. I guess that's more than one bad thing, but you know what I'm sayin'.
