Was talked into going by some good friends this past Monday and I am glad they did Came over already buzzed after having some drinks elsewhere. The place was dimly lit and had a pretty nice crowd for a Monday night. Our waitress was pretty good and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. She was also great with recommendations as well. For starters I went with the shrimp and crab bisque and it was great! The bread (especially the brown bread) was awesome! I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon ( for the lighter appetite) and it was definitely on point and hit the spot. I order my steak medium well so it was still juicy and tender, but not too pink. I ordered Redskin Mashed Potatoes to go along with my steak (yum!). To drink I went with Matilda beer by Goose Island...I usually never select beer when I go to a restaurant, but I could not drink any more hard booze that evening. Good spot, good food!
