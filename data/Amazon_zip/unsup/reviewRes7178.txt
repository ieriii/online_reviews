The most impressive thing about this place is the atmosphere. It's very old world fine dining with a southern BBQ twist. We sat by the fire at a high top in the bar area and received attentive, knowledgeable service. While I like the idea of this type of food done remarkably well in a "white table cloth" environment, I'm not sure the food really matches the atmosphere or the prices. If your significant other doesn't like the super bourgeois food that comes with a typical date night, try wiping sauce from their chin after sharing some succulent pulled pork.
