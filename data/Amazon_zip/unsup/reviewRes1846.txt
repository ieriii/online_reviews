You have to give it to Doug (The proprietor of this Popsicle stand) to come up with such a fresh twist to encased variations of snouts, lips, and a**holes. Ive been to quite a few hot dog stands in my time but not one where I had to wait 1 1/2 hours just to get one of these encased concoctions. I tell you what though the time spent in line is well worth it! The location is a little off but the main draw is the food! On the weekends they have duck fat French fries which are pretty good but I have to tell the truth....the first time I had them i was a little disappointed. I thought they would have more of an essence of duck instead of tasting super rich but still a goody. Their game of the week dogs change weekly so there is always something for the regulars to try. This place has to be on the regular to visit list if you are a Chicagoan!
