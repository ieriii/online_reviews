Veggie gyros and veggie bacon cheeseburgers? Unbelievably good! And the staff was awesome and helpful. Love this place and will be going back a lot. It's true what the others say about the chocolate peanut butter milkshake. Defintely get it (but split it). We didn't care for the sweet potato fries or the vegan mac and cheese but this place does a really fantastic job of making tofu and seitan taste like meat dishes but sooo much healthier (and kinder). The story about the two ducks on menu cover will make you glad you're eating a veggie meal. This place is really perfect for new vegetarians who might be craving their old favorite meats.
