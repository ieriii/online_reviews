Great drinks. Tasty food. Trendy Ambiance. I'd definitely recommend this place for fun date, night out w/ the friends, or in general. Food: Rock shrimp is good. Rolls are also good. And there are a couple of good vegetarian options as well (veggie appies seemed more appetizing than veggie entrees - my friend got the Pad Thai for her main dish, which was fresh but mediocre in taste; but we also got Indo Corn fritters and Eggplant/Tofu veggie appies and they were very good). Finally, I highly recommend the Kobe Beef Tartare. Creative made and very good. Service: Fine, no problems. Servers were friendly / accommodating both times I went. Cocktails: Quite vibrant and at times a bit too flavorful, but I'd still recommend trying the Peared Sake, Azure Dragon, Divine Lychee and Serenity. Well made and refreshing.
