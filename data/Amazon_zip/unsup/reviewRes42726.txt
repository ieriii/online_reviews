"I've made a huge mistake" That's the only thing I could think as the ink dried on the lease for my new office right down the street from Fogo 2 Go. Any chance of achieving any semblance of a healthy summer was dashed as the realty manager gave me the keys.  You see, one cannot resist Fogo 2 Go, it's a scientific impossibility, much like gravity guiding a leaf down from a tree branch to the ground, Fogo 2 Go will pull money right out of your wallet and stuff pizza right into your mouth if you're in the vicinity. Perhaps I should have taken it as a warning sign when I was already being thanked for my "repeat business" during their opening week...having delivery several times for parties and gatherings. But how was I supposed to resist the pepperoni festival, chock full of delicious varieties of pepperoni? And how about the 6 Quejoes? I'm a man who demands meat on his pizza, but that's one fine pie, full of caturpiry, blue cheese, fontina, eementhal, gorgonzola, and provolone? And no, that's not a rhetorical question--I need to know so I can break free of this addiction! The staff certainly isn't helping me escape--they're overly friendly to a fault, and willing to accommodate whatever crazy request I throw their way. So, back to the beginning of this review--the lease is signed, the office staffed, and all I can see when I look around are people eating 2 slices of Fogo 2 Go pizza and drinking a coke, Fog's evil lunch special. Today, I opted for sushi, in an attempt to break free from Fogo's grasp, but alas, my coworkers scorn and the feeling in my stomach afterward, most likely guilt over passing over such delicious pizza, will surely guide me back to Fogo tomorrow.
