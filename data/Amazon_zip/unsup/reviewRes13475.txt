We come here at least once a week. The bartenders are fast, knowledgeable, and nice, the servers are (usually) on the ball, and the food has been good every single time. It's reliable and while not gourmet, certainly well-done and has a few interesting spins on classics. While the entrees are a bit over-priced, the burgers are excellent, as are the appetizers and the brunch. The beer is well-crafted and the only bummer (which isn't really a bad thing at all) is that they tend to change it up every week or so. There have been a few times I tasted one I loved that was gone the next time I went, but at least it makes you to try new things. Bad stuff: the hostesses are generally not as awesome (but the managers have been hanging out up front recently, so maybe that'll be on the up-and-up), it's extremely loud, and on a busy night you'll wait forever for a table. But if you hang around the bar for a few minutes and are quick about it, you can bypass the hostesses and sit next to one another and just eat at the bar, which makes conversation over the loud music much easier.
