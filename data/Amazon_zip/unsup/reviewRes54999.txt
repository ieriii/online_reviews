It's a shame when an otherwise great restaurant has a pretentous hostess that ruins the atmosphere. The hostess is the first person you are greeted by and it's just not fun to go to a restaurant where he or she acts like a big shot because the place is popular. It ruins the whole mood. The woman working the hostess stand last night had long brown hair, white dress and boots on - never seen her before and I come frequently since I live in the neighborhood ... I hope that she changes her tune, she was a real bummer to deal with.
