I like the steaks here. The fact that they come smothered in sizzling butter is a real plus for the taste buds, but not for the cholesterol count. I also like the cheesy potatoes they do. They've got a nice private room upstairs which is great if you want to do a party of 20-30 people. They are very accomodating for groups and the service was quite good.
