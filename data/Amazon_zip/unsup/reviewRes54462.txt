The first vegetarian restaurant I can actually say that I love.I've been to several vegetarian restaurants back in Colorado, and I've always felt that a lot of vegetarian food winds up lacking flavor when placed in the wrong hands. Not so with this place!I had the sweet potato quesadillas, and they were amazing. I sampled some bites from my friend's dishes as well...meatloaf, country fried steak...both delicious as well.From a former skeptic, trust me and give the Chicago Diner a chance.
