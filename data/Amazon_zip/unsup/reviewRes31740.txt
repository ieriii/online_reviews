Let me start of by saying I really love the food at Chicago Diner. I've never had anything here I didn't like, and I love being able to pretty much order anything off the menu. I especially like Chicago Diner for brunch (my favorite meal). Their scrambled tofu is the best I've had at any restaurant, the french toast and blue corncakes are awesome, and I really like the steak and eggs with vegan hollandaise sauce. I also like the vegan buffalo "wings," chicken parmesan sandwich, and the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. (I admit, having grown up in Indiana I like faux meat.) And if it's on the menu, the vegan maki is excellent. The two main failings of Chicago Diner are the desserts and the hit-or-miss service. First off, Chicago Diner prides itself on its vegan desserts, but in my experience they are just awful. The cakes are very dense and very dry. The vegan cheesecake is unpalatable, and the cookies are gritty and crumbly. The saving grace here is the milkshake made with Cookie Dough Temptation, but I give more credit to Chicago Soy Dairy for that. And, unfortunately, the service is really inconsistent. I've had some great service here from some really great servers, but sometimes it seems there are servers who are just aloof, inattentive, and generally unfriendly. I almost feel bad giving Chicago Diner 3 stars, since I love the food there so much, but problems with the service and desserts really push the rating down. Avoid the dessert and luck out with a good server, though, and you are looking at a 5-star vegetarian meal.
