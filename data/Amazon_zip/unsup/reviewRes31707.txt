I was BLOWN AWAY by one of the dishes here. The Boo - Dah's style Grilled ahi tuna and pork was out of this world. If I had one thing to eat before I died, I would choose this (and maybe some mac n cheese from Kuma's corner, but that's beside the point). It is a random combination (ahi tuna and pork) but it was prepared to perfection - some mango and sweet chili sauce with delicious kick....AMAZING! I have to say, this place came close to getting a one after my husband and I had been there for 40 minutes without getting seated when we had an 8:00 reservation. When they came up to tell us at 8:40 that we could sit at a communal table I just about died. We finally were seated in the restaurant by 8:50.... Instead of making a scene, my husband and I were strategizing how we could make the restaurant lose money - our plan was to use our coupon, not order drinks, and yelp the crap out of how horrible this place was.... But all that disappeared when one of the owners ended up spoiling us for the rest of the night by throwing all kinds of free stuff our way and apologizing profusely- the chef even came out to offer us some free toro sashimi with sake expressing his apologies! Needless to say, they more than made up for our wait! We ordered one sushi roll (Sunda Rainbow Roll), the DELICIOUS ahi tuna/pork dish, "all of the above sashimi", and the "shaking beef".  The fish is AMAZING there - so fresh, perfectly cut, and just overall the best sushi I have had in the city (way better than Japonais). I cannot wait to go again. Just about everything on the menu had me drooling, and I still cannot stop thinking about the ahi tuna/pork dish that I hogged from my husband. It is a MUST if you go there. While they really need to work on the number of reservations that they take, the food is delicious, and I'm glad we stuck it out! :)
