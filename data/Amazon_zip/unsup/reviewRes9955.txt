Piccolo Sogno isn't just a good place to eat....this restaurant provides a great dining experience. This is not the Italian place you go to if you want to see spaghetti and meatballs on the menu, along with 200 other red-sauce selections. Piccolo Sogno offers rustic, regional Italian cuisine, and I will admit some non-adventurous folk may find the menu somewhat off-putting. I'm sure there was a time in my life when I would not have wanted to order chestnut flour ribbon pasta with a wild boar ragu...but I was lame then. Having had the pasta with wild boar ragu....I can say it is delicious, and not so "weird" that someone who might hesitate to try it would ardently dislike it. I think Piccolo Sogno is a great place to dine, to get out of the typical Italian restaurant box...try some new things and discover some new flavors...realize what Italian food is really all about. As a bonus....all the wines are Italian, all the waiters are Italian, they have a beautiful patio, and they make their own gelato. Really, you can't go wrong. To the four 20-something dudes at the table next to me, wearing their finest hoodies, who sat there not speaking to each other, but couldn't stop texting....yeah you were in a cool restaurant, but you're still lame.
