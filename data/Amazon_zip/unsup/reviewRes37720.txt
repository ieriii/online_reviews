The go-to place for Belgians, IPAs, and other such fancy beers in Chicago. My out-of-town friends insist upon going every time they're around, because they love the selection so much. Always a sure thing for food...nearly everything I have tried here is amazing, and I love that they have a varied selection of ever-changing seasonal plates. The entrees aren't cheap, but quality is amazing. Their sandwiches are surprisingly filling and come with a good-sized portion of frites with their signature tasty aioli. I recently tried the Tilapia Sandwich again and was blown away by how something so simple could be so good...perfect, crisp batter; yummy gribiche sauce, and the tangy lemon pickles are a nice touch. I'm also rather fond of their impressive Stilton Mac-n-Cheese, CB&J Sandwich, Brisket, and various salads. And I'm thrilled that they are still carrying Goose Island Green Line...for a reasonable $3.50! YES! Unfortunately, the wait-time for dinner can border on ridiculous, and there is NO good place to stand when the bar is filled (which is always.) I'd eat here every day if they weren't so popular :/ But glad to see a quality place doing so well... A few of the servers can border on the haughty hipster side, but I probably would be too if I had to contend with droves of annoying Lincoln Park yuppies crowding into my bar :)
