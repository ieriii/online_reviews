Great pizza place near the movie theater on Webster. Downstairs has a sports bar feel and upstairs is more of a family restaurant. Pizza is great, has a burned cheese ring around the edge of the crust. Not much else worth ordering on the menu, though some of the fried appetizers are pretty good. Good place for a group, as everyone will probably order pizza and you can get pitchers of beer. This is my bf's favorite Chicago pizza, and it's definitely in my top 5 (my favorite is Pizano's).
