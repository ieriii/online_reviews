Another venture to San Soo Gab San last night. Soup was a bit less spicy than past such that the kids liked it for a change. Kalbi, bulgogia and dahk were all great.  Lots of good kimchee and various root and sprout sides as usual. Worst "wine" I have ever tasted in my life. (No western grape wine...) Stick with beer. Ya... the service sucks and atmosphere rather grungy. No surprise there. Gotta deal with it and enjoy the food!
