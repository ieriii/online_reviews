Let me say first that i eat alone. I go to restaurants with my kindle and eat. I enjoy it. It's my life. So, this review isn't for groups or parties because that isn't my experience. I am judging the taste, and ambiance of the place. So obviously, the restaurant gets busy and a crowd was pressuring me to get and leave. There was a line of about 12 people before the waitstaff made me put down my kindle and ask me to leave. Look, the food was fine, and I liked the experience. However, the low rating is due to the unpleasant nature of the employees who pressured me into leaving. thanks, Andrew Saucer "I feel like I live in the present when I eat at this place. When I go out to eat I want to feel like a futuristic spaceman tasting the delicacies of some far off planet. The food here is quite good, in that boring "normal" sort of way." - Carl Sagan
