Aside from the exclusive and pretentious nature of the place, I absolutely love my experiences here. Never attempt to get in with an odd number of people. It's perfect for dates--very intimate, perfectly dim lighting, tall drapes everywhere, no windows, tall cozy chairs. The drinks are all deliciously prepared with the finest liquors and homemade mixers. I was unimpressed by the selections of cheeses, so I've only had the beer nuts to eat here, but they were excellent. All in all, a great place to cocktail.
