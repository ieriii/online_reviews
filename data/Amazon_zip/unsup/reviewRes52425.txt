The service here is extremely attentive. Actually, a bit TOO attentive if you asked me. We were constantly bombarded by servers offering meat, and even caught them doing it once when our coin was turned upside down. I like the attention, but I like having a conversation too. As for the quality of the food, I really enjoyed it. They have a pretty good salad bar too. Comparing this to Texas de Brazil, I will have to say the quality of meats are very similar, but I like the ambiance and decor of Texas de Brazil better.
