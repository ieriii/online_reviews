I didn't know what the hype was all about ....... I would compare the hype ( for you non-foodies ) to the locals thinking that the Cubs are going to win a World Series sometime soon.... Well, let's just say they might ! This place was definately a home run !!! Of course no matter where you go to have Pho, its never going to be good as your mom's , but the Pho here comes pretty darn close. Full of flavor and very well portioned with all the " additives " at your disposal on the side. I somewhat get a kick seeing the servers running around the dining floor in camo t-shirts, but they are all but trying to blend in the background and hide from their patrons as the service here was fast. This restaurant isnt on my top list for best decor , but I can appreciate it. The " family " style seating is different. Once you walk in, you could be seated at a table with complete strangers, but it would feel like you're having dinner at a large family gathering ..... in a garage !! Believe me, its not a bad thing ... Another " must " for a trip back to Chi -town.
