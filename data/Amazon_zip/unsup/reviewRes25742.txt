I am a big fondue foodie and love this place! I had been going to the Melting Pot for years and then tried this place for a birthday... wow.. that is all I can say! It is so much better...for a few reasons... I think the dipping sauces are amazing here...The sizes of the meat are also much larger and of a better quality. The ambiance is great.. and the flamenco guitar playing just makes the experience better! I highly recommend coming here for special occasions! Unfortunately, like all fondue, it can be very pricey.. but geja's offers many coupons and deals so we try to go when we have some type of coupon!
