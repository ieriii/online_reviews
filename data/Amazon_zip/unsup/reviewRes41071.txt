$50 Underground Tasting = Relaxing Evening Out Such a fun date spot! Kurt (manager, server, host, renaissance man) was very accommodating and happy to see us, which made me feel all fuzzy inside. We went on a summer night; it was so pleasant to sit in candlelight and enjoy - the soup was the best course, followed by the lamb. BYOB was great! The calamari appetizer quite small, but over-look-able. The decor was simple - it reminded us of Schwa, and was calm and soothing. The Underground thing felt very VIP, and I minused a star because I felt the food wanted to be better, I was just there on night where the staff brought their "A-" game. I'll be back - sooner rather than later. Reminder: The Armitage bus stops running at 7:30! I had to cab it after calling CTA.
