My only experience here is with a banh mi sandwich and sugar cane drink. I really don't have any basis on which to judge the sugar cane, so all I can say is that it had a very plant-ish fibrous taste to it akin to something I'd find in banana peel. Two other guests I was with really did not like the taste, but I don't think that had anything to do with the quality rather the unique taste which they weren't ready for. What I am familiar with are banh mi sandwiches. I had the grilled marinated pork. I've had pork sandwiches before, but I've never had one this flavorful. Right from the first bite even to several hours later, the pork shone through as the pre-eminent flavor. Depending on the bite, either a porky rib-like flavor or the sweet from the marinade emerged. Nonetheless, the bread was fairly unremarkable. It didn't really have a flavor worth noting, nor was I impressed or disappointed with with the flakiness or chewiness of the baguette. I will say that I was a tad disappointed with the heft of the sandwich. Although not expensive, it didn't really provide that much to munch on. It was, definitely, a very thin sandwich. Overall, though, I think it was pretty good, deserving of a fourth star, and I would recommend this place.
