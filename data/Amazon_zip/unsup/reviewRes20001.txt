I've had only good times at XOCO. I never waited very long, either I'm just lucky or go at the "right" time. First time I went, I was inebriated, cold and hungry (must have been late November '09) around 8 or 9pm. Had a group of friends (7 of us total), and I don't remember waiting very long, maybe 20 minutes. All we came for was the churros and hot chocolate. Bravo! Hot, sweet, chewy churros and smooth, silky hot chocolate. I love that there was no milky after-taste from the hot chocolate (history lesson: the Aztecs drank pure chocolate with a bit of water and spice, not that over-sweetened, milky stuff that every one is (unfortunately) so used to). Aaand, guess who we saw? The chef, himself! Mr. Bayless was kind enough to take a picture with my sister and I, how cool. Second visit, dinner time. Early/mid December '09, went with 2 friends, waited maybe 20 or 30 minutes to order and be seated. Had the Pepito torta, sans jalepenos. Deee-licious! The meat was so tender, almost dissolved in my mouth (I'm trying to make it sound good), and the onion, cheese and beans just worked so well together. I can't remember the brand of hard cider they have (available in a 21 or 22 (can't remember) ounce bottle), but it's so smooth. I am a fan of hard cider, and can hardly find it around, so I was ecstatic to see that XOCO serves it! Cons -Small space, may feel cramped -Busy, fast paced -Pricey Pros -You call it cramped, I say warm and intimate -Quick food, pay before you eat, don't worry about waiting for a bill -Quality ingredients, you get what you pay for (you want cheap Mexican? Chicago's got enough of those) -Just north of downtown, convenient location FYI, I'm taking my friend there this Friday. I love me some XOCO.
