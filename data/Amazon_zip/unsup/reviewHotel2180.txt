Back in the 80's, this hotel was a Radisson and a dump. You could look up at the florescent lighting and see the rats running around. Intercontinental saved a beautiful landmark hotel. I had a baby shower here for my wife. The staff did an outstanding job. I've worked some conferences in the beautiful grand ballroom. The rooms here are nice, but the service is top notch.
