This is the kind of place that you have to get on board and enjoy it, or miss the boat entirely. If you don't dig the whole communial aspect (sharing large tables, no chairs at the bar tables, sharing small spaces with strangers, etc.,) then it probably isn't your thing. They have a nice (not the greatest) beer menu, and an homage to pork, which I love. If you are in the mood for a noisy, communial, experience with lots of offal, you will have a great time.
