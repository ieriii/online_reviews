Living in Chicago I have tried most of the top places for Chicago style pizza and Giordano's is my number one pick! A great combination of sauce cheese and topping with a delicious deep dish crust. Order your pizza before you sit down (there is usually a long wait) and walk over to millennium park for a few minutes while you wait for your table and pizza. Once you are back your pizza should be on your table shortly.
