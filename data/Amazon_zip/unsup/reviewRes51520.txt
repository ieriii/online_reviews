MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!! Yummy and cheap burritos, tacos (they even have fish tacos!!!), chorizo anything, desayunos, quesadillas, horchatas (sometimes a lil too sweet for me), i mean probably anything off the menu is great!!!! They are open late, whether you dine in or take out. The waitstaff is nice and the food comes out fairly quick.   My only issue is parking, this area has gone up so fast (potbelly's, cold stone and all the new commercial-y places) that it's always a busy :( I have been coming here for years and it's never failed me. My bf always orders his burrito the same way (only beans, cheese, rice, and sour cream) and they have NEVER gotten it wrong - even if they did. All would be easily forgiven!!!! :) Garcia's is one of my top local spots for some gooooood mexican food.
