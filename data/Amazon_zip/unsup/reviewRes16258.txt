Very nice and intimate! It's a great date spot! Very sexy atmosphere! The food and drinks are very nontraditional. I had smoked trout appetizer and it was really good! I also had the white sangria, it was very strong and more bitter in my opinion than sweet. I didn't like it. They don't have traditional cognacs such as Hennessey or vodkas such as grey goose so keep an open mind about their drink menu. Their food is also very unique, fresh and delicious! The atmosphere is very inviting for conversation! They have a strict no cell phone use policy where you are only allowed to text on your phone, no talking on it. If you come in a large group or have a private party the back room is where you will be seated and it is AWESOME! There is a fireplace there and it's very cozy. The entire lounge is very warm and cozy.The dimly lit lights and candles being the only two sources of light definitely cater toward the atmosphere. The chairs are very high and spacious to make your lounging experience private. The music was not very noticeable, however, there was music playing.
