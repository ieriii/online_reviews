The service here SUCKS!! in fact I've had better service from a gas station attendant. My wife and went in for lunch today the manager/host was on a personal cell phone call and acknowledged us by holding up two fingers to indicate the size of our party. He then proceeded to take us all the way to the back of the establishment and seat us at a table next to the kitchen door (Still on his phone) It was not until he ended his call that he answered her and our request to be seated at another table. Which he then said he had something to do in the kitchen handed us the menu's and told us to sit where we wanted and he would be right back. I failed to mention that the restaurant was practically empty, maybe 12 to 15 diners tops. I will make it a point to tell everyone I know not to dine in at this place. Note to staff: WORK ON YOUR MANNERS
