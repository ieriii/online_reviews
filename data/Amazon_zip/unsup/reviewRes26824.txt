Guilty as charged. I begged my friend to go here with me. I thought the food would be as good, if not better, than Xoco or Topolo. However, it was just ok. About the famous 2 hour wait.. There is no real line, folks. Frontera makes people wait even when there are several tables open. This is so that people will run up bar tabs and order appetizers. It isn't that Frontera is *that* popular. Rather, they make you wait to increase the amount you spend there.  Waiter was very nice and good at his job. Food was good. Just good. I recommend Topolo or Xoco, but not this place.
