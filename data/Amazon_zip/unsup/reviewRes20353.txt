XOCO. So we came to Chicago for Rick Bayless' restaurants. I wish we could have tried more here, but I must say it was worth it. You can really tell a lot of thought goes into the food, service, and atmosphere. Everything pictured was great. If we ever go back we actually would try XOCO for lunch. Don't get me wrong Frontera was great, but the menu for XOCO at lunch looks very good. TWO THUMBS WAY UP.
