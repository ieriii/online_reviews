I have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since I never really developed an appreciation for Chinese cuisine in general. Sadly, this restaurant didn't help. They were out of the pea shoot dish, so we ordered the Chinese broccoli and it was tasty. We also order chicken sizzling rice soup, which turned out to be inedible goop akin to pork and beans. Yes, we ordered soup and, instead of broth, a bowl of liquid with the consistency of pork and beans arrived at our table. GROSS. We also got the fried chicken that comes with szechuan peppers. I didn't really care for the dish as it wasn't discernibly spicy, the chicken meat was almost non-existent, and it was oilier than a little ceasar's pizza. There seemed to be a language barrier (even though I went with a person who spoke Chinese) and the total bill topped $60 for lunch for two people...in Chinatown. Something is clearly wrong with that.* from my visit on 12/29/11
