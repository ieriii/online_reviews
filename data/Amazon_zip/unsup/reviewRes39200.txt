Date night with the wife. After a long day of work, I definitely love the quality of drinks and food. Located in Logan Square across the blue line stop, I didn't expect a place like this. I lived in Chicago since 1993 and Logan Square has greatly improved since then. Parking was an ease with plenty of street parking. Walked in and there was a 20-30 minutes wait for a table for 2, so we went to the bar and ordered some drinks. Their menu of whiskeys was very good and their Old Fashion is top notch. I was a little ticked off, when I had to wait for 10-15 minutes and seemingly ignored by the bartender when the bar was not busy at all. A nice patron nicely informed the bartender that I was waiting for a bit as the bartender greeted her after she asked if we had already ordered. I was about to give a 3 star due to the bar service, but the food definitely made it up. Right after we ordered our drinks (Old Fashion for me, Kentucky Daisy for wife), we were seated. Our waiter was informed enough to rattle off the specials and answered our questions of the menus. We ordered the 1) Roasted Marrow Bones, Red Onion Jam, Sea Salt, Sourdough Crostinis 2) Fried Foie Gras 3) Maine Lobster and 4) Fried Pig Tail. Portion was great and the food left me wanting more. We both wanted to try more, but the stomach did not allow for more. I will definitely be making this place a norm. If not for the mishap at the bar, 5 star is a must. I definitely love the non-pretentious feel and just really good quality food.
