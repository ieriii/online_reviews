Went to RJ's today. It was a beautiful 80 degree day in Chicago! Went here with my parents. We had the brunch buffet. The place was packed with people. All items on the buffet were super fresh and gourmet. Lots of cool things on there like israeli couscous, figs, fresh fruit, etc. My favorite thing on the buffet is the soup. It is to die for! It is well salted and flavorful, lots of good veggies in it. From there I moved onto the breakfast. Fresh made waffles paired well with apple chicken sausage and their bacon. Their bacon is the best I've ever had! They put some sort of seasoning on it. Freakin delicious! Also good were the eggs and denver scramble. I love this place and for 14 bucks cant be beat! Waitress was super friendly and attentive, kept bringing fresh bowls and plates. Definitely eat here.
