I went to this place after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, and boy were the reviews spot on! The places has become my absolute favorite place for brunch. The decor was pleasant, the environment was nice, and most importantly, the food was great! I've gotten the Eggs Benedict on several occasion and its absolutely amazing. I can't remember what else I've tried here but I have never been disappointed with the food quality here. Did I mention that the portions were very generous? I have to physically work, just to finish my meal each time. The only downside to the place is the wait, but that's expected with how popular this restaurant is. I will continue coming back to this place, and if you haven't tried this place out, you must go!
