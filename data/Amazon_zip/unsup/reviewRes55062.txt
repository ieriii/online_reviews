Where do I begin. I went here right after Christmas after I received a gift certificate. I should have re-gifted. If you want to sit in a loud cafeteria and eat an over priced steak with a charcoal crust while you yell at your date this is the place for you! There is nothing special about this place, so if you want a nice environment and a proper steak for the same price, checkout the Chicago Firehouse.
