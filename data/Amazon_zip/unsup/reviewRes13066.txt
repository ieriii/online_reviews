first churrascaria experience. impeccable service - had an amazingly attentive server, gauchos were consistently accommodating. favorite cuts were rather unexpected: leg of lamb (better than lamb chop, rack of lamb) garlic picanha (preferred to picanha, surprisingly underwhelming given this is the signature cut) costela de porco (bbq pork rib) - excellent, preferred to costela del boi (braised beef rib, on the blander side) pork tenderloin - unbelievably succulent bacon-wrapped filet mignon salad bar is as excellent as reviews state - some stand-outs include a sweet quinoa salad, seared ahi, baby beets, roasted garlic, grilled portabella, smoked salmon, prosciutto, fresh buff mozz.  very sleek lounge - might revisit for cocktails
