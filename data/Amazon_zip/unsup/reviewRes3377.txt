Korean fried chicken? where could you go wrong?!?! My friend and I picked-up some take-out from Crisp last night and it was DELICIOUS. We ordered ten wings (half Seoul Sassy and half Crisp BBQ) and half a chicken Plain Jane just to try it out. AMAZING. Not your usual fried chicken, there's something extra, a salty/sweet/spicy crunchy coating, perfectly cooked chicken, moist and very flavorful. The Plain Jane might have been my favorite, followed up by the Seoul Sassy. I also had the Baby Buddha Bowl with spinach, beansprouts, cucumbers, and bulgogi; they give you a big tub of the spicy red gojuchang to mix with, absolutely perfect. Haven't tried the rest of the items yet (they were out of smashed potatoes and the fries were meh) but I definitely will be back. They don't deliver as of yet but are planning to in the near future and last night, the cc machine was down, so remember to bring cash!
