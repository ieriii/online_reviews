Ate here on a date with my girlfriend when endless driving lead us to find the highest rated/byob/open restaurant around Humboldt Park late at night. Entered what seemed to look like a shack on the outside to find a bunch of workers and empty seats,....you can assume we thought the place was closing. Yet, the friendly waitress walked us to an extremely packed back area that is normally open to the outdoors during summer, but temporarily covered with false wall during the winter. Surprising the faux walls did nothing to hamper the awesome atmosphere of this place and convinced us to order their margarita mix that we would then pour are rhubarb wine into (winning combination). I was advised to order the empanadas, yuca frita and tostones as appetizers along with the ropa vieja as an entree. The yuca frita as fries while made to a good crisp lacked some flavor due to being made from cassava even when dipping into sauces. The empanadas when compared to  had better tasting dough but the inside ingredients seemed to not taste as well, but not by much. The tostones had a rich flavor and were perfectly crisp plantains and the ropa vieja was exceptionally flavorful and tender. So while the appetizers can be a bit hit and miss, when the entrees do taste great it's home run and the BYOB was a big plus. Leaving me to only deduct the place one star. Must Try: - Ropa Vieja - Empanadas - Tostones - Sangria Mix w/ your favorite bottle of wine Tips: - BYOB
