I went here last night. I was starving. It was pretty good! Their black & tans are made with Guinness and Harp instead of Bass which is fine with me. I think they go well together. Their burgers were good enough that I ate every single bite and licked my plate. I recommend it for sure and will definitely be back to try other food items and drinks!
