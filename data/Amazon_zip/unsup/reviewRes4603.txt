I really liked the atmosphere here. The outdoor seating is great for lounging and there are plenty of counters and bar stools as well. I really appreciated the tapas-style menu. There are many savory options on the menu -- coming here with a big party and sampling all the dishes would be a good idea. I had a taste of the slow roasted ham panini (the sundried tomato sauce was excellent), milk braised shoulder (most tender indeed!), prosciutto crusted cobia (the lemon sauce was a bit too tart for my liking, but the dish was still savory). I left satisfied and I hope to make my way back here if I'm back in Chicago.
