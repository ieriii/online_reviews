mmmm, so tasty! The food here is sustainably farmed and raised, so it tastes real. My hubby and I split and cheeseburger (fresh, perfectly cooked, and a side of cajun fries), and the fish special (flakey, well seasoned with a fresh veggie slaw). We also had the ruhbard galette for dessert. While it is slightly pricy it is one of our new favorites.
