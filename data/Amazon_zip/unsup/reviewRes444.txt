Amazing, truely as good as it gets... If Denis Miller's recommendation was not enough for you, this is an amazing place. The taste and textural revolution that achieved here is nothing more than mind bending. At Everest, and Trotter's, I go home disappointed since I could have made the meal better at home fora fraction of the cost. Here, the cost is a non-factor... Best restaurant in the US or Europe. Period.
