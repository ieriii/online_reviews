I ate here for dinner on Friday night a few weeks ago. The fish was great, we took the advice of the waiter and he was right for all three of us. My husband, the adventurous one, got sturgeon, and that was good too. Then we went back for breakfast the next morning. My sister, who is vegetarian, ordered eggs benedict which came with Canadian bacon on it. The waitress expressed her outrage at the mistake but we didn't hear any more about it. (And my sister ate it anyway after I removed the offending breakfast meat). Something not quite so great at breakfast and the coffee definitely diner-style stewed.
