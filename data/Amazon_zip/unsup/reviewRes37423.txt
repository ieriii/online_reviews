This place is something special. It isn't a great bargain, but it is something special. Foodies will love it. I prefer it to Whole Foods, many people will likely see it as a smaller whole foods. I had one of the brown lunch specials in the cafe (towards Illinois or Navy Pier, near the parking garage across the street) - it was great. I had chicken & Mango Quesadillas. I bought a sandwich to take with me for dinner, and bought my wife some of the prepared salads (smoked chicken salad was great). This isn't the place for weekly shopping, but for gourmet foods and gourmet prices. I wouldn't call it cheap, but the cafe for a quick, tasty meal is a bargain compared to a meal at the Sheraton and much better quality than Navy Pier restaurants.
