My wife and I arrive at Shaws around 4:30 P.M. on Sunday 6/12/2011. She ordered a beer, bowl of clam chowder and a lobster roll. I ordered a beer, bowl of clam chowder and the fish and chips. The clam chowder was great. The problem arises as I watch an order of fish and chips along with her lobster roll with fries and coleslaw is placed under a heated area to keep it warm. At this time someone takes the fish and chips and delivers it to another table that had been shorted an order due to someones mistake. All the while my wife's lobster roll and coleslaw (which should be served cool) is setting under a heat lamp. Fifteen minutes later another order of fish and chips along with the lobster roll and coleslaw is delivered to our table. The 3 pieces of fish were about the size of my fingers and I had to remind them that coleslaw was supposed to be included. My wife's lobster roll was warm by this time and her coleslaw was uneatable. No one suggested any adjustments or revisions. The total bill came to $81.00 for 2 bowls of soup, 2 beers, a lobster roll and an order of fish and chips. I don't think we'll go back!!!!
