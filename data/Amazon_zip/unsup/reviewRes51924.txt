Gino's East is the poor man's Giordano's. I wandered in with some out-of-town guests because Giordano's was at an hour wait, and while that's ridiculous, I wish we hadn't been so hungry and could've waited for the good stuff. The server was too solicitous, and didn't let up with the trite, overly familiar jokes even after it was clear that we weren't amused. The pizza was totally Meh, and I fear I did not provide my visitors with a proper Chicago deep dish experience.
