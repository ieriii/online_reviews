An amazingly delicious restaurant-- don't miss out on the self wrap beef wraps (the best of this kind I've ever had), and the lemongrass chicken. The place can be very busy so try to go on an off time. Some of the menu items are too authentic for my taste (beef penis, anyone?) but the menu is extremely large (literally hundreds of items), so that has never been a problem. The pho is also very good... I've actually never had anything here I didn't like.
