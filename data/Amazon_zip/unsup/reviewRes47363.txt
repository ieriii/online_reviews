I came here with a few friends several months ago. My gf had bought a YouSwoop for the place. Service was nice. Beer selection was good but they were out of a few things. I ordered a veggie burger with a side salad. The salad dressing tasted like it was from a bottle. Sorry but that is a pet peeve of mine. Salad dressing is very easy to make. Please don't screw it up or buy it ready made. The burger was awful. The worst veggie burger I have ever had including frozen ones from Jewel. I don't know why they called it a veggie burger. It should be called "warmed breading on bun". It was all filler and very bland. Ambiance. It was like going to Disney World. Or watching those "authentic" Rick Steve's shit tours of Europe on PBS. Or visiting Nassau Bahamas to get a feel for real Caribbean living. Or craving Italian and ordering Pizza Hut. The place was so phony it was actually comical and probably the best part of my experience. Avoid.
