We came here for lunch on my birthday (November 30 for all of you who'd like to send a card next year) and weren't disappointed. We'd visited Fogo's cousin Sal about 2 years ago and had anxiously awaited another Meaturday ever since... Service was impeccable, my water and iced tea glasses were refilled the moment a molecule of liquid evaporated from either one, to say say nothing of when I took a sip. The salad bar was great; the best smoked salmon I've ever had- including in Ireland, where they know their smoked salmon- was here. I went light on salad because the meat is the star of the show. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said in the myriad other reviews, so I'll leave it at this: a guy could sure get used to eating beef tenderloin for lunch. When my princess gave me the "I can't believe you're eating this much, I'm completely embarassed" look, I used my now Oldsmobile-sized stomach to fling my arm up onto the table and flipped my indicator disc to the red side and declared, "No mas." Unfortunately, no one understood because that's Spanish and Brazilians speak Portugese. Dang good thing I didn't have to be somewhere after lunch; I was in a meaty haze and wanted only to either nap, walk it off, or, wish I'd thought of this: sleepwalk it off.
