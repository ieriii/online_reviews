Full disclosure: I've only been to the Green Mill at 2 am on Wednesday nights (I'm a vampire. A jazzy, jazzy vampire). But I keep coming back for more, and like everyone else in Chicago, I love this place, and I aim to see what it is like when the normals are there. Music sounds great here, even that of which I'm not terribly fond (I'm looking at you, Frank Catalano). The crowd is always nice to me and sort of odd. During band breaks, there is a magical jukebox that plays 45s from 50 years ago. Actually, everything here feels like it is 50 years old. I feel 50 years old on Thursdays at 9 am, but it is so worth it.
