Tools of my brunch: Raspberry and Pear Mimosa, Smoked Salmon Benedict with Dill Hollandaise, Hash Browns, MYO egg white omelet (roasted red pepper, feta, mushrooms, fresh basil) Coffee, and Raspberry and Pear Mimosa. Weekend brunches at The Bongo Room pretty much means long wait times. The place is longer than it is wide, has a full bar, and the acoustics are such that you'll struggle to hear your conversation. This isn't a complaint, it's a fact. It's the ambiance that gives you the opportunity to literally rub elbows with your fellow brunchers. I've had so many recommendations to this place I can't even count them on my fingers. My first experience here was mostly positive. They brew bottomless cups of Intelligentsia which garners them 1000 points right off of the bat. The waitress was smiley and deft in her maneuvering. The smoked salmon Benedict with hash browns were delicious and well balanced. The Bongo Room's take on hash browns are the way of the smashed and seasoned red potato. Smoked salmon by design, is very salty. The low-sodium nature of the hash browns provided great balance with the salty salmon. The eggs were perfectly over-easy and the dill hollandaise was a delightful accent. The omelet was somewhat of a disappointment. There were spots where the sweet basil was too overpowering and other spots in the omelet where it was non-existent. They went a bit too heavy on the butter in the frying pan as well. My mimosa was delicious, effervescent and satisfying. Five stars would be garnered with closer attention to balanced flavors in the omelet, less of a heavy hand with the butter, and perhaps a more inventive menu.
