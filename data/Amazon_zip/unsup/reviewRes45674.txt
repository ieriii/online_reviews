bison = good (who knew?!) prices = high (bison burger was around $13 I think...) service = really good (my salad came with dressing on it after I said no dressing please! and the server took it off the bill and brought me another) decor = beautiful! (the library which is where the DJ sets up later is inviting and the bar is a beautiful wood) me = going back for more
