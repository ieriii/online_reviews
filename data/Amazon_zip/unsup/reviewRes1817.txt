I really feel it's 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to be nice. Bottom line: it didn't live up to the hype for me. I had the duck fat fries. Surprisingly they tasted "cleaner" and less greasy than regular fries. Overall, however, they did not impress me. As for encased meat, I had The Keira Knightley fire dog. It was not spicy, and seemed like a regular ol' dog. Then I had the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds. Definitely different, and pretty good, but my sister's antelope was better. I do give the place props for its creativity. I would go back to try the alligator sausage, but I would not go out of my way for the duck fat festivities. Don't be too intimidated by the line. It only took us 45 minutes to get to a table on a Friday.
