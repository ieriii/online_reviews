When people say fusion, you think French/Vietnamese, American/Japanese, (something white)/(something asian)... but Crisp takes fusion to another level. It's a melting pot of different cultural cuisines: burritos, bulgogi, kim chee, chicken burgers, fried chicken, and all around goodness. There's 3 things that I stick to: 1. Bulgogi burrito 2. Fried chicken 3. Buddha bowl Really, numbers 1 and 3 go together. It's like ordering a burrito vs a rice plate at Chipotle, except 10 times tastier, and maybe healthier? You've got your daily serving of meat in the bulgogi, daily serving of veggies w/ the carrots, lettuce, tomato, some other veggie stuff, and then your grains with the rice. For extra pizzaz and daily vitamins you'll want to top it off with their secret sauce, also known as "crack", w/o the jittery repercussions, just arterial. As for the fried chicken, I like mine with Seoul and with a bit of Sass. Nothing like glazing some crispy salty fried chicken with a sweet tang and chopped onions. For a multi-cultural explosion of flavors in your mouth, go to Crisp. You won't spit, you'll swallow.
