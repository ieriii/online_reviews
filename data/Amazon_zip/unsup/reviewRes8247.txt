Wow, I am really surprised there are not more 5 star reviews. I guess I'm just fortunate that I've had a great experience every time I've been.  I love this place. Granted, I've never actually been to Naples, so I'm in no way able to compare authenticity. However, the pizza is wonderful, the appetizers are great with generous portions and you really must try the tartuffo for dessert!! Service is fine, but the owner is great- always checking to make sure everything is ok. If you get stuck with a wait by the door, the downside is that it's a small narrow area- they could benefit from a vestibule in the winter. The upside, though, is that the owner often gives out amazing little bites while you're waiting- I got bread with truffle oil- YUM! Also, the patio is really beautiful in the summer and it's a peaceful little corner of Ravenswood. This is my little neighborhood jewel I show off to all visitors- all VERY impressed!
