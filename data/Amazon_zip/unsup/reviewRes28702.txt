Thanks to the chicken mole I officially have heartburn and acid reflux, chronically. Coming home from the restaurant I smelled like a filthy dishwasher's uniform and threw up into my mouth. While in a hotel elevator my girlfriend looked at me disgusted when I told her I had thrown up in my mouth. Thanks Top Chef Master Rick Bayless! Seriously, I would give him a second chance and I love Mexican food but I am cursed with heartburn whenever I eat out. Beware!
