Stayed here last February and again this New Year's Eve eve for a friend's wedding. The reception was at Zapatista a few blocks away. The good news for us is that they allow dogs, even big dogs. For a fee of $50, we could take our 50lb+ Labradoodle (or so the rescue said) puppy with us.     I know from our last visit that the hotel gym is great, the biggest gym I have seen in any Hotel, a real gym, not just a universal machine and a couple of treadmills. It had power racks, rowers, full range of dumbbells and plates (more but my memory of a year ago is faulty).    We had the breakfast buffet in the morning. It was free and ok, but not exciting. I get excited about a good breakfast buffet. I think any calories consumed before 11am do not count.    The location of the Hotel was great for our purpose, but it is a little south of the real downtown. It is right across from the park and very close to the Grant Bark Park, which we used.    The rates were great for both stays; $80 for the first stay through Priceline and $180 for the second stay (that includes the $50 dog fee).
