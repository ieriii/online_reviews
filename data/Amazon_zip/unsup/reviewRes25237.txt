Pequod's is without a doubt the best pizza in the world. Unlike many pizza joints in Chicago, they are consistent...EVERY TIME! I have ordered and dined there at least 30 times over the past few years and never had a negative experience. I find it humorous that individuals giving it a low rating generally appear to be focused on the service. Yes, it takes a while, yes delivery is slow, that's because they don't pop it out of a box and toss it in the oven! To be honest, I've always picked it up or dined in and never had more than a 40 minute wait which is pretty much the standard for any good pizza place. Delivery does appear to take a while, but if your criteria of a good food is fast delivery, I hope you have Domino's rated 5 Stars! When you have hundreds of orders, it's gonna take a while to get the product.  Another contributor appears to be confused by the caramelized--not burnt--crust. I'm assuming these individuals had someone else actually write the review for them since they clearly can't read. Pequod's is known for their caramelized crust and clearly states in the menu it can be ordered otherwise. Pequod's is not a white table cloth, maitre d' restaurant, it's simply the best pizza in the world.
