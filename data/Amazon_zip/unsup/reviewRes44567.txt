i love the sushi here but the service is just so-so. we had to ask a few times to get the wine we had brought that they were chilling. they also got kinda mad when we could not sit because our whole table was not there but we were happy paying for drinks at their bar. i totally understand the policy we can't sit until everyone is here, but i don't get why they get mad when they get to seat another table and more $$. the sushi is definitely worth it though :)
