What is everyone talking about?! My husband and I made a special lunch date trip up from Rogers Park to Wicker Park for this joint after seeing it on the television show "Check Please." It didn't look anything like the bright, fresh restaurant they depicted on television. It was dark, it smelled like a teenager's armpit and was decorated like a Moroccan women's room. There was a big selection of food but it seemed like a mess, one type of food shlopped over into the next, kind of unappetizing/unsanitary. I didn't think it was so cheap (yeah, less than $5 for a falafel, big deal, what are people used to paying for a falafel?) and the salad bar boosted up the price pretty quickly. The guys making the sandwiches were sweet, but the cashier wore quite the frowny-face.  My chicken shawarma had a lot of dark meat and was kind of gristly, and the toppings were gloppy and wholly without flavor in a tasteless white pita. I was kind of grossed out and I didn't bother to finish it and went next door for a different sandwich after lunch, which made it not such a great deal after all. Even though my vegetarian husband was thrilled to have so many choices, we won't make any special trips back. We're waaay better off for both flavor and value at the Taste of Lebanon on Foster or the Pita Inn in Skokie. Sorry!
