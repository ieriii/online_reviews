My advice, eat a light breakfast, skip lunch, and also skip the salad bar. Because the meat is very good, and thats what you pay $50 a head for. The salad bar, while impressive, wasn't touched by our party, as we came for the meat. The place didn't disappoint, as the service was excellent, and the meats were all cooked but not over cooked. I especially liked the lamp chops.
