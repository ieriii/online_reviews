I really want to like this hotel, and in the past have stayed frequently. The truth is that the rooms are small, and old, beds soft. The customer service here is horrible, especially the front desk. This is more of a hotel where conventions stay rather than a business or vacation hotel with personal attention. Called for room service last night - held for 15 minutes then hung up. Called the front desk to change my reservation (to leave early) and was also put on hold for 20 minutes, hung up on this too. I am done! Can't stand the lack of service or caring from the staff.
