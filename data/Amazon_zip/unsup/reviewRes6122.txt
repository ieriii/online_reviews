I would have to say that Wildfire is one of my favorite steak/carnivore joints so far. It's right up there with Fogo de Chao, Ruth's Chris and Bob Chinn's. Of course when I've come to this location, I've never actually ordered a meat-based entree, but rather picked off others who have. I tend to stick with the seafood. Ooooh, the seafood. I may be in love with the Teriyaki Glazed Ahi Tuna steak which is sashimi-grade tuna encrusted with black and white sesame seeds, marinated with a light soy/ponzu sauce and lightly seared on the outside. The beautifully tender tuna steak comes with a side of wasabi-mayonaise, more soy/ponzu sauce and plenty-o pickled ginger. The fried calamari is a must-try. If you have no plans to save room for dessert, at least ask to see the dessert tray. That just may change your mind. Service is usually above average and very friendly. Who knew that they have such an aweseome children's menu as well?
