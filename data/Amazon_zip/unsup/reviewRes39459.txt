Awesome. Authentic. Fun. I took my mom here will she was in town. I like to bring her to unique places and based on the previous reviews I knew it was a great choice. We started with the Seafood Pajan (sp?) which was huge and awesome. It is similar to a seafood pancake and comes with this sweet/sour dipping sauce. Very Good! For the main course we ordered the bulgoki and the chicken. Both had awesome flavors! The bulgoki was sweet and tender and the chicken was spicy and flavorful. I was equally impressed with both! Now for the 20 or so small bowls of side dishes that come with the meal. We had a blast trying to figure out what each thing was. One person would taste, guess and pass it on. It was definitely an experiment! We also ordered a small bottle of SoJu. I was familiar with it from previous Korean restaurants and love the smooth taste but it was a bit strong for me to sip. While one of my dining companions sipped it straight, I mixed with a little soda. I had a ton of fun. The service was quick, the grilling was an experience, and the food was great. I will be back again for sure!
