*Disclaimer- if you have as much personality as the beautiful couple in the American Gothic painting, maybe not the place for you. If you're well liked by others- this is the place for you. Ahhh the Publican, how the meat packing district defines your genuine stench. Tucked away in the Chicago meat packing district, this gem is definitely a defining dining experience. #1. Its crowded. This place was jam-packed on a Tuesday night. Must be doing something right. #2. Ambiance. This restaurant gets noisy, real noisy. No real partitions or walls in this "barn". I dont mind the noise. Its food I want. #3. Family style seating, family style food. The one hallmark of good restaurants is the harmony of contributing elements to the total experience. Carpet matches the drapes per se- relaxed dress, wait staff has creme colored butchers apron-esque uniforms (brilliant), fun seating arrangements. #4. Food. Good. Not mind blowing, but served piping hot. I dont remember the last time I almost burned my mouth on a french fry- that almost happened here. The pork rinds? To die for. I could eat these all day. Wonder if triple bypass is on the menu as well. Ribs- fantastic, juicy, mesquite flavor, grill marks! (a must for bbqed foods- unless theyre fake like those pork patties you got in elementary school for lunch or the McRib). Lamb Saddle- small portion, nice rare medallions of lamb, cute little bit of fat. Salty, but complimented well by the peas and mash. Delicious, but I wish I had more. Whole Chicken (w/fries)- My my, this dish was fantastic. Very juicy, STEAMLINES (you cant fake steamlines), seasoned well, perfectly cooked. Delicious, good portion, fries soak up all the cooking juices from the chicken, beautiful. Overall a good experience with good food. Will definitely come back.
