I was so excited that I got the chance to go to this bar during my recent trip to Chicago. My sister-in-law lives just a couple of blocks away, and we walked past this bar a few times during the day - and it was constantly packed!! But, I was happy to be in midst of all the action later on that evening, drinking my delicious Delerium - which they have on-tap!!! We eventually event found a table downstairs, and the most delicious dark, malty, chocolate-y stout found its way into my hand. This made me a happy girl.  Can't wait to go back!
