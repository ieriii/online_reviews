My little brother's expense account affords me luxuries I might not otherwise be able to frequently enjoy. Shout out to the little brother! And shout out to Bovine Heaven. I'm a carnivore, through and through. The more saturated fat, the better. By the end of my last tour d'meat, my plate was a mess of carnage. And I delighted in it! So, cute guys wielding carcass and fussing over me is pretty much my idea of a dream meal. When I am seated at Fogo, I basically have to expend enough energy to lift a fork, forage for fresh mozzarella at the salad bar and mutter, "medium rare, please" about seven thousand times. The staff is insanely friendly and accommodating, the food is consistently above par and the bathrooms are tidy (this is important for frequent peers such as I...). It's pricey, but lunch is significantly cheaper than dinner...and, like I bragged, little brother's expense account usually foots the bill! Stop judging, we talk plenty of business! Big hint: fight the urge to go nuts at the salad bar. Your stomach only has so much room...
