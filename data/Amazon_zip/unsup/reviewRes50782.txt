After an eight hour road trip and a trek out to Midway to return the rental car, I really, really wanted to treat myself to a nice meal at a restaurant near the Brown Line. And Wishbone did me right. The food was awesome. Crab fritters, poached salmon, and CHEESE GRITS. Oh so good. It was below zero and the day after New Year's, so the restaurant was nearly empty. Our server was great. He made great recommendations and was very slick with his offers of more drinks and dessert. I can't honestly say what it would have been like if the place was busier.
