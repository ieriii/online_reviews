Solid, a place that I just can't seem to quit (sorry, brokeback mountain fans). Have been here twice for dinners (once during February restaurant week and once in the summer) and more times than I can count for a drink at the bar. The food is always very inventive and it is great that there's an in-house sommelier who's willing to help- and not just trying to push the most expensive bottles. The last time I was there, the chef kept popping by asking how things were. This happened not once, not twice, but three times. It is good that he's attentive, but maybe not so good near the end of the meal when I could barely keep my head up with the two bottles of wine that I consumed. This is the kind of place that I can easily run into the ground, so will probably take a break before returning.
