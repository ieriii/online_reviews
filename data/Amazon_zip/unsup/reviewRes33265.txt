I used to eat falafel all the time. Then a few years ago I spent some time in Israel and ate more falafel than any girl prone to bad stomachaches should eat. Thus the end of my love affair with falafel. So when Colleen C and I entered Sultan's Market yesterday for lunch falafel wasn't really what I wanted. Sultan's had a delicious looking salad bar that I was about to hit up when I remembered the hundreds of Yelp reviews all raving about the falafel at Sultan's Market. So I did what any good yelper would do...ordered a falafel sandwich and braced myself for a stomach ache later that day.  Sultan could give my peeps in Israel a lesson on how to make a good falafel sandwich. This was darn tasty and a very generous portion...and at Mickey D's prices. Seriously, $4 for a very large falafel sandwich. I can't remember I had a lunch that cheap that wasn't the quality of a happy meal at McDonalds. We did hit up the salad bar as well...and got ourselves a few stuffed grape leaves. Those were really good too, but I recommend putting trust in these yelp reviews and going right for that falafel sandwich. And the good news is that I made it thru the day without a stomach ache. Thanks to Sultan I think it's time for me to resume my love affair with falafel.
