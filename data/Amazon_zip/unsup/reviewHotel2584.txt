Had a great time at the Victor Hotel. No cover. Staff was friendly. Decor is great and spacey. Music was fantastic!! It was a shame that no one was dancing though. Drinks were good. Tried Grey Goose Pomegranate vodka and it was great! Never even heard of it before! Bartender was pretty hott too, too bad he is probably gay...Lots of eye candy..some gross older men trying to hit on my friend and i but other than that it was a great time. Cant wait to go back. I hear Wednesday nights is a hot night.
