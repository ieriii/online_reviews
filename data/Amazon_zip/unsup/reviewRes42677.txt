And, I do not even partake of deep dish pizza, anymore:o Too much dough, but that is another story for another time on an entirely different website.  I always go with my standard thin-crust order with pineapple. The pineapple is fresh and ample, and I just stare at all of the oregano on top of my little gem for a good ten minutes before I dive into the mix. I like to inquire over the phone as to how many people each size serves. However, I suspect that the dudes on the phone are starting to recognize my voice (since I call every week), and they probably already know that I just eat the whole damn thing myself. That is my only complaint for The Art Of Pizza. Because of you guys, my pizza addiction has returned in full-force, and I have to go to the gym twice as often as I did before. Ok fine. I never went to the gym before, anyway. But, now, I HAVE to go.  Sigh.  Nevertheless, your cheese-to-sauce ration is superb, and I do appreciate the fact that I got to keep my first pizza which mistakenly arrived two weeks ago with pepperoni instead of pineapple. I gave that one to the boyfriend, and I scarfed the pineapple one that you guys hurried over to me, in my closet......guilty but pretty damn happy with all of that sauce on my face. Thanks, Dudes.
