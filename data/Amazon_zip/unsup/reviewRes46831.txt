Went last night for dinner. It was very mediocre. It's a pretty space but when we went, it was in the 40s out and I swear there was a door open somewhere because it was FREEZING inside the place. We looked around and half the people in the place were dining with their jackets on. It wasn't comfortable and made you feel like you wanted to eat and run. We did end up asking the server to warm the place up and they did. In terms of the food, there was a lack of seasoning on the gnocchi and frites with the mussels. The veggie ragout was OK. My husband had a pork chop which was way overcooked and the cut they used was not good. Dessert was good except for the horrendous sauces they tried to use. They were truly completely inedible. I had the brownie sundae that had some attempt at a caramel sauce. It was bitter and watery and not good. My husband had the brown butter pear cake which was tasty but again the sauce was also bitter and sour - like raw molasses. It really is a shame because their concept of fresh, local ingredients is wonderful as is their roof top garden. The problem is if you don't have a chef/s that work with the great ingredients and make it taste delicious, you end up with a mediocre menu.
