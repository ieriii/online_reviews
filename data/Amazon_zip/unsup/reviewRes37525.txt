After a bad service experience Hopleaf boycott, I took an out of town guest, and his brother (who had never been that far north before) to Hopleaf, last Saturday in the early evening. Service was less surly than in the past. We got a table before the 45 minute estimate given by the hostess. However, the food was a disappointment. We split a soggy endive salad, and two orders of mussels (belgian, and coconut curry). The fries were not fresh.  Beer selection felt lesser. I remember being overwhelmed by choices in the past. Maybe they scaled down the menu for the recession. Maybe we got an abbreviated menu. As Ellen P. noted, service has always been poor here. But in the past, the great food and beer selection made up for it. Go with Quenchers at Fullerton and Western. The food is not great, but the service is consistently good, and they have maintained a large selection of beers.
