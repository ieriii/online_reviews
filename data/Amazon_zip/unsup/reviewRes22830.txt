The crispy shrimp in mayonnaise sauce almost made me cry with happiness. And the rest of the food was awesome, too. The duck was perfectly done and not greasy at all, which can be a frequent problem with that dish. We ordered expansively - had something with curry, potstickers, and combination lo mein, I think - without a single disappointment. Corkage charge is $10 per table and we weren't discouraged at all from BYOB.  We were seated promptly and the service was professional and super-swift. It's been a week and I'm already trying to figure out when I can go back without looking like a stalker.  A stalker of shrimpy delights.
