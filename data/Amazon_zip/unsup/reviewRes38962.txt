I wouldn't know how great the food is here because I've always been incredibly angry when I've eaten it. The customer service here is terrible. From when you walk in the door you are treated like the cattle used in the burgers you are about to eat. There is no friendly greeting, just "IDS." or "How many in your party."  Each time I've been my waiter hasn't been particularly nice, but this last night set me off. He was flat out rude, and if I had the balls to not leave a tip I wouldn't have. Amongst ignoring multiple requesta during the meal, when we finally asked for our check after being ignored for an extended amount of time, he responded, "it's on the house." we all looked at each other in confusion until he smirked and said,"wouldn't that have been nice." and set the check down. I don't know if he was trying to be funny or what, but it was outrageous. This is just one instance of the wonderful service I've had at this place. Why would I come here when I could enjoy just as creative and wonderful food on Randolph street, while still be treated like a human being?
