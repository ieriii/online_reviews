I visited Shaw's and was a little disappointed.First off our waitress was a little rude and we felt rushed to order. The server assistants however did a great job at making sure the table was bussed.The $18 sushi roll was a joke. It was filled with virtually nothing and had hardly any flavor. My $15 fish taco was also flavorless and one of the fish tacos was filled with fish bones. I mean I know it's a fish taco, but come on.The oysters were the shining moment of the meal. I usually cant stand oysters, but Shaw's had a huge variety and they were very very good.All in all after an over $200 bill for 4 people I was a little upset. I don't mind spending money on an amazing dining experience with amazing food. But for what we got it was not worth the price.
