Somewhat overrated in my opinion. There was a bit of a wait but shorter than we were told. I ordered the Peeky Toe Crab Benedict and it was good but I got sick of it halfway trough the meal. The potatoes that came with it were excellent though. Someone else in my party got the fried chicken which was juicy and delicious till he got to the middle which was cold. He sent it back and got another meal. The Wild Boar Sloppy Joe was very tasty and a bit spicy. There are a great deal of drink choices here and their service is pretty good.
