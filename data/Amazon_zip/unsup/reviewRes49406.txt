We were lured here by the $10 wine promotion and our curiosity about the place. We ended up having a decent experience, but nothing to rave about. The $10 wine special was nice though; we had a tasty Sicilian syrah with our meal and felt like it was a good bargain. For our meal, we put together a bunch of smaller plate dishes, which is how we prefer to dine, but the menu wasn't very encouraging of this option. Nonetheless, we had two of their salads, which were ok, but again, not remarkable. Next we had their mussels, which were actually pretty good. The house made smoked salmon was also pretty good. Then we had a cheese flight and a dish of olives. For the cheese flight, we chose the Spanish cheeses, which included four cheeses: Zamorano, Cabra al Vino, Pau;s Sant Mateu, and Manchego (the reason I remember is they bring you a little piece of paper with the names on it and I took mine with me). The olives I didn't like so much, which is unusual, because I normally love olives. I just did not like the flavor of their marinade, I guess. Anyway, as I said, it was an ok experience. I wasn't super-impressed. It seemed like there was a level of pretentiousness with the wine recommendations and cheese and wine flights that was a little over the top. their selection of cheeses is impressive though,
