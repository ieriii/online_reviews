I waited tables here for my first 4 years in Chicago...Yes, I work in advertising- ha! Even after working here for so long, its one of the places I miss about Chicago. Completely reasonable prices for a healthy portion of food. As a waitress here, I loved the people who came in- mostly regulars. Newbies- please remember to give the waitstaff a break if they are slammed. The Pasta Bowl has NO busboys. The waiters do everything from taking orders, refilling drinks, bringing food and busing tables. Sometimes an extra cook from the back will help out, but keep in mind the waiters are going it alone.  Things to keep in mind: -The salads are awesome! Spinach salad with goat cheese is my fave. They are HUGE though, keep in mind if you are ordering pasta too. -Farfalle pollo is most popular- its a heart attack on a plate. -Rigatone Bolognese is yummy. -Cooks will change/add anything. Everything is fresh so there is little that they can't do.  -Vegetarians- keep in mind that their marinara and most of their soups are beef based. Ask for the BV marinara. Its on the "Lighter Side" menu, no beef stock. -If your waitress is clueless, feel free to ask one of the cooks at the bar. Most of those guys have been there forever.
