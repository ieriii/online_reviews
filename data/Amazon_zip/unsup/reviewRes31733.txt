I had apparently been doing it all wrong, and I have finally been set straight. Here's the shortlist, friends, for how to have a good meal at Chicago Diner. 1. Order the Reuben or the Dagwood. Don't get a side of mashed potatoes, it's one ice cream scoop of weak potato in a cup. Get sweet potato fries or the kale salad. 2. Don't order a milkshake with your meal, or you will drink it before your food arrives and then you will have a stomachache. Get it for dessert. 3. Don't order coffee if you don't really, really need coffee. It's miraculously bad for a place that should have better stuff. 4. Make EXTRA sure you don't order anything off the specials menu, no matter how good it looks like it might be. It will be under-seasoned and probably cold. 5. Did you order the Reuben or Dagwood? Seriously. Trust me. They are good, made even more delicious by the pitiful state of everything else. To make things even simpler: order the Dagwood and kale salad, split a peanut butter cookie milkshake with your dining companion, make it out alive. You're welcome.
