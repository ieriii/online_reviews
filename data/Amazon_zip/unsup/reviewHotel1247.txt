This hotel was great for what we were doing: passing through town. Our check-in was quick and the desk staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was booked through http://Hotwire.com (which is probably where everyone else that day booked their room, since there was no convention that weekend) and so it came over with a single King bed reservation even though I reserved for 4 people - a knock against Hotwire, not the hotel. Hyatt was happy to move me to a two-double bed room. The room had nice beds and linens, but the pillows were uncomfortable. The elevators were swift and to echo everyone else's statements about the gym: amazing. For gym enthusiasts: free towels, including chilled ones - free headphones, free water, music playing, TVs on, tons of cardio machines, free weights, jump ropes, resistance bands, medicine balls, balance balls, a full range of ROM weight machines, roman chair, etc. - really - AMAZING. The locker rooms have lockers, showers, sauna!! The pool is silly, it's more of a kiddie pool than anything, but the gym is 24 hours, so that's a huge plus. There aren't a million TV channels, and the internet is for-cost but those weren't material to us. It would've been nice to access the internet for questions about where to go to dinner, but the concierge was more than helpful about that. The hotel has really thin walls, we travel with a sound machine, but I could still hear TV in other rooms at 4am - lots of doors opening/closing late at night in the hall, too. Toiletries were above average and nice smelling. Plenty of towels. Room included iron, hairdryer (on closet shelf), bible, chairs, floorspace, mirror, bench. The split bathroom was nice for people traveling with more than one person. Temperature in the hotel was just fine for us, perfect for sleeping. For-cost amenities are over-priced, but we avoided them by bringing out own snacks/drinks and eating elsewhere. I would stay here again!
