It took us forever to get seated but the staff was so friend and offered to call us while we drank down the street. I of course brought my proud Italian friend who knows her italian food. She loved it of course, but we were overloaded.  We came as a group of four and just shared our small plates. We had the truffle egg bread, we had the egg on top of our pizza, and i also had (my favorite of the night) another raw egg nested in my noodles with sea urchin sauce. Definitely a cholesterol overload. I later slipped into a food coma that night, but it was all worth it. I will be returning but maybe next time I'll ease up on the eggs.
