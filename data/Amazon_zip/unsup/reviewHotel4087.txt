About two months before our wedding I reserved five rooms at the Hyatt for our special guests. For some reason we had to split up the reservations between two names. This was the cause of much confusion down the road. Then, when we tried to get an adjustment to the pricing during a special sale, some of our rooms were canceled. While I received email notices about everything concerning the rooms, I never received any cancellation notifications. I only happen to find out about the cancellation when I called the night before to ask a few questions about the check in process for my guests. We all ended up with rooms at the reserved pricing, but only after a few phone calls and too many minutes at the front desk. Aside from their difficult small group room reservation process, it was an OK place for our guests. The rooms and facilities were clean. The bar in the main lobby provided a fun place for our guests to end the evening. The cafe food was good and the breakfast buffet had a very nice spread.  Overall, we enjoyed staying there but I will not select this place for large groups in the future.
