Definitely a great little Italian restaurant in the Ravenswood area. Pros: Intimate for a nice date, BYOB (Always a huge plus, especially if you have a consumption problem like muah.), huge portions and great service. Cons: (Only can think of one.) The restaurant is small and they try to jam as many tables as possible, so it feels like your also dining with the people next to you. My conversations usually end up being inappropriate which is kind of AWKWARD when grandma and grandpa are next to you. Definitely add it to your list of great BYOB restaurants in Chicago. P.S. Make reservations ahead of time.
