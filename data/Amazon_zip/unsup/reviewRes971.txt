Hot Doug's doesn't get old and I haven't had a bad visit yet, and that is why I am adding the extra star. I've learned to target my visits on days and times the lines are likely to be short, such as a 90 degree day last week when people didn't want to melt while waiting in line and the wait was less than ten minutes. This time the game of the week was "Pear and Port Wine Elk Sausage with Foie Gras Aioli and Aged Centenol Cheese". I actually had to look up Centenol Cheese, because I'd never heard of it. I still don't know exactly what it is, but it was delicious. So finally, in my tradition of Hot Doug's reviews, here are some suggestions to Doug for Games of the Week: Velociraptor Worg Bunyip R.O.U.S. Kraken Chupacabra Shoggoth
