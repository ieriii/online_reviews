We've been here twice, and both times I think the food was awesome. The only complaint I had was the seating--too crowded. The first time we went there, we ordered Sardines and Pig's Ear with kale for appetizer. Pig's ear was good but sardines were a bit too strong. Then we tried the Purple Pig Platter. All the cured meats were delicious, but my favorite was the Jamon Serrano, which was the duck meat and had very strong taste. I think my BF's fav was the Salami. We also had the Pork Neck Bone Rillette. It was presented in a glass jar, easy on the eyes and better in your mouth. The meat melts in your mouth, coupled with the fat and the bread, it was delish. The second time, after reading all the reviews on their Bone Marrow smear, we decided to give it a try. I think the breads were what made it yummy. We also ordered Pork Blade Steak and some duck egg with Serrano on a bread, both of which were very unique and delectable. Although after the whole meal, we felt like we were overloaded on the bread. All in all, it was a solid 4 and we will definitely go back.
