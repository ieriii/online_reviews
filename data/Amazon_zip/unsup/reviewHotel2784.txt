A wee bit of an oops or two but we LOVED LOVED LOVED this place (is it clear we loved this place :-) ! Hubby and I just returned today from a weekend stay at The James. This place is centrally located just off of Michigan Avenue on Ontario Street and if you look up "Swanky" in the dictionary, I'm fairly sure you will find The James featured. Everyone and I mean everyone from the Valet parking staff to front desk professionals were out of their minds friendly and helpful, which is refreshing! We had a room on the 16th floor with a great view of Chicago life below but when we arrived our keys didn't work in our room. A very helpful housekeeper saved the day by immediately calling a supervisor who let us in the room and within 5 minutes we had our keys with numerous apologies. No cheap room amenities here, Keihl's products galore! Friday night we dined at David Burke's Steakhouse on site which was divine. Dry aged steak was the best I have ever had, martini's reasonable priced and deliciious! Saturday after breakfast at nearby Grand Lux Cafe which I would highly recommend we spent the day shopping on Michigan Avenue, awesome shops including Crate & Barr ell and Tiffany & Co within close walking distance of The James. We arrived back t our room around 3pm and were a bit disappointed that our room had not yet been serviced by housekeeping. Called the front though and immediately got fresh towels and we were happy and when we came back from dinner our room was thoroughly cleaned with their nightly turn down service and cookies, ice bucket filled, dimly lit lights and music playing. It does not get any better than this. We will most definitely absolutely hale yes be returning to The James for another Chi town visit soon!!!
