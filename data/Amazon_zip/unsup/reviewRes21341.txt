To be honest with you, this place is more touristy than anything else. I'm not saying the hot dogs are bad, they just don't really stand out more than any other hot dog stand that you can find in the city, and you can find plenty of those. The best thing about the place is the experience of doing the old school Drive-In thing. If you haven't gone to one in your life, I would definitely recommend this place just because of that but if you are going for the dog and something unique as far as food, I wouldn't drive over there unless you live in the area. It is an experience to have a car hop but I really look for something unique in the hot dog that sets it apart from the rest. -Papa Bear
