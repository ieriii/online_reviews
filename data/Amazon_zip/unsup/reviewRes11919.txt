THE OWNER IS A TOTAL DOUCHE. He is SO rude. Went there today with my 2 year old. I was told the wait would be under 5 minutes. 10 minutes later, my child is screaming. I ask the owner if i could be seated in the booth that had just opened. He literally IGNORED me and walked away. He came back and told me to wait. He was again SO RUDE about not seating me because it was a booth (4-top). I reminded him that I had a screaming child, that there was an open table and I had been told under 5 minutes. Wound up walking out. Probably would have been fine if he had been REMOTELY polite to me, but he was SO rude the entire time. DON'T GIVE ONE PENNY TO THIS DOUCHE.
