This is the Pho spot to goto Love it here like others have said it is mad crazy up in here and busy as hell, they will usually ask if you mind sharing a table, which to me isn't a issue as I get seated quicker only small bummer is they just raised the prices but still not too bad, and they also got shiny new menu's with even more pictures than before we always get the rare beef Pho and some spring rolls both very good, so far this place has the best broth in town nice and savory, never greasy or too sweet like some other places, we tend to also get a Bahn Mi to go when ever we get here also I love the Chicken it is always tender with lits of veggies on it
