I had a groupon for Geja's and came here for dinner after work. The ambiance was romantic -- which was really funny to me and my friend -- we were doing a "let's catch-up dinner." But I digress. First - the service was nice, but the place was so dark she accidentally spilled and stepped on me. A little light would've been nice. The cheese part was a-okay, although nothing compared to the fondues in Switzerland. The entree part of the fondue was subpar - the dipping sauces just weren't that great. They weren't very tasty and I didn't feel satisfied at all. But good thing there was the chocolate! It was probably the best part - both the yummy chocolate and the super cool flames (on which I was so captivated I burned my marshmallow :/ ) If I go back, it'll probably just be for the chocolate fondue.
