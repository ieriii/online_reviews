I knew I was going to frequent this place when they were still just getting the place ready. They had painted a mural on the back wall (now in the enclosed four seasons patio) and someone tagged the crap out of it. For whatever reason I felt so awful about it. After someone put all that work into it to have someone come by and do that is pretty frustrating. I love when a new place comes into the Square and helps to make it a little better and I get pretty ticked when people try to muck it up. Anyhow, I've now been there many, many times! The atmosphere is great, your fellow diners are great! The food is great! I haven't had anything that's not good. Vaca Frita, Snapper, sandwiches, everything! Yum, double yum! Oh, this place is so good that I even love their tostones and I hate plantains! Another great thing is that they're BYOB! You can also bring in the necessary alcohols for Mojitos and sangria and they'll mix it up for you. I forget how much it costs but it isn't terribly unreasonable and great for when you go with a group!!
