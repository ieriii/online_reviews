I'm sorry but for the price this hotel is an EPIC FAIL on every level. The rooms smell, I tried two different ones and went for the paint smell over the old furnace smell. The closet doors did not work. The lobby feels OLD and TIRED. I love classic architecture and love some older hotels, but older hotels require maintenance. This one doesn't cut it. No wireless internet in the room - remember this is a Conference Center Hotel, so it was designed for business travelers. Seriously I picked up the wireless from across the street at the Travelodge.  I don't know what to say other than do NOT stay here, if your conference is here, stay somewhere else and come for the conference. The website is very mis-leading. I have stayed at hotels all over the US and the world, for price performance this is one of the worst ever, not the worst hotel, but for the price and given there are better deals in Chicago.
