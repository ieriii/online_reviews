I recently tried this restuarant before a show at the Annoyance Theatre. Definitely a nice experience and great for a group, in fact most of the tables were full with groups of five or more. I noticed everyone with soup but our table it seemed. It seemed way to hot for a boiling cauldron of soup. Anyway, we had the shrimp spring rolls and the pork skin spring rolls. I didn't try the pork skin but the shrimp were tangy and fresh tasting, yum. We also got spicy lemongrass chicken, crispy noodles with shrimp, and beef with brocoli. I wasn't crazy about the beef because it was kind of gray colored and a little dry but the brocoli was very good. The noodles were crispy and amazing and the chicken was a nice spice. I think the portions definitely could have been a little bigger though. One last thing, they included the tip in our bill even though we were only a group of 4 which was a little strange but no big deal...in fact we wanted to tip them more for the nice service. Give this place a try and I don't think you'll regret it.
