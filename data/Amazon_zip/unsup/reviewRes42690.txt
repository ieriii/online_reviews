Ok, we happened to be next door when we were drawn into the door by the smells coming from this place. You may be taken back by the menu, your looking at 60+ pizza's and its overwhelming at first. Not to mention salads and chicken. Take a breath, and know that no matter what you choose, quality ingredients are going to end up on your plate. Let's talk pizza for a moment. Think Sapore di Napoli, Spacca Napoli but with a brazilian/italian flair... Seems strange but this brazilian joint is putting out quality pizza's with a great crust coming from the stone hearth oven. The sausage was amazing, my wife enjoyed every slice. Also, try the potato/chicken appetizer it's great! We will be back to this place for sure.
