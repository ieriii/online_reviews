All I can say is - great steaks! The steak (Filet) totally melts in your mouth, not to mention the nice buttery aroma from the sizzling butter on my hot plate! The sides were also pretty yummy - we got the creamed spinach (could use a little more salt, but that'd be unhealthy), mashed sweet potatoes, and shoe string fries. Finished our dinner on a high note by orderng Creme Brulee and Chocolate Sin Cake...the cake was a little dry and hard, but the Creme Brulee was simply heavenly...very rich and creamy. So if you ever go there for steaks, def. save some room for dessert, cuz it's worth it!
