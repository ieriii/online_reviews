I've eaten here/gotten takeaway more times than I'd care to admit and the rolls are always amazing. The godzilla roll is one of the best, it's so much better than the godzilla at Butterfly. The dragon roll is another one of my favorites.  The dining room is tiny but I've never had a bad experience, the servers have always been nice and it's BYOB.
