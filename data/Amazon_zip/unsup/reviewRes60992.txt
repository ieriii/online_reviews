This place is pretty good for what it is. I really just want to talk about the waffle fries--so good. Also, the late night menu lets you build your own burger using like 80 bagillion options and mine came out super tasty. I'm not much of a drinker, but the cocktails they had were pretty good. My bf and his friend enjoy the beer and wings. This is a great place for people watching (I like to sit on the second floor and look down at all the desperate men). I'm not a huge fan of pop music, but I have to say that the dj-ing is pretty darn good. It's loud and crowded, but that can be cathartic in a good way. The service is good too (albeit valley-girlish).
