My absolute favorite place to go out to eat in Chicago is a quaint, little South American steak house called Las Tablas. Tucked away near the Southport/Lincoln intersection, it is definitely a hidden treasure. I was taken to Las Tablas on a date years ago and although the relationship didn't last, my love for the restaurant did! The menu offers authentic South American cuisine like steak, seafood, paella and some vegetarian dishes prepared in the traditional Colombian/Argentinean way. My go-to dish is the Churrasco steak, which is huge, so bring your appetite. Dishes are served on wooden slabs and include potatoes, yucca, and my favorite, the "magic green sauce" with which I drown everything on my plate. There is occasionally live music to listen to during dinner and on my last visit I even joined in on a salsa lesson! There are different sized tables for romantic dates or for larger groups like birthday parties. Everyone that has come to Chicago to visit me gets to check out Las Tablas. I love taking new people there and introducing them to the flavorful, traditional tastes of South America & showing them just how magic the green sauce really is. Don't forget to BYOB and get there early on weekend nights, the place gets packed!
