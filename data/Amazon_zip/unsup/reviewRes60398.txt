I came into Chicago from Minneapolis to visit family and have a break, which also included having my first deep dish. I have to say, I don't think I could have it all the time, but I'm glad to have experienced it.Giordano's was nicely low-key on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. The staff were very friendly and it was fun tourist-watching (a very cute japanese couple took turns taking each other's pictures with their pizza). The loop location was very convenient for site-seeing and didn't seem like it was solely for tourists. My boyfriend and I ordered two personal size pizzas since I'm rather plain in my tastes (I had just cheese, he had meats and veggies). It took about 30 min, but we ate great garlic cheese bread to take the edge off. The pizza was hot, cheesy, and very good. I was worried it'd be very saucy, since that goes on top, but I thought the ratios were good all around.It was a really nice experience on a good vacation day, but probably not the place real chicagoans often head for their deep dish.
