I've been going here almost weekly since I moved to Chicago back in 2006. Found it through a friend. It is my favorite place to get Mexican. The food is always top notch and the service is always friendly and with a smile. My favorite dishes are the shrimp fajitas and the burrito suizo. Their guacamole is pretty good too!! 1/2 price house margaritas and pitchers on Tuesday and Thursday make dinner and unwinding at the end of the day fabulous and affordable. I reccommend the raspberry and pineapple! I highly recommend you give this place a try if you have not done so already!!
