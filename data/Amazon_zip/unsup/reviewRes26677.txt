I have only seen my father get emotional maybe twice: once for my uncle getting married and another time when we saw Stonehenge. Until we went to Pequods. I don't know, maybe its the fact I grew up in the southeast and the only pizza we had was dominoes but that all changed when I moved to Chicago. Now, I have access to some of the best pizza places around: Art of Pizza, Pequod's, Pat's, and even some of the chains are way better than the cardboard I was used to eating. Anyway, my father and I got a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and fresh basil. I mean holy shit, this stuff was great, and my dad would not shut up about it. I had to take him to see a movie to shut him up. Even after There Will Be Blood he was going on a on about the pizza.  So there you have it Pequods, you managed to out due an Oscar winning performance with your pizza. Good Job.
