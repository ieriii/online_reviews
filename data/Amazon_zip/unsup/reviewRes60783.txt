I was really hoping this place was going to be great.  I live very close to it and the hood needs a good place to eat and relax.  However, its been disappointing so far.  My first visit was ok. I had a great burger and the service was awesome. However, the atmosphere of pounding music and all-you-can handle concerts was a bit too much.  Unfortunatley, today's experience soured me even more.  I had the wings, which were labeled as some kind of "sweet chili" wings, but were more like terriaki and onion wings. Very disappointing. also, the service sucked.  Im very disappointed that this neighborhood finally has a bar with decent burgers, and the chance to be a place for refuge from a tough week.  Instead, we got a burger place (albeit, great burgers) and a place to watch overaged headbangers on tv.
