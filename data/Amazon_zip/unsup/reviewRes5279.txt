My trip to the purple pig was originally to use the bathroom but once I stepped in I was tempted for some wine and cheese. OMG I was a happy girl when I left. Fava Beans, Leeks with Hard Boiled Eggs & Crispy Prosciutto super yummy!!! They lose a star because of the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio spread, it sounded better on paper but was just meh. I will return for another snack if I'm back in Chicago
