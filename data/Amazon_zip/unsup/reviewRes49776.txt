This was my first time to try Columbian food, and I enjoyed everything about it. As an Art History student, I especially enjoyed the Botero paintings of delightfully plump people that were hanging all over the restaurant. Got the empanadas for the appetizers and they were perfect. Flaky crust and savory stuffing. Then for entree, my dining companion and I split one of the combination plates which was recommended for serving two. It came with a little bit of everything - steak, ribs, sausage, chicken, plantains, potatoes, and yuca. This was great for the first visit because I got to figure out what I liked, and I especially enjoyed the chicken and the plaintains. The other meats were good, but the potatoes and the yuca were super dry. I would suggest though that you split the two person combo platter between three or even four people. We had a bunch of leftovers, and there was just way too much food for a platter suggested for two. Our meal came out to about $80 (for food, wine, tax, and tip) for two people. A bit pricey, so I'll try out other South American steakhouses which might be cheaper. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed dinner here.
