I love this place, even though I am not a fan of mixed meats. the foie gras hot dog is amazing, and bison, elk, alligator meats make it really interesting. Doug is also super nice and makes the whole place fun. However, the wait is brutal and unless you are really craving, you don't wanna wait up to an hour for food. but once you do reach the end of the line, you feel the need to get 10 hot dogs, seriously, and eat them all in one day, because they are that good!
