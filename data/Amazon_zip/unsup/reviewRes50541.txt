I have to admit, I'm a creature of habit. Once I order a dish from a restaurant that is mouth-watering, I tend to order the same thing each time I go back. This is true with Wishbone. Although I'd love to try some of their other breakfast/brunch options, or their fried chicken with greens... I always go for the shrimp and grits. Why? Because it's THAT good. So good, in fact, that I've ordered delivery just to get my fix.  To be short and sweet: There's usually a wait on weekend morning/mid-day/early afternoon because of the brunch crowd. NOTE - they won't seat you until your entire party is actually at the restaurant. We had a friend go to their other location and we had to sit there and wait for her to arrive before they would even let us sit down... and I really, really needed coffee at that point! Oh well, worth the wait.  One day I will order something else, I promise. And I'm sure I'll have grand things to say about that meal. But until then, shrimp-n-grits fo' life!!!! (proceeds to order some delivery)
