The Publican...ohhh the Publican. I was so excited to visit you. And you let me down. Here's the rundown: The good: The oysters - We got an array of different kinds of oysters and they were all delicious. The bread - yummmmm. The dessert The bad: Fried shrimp appetizer - they kept the shells on and then fried them. I really tried to like these, but the texture felt like eating toenails. Ugh. The open kitchen - Normally, I like the idea of an open kitchen. But, if you're going to have an open kitchen, you need to teach your servers to remember that everyone can see what they are doing in there. The night we went to the Publican, there was a waitress (not ours, thank goodness) who repeatedly went into the kitchen, played with her hair, and then touched people's food that she was about to serve. I don't mean she picked up the plates, I mean she touched the food, rearranging it on the plate. I was disgusted. Overall, the service was good, the atmosphere was good, but the food, eh, I've had better, and especially for the price.
