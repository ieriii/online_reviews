Anteprima has a lot going for it. Price for one, but it was very lively for a Thursday night and the place was packed. Because they squeeze you in like sardines it's a little loud and cramped on the inside. It's not a very intimate place if that's what you're going for but has all the charm of a neighborhood spot. The food was good. I liked everything I received including the free bread and bread sticks (grissini) passed around as an appetizer. So many restaurants give boring bread to start but Anteprima's had flavor. I was happily surprised. And you can taste the ridiculous amounts of butter in the grissini which is why they're so damn good. The unfortunate thing was that no olive oil or butter were provided. So eating dry bread was the only option. My steak was cooked as I had ordered and topped with fresh herbs. I've never had a steak where, once finished cooking, fresh herbs were then put on top. They were very strong and a bit overpowering so I had to scrape them off as I was eating. They were all I tasted as I began eating. My main problem were the portion sizes. The ravioli was ordered by someone in the party and they received 6 or 8 smallish ravioli. They finished well before anyone else and immediately asked for more bread at the table. Portions here are rather small. Prices on the otherhand aren't outrageous so ordering an appetizer and dessert may be what you need. Then Anteprima no longer becomes the good value. I'd describe Anteprima as a nice neighborhood spot where you can get a quick meal for $20 on a week night when you don't want to cook. It's nothing more or less than that.
