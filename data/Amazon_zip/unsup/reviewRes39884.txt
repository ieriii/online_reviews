Good prices for korean barbecue with a vast array of panchan (side dishes). Get the marinated kalbi, chop chae, and their yuk gae jang is not bad either. I tried the kalbi tang once and it was not comparable to what I had in Korea, so that was a big bummer for me. However, they are open all the time. Only downside is you definitely smell like what you just ate afterwards. Small parking lot available.
