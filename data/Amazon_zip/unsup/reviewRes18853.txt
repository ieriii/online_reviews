I adore Top Chef Masters winner Rick Bayless and I love going to his restaurants when I'm in Chicago. I hadn't been to XOCO yet, so it was a must for this trip. This is his casual eatery. One of my favorite things about his cooking how he is able to pack such amazingly complex flavors into vegetarian food. PS there is always a vegan option on his menus. : ) If you are interested in trying some of Rick Bayless' food, but don't want to break the bank, definitely check out XOCO! Ok, so here's what I ate: Of course we started with chips, guacamole and salsa! The guac was super tasty! It had little pieces of sundried tomatoes in it instead of fresh and wow what a great idea! Next up, I had this absolutely incredible vegetable and black bean caldo. It seriously was one of the best things I've ever eaten! It was a warm broth soup with potato-masa dumplings, zucchini, onions, woodland mushrooms, black beans, avocado and is topped with arugula. Unbelievable! CHURROS! Here at XOCO, they hardly even need to ask if you would like the churros because it's almost a given that you will order them! Super yummy way to end an amazing meal!
