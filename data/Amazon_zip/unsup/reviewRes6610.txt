Aside from the waitress we had, this place was great. Second time around and it was slammin. Tender meats with good flavor, great sauce choices and the sides were perfect. Didn't expect good bbq to come from a place with this kind of decor but it did. The waitress we had was all about getting us to order more than we needed. That doesn't change my mind about the food though.The outoor seating is a great spot too
