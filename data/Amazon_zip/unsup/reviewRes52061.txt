When you feel you can make a living on your name, you should maybe check out how your waitstaff are doin! The wait just to get some service is unacceptable! We walked in & proceeded to sit in the bar, well we sat around for a good 10 mins. before I got up to get someone. Now when we walked in there was 3 guys just standing around talking. So after I tell 1 of the guys we want some service the guy says, "where did you come from?" I'm like umm I've been sittin in the bar for goin on 10 minutes! So we order the pepperoni deep dish, blue moon & a stella! We literally have just been piggin out, sharing some Chicago classics! Luckily the pizza takes 45 mins!
