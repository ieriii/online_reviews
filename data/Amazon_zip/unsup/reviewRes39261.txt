These people are magnificent. They love meat very much and it shows through the way they marinate and handle it. So lovingly they touch the meat, so tender it becomes, to where the meat and the bones all gravitate to all the open and drooling mouths in the room resulting in mouthsplosions of flavor. Many. many, many sides to accompany this magical meat, and as one Korean in the room said it...the redder the color the hotter the meal...so now I know. Must bring mass people with you to share and to suck on the bones as the bones are very tasty and suckworthy. Chukbae!
