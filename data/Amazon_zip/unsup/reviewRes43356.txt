Milk & Honey is my go-to place for brunch. I live nearby and always take people here when they are in town or I am having a lazy Sunday. Granted, I haven't been since its been cold so it might be a lot more difficult to get seated without the outdoor seating. 1-Its really quality food at a really reasonable price 2-The portions are gigantic 3-It's very neighborhoodly 4-The dishes are always fresh and interesting flavor combos. 5-The ambience is way cool. Old dishware, jars of honey, nice people. Love it here!
