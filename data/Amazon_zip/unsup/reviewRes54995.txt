After a good friend of mine said You gotta try the burger! I had to give it a shot...And I will say, the food was Okay. Not the best, and not the worst either. If the menu was 1/2 the price I would say Hey! You gotta check it out - but after being gouged on the prices, having just okay (at best) dining and dealing with hipster snobbishness..Um...By all means, PASS on this! I'd rather go to Bluebird and have a charcuterie plate and beer with a shot over and be in the presence of Real people who are happy you stopped into their establishment. I heard the owner owns the Empty Bottle and Beauty Bar...Yup, those places suck too.
