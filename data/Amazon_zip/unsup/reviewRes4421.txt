My opinion is biased, since I only really ever go to the Green Mill for the Poetry Slam, but if you are looking for the Grandaddy of the Slam, here it is. The founder of poetry slam itself, Marc Smith, hosts the slam at the Green Mill and it always awesome. The drink prices are reasonable as well, so it makes for a pretty nice time all around.
