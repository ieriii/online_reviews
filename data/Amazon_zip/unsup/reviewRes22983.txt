My husband and I decided to go here since it was close to the UC and we were going there after dinner. We were greeted with big smiles and friendly hello's as soon as we walked up to the hostess desk. Despite it being packed, we had no wait on a Sunday night at about 5pm. This place is huge, with many rooms and great for groups (we saw many 10+ groups there). We sat by the kitchen and were served immediately with bread and water. My husband and I split the greek salad, which had all the traditional fixings. I had lamb and chicken shishkabobs and my husband had a lamb artichoke dish, which he finished quickly in normal Ed fashion. Both dishes were perfectly seasoned and cooked. My husbands lamb was tender and came right off the bone. As we were leaving and waiting for our car from valet, some chick pulled up at valet. She went inside only to come out like 2 minutes later and she walked around the corner. Free valet and she wasn't even dining there! Pretty bold.
