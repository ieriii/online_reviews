If you're looking for a fondue place, this is the place to go. It's pricey but most fondue places are, and if you're going to spend the money anyways Geja's will give you great quality ingredients and make sure you're way too full to eat for the rest of the weekend. The service was great, except for the bitchy hostess. I will overlook that since our server was exceptional and the so was the food. The fondue cooks in oil, which is yes, more fattening the boiling water, but tastes 100 times better. If you're on a diet and you come here, you shouldnt be complaining, just don't eat here. If you want to eat food that actually tastes delicious and fills you up then you need to eat here. Don't forget to order their White Sangria- best sangria i've ever had. Ordered a glass, and then ordered a pitcher! hah.
