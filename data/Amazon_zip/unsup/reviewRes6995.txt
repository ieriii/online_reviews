Just simply awesome. We selected Chicago Q for restaurant week and it's the kind of place where you can't wait to take out your phone after dinner and start telling all your friends about. They were just slammed and the service was still perfect fast and pleasant.  Drink selection Aps entree desert (MILK and COOKIES) So cool that the Head Chef came out to talk to us too.  A Chicago must.
