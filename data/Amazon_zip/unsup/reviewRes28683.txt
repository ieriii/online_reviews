I have never eaten AT Pequods only ordered out. I would have to say hands down this is the best deep dish pizza in chicago. The sauce is perfect and the crust is to die for. Usually when you eat a deep dish pizza the crust at the end is this flaky cookie like substance that tastes OK but is not as good as the rest of the pizza. Pequods carmalizes their crust and has the deep dish meat of the center of the pizza go all the way to the end. You get a carmalized sweet treat. How often would you say that the crust is the best part of the pizza, when the pizza is already good?
