I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel,the location is awesome! It's in the middle of everything! On block from Michigan Ave,The Library and Museum all within walking distance.  There were no double rooms available by the time we checked in so a king would have to do for my son and I,they did offer a rollway if needed. We had a pretty large room it was a corner room with windows on two sides and quite a bit of room. The lobby itself takes your breath away and it stays busy it's full of energy. I will return and this will also be a hotel I return too.
