Where to even begin with this place: wait staff, food, wine, atmosphere, prices, selection, location, .... all are wonderful! OMG I love this place. I highly recommend making reservations before you go, but honestly I've walked in at least 4 times this summer with no reservation and they made space for me. I'm not a meat eater and they do a great job of altering the dishes to make sure you have multiple options; all their pastas are made fresh daily and delicious. My meat eating friends seem to always get the steak cooked in olive oil and rosemary; laid on a bed of arugula ... I've yet to see anyone leave even a bite on the plate. It's devoured and gushed over it's complex tastes and texture experience! Go here; you won't regret it. Ask lots of questions about the food and how it's cooked, the wait staff actually know what they are talking about and love to share the info. Also, great wine selection and the wait staff will bend over backwards to help you find something you love!
