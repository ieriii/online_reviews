I have been here over a dozen times, mostly because of my friends wanting to go. time and time again the food has been average to sub-par. The Cajun inspired dishes lack any real flavor or taste compared to what they should. The jambalaya is a joke, more like rice with a tomato based sauce on it. If you are looking for Cajun save yourself the disappointment and try somewhere like Dixie Kitchen.
