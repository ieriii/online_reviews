Framing: My partner and I went to Alinea for our 10th Anniversary. This was a special occasion so we opted for a special restaurant. The final bill was around $700 including a 13 course tasting menu with wine. Arriving at the restaurant, initially we thought we had the address wrong because it is about as nodescript as they come. Walking in, however, we were transformed into a truly magical experience with decor that was stupendous. We had the 13 course tasting menu and enjoyed every minute of it. The presentation of each course was amazing and the food really good. If there is one thing both of us questioned, it was the sheer volume of pureed or "foamy" foods. I did get a feeling much of what we were eating was prepared earlier, which is a bit disapppointing. Service was better than I expected. I can afford, thank God, this kind of restaurant and pretty much any restaurant in Chicago. Yet, I don't feel I have to act like I can, nor do I feel the servers must be snobby to make me feel special. I KNOW this is a special restaurant and I know that only certain people can afford it. But SOME (not all) of the staff were a bit pretentious. Could they afford to eat there if they did not work there? My particular server was really good, and I liked the fact that the entire staff worked together to ensure your meal was always moving. After the meal, we took a peak into the kitchen with our waiter and about a week later we received an autographed copy of our menu, which really meant a lot to us. Would I go here again? Probably - maybe for 15th Anniversary. Would I take friends? Not likely. I would rather have a nice dinner at a reasonably priced restaurant with friends where I can treat the whole crew for the price of one meal at Alinea. Great food. Great ambiance. Great service. Great presentation. REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE. And I don't feel like less of a person for saying that!
