BYBO=Best Part! Went on Saturday night about 9:30PM, seated quickly. mah Mah dey, Mediocre at best. Bread was not very fresh, so the fact it was never refilled was ok. Garlic infused oil was a hit with me. We ordered Veal Parm, which came buried in sauce. Didn't expect much else after looking at dishes on other tables while being seated. Veal was tough. Huge portion which came with small side of pasta. That part was good. Unsure if it was the cheese or the chef, but veal was very salty. Waiter recommended seafood pasta and that was just ok . We did enjoy the Chocolate Souffle. Not the best but still tasted good. With all the places you can get Italian in Chicago, probably won't be back to this place.
