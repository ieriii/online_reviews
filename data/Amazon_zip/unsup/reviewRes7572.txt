My partner was pleasure, my partner was pain. I think everyone knows the drill at Fogo de Chao. You start with the amazeballs salad bar...but know not to fill up, because better things await (at least, if you are a carnivore...if you are not a carnivore, why are you here?). Then the parade of amazeballs meat starts....and it keeps coming. Bacon wrapped filet mignon? Yes, sir. Ribs? Why not. Care for some pork loin? Who wouldn't. House sirloin? Gimme. And still, there was more. To go with all these meats are some fabulous sides, that are readily replenished (I think I ate 4 of those big honkin' plantains). But obviously, the meat is the star of the show here. And I had plenty of that. At the top of the mountain, amongst the clouds...I raised my fork in triumph towards the heavens....then realized that standing erect hurt my tummy and I had best get into the fetal position, where I remained for several hours. Pleasure and pain...oh yeah.
