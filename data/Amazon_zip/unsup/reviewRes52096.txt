Great pizza, stuff yourself and ignore everything else. This is the real stuff, THE Chicago deep dish pizza experience. You may like others better, but this is what's been Chicago deep dish pizza for 40 year. The wait is usually long, service is adequate, the decor is someones idea of a pizza joint, but you didn't come for the fine china dining. Relax, visit, look around, and enjoy great pizza. If you're a veggie, you shouldn't bother. The sausage, layered under the cheese, is the traditional Gino's East pizza, and the way to go to try the real thing.
