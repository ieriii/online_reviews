This is my favorite place for a hot dog and fries. It is quite a bit out of my way, but it is definitely worth it. Friday and Saturday are a special treat because the fries are fried in duck fat! Yummo! I have tried the Jalapeno-Cheddar Chicken hot dog with chihuahua cheese. It is very tasty. My favorite, though, is the Chicken and Wild Rice hot dog. It comes with a delicious curry mustard sauce. Ohhhhhh. So delicious! It can be a bit of a wait, but I think it helps with the anticipation! Service is great! Overall, great place to go. I would highly recommend traveling out there if you get a chance!
