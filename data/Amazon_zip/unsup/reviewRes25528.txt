This is a great place to just chill and have coffee and dessert at night! It is even nice to just sit at the bar and have a few drinks at night! The only thing that sucks is the service! The waiters either hit on you to get a "Green card" or the waitresses have no clue what is on the dessert menu and spill your water as she is trying to refill it.
