I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet. The pancakes here are phenomenal! I dream of their white chocolate pretzel pancakes. I came here last week and my heart sank when they weren't on the menu (which changes seasonally) - but then when I saw it on the specials I almost cried tears of joy! White chocolate pretzel pancakes may sound odd, and maybe even a little over-the-top, but just try them and you will get what I mean. So this is what you do when you go to Bongo Room with your brunch buddy: 1) You both get savory entrees. They have tons, and they are all delicious, with fresh ingredients.  2) You order one (1) pancake, whichever kind you like (I recommend white chocolate pretzel, of course). Not a FULL order of pancakes, but ONE pancake. Then share it for dessert! The full orders of pancakes are HUGE, but they will make orders of one pancake and this way you don't have to pay for a full order that you would probably not finish, even with a brunch buddy.
