I don't think I will ever go back here.  The space is great and the menu looked amazing. But the servers were a hot mess. And by mess, I mean they actually looked messy. I can appreciate a casual atmosphere, but they all looked sloppy, like they had rolled out of bed. Hard to know who worked there because they didn't have any defining mark, an apron, a t-shirt, nothing. And, I'm sorry, but I don't want to see your hot pink bra. There is such a thing as respect for your patrons. Plus, they were gathered in groups chit chatting quite loudly. Your guests DO NOT want to hear about your personal life. AND one server walked in the front door with slurpees from 7-eleven, and then a few minutes later another employee walked in with bags from McDonalds.... REALLLLLLY????  I worked in the restaurant industry for 12 years... from casual to high end. This was just TOTALLY off-putting and distracting. So if you want to hear more... the red wine was warm... wayyyyyy to warm and we had to ask for it to be chilled a bit. The waiter was very helpful and nice. We came in late afternoon for some wine and a small bite to eat.  We ordered a cheese board. It seemed that one of the cheeses had not been stored properly. We also had the Pizza con salsiccia e rapini. It got delivered to us not cut. The food runner took it back and cut it. But I found the pizza to be dripping with oil. Literally... dripping down my chin after taking a bite. There was so much oil that you couldn't pick a slice of pizza up because the crust was drenched in oil. Needless to say I was SUPER disappointed. I have a million thoughts on why this experience was so bad... but ultimately I think it comes down to lack of attention to detail during a smaller volume time. But that is simply not an excuse. I don't even think this deserves on star... but c'est la vie.
