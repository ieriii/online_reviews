3 or 4 stars depending on your mindset: Pros: Gym...Its pretty good Rooms...Spacious Physical plant: Great lobby with a very nice, old world look Restaurants: 3 or four decent places Cons: Noise: You can hear the street, and I was on the 21st floor Location: I personally like the area around Whitehall and the Drake better Seriously, Chicago is just a great hotel town. In Boston the hotel would easily be in the top four....In this town, you can almost find a hotel, which matches your particular taste...So there may be better places
