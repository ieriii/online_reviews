I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. This place is wonderful. The beer list is great, and the pizza is delish. It's casual and fun, and will be around for a while I'm sure. It's going to be a Chicago classic - I think they brew their own beer and the ovens are this Rhode Island style pizza oven. Check it out.
