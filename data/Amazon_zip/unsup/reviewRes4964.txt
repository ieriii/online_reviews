Can you say over hyped! Terrible service we were asked to give our order all at once, so the waitress can manage the dishes coming out. Instead she put the order in all at once and we received 2 rounds of small plates before our drinks even came out. No apology!  The food is not spectacular or ground breaking,the ubiqitous fried egg you see all chic menu, The pig ears more like pork rinds..., they just try to make it appear that way. Do not order the calamari, not sure what they are trying to do with this dish.  Will not be back.
