This place is an institution amongst the peeps from Rogers Park....even though it's not in Rogers Park. This a weird thing that I have always noticed, I'd say the peeps from Albany Park and even Lincoln Square are pretty indifferent towards it. The place is clean, and the service is decent. Some of the normal complaints you'll hear are gonna be in regards to their lack of (spicy) heat, and the large but very run-of-the-mill tacos, ohh. The beans....I hear a lot of crap about lardy beans, and yeah -but I kinda like them. Anyway, before you guys snub this place...and no, this is not Little Village, or Pilsen...this is more like "The world's greatest and best Pepe's"..... The following things here are very yummy: Skirt steak dinner, combo, or with eggs...truly a perfect cut of well seasoned and TENDER beef, very hard to do with skirt -and no, cutting across the grain like the Food Network tells you is not a cure all. My favorite thing at this place is skirt steak, so nothing cutting edge, but damn it's good. Huevos rancheros, I've heard that these are actually "huevos ahogados", but you know...there are a million variations to this dish. Garcias is my favorite, mainly because it's not just some afterthought green sauce splash on some over easy eggs. Maybe even best in city. Plain ass tostada, just beans, and rice maybe. So good. I remember the flan being "jello packet", but decent. Oh, the chips and salsa!!!! good. In closing, if you're from out of town, like Iowa or Green Bay ...or you're from a place that has a Carlos O'Kelly's. This place might just blow you away. If you're any kind of Mexican/ street ethnic food aficionado...this place may suck.
