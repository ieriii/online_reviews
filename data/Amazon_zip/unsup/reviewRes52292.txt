We arrived at Gino's and there was a short line for dinner. The line instantly got longer the moment we started standing in it. You can buy drinks inside and bring them back out to drink in line. People were being seated fairly quickly, so I don't know why we agreed to sit outside to shorten our wait.  I already knew we needed to try the deep dish cheese and sausage patty. Typically I would never order sausage, but of course I was going to try their specialty. Although one can get so much more value by upping an order to a medium, the two of us stayed with a small. Two slices each was more than enough. We also shared a house salad that arrived what felt like just a minute after ordering. Usually I don't like Italian dressing, but I liked their version. The croutons were also really good. There was some kind of seasoning on it, but I couldn't identify it. We were quoted about 30-45 minute wait on the pizza and it ended up being on the shorter end. I think it had to do with being a small size, rather than a medium. The first piece was super hot and just melted on the plate into a tasty mess. I like the second piece too because it was much cooler and you can clearly see the sausage patty and cheese layers. The menu says the sauce is chunky but I didn't think it was by California standards. The crust was very crisp. Not sure if I fully liked the flavor of the cornmeal, but at least the bottom wasn't soggy. I think we missed quite a bit of atmosphere by sitting outside - no graffittied walls, heavy pizza aroma, and excited buzz. I looked forward to reading some walls when I went in to use the restroom, but they have a policy that leaves all those walls clean. Friendly service.
