It's the closest food for me in my neighborhood, so it isn't much of a secret why I would try it out. What keeps me coming back is the friendly staff and quick service of the food. The menu is widely varied, I am still not sure why there are tacos on it, so there is something for everyone. Even dropping in for a glass of wine at the end of the day somehow fits...in my book that is a tough order for a place that does good breakfast business. You won't find the newest gourmet trends here, but that is part of the charm too I think. All around a great place to eat if you are in the area.
