Art of PIzza used to be a weekly stop for me when I worked down the street. A meal for less than $5 is hard to find, but for a (huge!) slice of stuffed pizza and a pop on the side, I'd walk out of there completely satisfied. If I wasn't trying to keep my girlish figure, I would have probably gone there way more frequently. My favorite is the spinach, green pepper and onion, but I usually chose my slice by pointing to the most fresh-out-of-the-oven-looking pizza (steaming and extra saucy). Everyone that I have brought here has loved the pizza, and unfortunately I have yet to find anything in the 'burbs that is close to comparable.
