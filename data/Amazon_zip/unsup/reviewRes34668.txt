Yes. Yes. YES! It's all you want and at a cheap price! No question. Folks, I love Pita Inn also but if you're looking for a falafel sammy it's honestly just as good as Pita Inn's if not a little better. (Pita Inn win out on variety and their fresh-made pitas.) Seriously, I spend like $4 there. How is that not fantastic for a belly full of delish hummus, pita and falafel?
