Rarely do places live up to the hype. Rick Bayless this and Top Chef masters that. To be honest web it comes down to it they are just making amazing food. I came with my brother and decided we would just order a bunch of things and split everything that way we got to try a variety of dishes. The guacamole was delicious, great texture with a hint of lime. For tortas we got the ahagoda and chapel pepil. If we were looking at just the sandwiches I would have to choose the pepil, but the ahogada is served in a bowl of spicy tomato broth that just takes this dish to a whole new level (my 28 year brother tipped back the bowl and drank it without a spoon so not one bit went to waste). For dessert we got the Aztec hot chocolate which was rich and a bit spicy. Of course we got a churro that was crispy, chewy and oh so cinnamoney. You have to get soft serve to dip the churro in...may I recommend the bacon strusel soft serve. All in all this was a great meal worth the 30-45 minute wait (however the line was twice as long when we left). I would still wait.
