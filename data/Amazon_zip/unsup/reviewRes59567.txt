Very authentic Korean grill style cuisine. I really enjoyed the 20 different complimentary appetizers that came with the meal. There was a great variety of pickled vegetables and seared tofus. We ordered 3 varieties of meats and they were served with a side of lettuce and sauces to wrap them in. VERY DELICIOUS!!The atmosphere could have been better ventilated, It was very smoky and when we left we all smelled like grilled meat. The staff were not so personable but provided good service.
