Anyone living in Chicago has to go to Superdawg at some point. This place has a ton of character and the hot dogs are the standard by which Chicago-dogs should be measured against. There's something incredibly comfortable and quaint about eating in a parked car with a tray attached to you window, complete with all the necessary condiments. The pickled green tomatilo is a nice touch too, and the Superdawg-box container each meal is served in is iconic. This is the perfect place for a casual mid-summer dinner.
