I have not written a negative review about a restaurant until now. The first time my husband and I tried 90 Mile, it was when it opened its Clybourn location. Just coming back from an amazing trip from Puerto Vallarta, where we experienced wonderful Cuban food, we were ecstatic to try 90 Mile when it first opened. The owner was so nice and made sure we enjoyed everything, answering any questions we had. He even knew of the restaurant we ate at in PVR. So, when he opened the second location on Armitage, we had to check it out. Same thing - we enjoyed it, especially since it expanded its offerings to full dinners, with dishes such as braised oxtail and whole red snapper. The last time we were here was over a year ago and we came back last Friday (5/6/11). It was clear that business was booming, as they expanded seating into what used to be the parking lot. However, the quality of service was the first thing we noticed that declined. We ordered two teas, two appetizers and two entrees. We received our teas, but waited at least 30 minutes for the appetizers showed. The table next to us, who arrived after we got there, received both appetizers and entrees before we received our appetizers. The server rarely checked in, and only did to apologize after over 40 minutes. The hostess came over to apologize and said dessert was on the house, which we had no say in the selection. We felt that the quality of the meat was such low grade that there was gritty fat. At that point, we lost interest in finishing the meal and just wanted to leave. With many good restaurants such as Belly Shack nearby and XOCO in River North, the price we paid for this meal was not reflective of the product. Needless to say, we won't be returning. It is unfortunate because I really like this place.
