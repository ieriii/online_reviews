I used to be pretty 'meh' on this place, but they've turned it around with their new menu items and their always yummy, outstanding, mind-blowing and guilt-filled shakes! This go-round I ordered the radical reuben w/ mac & cheeze, and a good ole cookie peanut butter shake to top it all off! And then I walked 6 miles... The reuben was gooey, 'meaty', and the it all just sort of sinfully melted in your mouth. My only complaint is that the sandwich needs to be bigger! I need more reub as the mac and cheeze was just okay. A bit luke warm and not as flavorful as the awesome fake cheese (daiya?) on the reuben. I'm glad this place is actually producing tasty food for a change. I was getting too used to their dry, mealy breakfasts, but lunch/dinner is where it's @! Next time I'm hoping to try the half-pipe and nachos. Bring on the pounders!
