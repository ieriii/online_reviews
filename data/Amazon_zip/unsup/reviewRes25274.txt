WOW! This was fabulous and delicious! The cuisine was infused with full, fresh, ethnic flavors! I recommend it on a trip to Chicago or to the local crowd. I enjoyed the Country Greek Salad, White bean and Tomato Soup, Grape Leaves, and traditional Greek coffee and cookies. I was with a group of friends, so it was nice to be able to sample a variety of selections!
