Came here on my birthday with my parents and my boyfriend and the dinner was really, really good. The cocktails were also incredible. The crowd was generally very snobby and serious- my table sang happy birthday to me and someone at the bar uttered a sarcastic "congratulations..." whatever, the restaurant can't choose who comes in the door. The restaurant CAN choose, who they hire, however.  This is a WARNING about Longman and Eagle- after paying for my birthday dinner my dad's credit card info was stolen and used for several days until the bank caught on. I don't want a good restaurant to have to pay for one ass hole employee- so if you go, keep this in mind- If I go back, I will certainly pay with cash. Come on guys...you don't get enough tips on a Saturday night with a 3 hour wait list?
