My husband and I went to eat at Frontera Grill with my brother-in-law and his girlfriend last weekend while we were in town visiting. My brother-in-law picked the restaurant because it was where he and his girlfriend had their first date (and he ended up proposing to her that night!). The wait was almost unbearable. We showed up around 5pm and waited until about 7:30pm for a table. I cannot imagine waiting any longer than that, but of course, there were people who did. The thing my brother-in-law didn't know was that they now take reservations. Definitely suggest that if you can do that ahead of time. My husband had one of their Blue Agave Margarita's and he said it was delicious but strong. He was a little bit buzzed since we had a round of drinks while waiting for our table on empty stomachs. When we were finally seated, the table ordered chips and guacamole for appetizer. I am not a fan of guacamole in general but this one was very smooth and tasteful. When it came time to order, both my husband and I were salivating over the carne asada. It was absolutely wonderful. A pretty large portion for me so I ended up taking about half of it home! My husband ate his whole plate. Yum yum yum!
