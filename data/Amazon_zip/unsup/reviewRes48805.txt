I was not very impressed on my second visit to the Publican. This time around I felt that the level of service was mediocre . The food was excellent, it was a selection and the ingredients from local farmers are superb. We started off the meal with the spicy pork rinds. Not as great as I last remember them. But the time previous, they were warm and still popping as I bit into them. Hard to match that experience.We had the scallops with fava beans, which were delicious. The striped bass was good, not my favorite of the night but it wasn't terrible either. It had a mineral taste to it in which I was not a fan. The sweetbreads were hands down my favorite. They were prepared different from the last time ( I went in the summer as compared to early spring) but the combination of flavors this time with the pesto was amazing! They were unfortunately out of the shaved brussel sprouts but we opted for the beet salad instead and it was a wise choice. The beets were served in a yogurt dressing with basil and it was so refreshing and delicious. We ended the meal with the half of farm house chicken which was delicious but we were already full from the rest of our meal. But unfortunately, food cannot stand on its own when the service was lacking.The food took forever to get out. And when it did, it all came at once. Also, the minute we had told our server that we were not having any beer/beverages solely water, our service went from a 5 to a 3 immediately. Hey, sorry dude that we weren't ordering rounds of beer but it's not like we ordered salads and pork rinds and tons of extra bread and then only give you a 10% tip. And in regards to the service, I have been to the just or even more busy restaurant called "Girl & Goat" who serves similar food and the service blew the Publican out of the water. Publican, you are like the nice guy that you date for a few months and suddenly becomes a douche. I think I'll take my business elsewhere next time.
