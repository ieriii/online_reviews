If is wasn't for my #1 place SOLGA... this would be my #1. Oh well... I guess it's my #2 place. Now, you I don't like comparing one restaurant to another.. and giving it lower marks simply because I'm comparing. In other words.. its like comparing Taco Bell to Chipotle to Su Casa... these are all good restaurants, however there is NO COMPARISON to ONE ANOTHER! This place ROCKS. First of all... the Korean BBQ is cooked with charcoal (my fav). It reminds me of a 70's Korean Dive Bar I used to go in Los Angeles. The waitress actually spoke PERFECT english and the menu was very big. I think I would bring a friend that was not 100% used to korean food. This way, we could order several things and he/she can try it out. However, next time I would skip the soon tofu. (best place in schaumburg). Stick with the specialty.... BBQ. The place is not very expensive... I like the atmosphere.... and once again... the Food ROCKED.
