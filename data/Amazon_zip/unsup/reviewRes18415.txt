XOCO, love of my life. Bless Rick Bayless for opening a Mexican eatery that's a middle ground between Frontera Grill and $1 carne asada tacos from Maxwell Street Market. I can't believe there are 1200 reviews of this place, and I can't believe I haven't written one up yet, seeing as how I live down the street and eat here about 2x/month. I love the caldos and the tortas, ESPECIALLY the Cubana. With a salad, this can be made into two meals. Admittedly, I've rarely achieved letting the second half of a torta make it into my refrigerator. I wish they would deliver or let me at least call-in orders, but alas, I'm resigned to continue waiting my 15 minutes in house for take-out. It's not all bad though. At least I get to savor my hot chocolate during those moments. I'm currently on a big Aztec kick to combat the onslaught of winter doldrums, though prior to this I was an Almendrado girl all the way. And no, these are not your average hot chocolates, though that's exactly why you get them: to experience hot cocoa from an authentically rich and flavorful place that's the complete antithesis of your packets of Swiss Miss. PSA: They chucked the Thursday mole poblano special in favor of an al pastor torta that my boyfriend was not as fond of. Also, while I will eagerly devour the chocolate hazelnut cookie, I stopped buying it because it's pretty overpriced at $2.50 and I can find awesome cookies at Fox and Obel down the street for less. Other than that, I think anything on the menu is a pretty safe bet. So go and take your friends.
