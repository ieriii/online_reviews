In my last several trips to Chicago, the popular and most delicious places I've been are proving to follow a trend: shared dishes. Unfortunately, I don't think Davanti did this too well. Maybe because of our specific service that we received, but it didn't feel so sharable. It's extremely cute in here. The ambience is perfect and the lighting is not too dark and not too bright. It was very busy on a Tuesday night so our waiter wasn't as available, but I think this was only a problem because the company I was with was very hungry. And antsy. Boys... Sigh. Extensive wine menu. Mind you, they consider their restaurant to be a wine STORE as well so they do charge a corkage fee. I think it's fair if they consider themselves an actual wine store and the wine bottles are priced as they would be in a decent wine store. But yet again, their concept is a bit too mixed. Are you a store or a restaurant? The foccacia is as good as everyone else says. It's crisp, flat, and has a really mild and creamy cheese that doesn't overpower it. Is got a nice chewy texture that reminds me of slightly under baked bread. Worth $15? Not sure. But I loved it anyway. Haha I ordered the squash salad with hazelnuts and other goodies. Can I tell you? Best warm salad ever. Not sure if there were enough greens to be considered a salad. But I don't care. Warm, rich, and wonderful textures from the hazelnuts. Squash was yummy.  Boyfriend had the risotto which actually reminded me of Korean jook or Chinese congee. But it was nice and clean and soft and he absolutely loved it. Service was ok. Our waiter was really busy. Oh! I had the infused vodka. It's infused with cantaloupe and oregano and they serve it wit a little lime and moscato. It slightly tasted like a vodka tonic, but better. It's really well made and you should definitely try it. Yum. Davanti, you have changed my mind about Italian food :) thank you.
