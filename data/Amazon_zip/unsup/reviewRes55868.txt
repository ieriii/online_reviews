For the past year I have lived and worked within walking distance of this restaurant, so I was a bit surprised that I had overlooked it in my first 9 or so months of eating out more or less every night. Granted, there are plenty of good options in the area ranging from the Rick Bayless restaurants to the Purple Pig, but that's still no excuse.The surprise was a pleasant one given that while the restaurant was not busy, the food was great! It got off to a good start with the complimentary bread and dipping sauce and was followed up with well-spice renditions of the classic dishes that I have at a million other Indian restaurants for better or worse. For a first visit, I tend to go for safer options - chicken korma, saag paneer are good candidates. If those are done well, then a follow-up visit can go more exotic.All in all, I was quite pleased with the flavors, the portions, and the service. I can't speak to true authenticity, but I can say I was quite content with my meal!
