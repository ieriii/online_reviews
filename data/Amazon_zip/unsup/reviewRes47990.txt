I have only been here for brunch and both times, it was a solid experience, but not perfect. 3.5 stars for the food/menu would be more accurate, but for service and ambiance, I'll bump up to 4. The menu changed a lot between my visits, which were only a week apart, but the menu on my more recent visit was much better. There weren't a lot of breakfast/egg options my first time there (no waffles or pancakes, only one egg dish) but the second time, there were multiple egg options and waffles. Yay. Both meals I had were good -- I had a baked eggs dish the first visit, with Swiss chard, Parmesan and tessa, which is similar to prosciutto. Rich, but delicious. My friend got the chorizo flatbread and was disappointed by the almost non-existent chorizo. It was mostly bread. On the 2nd visit, I got the corn and Shishito pepper hash, with sausage. This was good, great flavors, but I was hoping for a lot more corn and peppers! It was pretty sparse in terms of the veggies. My friend's pork belly bimibop (sp?) with kimchi, on the other hand, was huge and out-of-this-world. Also tried the bacon -- which is thick cut and very fatty -- and a sticky bun, which was heavenly. It's a nice, airy, light-filled space and even when it's crowded, the acoustics are fine for conversation. On my second visit, we were seated close to the end of service (1:40pm) and we could tell the staff was itching to reset for dinner and/or leave. They were polite but obviously wanting to move us along quickly, clearing things pretty aggressively, dropping the check without us asking for it. But I've been a server, so I get it....just wish they had been a tad more subtle about it.
