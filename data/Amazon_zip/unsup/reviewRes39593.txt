Second time I've been to a Korean BBQ, but this was the first time cooking over charcoal. It's definitely smoky and started to bother my eyes a bit by the end of the meal, buy my peepers are pretty sensitive, so I won't count it against them. I went with two other ladies and think this is definitely a group joint. Sharing the the main thing. We got to sit at one of the tables along the edge of the restaurant where you have to take off your shoes and essentially sit on the floor level. I really liked this since it made it seem different and fun. The we got short ribs and bulgogi and I liked them both. I gotta say I enjoyed the quality of the meat at Cho Sun Ok a little more, but I really liked the flavor of the charcoal over the hot stone pots they use at Cho Sun Ok. Service was fine, nothing spectacular, but we weren't ignored or anything. The food was good and we did get more little sides than I remember getting at Cho Sun Ok, so that was really fun, trying the different things. If I have a friend who wants to head for Korean BBQ with a group, I won't hesitate in recommending San Soo Gab San. Delicious!
