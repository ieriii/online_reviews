Being a homebrewer and beer enthusiast, I decided to check out some local brewpubs to try out some locally brewed beers on tap. Piece was first on the list, in front of Goose Island Clybourn and Rock Bottom. This place definitely gets first place out of those three brewpubs. My girldfriend and I were there on a friday afternoon and easily found a table to sit at. I ordered the Big Black Mariah and a sample of Dysfuntionale and my girlfriend ordered the Golden Wonder(I think that's what it was called). The beers were very affordable and both of us enjoyed the beers. I would give a 5 star rating just based on the beer and the service, but that wouldn't be fair. I'll start off with a 4 star, and then I will edit the rating once I try their pizza..
