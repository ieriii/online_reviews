This was barely a three star. The only redeeming quality was the comfy bed. I got the historic tower aka old. It was terrible. I couldn't even look out the window because it was a little square window over my head. It was more like a prison window. You also have to pay for the gym which is cool but they should tell you ahead if time so you don't need to go up and down the elevator to gain access. Very disappointed.
