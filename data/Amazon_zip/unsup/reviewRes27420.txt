Normally, I'm not a high priced "pretentious food diner". But I am the type of person that thinks the experience is worth it. The space is cozy, nothing too crazy, and the food was really good. The wine list was SO PRICY. I think the cheapest class of wine was $16.00. I was here on a work dinner, otherwise I would never be able to afford to eat here. Our waiter brought out the truffled popcorn which was delicious. We had a crazy bottle of wine in which only 90 bottle were produced a year or something, and of course, it was the best wine I ever had.  We had the tasting menu which consisted of Caesar Salad, Squash Soup, Short Ribs, Scallops (we also added the chicken) and the Smore's dessert. It was really good, but everything was served at room temperature. Is that normal? Because I really don't know. Regardless, dining here is simply for pleasure, hopefully you don't have to pay for it yourself, and it does make for a cool experience.
