The Good: -The absolute BEST deep dish pizza I have EVER had! -Great service (waiters/waitresses are fun and friendly) -Recommended by more Chicagoans I know than any other place when asked where to go for the BEST pizza The Bad: -None The Ugly: -Friend told me he had food poisoning from them once, to give you an idea of how good the pizza is, he still goes there regularly!
