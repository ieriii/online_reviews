Our son and his bride chose Mercat a la Planxa for their rehearsal dinner on 8/20/2009 and it was fantastic! Service was superb - attentive but not intrusive and the food delicious; we had a private room overlooking the restaurant. Our wedding guests were all staying at The Blackstone so frequented Mercat and were also very pleased as it was a natural for all to meet in the bar or the restaurant. Simply excellent!
