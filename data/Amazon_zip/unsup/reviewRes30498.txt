After hearing rave reviews about Frontera Grill from my friends, I attempted to make a reservation for an early dinner on a Wednesday...after being on hold for at least 5 minutes, the hostess was extremely rude and told me that there were no open reservations and we would have to wait. Before I finished asking my next question she had already hung up on me, great first impression.
