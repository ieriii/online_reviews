We have taken friends and family to this wonderful restaurant because their food is consistently delicious!. My favorite is the salmon grilled kabob and dill rice. I'm not sure how they marinate it but its amazing. The Aash soup is healthy and incredible with spinach, cilantro, turnips, oats, lentils, beans, chick peas & noodles, with caramelized onions on top. The shrimp or veggie curry is one of our favorites. And the staff is always friendly and sweet.
