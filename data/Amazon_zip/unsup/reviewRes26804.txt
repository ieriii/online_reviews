This is what I wish somebody had told me about Graham Eliot: "This experience will not be like eating a typical meal. It's not about being hungry and (thus correspondingly) sitting down to refill yourself. Rather, it is about tasting the most exquisite and unusual creations you will ever have sampled (that also just happen to fill you up like a meal)." I came here and did the 15 course tasting meal. It was, at no point, "a lot of food." It was a lot of tastes. Criticizing any part of it feels like criticizing world-class acrobats. I am so far away from being able to do any of this, it might as well be sorcery. Some of the courses (lobster, crab, cheese) were incredibly tasty, and I would have glady eaten 15 courses of just that. Other courses were strange and gross (foamy oyster mousse, for example). Many were somewhere in between. But each was a novel, interesting creation. Nothing was (the most Cardinal sin) boring.  The experience is a culinary magic show. As magic shows go, it is definitely worth the price. (And also, the crazy hipster bartenders/waitstaff are fun! Peep their awesome Graham Elliot belt buckles!)
