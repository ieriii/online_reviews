Feb. 14 2009 Menu options: Aphrodisiac - $250 Chef's     - $200 I took my boyfriend there for Valentine's Day and needless to say, reservations were literally impossible to find. Picked the last time available (10:30pm). We were there until 1:30am. We both had the Chef's collection and share the 3oz. Kobe beef fillet. On the whole, the food and service were spectacular. However, the waiter seemed a bit "cocky".... and BF had a slight problem with it. I didn't really mind..... E.g. If it's your first time in an upscale French restaurant, you barely understand French, and you rarely eat liver, you probably won't know what foie gras is. And when we asked, we got almost a slightly sarcastic answer... 1 star off! I would love to go back for the food, but racking up a $700 check for 2 is not exactly what I had in mind. On the website, the two tours are priced around $140-$100.... but because it was Valentine's day, they were marked up an extra $100!!! I feel cheated out of my hard earned money!! Another star off!!! Flowers and confectionery are marked up during Valentine's Day... but this was a total rip-off!!!
