This was such a welcome addition to Broadway, but oh, my! Not so much anymore. The waitress was wonderful. She gets the star. The seafood chowder was good. The Fish & Chi[ps were so so, with the "chips" cold, overcooked and greasy. The blackened chicken sandwich was cold, the toast was blackened, literally burned and tasted like charcoal. The side of mashed potatoes was cold. I asked for butter and the potatoes were so cold the butter wouldn't melt. As for dessert... took forever to get the two bowls of ice-cream... they were so melted when they got to the table they were like milk. She took them back. You've got a beautiful room, with too-loud music and food that does not justify the high prices. Never again.
