I've dined here several times now and after trying nearly every item of their winter 2010 menu, I'm still impressed with the quality of the food and the level of service from this excellent restaurant. I tend to be picky about italian food and prefer the authentic flavors of real Italian vs. Italian/American and this place does a good job of preserving the flavors of the old country.
