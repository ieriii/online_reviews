The first thing that struck me about Hot Doug's is that it is an incredible business model. Have your clientele wait in anticipation, poring over your menu, for hours before they get to the counter, and I guarantee they'll order 4 times what they'd intended. This was the first stop on my summer project with my fiance, the Great Summer Sandwich Adventure. Hot dogs and hamburgers, we have arbitrarily decided, count as sandwiches, but burritos don't. We feel like we've already discovered many excellent taquerias, and do not require structure to further this quest. Hot Doug's has always abstractly been on our list of Things To Do Before Leaving Chicago, but we ended up actually going because we had family in town who were interested. On a rainy Saturday morning, the line was an hour and a half to two hours long. By the time we got to the front, we were veterans. The people behind us, hoping for a tasty, greasy hangover cure, found the wait too uncomfortable, and the guys in front of us just plain got bored. We ended up ordering the fois gras dog (of course), the smoked crayfish and pork and the classic Chicago dog, supplemented by an order of duck fat fries. Everything was completely delicious. Honestly, you should absolutely get the Chicago dog, even if it looks boring, because it's a sublime combination of flavors and textures. You should also order two orders of fries - the regular and the duck fat - just to contrast flavors. In the end, I probably won't go back to Hot Doug's unless someone else really wants to - it's a little out of the way, and a pretty major time commitment even on weekdays - but I'm hugely glad we went, and that we did it right. This is a Great Summer Sandwich Adventure victory - legendary, inexpensive meat wedged between pieces of bread.
