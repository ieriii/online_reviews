Ooof. This is place will make your afternoon. It's famous for its exotic tube steak and duck fries, but I've never been blown away by that stuff. Most of their specials have some kind of fine cheese and fancy mayo, not a great treatment for sausage in my opinion. I think you're better off sticking with the classic Chicago dog. They do it better than anyone. Charred and deep fried is the way to go. Of course, the line is an ordeal, especially since they showed this place on Bourdain. Stick with it. Typically they close the line down at 4, but stay open until everyone who was in line at 4 gets served -- disregard the Chads and Brosefs who might try to get you to leave the line by telling you otherwise. Oh, and if you're lucky enough to see the elusive Frankenwurst on special, you best man up... to whale cancer. F'yeah.
