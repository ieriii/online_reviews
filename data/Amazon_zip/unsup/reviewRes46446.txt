This gets five stars because in the dozens of times I've been with friends and family they have yet to mess up one order, I have yet to hear anyone say, I didn't like that, that wasn't cooked right, etc. Everything is always prepared with the consumer in mind, no high and mighty items floating around in their fridges that people don't plan to consume. HEY THAT IS HOW YOU SHOULD ALL RUN YOUR RESTAURANTS. THank you Grand Lux, and hang in there.
