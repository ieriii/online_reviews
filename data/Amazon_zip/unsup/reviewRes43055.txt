I write this review now that I finally received the pizza (lukewarm) I ordered over 2 hours ago. Called after an hour and a half, and the staff assured us that the pizza was on it's way and they had just left to deliver it. Unfortunately after waiting another 45 minutes we called again to complain and the staff laughed at our complaint! I find their lack of customer service appalling. I have raved about Fogo 2 Go to my friends and family, and ordered pizza and appetizers from here several times. I will not be ordering from here again.
