Apart from the man who tried to start a fight with my husband because he had accidently bumped our daughter stroller against his foot everything was fine! Obviously that's not the restaurant's fault and his friends told him to stop being a jerk. Anyway - back to Wishbone. The wait is incredibly long for brunch but the food is good. I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids though it was just too much hassle. The food was good though. I can't wait until my kids are older and I can do things again! I won't mark it bad for kids because it probably would be fine another time, but not for brunch
