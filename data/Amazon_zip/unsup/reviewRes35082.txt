My wife and I went during the week. It is a small space and seems to do a brisk take-out and delivery business. The menu is small and specialized. The sushi was good, but not memorable especially considering the price. It was pretty much forgettable except for the Thai stick which suffered from what other rolls seemed to suffer from - too many ingredients. Several rolls might as well have been called "The Kitchen Sink". The sushi craze is all well and good but when you have 8 or 9 ingredients in addition to some fish, you've got too much going on. What you have at Sushi X is mediocre food at an inflated price.
