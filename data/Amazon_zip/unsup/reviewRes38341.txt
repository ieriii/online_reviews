I'll start by stating that I loved my cheese browned under the broiler. That's probably my favorite part of the pizza. With Chicago style pizza, that's not possible. So take my review from a cheese on top of the pizza lover. The pizza arrived an hour and 45 minutes after ordering & being told it would be here in an hour. It was tasty and hot. Just not the best I've ever had. They took $5 off of our bill for the delay, which I thought was nice.
