A 2 star review seems a little harsh because apparently the bar and rooftop are awesome in the summer (the place is well decorated and is the kind of bar that probably scores you points if you take a date or you would go to if you want to meet some decently classy). But I'm here to talk about dinner. Meh. I've been to Zed, Brazzaz and Fogo de Chao. If you want a brazilian steakhouse, its a really easy decision. Just go to Fogo. The only piece of meat I really liked was the rump roast, but one cut is not passing for a $44 meal. The "Harvest Tables" are really just not great - most of the charcuterie and cheese is average and the salads are all pretty limp and too oily. The wine list was ok and a bit overpriced in my opinion. It was a tuesday and I was at a business dinner. That was fine, but the restaurant had 4 first dates (yea, really, it was that obvious) and all of them clearly went poorly. Avoid this place for a dinner date. The bar however seemed like a good meet-for-drinks place.
