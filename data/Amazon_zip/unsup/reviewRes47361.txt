1/2 price burgers on tuesdays are what got me to go here. but, i will say that i will gladly pay full price for one of lockdown's burgers...but when it's a tuesday, and you've got a hankering for a good cheap burger, head to lockdown. oh and the upgrade to mac&cheese instead of fries. yeah, do it. worth it. worth every calorie. i have yet to come on thursday for 1/2 price build your own mac.
