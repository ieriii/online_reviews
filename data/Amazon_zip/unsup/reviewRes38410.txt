dearest hopleaf, we have such blessed memories don't we? i was deeply committed to your deep fried smelt, a buttery and crunchy midwestern entree that went so well with any beverage/beer that you provided. shortly, after the smelt had disappeared, i regretfully moved on to your mussels and pomme frites. i learned that this was my only alternative, that this was as pleasurable and succulent mussels could be without going to the east coast. your broths were clean, rich, and used delicious ingredients. i understand your charm, your magnetism--- despite your stupid-ass long lines. yes your ambiance has a warm comfy wooden atmosphere, but not all of your food is as on-point as the mussels. your crowd can get frustrating as it is a bit bourgeois and white for my taste. now, i could forgo that blemish (as per usual, being in northside chicago) if your service was consistently polite, attentive, and accessible. however, in that department you are hit or miss. either i have had the most diligent service in my life or someone rude and frigidly inhuman. i would suggest that you work on this. in closing, 3.5 stars.
