I would have to give this place the ultimate sum up by calling Sultans Market the mom and pop version of Pita Inn. I can't say the menu selection was big , but it got the job done. The falafel was good , the curry rice was good , the meat combo , which had lamb shwarma (good) , Kifta kabob (pretty good) , great hummos , and chicken shwerma (very good). I didn't dig the cucumber salad , don't like cucumbers , not their fault. The lentils and rice was very good. The prices here were really good , and the service fast , although it was counter service , no waiters. Good for the area , I've had better though no major complaints other than the size of the dining room, very small.
