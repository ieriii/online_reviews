Sunday morning. I wake up, craving waffles and pancakes. After an extensive search of the pantry, I realize I have nothing to sate my desire. We end up at Yolk on a whim. The first thing that I notice is that this place has damn near anything you could want for breakfast or brunch. Eggs, pancakes, waffles, skillets...you name it, they've got some form of it. From quickly peeking around, it all looked really good and I'd definitely order a variety of things over some future visits. I had the blackberry and banana pancakes, my dining partner the stuffed French toast, and we split an order of sausage links. The pancakes were three massive slabs of pancake covered in berries and sliced bananas, and damn were they good. They were fluffy, of a light flavor, and paired with the fruit perfectly. The stuffed French toast was a little heavy on the cream cheese, but good nevertheless. The raspberry sauce that came with the French toast was very good. Lastly, the sausage links were fantastic. The atmosphere of Yolk is pretty chill, mixed with tourists, university students, and locals. The staff is friendly, efficient, and good at their job. Without a question, we're going there again. And you should too.
