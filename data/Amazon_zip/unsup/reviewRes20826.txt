Whenever I would come to the Gage with my girlfriend, the waiters would politely ignore us feeling each other up under the table, even long after we'd finished our food. But then I sat at the bar by myself, and the bartender ignored me, and I wasn't feeling myself up under the counter; so now I wonder if the waiters are just too busy to be bothered. Hmm. Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA on tap was a treat, and my rabbit salad today was very good; but paying $12 for pureed Brussels sprouts made me feel silly.
