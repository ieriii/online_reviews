I met one of the Purple Pig chefs at a benefit right when the restaurant opened a few years ago. I would have given the Purple Pig 5 stars right there because the chef was smart and friendly, and the food was terrific at the benefit. Unfortunately, when I went to the restaurant, although the food was still great, the ambiance (too loud and too windy) and the staff (what's with the pissed-off attitude?) left a bad taste in my mouth. I'll wait to eat at the Purple Pig the next time I see them at a benefit.
