No reservations means long waits. Is it worth it? Yes. My dear friend took me here for my birthday and we did not wait very long at around 1:30 PM on a Friday. We were seated at a two person table and were grateful we did not have to sit at the communal tables. The chairs were scary high and we are both small, plus we wanted to talk. The blond waitress came over and looked completely distracted. She did not seem to be focusing on us until we asked her for a recommendation for a glass of wine and she was completely professional in her response. She listened to our tastes and brought us over an amazing Greek red. We had 3 small dishes and they were wonderful. The beets and the sweet potatoes were memorable. Then we had an Illy espresso. By far, ask any Italian, the best espresso coffee...100% arabica and the exact right miscela. We ordered the Italian cookies which were perfect. We gave the rest of them to our neighboring table. It was such a delightful meal that I tried to go back 3 more times but could not do the wait. Maybe try going at off hours.
