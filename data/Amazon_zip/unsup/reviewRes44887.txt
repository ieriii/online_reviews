The Deep Dish Pizza rocked!!! It was probably worth the long wait that came along with it. My boyfriend and I didn't have a problem waiting however once we were seated we saw that half the restaurant wasn't even full, so why that long of a wait?? We pre-ordered at the bar but once we were seated our waitress couldn't find our order, and she kept coming to us with other people's orders. We decided to order coke to go with the pizza, and it finally made it to the table at our last bite. For me customer service is important, even if the pizza was so yummy, they lost me with the customer service. I just hope that other locations aren't so slow with their service.
