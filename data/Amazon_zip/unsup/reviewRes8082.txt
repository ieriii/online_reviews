Here's the deal on Fogo: Everything is great, but I can think of like, 12 better ways to spend the money. You go in and they start you with their salad bar. This ain't no Ruby Tuesday ordeal, folks. It's hard core. I knew what half of the possible items were. For real. At one point, I think I encountered brains... Regardless, the salad was great. Then, immediately after that last bite of salad, the meat barrage begins! The second you flip that little disc over, your life is forever changed. I thought it would take about 30 minutes before I began to forget what kind of meat I was eating but it was more like 30 seconds. I didn't know if I was sticking lamb inside of me or cow. All animals became one in that place. One inside of my stomach, that is. The garnishes and side dishes they provide are essential because after your first pound of meat, you start feeling like death. Fried bananas, seasoned mashed potatoes, and some Brazilian cornbread stick-things provide hope in the face of a possible self-inflicted homicide by meat. All were top notch. Bottom-line: This place gave me the biggest case of the 'meat sweats'. Seriously.
