If you want authentic and don't mind healthcode violations, Nuevo Leon is the joint for you! You might need a strong constitution because this stuff is authentic and good stuff. Even the darn menudo is good here! We love coming to this BYOB place for lunch. Atmosphere is a little ghetto but hey, it's Pilsen. It's even worth coming here at night even if there was a shooting only 2 blocks away a couple of days ago. Their bistec is mmmm mmm yummmy, so is the carne asada and every type of taco. Good thing it ain't in LP or I'd be fat. The prices are very reasonable too!
