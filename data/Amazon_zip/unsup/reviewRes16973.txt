After reading the menu, had high hopes. I like mango and I like mushroom, and they had a dish with both and being adventurous I wanted to get it. However it had cream in it and I eat vegan so that's out. My next choice was the soya meat, but they didn't have that in stock. I ended up with a standby of aloo palak. It was bland and I think creamy too. Not very satisfying. I got a nonalcoholic drink, it was good, but expensive. I'd think the expense in drinks would come from alcohol, and not the process of mixing, but what do I know. The potato/cashew/almond fritters were good, kinda like hush puppies. The layout is weird here. If you're picky about tables at restaurants you may have trouble. Service is ok.
