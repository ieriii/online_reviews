A great whiskey selection, and the hard-working staff really put a lot of sweat into the cocktails (I mean that in the good way, not in the bodily-fluids-in-your-drink-way). The Thursday night crowd was a bit loud, but I enjoyed stopping by again during the early afternoon when the crowds were lighter.
