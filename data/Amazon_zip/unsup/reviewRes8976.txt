I'm not one for this kind of food. I'm not sure why i was putting this off, considering I wasn't paying for it! (LOL) I was totally surprised when we went into the restaurant - I was expecting a dive, instead, beautifully-decorated decor - the waitstaff very friendly and attentive and the food - totally delicious!
