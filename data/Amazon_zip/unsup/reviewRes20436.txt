Amazing. I love everything about this gem. From the self serve still/bubble water station to the LEED certified building to the great counter staff to the incredible food. I always order the woodland mushroom torta and vegetable caldos. My partner and I split the two items and it is always just enough and then some. The red sauce that comes with the torta is a flavor explosion. I could drink a bottle of it. And the veg and black bean caldos is one of the best things I have ever EVER eaten. Such perfectly layered, clean flavors.  If we are feeling a little extra sassy we will order chips and guacamole, which never let us down. The crisp of the chips is perfect and they are always salted just right. The frontera guacamole is marvelous.  Other musts are the bean-to-cup chocolates, churros, and agua frescas.  One of my favorites.
