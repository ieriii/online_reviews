Ambience 5 starsService 5 starsfood 5 starsI made a reservation on open table. I got a phone call from Mastros the day before to confirm the reservation. I received a follow up call the day after our dining experience. Great job by the entire staff!Piano bar on the 1st floor was very elegant. I felt as if I needed a white jacket and was going to star in my own black and white film. Very classy, but you can wear a nice dress shirt with jeans and women can wear a casual dress. Was seated upstairs and the mood continue to awe. I received several compliments on the restaurant selection. Thanks Mastros ;)Our waitress was super friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there. Presentation on the appetizers were great. We had the seared ahi tuna and crab cakes. Our party of 6 did not have a single complaint! Plates were sizzling hot and once the corn was placed on the plate it began to sizzle! Wow. New york pepper steak, great, filet for the girlfriend, awesome. Baked potato, corn, and asparagus were good companions for my meal. Dessert was very good.Food is pricey but worth it for every aspect. From phone calls, to the welcoming mood, to the ambiance, taste of food, and overall experience! Thinking about it puts a smile on my face!
