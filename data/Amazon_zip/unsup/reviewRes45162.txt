I've had mixed experiences here, and it often happens because my husband's or friend's entree ends up looking way better than mine! Some of the pasta dishes are so light on sauce and salt that it's underwhelming, while others are home runs. I tend toward anything with mushrooms, and for whatever reason those are the lackluster experiences. Go with what's seasonal and what your server recommends. A bit pricy, but a really nice neighborhood place.
