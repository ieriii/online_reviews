This hotel is kinda hidden so we had a difficult time looking for it, but it is close to everything. Walking distance to Magnificent Mile and Millennium Park. The room is very modern and a decent size. Yay! Flat screen TV! However, the bathroom is terrible. I'm not complaining about the size, but the design is so stupid. Geez, can a girl get some counter space? While we're at it, can my boyfriend and I get some toilet paper without pulling a muscle? The toilet is right next to the shower so the holder was attached to the tiny corner between the two so you can't reach it. We ended up just putting the toilet paper roll on the floor.  I was also excited about a fridge listed as an amenity, but I opened the cabinet to find it empty. Sucked they didn't have free wifi either! I'll probably try a different hotel the next time I'm in Chi-Town.
