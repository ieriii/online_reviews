The Bongo Room is pretty tasty, but for me nothing warrants an hour-long wait in the morning. I need my coffee! Still, like the other reviewers, I find the food to be pretty tasty when I can stop by at an off-peak time. My usual brunch buddy and I made time to check out the Bongo Room on a weekday which was both a blessing and curse. A blessing because we didn't have the killer wait that comes with weekends; a curse because our server really didn't have his game face on. Service was pretty spotty, and like another reviewer we had our cheque dropped off soon after we'd started eating- why shove us out the door when there are no others waiting? The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. Take my opinion with a grain of salt though, as I'm not the type to get the chocolate french toast tower. BB and I both stayed on the savoury side and left satiated, but not chomping at the bit to come back.
