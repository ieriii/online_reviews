Very pretty decor, professional and efficient service, great cozy bar downstairs. Food is delicious- every bite. Chef Garces is gaining popularity for good reason. Try the short rib flat bread, it was yummy! However, I cannot overlook how TINY the portions are. Ti-neeee! I know, tapas are not supposed to resemble gyro plates or super-sized value meals, but these portions were extra tiny! I've eaten at 5 or 6 other tapas places, and I felt that this one served the smallest portions at the highest prices. I also felt that the cocktails were weak, which did not help the cause. Sorry, kids, I'll likely skip it the next time.
