My husband loves place. Not me.  He keeps trying to make me "give it another chance." After five times, I can say with confidence, I don't like it. Not one bit. The hot dogs are really thick. I prefer the thin ones at Gene and Judes. It is a cute,kitschy place with the boy and girl hot dogs on the roof but this is where the appeal ends for me.
