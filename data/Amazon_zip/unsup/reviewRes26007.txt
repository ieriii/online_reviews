food: 4 of 5 value: 1.5 of 5 decor/ambience: 4 of 5 quick review: a forgettable dining experience. food was good - however you do not get what you pay for. for example butternut squash which were about 1.5 square inch was ~$4. we ordered the following: butternut squash (good), bacon wrapped dates (very good), short rib and scallop (very good), and shrimp/scallop balls (play on their meatballs - ok).
