I love how sleek this place is--the wait is not bothersome. It's all about the scene--glamorous, secretive, sexy The drinks are too good, and the catchet of it all is appealing--a mix of country club, mafioso, and lounge. I had a riviera which involve a frothed egg white, and I felt it was prepared so well.
