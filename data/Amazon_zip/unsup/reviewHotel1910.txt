The W has an ultra-modern, swanky vibe and is not the kind of hotel I would typically stay in, but it is right around the corner from the site of our wedding (the Rookery building), so we recommended it to all of our out-of-town guests and stayed there ourselves the weekend of the wedding. Overall our experience there was a positive one. The people I dealt with to reserve our room block were nice, and the suite we stayed in was large and clean. They also get a bonus star for the tray of chocolate-covered strawberries that we found in our room.
