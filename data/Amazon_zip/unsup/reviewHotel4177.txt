Stayed here for a convention over Valentine's weekend. I was chaperoning a group of 40 students and I was anticipating a hassel at check in, but it went pretty smoothly. No free internet anywhere in the place, but the rooms were comfortable and everything seemed new. I noticed a charge to my credit card for around $13 that I didn't make (I think for internet service) and I was on hold for 10 minutes with accounting before I hung up. Services for the conference were excellent, but not the best customer service-wise for guests. Too much bleach on the towels too, I thought I was going to faint from the smell
