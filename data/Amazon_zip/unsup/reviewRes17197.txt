ok, first of all, let me say that if you are looking to 'get noticed' or your aim for the evening is to be a completely annoying drunk, this is not the place to go.  I've read a few of the negative reviews and I have to say that it seems the people who don't like this place fall into the categories I mentioned above. I LOVE this place!! It's amazing from the very start. No address, no sign, just a boarded up wall. Followed by floor to ceiling velvet curtains and an amazing throw-back atmosphere.  I think what some of the negative yelpers don't understand is that it's a Prohibition era speakeasy. It's all about being discrete. It's candle light, and if there isn't a chair available, you have to wait-this prevents the over-crowded 'club' feel which I really appreciated! The drinks are amazing. I told the server (who was very knowledgeable and polite) that I am a sissy girl drinker and she recommended this amazing strawberry mint cocktail. My mom had a delicious drink that was a mix of brandy, a few things I can't remember, and an egg white. I know...egg white?? I was thinking the same thing. But it was so good. They shake up the drink and the egg gets frothy and adds this amazing texture to the drink. I appreciated the fact that both my mom (early 50's) and I (mid 20's) found this place welcoming, unique and comfortable. It's sometimes hard to find a place that I know my mom and I will both enjoy. Lets face it, this place is not for everyone, and they know that. If you aren't open to something new don't go.  If you are however looking for a new place to try, I highly highly recommend the Violet Hour...if you can find it!
