The atmosphere of an old Chicago inn that the owners were trying to create in Longman and Eagle was certainly present without it seeming like it was some sort of corporate design or movie set. I think it was that much of the furniture, and maybe even the fixtures were handmade that created a real sense of place. I would advise against ordering a chocotini, but instead asking for a bottle of Old Crow and a shot glass. A bar just like this does not exist anywhere else that I've ever been. I am a big fan of bars that do not have a television; this bar and Cole's are two that opened in Logan Square recently. They are putting several hotel rooms upstairs in the spring, and when you see the drink list you will know why. Now on to the whiskey. They have 23 one ounce shots available for $3, double that for two ounces. Of these, six begin with the word "old". There are other aptly named whiskeys on that list such as Rebel Yell, Virginia Lightning, Fighting Cock, and Georgia Moon. The last whiskey mentioned comes in a mason jar and tastes like lighter fluid. More popular brands such as Maker's Mark, Jack Daniels, and Jim Beam are also on the $3 list along with many more that are at various prices. If you brought about $60 here, you could kill yourself. The bar also has several beers on tap. The focus seems to be on local breweries such as Goose Island and Half Acre, most of which go for $5. For those that are cheap, there is Old Style on tap for $3, and cans of PBR for $2.
