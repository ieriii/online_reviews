Location. Location. Location!The rooms are older and rather small, but the beds (and bedding) more than make up for it.  I LOVE their down comforters and the convenience of having your own safe (and in room coffee makers). The lobby/lounge area is the hotel's best feature. Many comfortable sofas and chairs, to catch up on your e-mail or have a specialty coffee (or cocktails and lite snacks). The 4th floor offers a lounge area, that still allowed smoking (on my last visit in early March). You can easily walk to most of the city's main attractions from this hotel.  Which is why it's one of my top choices when coming back "home" to visit.{--- Chicago native, currently "exiled" in Nebraska ;)
