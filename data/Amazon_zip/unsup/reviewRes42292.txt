i cant stay away from this place. finally tried some other things on the menu. we started with bone marrow -duh. but also mussels corn bread and truffle pasta. mussels were great, broth was really good. the corn bread was yummy, esp with the mussels broth. and the pasta was great too. sauce wasnt too heavy or too light. portions were big enough for two to share. maybe even three. that night they had jazz downstairs, which we ventured down to. i think its a feb thing every tues night. obvi i will be back.
