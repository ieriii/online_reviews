Being a big W Hotel fan, I had to stay at this one when I was in Chicago a while back. I loved it. From the bar with wireless access for my laptop to the plush rooms with breathtaking views I was in heaven. Whatever/Whenever is the W Hotel theme and I certainly got that treatment while staying at this luxury spot. The cool thing is that they were doing a promotion when I went so I left the W with 3 DVD movies and an official W hotel blanket. Highly recommend this to the trendy traveler.
