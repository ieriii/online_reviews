This review is for the bar side of the restaurant: the Oyster Bar. It's a great place to go if the restaurant side is packed, because the menu here is the exact same as the restaurant. I had a super craving for seafood, so my order was of: 1. Yellowtail Nigiri 2. Blue Crab Spring Rolls (comes in 4) 3. The Lounge Combination of garlic shrimp, scallops, and crab cake I was hesitant to order sushi outside of J-town (Little Tokyo in Los Angeles for the Chicago natives), but I decided to try it anyways. It was good, but not as fresh as the ones found in LA. Ordering the spring rolls was the best decision I had made about the meal. Truth is, they aren't really spring rolls since they were deep fried. They come packed with blue crab, with big leaves of lettuce for wrapping and peanut sauce for dipping. OMG, it was SO GOOD! Honestly, I enjoyed eating all four pieces and they are the reason why I had to take half of the lounge combination home as leftovers. I tried a bite or two of each item in the Lounge Combination just so I knew how it tasted fresh from the kitchen. The scallops were a bit chewy and soft, not what I expected. The shrimp was grilled just right with plenty of flavor. The crab cake was done well; not too soft and not hard as a rock. The bed of flavored rice complimented the three parts extremely well. I had a ball eating the leftovers a few hours later. =) The service was okay, just a little slow (getting the check took 15 minutes), but it was likely from the busy night with a basketball game going on. Next trip back here would be to try the oysters themselves, hopefully on a slower night!
