Stand back, Yelpers. My breath is literally made of garlic fire balls. Why? Because I carried out from Greek Islands tonight. And I ate garlic. . . covered in garlic, baked inside of garlic on top of garlic. OK, you get the point. And I ain't complaining. It may not be a legitimate gauge of Greek cuisine but I judge restaurants of this genre by their gyros. It's like the pad thai of, uh, Thai food. Not "authentic" in a old school way, but predictable. Even after a five minute drive in the hot Ford Focus sedan, the shards of lamb were charred on the outside and salty smooth on the inside. *takes moment alone with gyros* We could have easily split one order and added extra pita. In fact that's what we'll do next time. Three stars just because I can go giving these five-pointed beauties away. I think Greek Islands has to work for it, and there's a lot to go back and try first. Suggestions anyone? *looks below*
