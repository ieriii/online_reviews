OMG! Can you say carnes? The meats are sooooo good! My husband and I came here for our weekly date nights. He picked this place looking on yelp for Latin American food. There was adequate meter parking on the street. There's seating outdoor and inside but we chose inside. We started with the empanada combo and I had a sangria and he had a Modelo. We ended up sharing the Picada Colombiana which is basically a plate for two of all their meats. My husband and I couldn't finish it and we ended up having to take some home and cook the rest of the meats for some great steak and eggs the next morning. Definitely recommended :)
