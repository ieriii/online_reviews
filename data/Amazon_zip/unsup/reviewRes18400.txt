My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner on a Tuesday night. It was practically empty when we got there which was fine with us. We shared a BYO bottle of wine and ordered amazingly decadent food and had a lovely night overall. I ordered the asiago-filled gnocchi and hubs got the pumpkin ravioli in mascarpone cheese sauce. We shared both meals, of course, and they were both awesome. Rich, filling, perfect for a splurge.  We finished off the evening with the lemon sorbet dessert (the one with a limoncello center) and it was delicious as well. Next time we want to sabotage our diets and go all out, we know where to go.
