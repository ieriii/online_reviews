This is all based off of the dumb broad working behind the counter. I don't know who but someone was messing up the whole operation back there. I'm going to start from the beginning. It started out as a fun Sunday breakfast adventure. Having never been there before but hearing good things, the bf and I decided to give it a whirl. First of all it's total chaos in there on a Sunday morning. There's a line for God knows what reason. To put your name in? To put your order in? No one knew for sure. We finally got to the front of the line and ordered two coffees, two unmemorable entrees, and a side of turkey sausage (a.k.a. turdey suckage) We asked for one of the coffees to-go but to the lady behind the counter took it to mean "I'll take your money and pretend you never ordered it" After some words were exchanged and some major 'tude thrown our way we finally got some decent coffee. Not worth the effort.
