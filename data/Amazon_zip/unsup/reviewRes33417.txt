This is about a 3.5 star, but I had to knock it down 1/2 star because the food was OK, but my friend's fork was dirty and there was numerous empty creamer containers mixed in the creamer bowl. The service on the other hand, was on point. As soon as we were seated the waitress came and offered us coffee. When I went to grab the creamer, I picked up one and saw that it was open and empty. Then I tried to grab the same flavor in the middle of the bowl, again empty. I think I counted a total of about 4 empty creamers, which made think about how much the place pays attention to the trash on the table. The food... we ordered the eggs Benedict and Florentine. The fruit was fresh and the potatoes were very good. It was seasoned perfectly. I was satisfied with the 2 dishes that we ordered and the service, but was turned off by the empty creamers and dirty fork (even though the waitress brought us a new one as soon as it was brought to her attention). I just think that they should pay attention to the silverware before wrapping it up in the tablecloths.
