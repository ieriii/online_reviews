YUMMMY. Went here with my sister, fiancee and brother in law a couple of weeks ago. All of the food was delicious. We had a variety of sushi and some cooked dishes. Great wine selections and interesting cocktails. No complaints with the food and beverage department. The decor is goregous. It's a really large space with dark wood, Asian, modern and vintage inspired. Sounds like a mish mash, but they made it work. Beautiful. The only very annoying thing is that I could not hear anyone at the table unless they were basically screaming. The acoustics in this place are atrocious. Serioulsy. Oh yes, and our waitress was just so-so. That's why I took off two stars. If they had better acoustics, I would've given it 4.
