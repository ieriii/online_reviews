I had known about Yolk for about a year and finally made it for New Year's Day brunch. I can see why friends of mine enjoyed it in the past, but wouldn't say it's top notch as far as South Loop breakfasts go. The range of the menu is pretty astounding. You can get everything from huge omelettes that come packed with pretty yummy fillings and sides of pancakes, to baked eggs and crepes. The portions are pretty huge. My friend and I were seated at the front of the restaurant right next to the window, which was nice! The rest of the restaurant was incredibly crowded and a tad claustrophobic, so I was glad we snagged a window seat. Nice view out onto Michigan Avenue/Roosevelt. I got the "When in Rome" omelette ($9.99) which was stuffed with Italian sausage, spinach (I think? maybe it was basil), tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese, and topped with marinara sauce. I'd never seen an omelette like this on a menu before, and overall I'm pretty glad I got it. I got fresh fruit (mostly grapes and pineapple) and an English muffin as my sides. The English muffin was toasted, but already cold, so my butter didn't really melt on it which was too bad. My friend got the nutella crepes. They were pretty delicious and came loaded with strawberries and bananas on top. Overall I'd say that Yolk delivers a solid breakfast, and that it's a good place for hungry tourists. But the food isn't really that creatively presented (and I'm not sure it's trying to be). So perhaps Yolk's mission is to deliver solid food in huge portions, and in that respect they succeed. I prefer brunches with a little more flair, so I will probably stick to Bongo Room and Eleven City Diner around the corner on Wabash.
