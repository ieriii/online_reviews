I don't get the hype behind this place. I used to work in the area, and my coworkers would always send those "lunch?" emails at about 11am, and, without fail, at least 4 people would reply with "Garcia's!" every damn time. I've been here maybe 3 times, and each time, the food was mediocre at best. I particularly remember the cheese not being melted on whatever dish it was that I got that had cheese on it. Poor performance. This place might be authentic, but the chefs are authentically bad.
