Never been here, but always knew about it. Decided to go on a Tuesday evening to have a bit of dinner and sit outside. I got the blackened salmon with spinach and mashed potatoes and gravy as my side. The food was great and the serving was big enough to have a little snack to take home. The server liked my Naked Raygun t-shirt which was an added plus. Overall, it has some quality choices on the menu that I look forward to trying out. 4.5 stars.
