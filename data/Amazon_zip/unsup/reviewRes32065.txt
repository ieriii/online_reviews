I'm not into vegan/vegetarian dishes but this place turns that upside down. The dishes taste so amazing you wouldn't know that there are no animal ingredients/biproducts. Their lasagna tastes better than average meat lasagna. You can't leave here without trying a milkshake either! Their outdoor back patio is also nice. It will surpass your expectations!
