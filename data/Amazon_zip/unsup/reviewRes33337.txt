As you've no doubt read in the glowing reviews, this is the kind of exotic, charming out of the way restaurant that I love to catch wind of. before the masses. Surely to become a staple go to spot once word catches on, for now it will remain my new secret spot. The food is impeccable, and ALSO they just started serving a new traditional brunch that is honestly heavenly. The free mimosa to start off with isn't a bad way to begin any breakfast after a long night out.
