I joined Yelp tonight specifically to warn people away from this place. I arrived at 10:30 in the evening, and by the time I was in the room for 30 minutes I had already made reservations at another place; 15 minutes later I was already walking to the new place with my bags. I simply could not stay there. Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, mystery stains on the carpet, a truly frightening bedspread, ripped chair cushions, scratched-up upholstery, and a general sense of uncleanliness; but the clincher was the security chain, which had clearly been broken in numerous times before, given the EIGHT bruised nail holes clustered around it. They did offer to upgrade me, but I simply had to leave. I am not a hotel snob, but that room just felt like a dirty motel at a truck stop. If it was $40 / night [in this neighborhood], I could see it. But over $100 / night?!?! No f-ing way. I went to the Day's Inn one block away for $13 / night cheaper...  I hate to be so negative, but they need to know they need to upgrade their facility; in the meantime, I can take some solace from helping others avoid the disappointment I felt.
