So, first time in Chicago and my girlfriend found most of the spots that we visited. This was one of my favorites! I had the Veggie Ruben and i have to say it was one of the best "pho" rubens i have ever had. they used a seasoned Seiten which tasted very near to the real thing. The sandwich was fantastic! I also tried my GF french toast. It was a bit dry but very flavorful. the price was ok and the service was average. Very hipsterish but not pretentious.
