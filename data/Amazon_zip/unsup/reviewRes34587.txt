not impressed. the chicken shawarma that we ordered was low quality. the meat was rubbery and bland and the hummus didn't really taste like anything either. they do offer a nice serve-yourself buffet spread which almost made up for it. the staff is indifferent. not overly friendly, but certainly not rude. the good: they serve cheap food and their service is quick. $3-5 sandwiches for your broke-ass. the bad: the food kinda sucks compared to the many other middle eastern options that are out there. eh. with so many other choices, i'll go elsewhere for my kabob fix.
