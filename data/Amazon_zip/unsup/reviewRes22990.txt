I am a Chinese, so Sichuan food for me can't be more familiar.Before I ate their food, I already saw it is high-rated restaurant in Yelp. I thought to myself,lets see if the food in Lao Sze Chuan is authentic enough to impress me.We ordered only boiled beef in spicy sichuan sauce and sorted stir fried veggie.I have to say the boiled beef is amazing. The spicy sauce is very authentic ,which I can tell, that is not directly from a spice package from super market. They made it with real Sichuan spice and other ingredients then they take time to cook and boil ,and make sure the sauce could be absorbed fully by beef.The beef inside the pot is very soft and tender but pleasantly chewable.The veggie is fresh too.Rice is ok. Overall is good. Service is great.Environment reminds me of Sichuan,China. I like it!
