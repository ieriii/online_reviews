Going on a first date, I was a little perplexed when he said we were heading to Logan Square. Longman & Eagle is located in a bit of a random spot, however it very quickly won me over.  We went on a Thursday evening around 7p and there was a wait, but we were able to nestle up to the bar & enjoy some fantastic signature cocktails. It was August when we went, so we were able to be seated in less than 20 minutes at an outdoor table. I loved the pork belly & my date had two smaller plates: pork cheek & grilled octopus. It was a relaxing environment, perfect for two foodies on a first date.
