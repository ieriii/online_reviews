Went there for dinner a few years back and had a good experience. Recently headed there for lunch. It was a 25 minute wait and the place was jammed. We sat on the second level and the service was terrible. I wish I could say our server was overwhelmed with all her tables but she appeared to only have a hand full. The only positive thing was the Spicy Chicken Flatbread Sandwich. I'll agree with Tina B's review that the portions were way too big...ended up not finishing 1/2 the sandwich. Maybe that's what I get for heading to the Magnificent Mile on a Saturday in the summer...
