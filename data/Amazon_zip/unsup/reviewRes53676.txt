I have never had anything like this food (which is too generic a word) and I loved every bite.I am not edgy or cool and this place is very edgy and cool and yet I was completely at ease and comfortable. The music is not my taste and I didn't know any of the artists, but the thing I liked about it was it created privacy in a small space. My conversation was heard by the person who was intended to hear it. It also complemented the energy of the kitchen. And maybe the intended effect was to even out any energy differential between the kitchen and the dining room. I thought it did and it was fun.This place also reminded me of really talented people who decide to do a stint in the public sector to hone skills and act upon some principal of their personality. If I had to guess at the principal at work with the owner I would say accessibility (to uncommon flavors and concepts).  I bet it's not as expensive as restaurants serving similar fare too. Yes, I needed to reschedule my original reservation, but they were persistent and courteous about the process. I once knew someone who at a certain time in his life went to fancy restaurants for an ego boost. Sometimes he would be disappointed at some of the City's better known restaurants if they did not provide the right service. I do not think the quirks of this place would have appealed to him. I could not have had a better time!
