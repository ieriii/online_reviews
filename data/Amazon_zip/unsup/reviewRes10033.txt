Brews n Pizza. 'Nuff said. I've been a-numerous times and it gets better and better. I've only ordered the "red" sauce for my pizza sauce choices but others have ordered the "white" and have loved it. Good number of fresh topping choices always. Pepperoni, basil, tomato, sausage, bacon...MMMm. Just salivating writing this. Gosh, must calm down. Thin crust hands down is the only way to go (Sorry deep dish lovers. It ain't here). What i truly love is their selections of brews. They make their own and have won tons of awards for it. I personally liked the Dark n Curvy. The guys liked Full Frontal and Golden Arm. They also have other choices such as hard cider (Strongbow) and my favorite Lefes Blonde. Be prepared to wait a big for larger groups. Been here for date nights as well. Always packed every night especially if their a game on. Chill out at the bar for your table, grab a brew or two. It's well WORTH it.
