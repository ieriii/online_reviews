Absolutely amazing food and beer. THeir food is modern midwest comfort food (get really fat and look cool while you get there). True story: my wife had their workman's burger, gave me half of it for lunch the next day, and then I left it at work over the weekend. She still complains about that burger being wasted! Losing that burger resulted in a real 5 hour fight. We go back whenever we are in chicago!
