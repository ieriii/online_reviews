You cant go wrong with their Superdawgs here. I found the burgers to be a bit dry. Always get the Superveggies, they are a must. I always get my fries well done, I hate soggy fries there. Carhops are always nice and they place hasn't been super crowded the times that I've been. Prices are very reasonable.
