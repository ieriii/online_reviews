I like this place, it is loud, lively, handsome bar. The staff is ok , not the best service but not the worst. the food is good for bar food, but I have one issue with salads and this goes for many restaurants now. Whats up with wedge salads, when did it become chic to serve a wedge of lettuce with not enough dressing. The cesear salad here is a wedge salad, this is a whole romaine lettuce cut in half , and put on a plate,  this is not a cesear salad. Cesear salads need to be tossed with the dressing. Thats the end of my rant on salads.  So now on to the rest of the review, the room is nice and comfy mostly though music is really loud sometimes but that is a bar cause this is really just a bar that serves food.
