I was very impressed by the thought out decor and the authentic replication of a beautiful Irish pub. I am also pretty impressed by the owner's willingness to embrace the controvertial Mr. Wilde and throw it into the melting pot that is the neighborhood! It seems a perfect fit. I saw Cub fans and my-2-dad families dining side by side with a dash of Chad and Trixie and a few random folks from the old country. Went there for a quiet drink with Ronnie and the legal counsel before the Pre Lube at Friar Tuck. Counsel enjoyed his fish and chips and loved the tasty curry sauce Ronnie suggested. They have Sugar Free Red Bull.! We had a nice time and carried on, watching families and locals come and go in waves for dinner and drinks, low key, no attitude. It was when the merry band of Yelpers returned after the Cesar's foray that all hell broke loose and god bless them for putting up with all the drinking, spanking, sombero wearing, flash photography, Matt's gay hat stealing and the cleavege club exposing. And for that awesome |rish welcome at the door. Yeah, that was something.
