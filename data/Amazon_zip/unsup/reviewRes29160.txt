Recently, I started a journey to find the best Pad Thai in the city. I have been all over the place looking for decent Thai food that isnt too americanized. In comes, Opart Thai House Restaurant. We were randomly in the south loop and decided to check out this joint. We parked on the street (metered parking) only to find out that they have parking in back...hmm good news because I plan on returning to this place. We both ordered Pad Thai, I ordered vegetable and my bf ordered chicken. I found out that the veggie pad thai was lacking in vegetables so I asked for more. They charged me $3 for a few extra veggies! WTF? I mean its only $3 but no one told me and I only got a few extras pieces. Overall, the Pad Thai is very good (not the best ever, I am still on my hunt). I also felt extremly rushed and the restaurant wasnt even busy. We had time to kill before our movie and basically got kicked out. I will return, hopefully to better service.
