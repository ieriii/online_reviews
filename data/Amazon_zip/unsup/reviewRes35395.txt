I decided to ditch my family's Christmas day dinner this year and head out with a gaggle of duck hungry yelpers for a gathering at Sun Wah. That might sound a little odd but is two straight days of family mayhem really necessary? I think not. I was expecting a Christmas Story scene at Sun Wah and surprisingly that was not the case at all. SW was hustling and bustling and seemed to be at maximum capacity. There was a short wait (even with a reso) but I didn't mind because after admiring the glorious roasted ducks in the window...I knew it would be worth the wait...and it was. We were a table of about 10 or so and ordered two of the duck dinner which is served three ways - roasted & carved table side (what a treat!), ducked fried rice or noodles and souped. Since we we ordered two dinners...we got an order of a rice and noodles. We also ordered up some chinese broccoli for good measure. The carved duck was served with steamed buns, shredded veggies and hoison and in a word is DIVINE. The noodles were off the chain and the broccoli was surprisingly good. SW is BYOB (corkage fees do apply, $5/wine $2/beer). We were well fed and therefore very very happy. The cost for this feast? EIGHTEEN DOLLAR including tip! Merry Christmas to us! I wouldn't hesitate to do Sun Way for Christmas dinner...Easter dinner...Thanksgiving...St. Patrick's...or for no other reason than just wanting a plate of the delicious skin from that glorious duck. PS - during dinner we saw the staff carrying a whole roasted pig through the dining area. Must. try. the. pig. This is more a reminder for me, than you :)
