I have a huge crush on Rick Bayless. I already love Mexican food to begin with, and that man just knows how to do it right. The night he won Top Chef Masters was one of the happiest of my life... ANYWAY... Frontera, I love you. This place is seriously awesome. The food is absolutely delicious, they have fun drinks, and it's not terribly expensive. If you can sit on the sidewalk patio in the summer, it's just a perfect evening.  The downside to Frontera is no reservations - you need to come here on a night when you're prepared to wait 1 - 2 hours for your table. Not bad on a summer evening when you can show up a bit early and just grab a drink and hang out for a while before dinner. Tougher in winter because the very tiny lobby gets too crowded and it can be a bit miserable. Point being, keep all this in mind - there are always so many tourists coming in there and getting shocked by the wait times, so don't let that be you. Be prepared, but it is all so worth it for a little taste of Rick Bayless goodness.
