Breakfast officially ends at 10:30. Let it be known. In my world breakfast never ends, so I was a little peeved that we had to wait half an hour for the folks at XOCO to get their lunch show on the road. The delicious churros were the star of the meal. I probably would have been happiest if we had just limited the meal to churros, a hot chocolate and a coffee. The "pepito" sandwich we had was cheesy and meaty and pretty good, but my bf was a little upset that it didn't come on torta bread. The carnitas salad is the bomb. I can't get enough of those pink pickled onions. Next time, Rick Bayless, I will try to get my butt out of bed in time for that egg empanada everyone has been raving about.
