All in all, an excellent meal! We waited quite a while to get in and were seated outside in the tented area, which was mostly fine on a evening when temperatures were in the high-50's (though we did keep our coats on through dinner), but it will be interesting to see how they survive the winter, when no one will be willing to stand outside, and those heaters really start to lose out to the chill. The food was fabulous, fabulous. The only complaint is that one of our two bones of marrow was decidedly marrow-less. Great wine selection, and attendant service.
