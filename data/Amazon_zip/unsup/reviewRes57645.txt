I had second thoughts about posting this review because the incident I am referring to happened a couple of years back and I haven't been back to Nuevo Leon because of the incident.I went in one night during the week with my wife and ordered my usual skirt steak. I had eaten here at least 4 or 5 times before. The steak came out and I smelled something very strange and disturbing. At first I did not think it was my food and thought it might just have been my imagination. I took my first bite and realized my steak was flat out rotten. I could not believe it and let my wife have a sniff and she was shocked. My first instinct was to take the plate right up to the front counter and demand to speak with a manger/owner but I didn't want to create a scene so I quietly called the server over to have her take a sniff. She did and looked at me like I was nuts (that really angered me). I said you can't be serious. This meat is rotten and you are acting like there is nothing wrong. She took it off the bill and asked if I would like anything else. We sat there for another 15 minutes discussing what we should do and just decided to pay the rest of the bill and leave.I have never gotten over how the steak got past the chef and the server and that's the main reason why I posted. They may have improved on some things since but I have never been back and will always be leery of Nuevo Leon.
