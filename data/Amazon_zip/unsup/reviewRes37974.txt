If you like beer, or claim to like beer, it may be a good idea to erase from your memory any mainstream brand of brew, and start with a clean slate. Whether you pick something off the table menu, or jump right into the full beer menu, chances are there is a beer to satisfy every type of taste and preference. Here's a tip. If you're not sure what you would like, and the bartender is not too busy, describe what you would like to have. Yes, you are putting you selection in the hands of the bar, but I was pretty satisfied with what was given me. Part 2 of the tip- if you seem clueless, you will get ignored. Service is not a highlight of the bar area. It ranks somewhere inbetween cold and indifferent, with a touch of attitude. They probably have a brew based on this somewhere on the menu. My food experience was limited to their Toasted Nueskke Ham Sandwich and some fries. The sandwich was okay, next time I'll definitely get a regular entree, but the fries, (okay pomme frites) were good. Atmosphere? Anything goes. Chances are it will be packed and crowded. Read other reviews for other tips on this place, I know I am. If you're in the main bar area, well, expect a bar. I haven't experienced the back or upstairs yet, so I can't comment on that. All in all, I enjoyed my time here. Pros: Extensive beer menu, urban bar atmosphere without feeling yuppy or preppy, but weird enough to have some character to it. Cons: Packed, smoking still allowed (may bother some people), service can be cold. To Sum it Up: (in Homer voice) beer...the cause of and solution to all of life's problems.
