Ok, so I went because I have heard good things about the burgers and it is is the neighborhood. Sorry, but I won't be back. The burgers were too well-done (for medium orders) and they just weren't that tasty. Too many great burger joints around this area to make sub-standard burgers. Only burgers were ordered at our table (3 different ones and 3 disappointments) so I can't comment on anything else on the menu.
