I've been going to Wildfire for years and they never disappoint. From the filet to the prime rib to scallops, they do it right. No, it's not prime beef, but it's the next best thing and for the money, it is totally worth it. And the mashed potatoes are some of the best in the city. The service is always spectacular. The ambiance is cozy and warm and inviting for a romantic evening. You definitely have to give this place a try, you will become a believer!
