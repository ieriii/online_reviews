I came here on a trip across the country on my way to move to California. We planned our whole trip to make sure we could stop here, and it was definitely worth it. To start off, the foie gras dog is one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was just perfect. I would happily wait in line again just for that first bite. I couldn't believe how good it was at first, seriously. I kept asking myself, "Is this for real?" We also got the Chicago Dog. It was good, but that was about it. It's not what we came for, but we just felt like we had to. The Irish Banger had one of the best pops of any sausage I've ever had, and it was delicious as well. The rattlesnake was fantastic. I never would have thought I'd have it as a sausage, but I'm damn glad I did. Finally the duck fat fries...I'm sorry, but I was slightly disappointed. Maybe it was me, but I didn't get much of the duck fat flavor. They were great fries, but I guess I was just expecting a stronger duck fat flavor, which is one of my favorites.
