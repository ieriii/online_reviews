This place is totally what Guy Fieri hyped it up to be. The Empanadas are delish, as is the grilled steak, but get it with sweet plantains on the side. Wash it down with a soy oatmeal shake and you're in Costa Rican heaven. Can't wait to go back! Also, this place gets packed around dinner. In the summer it gets packed and everyone wants a seat outside, if you don't want to wait then opt for a seat inside.
