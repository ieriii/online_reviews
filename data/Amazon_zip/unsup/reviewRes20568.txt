I must applaud Xoco for not being afraid to put a little spice in their dishes. Far too often I end up at a South American or Mexican style restaurant that has bland salsa and bland meat-marinades. The chipotle-style green salsa (came with my Goat Barbacoa) is a little bit spicy and a lotta bit smoky, almost peaty; I was pleasantly surprised. I had only heard about Xoco in passing from other people (who had never actually been there). I'd been to both Frontera and Topolobampo several times, and for some reason never bothered to check out Xoco on Yelp first. I was honestly expecting a Chipotle-style-burrito experience. I was gravely wrong. Apparently I'd never had a torta before, as certainly I would remember something so convenient and delicious. Sleep in a little this Saturday, and hit up Xoco around 10:30. Sit outside in the sunshine and enjoy a savory sandwich, creamy guac, a crispy churro ($1!), and maybe an espresso to get you going. I can't think of many better ways to start off a weekend.
