Went here on a Fri night and there was about a 45+ minute wait. Place is real small but overall the food and atmosphere is real good. I had the Pibil which is the torta with the suckling pig. This was absolutely delicious as even cardboard with suckling pig would probably be. It comes with a very, very, very spicy habanero salsa which complements the torta real well especially the pickled onions and jalapenos. The churros were also very moist and delicious and by far some of the best ones I've had ever. The place is pricey for a "street food shop" but that was to be expected. 2 tortas, beer, churros and chips/guac came out to about $50. Other than the wait, there isn't too much wrong with Bayless' newest endeavor.
