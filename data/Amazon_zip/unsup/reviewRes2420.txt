Best hot dog's in Chicago, a definite must even if the line is incredibly long. If you want the full experience go on Friday or Saturday for the duck fat fries (evil genius) and the Foie Gras Dog. I'm not joking, this is THE BEST HOT DOG you will ever eat. And feel free to try the week's special dog, ridiculous in the best way. Refills are free and (contrary to other reviews) Doug is a really nice guy, just crazy. Trust me, you MUST eat here before you die... Ok, too much, but if you're in the city DO GO. It's not a recommendation, it's an order!
