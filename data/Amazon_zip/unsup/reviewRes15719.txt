3.5 stars. We ordered delivery, so I have no idea about the actual restaurant. The pan pizza was really tasty, I enjoyed it and I wouldn't complain if I had to eat it again.  We also ordered prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls. If you're a prosciutto or mozzarella snob, I wouldn't recommend this. While tasty, neither were very high quality.
