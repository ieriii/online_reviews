Believe it or not, this place has THE BEST HOMEMADE CHICKEN SOUP with fresh vegetables.. I was feeling lousy last week and couldn't get Mom's chicken soup till the next day. All I have to say is that I ordered a second soup and called Momma Titi and told her not to bother making me soup!  I felt better instantly and was excited to note that they deliver to Lakeview.  The service was friendly and my friend was pleased with his meal.
