Alliance is by far the nearest and most convenient coffee shop to my apartment and I love it when it's not packed to the gills with people and when the radio station in the lounge isn't playing Coldplay and The Dave Matthews Band. I mean, for Christ's sake, really...really? But...but...why? I hear you playing your iPod in the room with the cash register, why can't you rewire it to include the lounge? When I don't have to hear contemporary easy listening crap and tune out the inane conversation of some recent DePaul grads this is a great place. Sadly, far too rarely is that the case. :-(
