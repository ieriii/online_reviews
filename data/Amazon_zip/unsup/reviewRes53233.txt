I've been here several times to take out the pork sandwich which I worship. It is soooooo yummy!  Finally went and sat down for dinner last night. I must say I was disappointed! Food was inconsistent. Empanadas were okay.  Pork tamal had very little pork and was all corn filling which had too much garlic. My friend had the skirt steak which was great. Another one had the pork medallions which was bland. I ventured out and had the red snapper filet. It was super fishy tasting and everyone at the table agreed. We told the waiter who just shrugged and walked away.  Luckily, my friends shared meals.  I also agree with the other reviewers on the noise level. It is really hard to hear people. I think outside seating is better as the patio really is loud and makes it hard to have a conversation.
