i love soup noodle and i love pho! this place did live up to its reputation. i got the original pho and the broth was really great - aromatic, not too salty, not too oily. that's the most important part and they got it right. the sides are abundant too. it even came with a side i've never seen before - some tough leaves that looked like dandelion greens. weird. i hate asking for more sides (i'm always trying to cop extra lime and thai basil) so the fact that we had more than enough was super satisfying. i do wish my soup had more tripe and less tendon. the tendon was well-cooked but there was just too much of it and in huge chunks. i also like the sliced beef rarer than it was when it came out. it felt a little overcooked, but i know that's a hard thing to time. it's a good sign when i can get nit-picky about things like that though. also got the pork banh mi, which was pretty good. it's not the kind of banh mi i'd usually get (usually opt for something with pate and that weird meat that comes in a plastic tube - you know the one), but the bread was chewy and delicious, the pickled veggies were light, and meat was flavorful and tender. could have used more cilantro, but i always think everything could use more cilantro. got there on a saturday night around seven and the wait wasn't too bad for three people. we did have to share a table but i don't think that's too weird for places like this. service was good, especially considering how busy it got, and the meal was ridiculously cheap. i'd like to be back and probably will, but it didn't blow me away so much that i wouldn't try some of the other pho places around to compare.
