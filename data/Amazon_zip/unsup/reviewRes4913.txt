Cheese, Swine, and Wine. The Purple Pig is a place that I will visit over and over. Tapas like style so ordering 2 dishes per person is enough to share with a group size of 6 people. (3 dish maybe if you are hungry.) Don't be scared to try new things! I had the opportunity to try bone marrow, (Thanks Natalie and Derrick) and fried pigs ear. Gracias Juliann. Fried pigs ear is now my favorite dish there. Why? its sliced thin and does not look like an ear, doesn't taste disgusting at all, and there's a fried egg on top. Fried egg people! Everything is good with fried eggs. One more quick tip. If you don't know what the hell some of the ingredients are, don't worry. Look up at the light on your table, there is a list of what they are. :) Enjoy!!
