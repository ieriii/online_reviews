Really? 4+ years in Chicago and just now I make it to Coast. It wasn't difficult snagging a table - then again, most people were still stuck after Snowpacolypse 2011 blew through. It was also 10pm on a Thursday night... but there's something so chic about going for late-night sushi! Reminds me of time I've spent in NYC. As others mention, the rolls are divine and the service is so-so. Our server tried whisking away my sparkling clementine juice with still a quarter remaining in the glass. Not so fast! Gotta haves: - Oysters - White Dragon and Po' Boy maki - Clementine or blood orange sparkling juice - Mango, passionfruit and raspberry white chocolate mochi Don't forget to bring your wine, as Coast is BYO! And for you procrastinators, there's a 7-11 across the street with very bad wine marked up sky high.
