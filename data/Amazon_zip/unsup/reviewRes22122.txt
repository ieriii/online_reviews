This place is the bomb and has great service to boot! Must get the gyros. They are homemade, delicious slices of meat perfectly charred that literally melt in your mouth. My fiancee likes the gyro plate while I prefer the Greek salad with gyro meat (hey, I can at least pretend I'm eating healthy). The servers are icing on the cake. They are so polite and go above and beyond for you. Example- we asked for a spicy chile sauce and they said they only had Tabasco. We politely declined (Tabascos only use in my mind is in bloody marys) and instead of walking away, they offered us freshly sliced jalapenos. Within minutes we had the cutest plate of jalapenos garnished with olive oil. This place is a must try!
