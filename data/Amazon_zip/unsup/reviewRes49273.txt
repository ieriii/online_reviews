I hate to give a place two stars that focuses on serving wine and cheese but this was a miss for me. This is based on one visit. The atmosphere is remarkable in that it is cavernous feeling and weird. I don't know anything about lighting but that doesn't stop me from criticizing theirs.....it seemed too bright and cold.  It felt like sitting in a school cafeteria at night if that makes any sense. If it doesn't make sense trust me that it made more sense than our waiter. I wanted to like our server but he was not a professional waiter. He was slow in speech and manner and not helpful in any way.   He barely said two words even when questioned. He seemed like an extra cook who decided to go out and wait on tables to help out. Only not as friendly or helpful as you would imagine a cook turned waiter would be.  Food - We had the tuna and the salmon and I thought both were adequate to good.  I did like the wine flights. Its fun to read the different descriptions and pretend you can taste the subtle differences.  I thought the little store at the front was out of place and cheapened the whole restaurant experience.  I was here on a date and had a fun night but I could see how it might be more fun with a group where you were sampling lots of cheese and drinking lots of wine.  If you really loved wine I wouldn't hesitate to give it a try but based on my one experience I won't be back soon.  Being new to this town I cant imagine there aren't 100 places better than this in Chicago. I hope I am correct.
