Our family of 4 ate here last week, again. We live in the far southwestern suburbs, but every now and again, we take the trek to Tank Noodle to fulfill our Pho cravings. The servings are huge! I always order the regular sized bowl, and I can never finish it. The herbs are always fresh, and the soup is very flavorful. This last time, we shared something new - Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe). Wow, it was spectacular! Even our picky boys couldn't get enough, they were arguing over the last few bites. This place is always a great value, and the food is consistently good. Tip: go before 6pm to beat the crowds. It can get fairly cramped, but usually not before 6pm.
