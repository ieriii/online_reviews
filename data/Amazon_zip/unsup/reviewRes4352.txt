Oh, the Green Mill... it seems I spend more and more Friday nights here as time goes by. It isn't THAT crowded, I've always been able to find a seat at the bar. There isn't a cover after 1 am, and the jazz band they have on Friday nights is lots of fun. They're called the Green Mill Quartet, featuring Steve Hashimoto and Barry Winograd, who does the jazz show on WXRT. The staff is friendly and funny: Nathan, Steve, the guy at the door. Don't be shocked at the high drink prices, drinks are expensive at any place with live music. Dress up or dress down, there are as many neighborhood people that hang out here as there are tourists. Uptown isn't as sketchy a neighborhood as it was 10 years ago, just use your head as you would anywhere in the city. Street parking is easy. As you probably know by now, this place used to be a speakeasy in the Chicago gangster days. Sneak a peek behind the bar and you will see the trapdoor Al Capone used to sneak out.
