I love the fact that parking is so easy! There's a strip for free parking, parking meters easily accessible, $5 valet, and a closeby parking garage for $3 for the whole evening! This place is very hip. You definitely would want to dress up nicely. Food is AMAZING! They do cost a bit more than your usual entree but it tastes good. I ordered the place with all the seafood and it was delicious. I also had the arrachara which is skirt steak over a blanket of rice and beans and that was so good too. The atmosphere is very alive. You still see people coming in around 11pm for dinner. Very nice! But definitely make reservations before you go. It is always busy!
