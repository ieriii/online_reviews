I came here with a small group for brunch last year. The place is quite pretty, and the presentation of the food is very cute. There was a bit of a wait, but the service was good once we were seated. I'm a fan of savory breakfast foods, so I ordered some kind of omelet with chorizo, and another girl ordered pumpkin pancakes (I think). Our food was tasty but not memorable. However, there was one other person at our table who got the brown sugar brioche French toast with warm vanilla bean cream, and my god it was good. Everyone tried a little of each other's food, but she couldn't finish hers because the tower of french toast was huge, so I finished the last piece and wanted more. It's not on their menu this season which is a big shame, but I would go back again for brunch, and I would definitely order one of their sweet menu items next time.
