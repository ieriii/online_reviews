Totally enjoyed my time there. Starting with valet parking especially when its raining out. Ambiance was just right. Recommend a reservation. If your on a date night ask for a more private sitting arrangement. Main dining area is pretty open. Recommend the Churasco or Skirt steak add mixto and yuca or platains. A glass of sangria never hurts but would totally have their Raspberry Mojito or frozen margaritas again. Overall, service was fast and friendly. Sat in their lounge area and bar staff was pleasant. Get ready to spend some $$$
