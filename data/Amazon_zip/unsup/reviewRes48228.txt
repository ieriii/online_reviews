This place was pretty awesome, but while it is bench style dining, it was pretty cramped.  To start, the mussels were divine. We ordered the fish stew, and while it was amazing, I wish the waiter had told us that it's a lot like the mussels taste/presentation-wise.  The waffle for desert was ok, but not what the waiter hyped it up to be. The busboy accidentally knocked over very garlicky aioli all over me. What I was most impressed by was the way the restaurant handled the situation.
