Sometimes the service is a bit spotty, but that seems pretty standard for places in Chinatown, the food makes it all worth it though. I've loved everything I've ordered here. I could write a really long review saying how great everything is, but with 400+ reviews it is mostly covered... My recommendation, if it is your first time just stick top the chef's specials near the front of the menu. You can't go wrong with any of those. If it has two peppers next to it the food is actually spicy, I love it!
