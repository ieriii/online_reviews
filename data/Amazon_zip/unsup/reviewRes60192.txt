Nice neighborhood pizza place. Friendly service and good pizza. The two slices and a drink special (for under $6) is a really good deal. I tried a Margherita and a kielbasa/cucumber slice. The kielbasa (a daily special) was really good. They also have a huge variety of pizzas to order which I am sure to do in the near future. This is a great place to get lunch if you're in the area (or a quick bite after getting off of the train).
