Meh. That's how I feel about Frontera. Honestly, the entire experience was average - maybe even slightly below average. We live in a city with some of the best authentic Mexican food in the country. I can go to almost any neighborhood and have an authentic torta or mole enchilada or any number of other Mexican foodstuffs. The tacos left me unimpressed. My brother liked his vegetarian dish but certainly wasn't wowed by it. It's a fine place to take tourists, but as a local, I wouldn't go here again. Meh.
