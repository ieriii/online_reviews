I'm currently obsessed with this restaurant.  It's one of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to. (I've been to lots of restaurants in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan) This one is definitely the best I've been to in Chicago and in my top 4-5 all time. Do:  -Order the authentic Chinese / Sichuan items -Come during off-peak hours -Exhibit some patience, since service isn't the best -Drink lots of water Dont: -Don't order the Americanized Chinese / "Everyday" Chinese items. i.e. Beef Broccoli, Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Fried Rice, Lo Mein. These dishes are prepared, cooked, and taste pretty much the same in every Chinese restaurant in America.  Dishes I've Tried: Boiled Beef w/ Szechuan Sauce - 5* - Fantastic, Very Spicy, Ask for it "Less Spicy" Sliced Pork w/ Garlic Sauce - 5* - Cold Sliced Pork Belly w/ Chili OIl and Garlic - Probably one of the best dishes I've had all year.  Very Rich. 3 Cups Chicken - 5* - Delicious braised chicken - Love the sauce and the fried basil leaves. Lamb w/ Cumin - 4* - Good, lamb could be more tender Chili Prawns (Dry) - 4* - Good, simple, nice sized prawns Chili Chicken (Dry) - 4* - Good, simple, spicy I can't wait to try some more of the items on the menu. Next on my list is Lao Hunan. But needless to say, this restaurant has re-invigorated my interest in Chinese food.  Good Stuff.....
