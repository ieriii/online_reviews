It is with a heavy heart I write this review as I had been looking towards dining at The Bad Apple since its opening was announced. Being a big fan of both Kuma and Cooper's this place was on my map. I went with a friend around 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday night. The crowd was light and the stereo hummed along creating a comfortable atmosphere.  On entering the restaurant we stood at the front for 2-3 minutes waiting to be seated but nobody came. I approached the bar tender and asked if we were to seat ourselves and he looked at me curiously then directed us to a dirty table.  Once the table was clean, a candle was lit (which promptly died, never to be re-lit) and our beer orders were taken. Roughly 15 minutes later I received my beer after a notification that the tap was dry.  I ordered by $9 Bleu Cheese burger medium rare and was excited to savor. Once our food was delivered I noticed that the burger was cooked well done (not medium), the patty was significantly smaller than the bun, and the bleu cheese appeared to be a rare commodity. The fries were tasty but the portion was small and they were served only slightly warmer than room temp.  We finished our food, paid and left. Nobody asked our opinion on the service or the meal. While I will probably give The Bad Apple one more shot in a few months, I have no urge to go back even if it is in the neighborhood.  Disappointing.
