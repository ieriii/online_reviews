I have been wanting to visit a Francesca restaurant since moving to Chicago, and I am so glad that I finally had the opportunity to do so.  The bruchette was delicious start to the meal. I also enjoyed my share of bread and olive oil. Yum! For my entree, I ordered the Linguine all' Amatriciana, and it was excellent.  The parmesan tomato sauce was flavorful and the pancetta was cooked perfectly. The atmosphere was cozy and quite authentic. I really enjoyed Mia Francesca, and I would definitely return.
