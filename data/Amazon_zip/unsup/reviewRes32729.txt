i ate here for the first time saturday night. im a big carnie, just to get that out there, but i definitely love all food, invluding vegan food. i got there around 930, and it wasn't very busy at all, which made me happy. i was super excited to try some excellent veg food, and i was extremely pleased with what i had. i ordered the bbq buffalo wings, the halfpipe, and a small cookie dough peanut butter shake. EVERYTHING and i mean everything was amazing. the wings were surprisingly good, had good flavor -- i definitely want to try their buffalo wing flavor next time. the halfpipe -- an open faced hoagie with country fried seitan steak, french fried onions, lettuce, tomato & 1260 Sauce. this thing was MASSIVE. and uhh yeah, i would choose this over a real country fried steak anyday! it didn't make me feel totally gross and bloated afterwards, and the texture was really good. the shake. oh the shake. it definitely lived up to the hype. i ate my leftover halfpipe the next morning cold straight from the refrigerator, and wow. it was still reallly good! if veggie food could taste like that all the time, i would possibly consider switching over. (but...the carnie inside of me won't allow it.)
