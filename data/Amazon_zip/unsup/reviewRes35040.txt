Just tried Sushi-X, and I have to say I was underwhelmed. The rolls I got, spicy scallop and the honey roll, were really dressed up. Tons of mayos and random stuff. Normally I like that in smaller degrees, but I also like to know that I'm actually eating raw fish. I'm weird like that when I come to sushi. The gomae, additionally, was just eh. Would I say it's the worst I ever had? No. Best? Not so much. This was just delivery though, so I want to try the storefront before I make a final decision. Anyone can have an off night.
