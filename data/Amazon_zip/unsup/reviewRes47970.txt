I capped off my gastronomic journey through Chicago with a visit to the Publican. How could I resist an establishment built on a foundation of premium meat and seafood? The communal, beer-hall, seating was interesting, giving this upscale restaurant a down-to-earth feel. It kinda reminded me of Hofbrauhaus. Stuffed with food and booze throughout the day, we passed on the extensive beer menu. We opted for the arctic char, chicken liver pate, fish stew, and suckling pig for a party of 3. Service was a bit slow, and we had to ask twice for bread. The arctic char dish was an excellent start to the meal. It was served with salad greens, sweet cherry tomatoes, and soft cheese over crostini. I really like the flavor combination, although I could have used some more fish. The pate, however, ended up being a disappointment. The bread was slathered with overly sweet grape jelly, overpowering the dish and creating a strange flavor profile that made my friend stop eating after one bite. I almost finished my piece, but it was just too overwhelming. Luckily, a huge pot of fish stew came out after. Loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp, and more, this was definitely a hidden gem on the menu. Its vibrant and bold flavors spoke volumes over its somewhat pedestrian menu description, and I'm really glad my friend wanted to order it. Our last stop was the suckling pig dish, very moist and flavorful. The sweet cornmeal and slightly bitter and sour greens complimented the pork nicely, and I couldn't stop eating it. I thought we'd be too full for dessert, but I can never say no good bread pudding. It was sinfully delightful, and I was very satisfied with the end of the meal. Oh, and the bathrooms are pretty cool too. Aside from the pate and average service, I had a great experience and would definitely like to come back to try some more dishes.
