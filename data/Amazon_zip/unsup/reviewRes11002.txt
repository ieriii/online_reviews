Outstanding thin crust pizza. The red style was great and the sauce was incredibly tasty. We didn't order toppings so can't comment on those. The pizza was not totally soft like NY style pizza, but was not hard either. During the wait, we walked around the neighborhood & got seated in 90minutes, though we were told it would be 2 hours.
