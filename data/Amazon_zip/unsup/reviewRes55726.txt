Went here for lunch with my aunt. I was not impressed with the food at all. The chicken sandwich was very basic, the fries were cold! The service was just ok - even though it was not really busy, we had to wait 10 minutes for a waiter! Also was surprised to find that valet parking was required for lunch! I was truly disappointed and will not be returning any time soon.
