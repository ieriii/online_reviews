Is it a Microbrewery or is it a Bistro? Both! When's the last time you went to a pub and got amazing Coconut Curry Mussels? I am a recent Andersonville transplant and this is my new favorite place to go! The service is unbelievable. Every time my little "mussell shell bowl" was 80% full, a magical being swooped in and provided a fresh, empty one. The beer was great and the prices reasonable as well. YUM!
