Really disappointing. We stopped in after a night of Christmas shopping and looking at the lights downtown. The waiter was almost non-existent (water glasses sat empty after the first 5 minutes) and he even stopped while taking our order to join in a conversation at the next table about living in Michigan. Food was not worth the price and the atmosphere wasn't anything special. Won't go back.
