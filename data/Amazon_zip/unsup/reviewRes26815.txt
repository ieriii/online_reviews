I can't say anything that hasn't been said a million times on Yelp about Pequod's already. Quite honestly, my favorite pan pizza in Chicago. The crust is perfectly thick. The sausage is my FAVORITE. I'm quite leary about italian sausage in Chicago. The "layer of sausage" at a certain pizza joint favored by concierge's all over the city that will remain nameless made me violently ill once. Since then I am extremely picky about the sausage. Pequod's sausage is perfect. Perfect seasoning with a slight twinge of fennel along with perfectly sized chunks. I always ask for my pie well done. This makes the generous layer of pepperoni on top a little bit crispy. And I won't even talk about he carmelized cheese. Its my favorite part. Pequods for life!
