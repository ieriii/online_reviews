I only went once for dinner, but my experience was very nice. The service was good and the kitchen was very accommodating. I was dining with a few picky eaters and they were more than willing to make substitutions. The food was above average, but a bit expensive. Although, the portions were quite large, I think that two entrees and a few starters could easily feed three people.
