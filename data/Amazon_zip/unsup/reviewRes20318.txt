Stopped by here during Restaurant Week to try out the food. I was pleasantly surprised at the fish and chips, they were the most flavorful and least greasy I've had in quite some time. The wine is good but definitely on the pricey side and we all paid upwards of 16 bucks a glass. Yikes. The scene is fun and lively, and looks like it would be a fun place to stop for Happy Hour cocktails and apps. It is crazy loud in there though, so if you're looking for quiet conversation with your dining patron, I might think twice about stopping here! Otherwise, good food, fun atmosphere. Worth a try!
