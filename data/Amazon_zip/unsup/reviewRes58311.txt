On my most recent trip to Chicago, and my first trip after my conversion to full blown veganism, I was pleased to find several vegan dining options. My boyfriend and I went through the list and picked a few places to try, and thank goodness one of the places we put on our list was the Chicago Diner, because it was fabulous!There was quite a wait to get in to a table, but luckily we stuck it out. The servers were incredibly helpful, making tons of suggestions when we were both so overwhelmed by the selection. I ended up settling on the Black Bean Burger, which was absolutely incredible, and a cup of the French Onion soup. My boyfriend, a self-professed meat and potatoes guy, decided to go with the huevos mexicanos, and was pleased as well. I was a little apprehensive about bringing him to a restaurant where he couldn't stuff himself with bacon and sausage, but he really ended up enjoying it as much as I did. A great place to go if you're a couple with such different food preferences.The Chicago Diner has a cookbook, which we also purchased, and it has been so wonderful here at home in Lansing to be able to recreate some of the dishes. I recommend buying it if you're only in town for a short while.
