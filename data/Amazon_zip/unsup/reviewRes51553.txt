Hmm...I'm conflicted on this review. I know a lot of ppl that swear by this place but I worry that their food judgement is impaired by volume of alcohol consumed. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of the Garcia's margarita..the mango one being my fave. The food howere, not so hot. Its okay. Not bad. But definitely nothing extraordinary. So if you're hungry and go here, I recommend drinking a lot cuz everything tastes better when intoxicated.
