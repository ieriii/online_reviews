The cochon was delicious. Surprisingly as the description of it put me off, but it was tender with a perfect crispy crust. The 5 spice mustard cut through the fat nicely. I would go again just for the cocktails and whiskey/bourbon list. The service is fabulous - very kind and knowledgeable servers.
