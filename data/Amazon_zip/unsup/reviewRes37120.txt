I cannot even tell you how much I miss this place now that I live in NYC. When I made the big move to New York, I had imagined that NYC would be teeming with gastropubs with the same quality, cool vibe, and impressive beer list, but I am yet to find a place that even holds a candle to my dear Hopleaf. What I love about this place is that it'll satisfy a variety of food and drink moods you might be in. If you're in the mood for drinks and greasy bar food, you can get a great beer and snack on their delicious fries and aioli or their apple fritters. If you want a simple dinner, you can get a sandwich and fries-- the CB&J (a grilled sandwich with fig jam, cashew butter, and cheese) is my favorite. If you want a lighter meal, get the mussels (probably the best in the city). Or, if you're in the mood for something a little fancier, they always have several more constructed bistro-type items on the menu, like roast chicken, steak, a pan-seared fish, etc. Like others have said, the major downside to this place is that it's always packed. Be aware, though, that there is a large back room and 2nd floor with seating-- my parents had avoided coming here for a long time because they thought that the crowded bar in front was all there was. If you come before 6 on a weekday, you should be able to get a table without waiting much.
