I guess I don't get it. I was all psyched to try the caramelized cheese everyone raved about and... the quarter inch of burned cheese around the edge of my pizza just didn't really set my panties on fire the way everyone made it sound like it would. It was pretty good pizza, but not the best I've ever had by any means. And, this is weird, but I really felt like about 45% of the staff was just repeatedly walking by my table and just starring at me. It was creepy. I won't go back unless my husband really loved it and makes a special trip...but I think he's just as happy with the 5 places right by our house. Sorry, dudes!
