Piece is awesome. That's the only way I can think to describe it. The vibe in the restaurant is laid-back and friendly, with everyone looking for a good pizza and tasty beer. We ordered two pizzas; the first was a white pizza with artichoke, mushroom, and chicken, and the second was a red pizza with sausage, banana peppers, and onions. I did not even try the second pizza because I was so enamored with the first. The white pizza was the perfect combination of cheese, meat, and veggies. I also ordered the Golden Arm beer, which was delicious as a pairing. I would definitely recommend Piece, anytime. It's certainly worth a long wait (I waited over an hour) if you encounter one.
