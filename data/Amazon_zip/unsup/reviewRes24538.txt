I love their cakes!!! Especially the mango and coconut mousse ones. We always get these for birthdays now and when we go over to guests'. Also their almond cookies are the best I've had. Light and airy with lots of almond flavor. Even the bf who isn't a big fan of sweets loves them. Last night we also tried the Opera cake. Hazelnut and chocolate? YUM. Dessert is the only thing we come for but as we left bf saw a pizza at another table and said "They serve pizza here?" Guess we'll have to come back and try the food too. We bought some cookies before we left. Think I'm going to have one now! ^_^
