Fox & Obel is extremely hit or miss in my opinion. I've been going here for the last five years, namely for their bakery but also for various one-off items Their cheese selection is expansive and the gentleman who usually is there is both knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Definitely would recommend others to stop over at the cheese counter. On to the bakery...It looks amazing. However, looks can be deceiving: I'm a bit of a pastry junkie, so I often find myself on the search for an almond croissant. The first time I had one here, it was amazing. Crispy, buttery, with the perfect amount of frangipane that had set perfectly during baking. The next time I came in, I ordered the croissant and the almond cream wasn't cooked at all and still was runny, like an egg. I took it back, the customer service person and bakery person were extremely rude. Instead of just replacing the darn thing, they argued that frangipane should be runny. Umm, in whose world? Despite this sour experience, I was in the neighborhood again and picked up a croissant and it was like before. The next time, it was runny again. I recently stopped in and got the croissant. It was fine, but unfortunately came with some serious attitude from the English lady who mans the counter. I asked if she could warm up the croissant, and she said to go the deli and have them microwave it. I was shocked that a baker suggested putting a croissant in a microwave. Doing so defeats the purpose of all the work that went into making the croissant that results in the structure of a crossiant (crispy, flaky exterior/ soft, layered interior). I will admit their olive ciabatta is superb, but a few times I have come in and noticed fruit flies in the corners of their display case and promptly left. Their manager should really look into this.
