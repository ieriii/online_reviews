The best thing is Doug himself, bedecked in his black tee shirt, and big black nerd glasses. He looks like he wondered in from the set of the old movie "High Fidelity". Doug has a laugh and a good word for each customer, while he personally mans the cash register in the tradition of small joints for eons. Careful, though. Doug takes time off now and then and the place is simply closed while he has "gone fishin'". So call to make sure he is open. The lunch line is insane. So go for early or late lunch. Many chefs meet there for mid-afternoon encased meats before going off to look after heirloom tomatoes and froth. This is not a classic Chicago hot dog stand. This is a tribute to encased meats of all sorts. Goi with the oddities and enjoy.
