this place was good but not the best deep dish that i've had in my life... the sad thing is that the other good deep dish places were not even in chicago... i'm not saying that it was bad, but for the amount of time that people wait to get in here, and the price of one pie, i was expecting to have a foodgasm and honestly i had to fake it. the appetizer my girl and i had was actually more "memorable" than the pizza if that says anything... the service was pretty good, except for the fact he brought the pizza uncut, said he'd be back to cut it, and we didnt see him for about 5 more minutes... by that time you bet your ass i had already cut it, you're not gonna leave a pizza in front of my face for even 30 seconds and expect me not to tear it apart... i'm looking forward to my next trip to find somewhere that tops their pizza.
