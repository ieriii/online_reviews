4.5, really. I ate here a few weeks back, and I can still remember the big, bold flavors of my meal. I had the 2 course lunch here, and I chose the Arroz a la Cazuela (a type of Chilean soup), the Butifarra con Judias (house made sausages with truffled white beans) with the fries as a side, and my friend and I split the chocolate croquettes as a desert. The Arroz a la Cazuela was a solid dish. The saffron added a great aroma to the broth, and the flavor was subtle, but not hidden. I didn't care too much for the artichoke confit--the shrimp, chicken, and chorizo, when eaten with the aioli, blew that away. My second dish was essentially house made sausage with with truffled white beans. The white beans knocked my socks off. They were the best beans I had ever had. The accompanying fries were well cooked, the but the aioli wasn't too memorable. For desert, a friend and I split the chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow. My friend loved the croquettes--she devoured hers so fast, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I did the marshmallows with caramel. Silky smooth with rich banana flavor . . . highly recommended. Don't let the olive oil turn you off of this desert--it adds a nice contrasting flavor to this dish. I will definitely visit Mercat when I'm in Chicago again . . . I can't seem about to forget those delicious truffled white beans . . . Oh, and I also had the seasonal sangria. If I'm not mistaken, it was ~$7 and well worth the price. You'd never think of putting basil in an alcoholic beverage, but damn, was it great.
