The misses and I usually eat cereal for breakfast. She isn't really fond of breakfast foods - but we decided to have a Chicago Nerdy Touristy Day (parks, museums), so we kicked it off by walking to Milk & Honey Cafe. The place was packed, almost out the door. We waited about 20 minutes. This place had cool waffles but we decided to go with the sandwiches and this carrot cake. I liked the sandwich. The chips served with it was decent at best. I had a Moscato which woke me up. The ambiance is cool, awesome staff, cool interior, decent food. Overall a fun experience in the morning.
