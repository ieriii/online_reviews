We were very pleasantly surprised by Caro Mio. They started by giving us fresh bread with fresh garlic and oil. We ordered the polenta as a starter as we never had polenta before and it was good. The sauce was excellent. I order a special gnocchi stuffed with asiago cheese and it was excellent. My wife order the chicken parmesan, which was also excellent. The service was great. It is a little pricey but that is how it is at good BYOB places. I guess the additional price may not be worth it if you don't drink. Our bill was under $60 because we brought a bottle of wine.
