I am a huge fan of Simply It. I have never actually eaten inside of the restaurant but have ordered delivery plenty of times. They are very fast and the food is always fresh and top quality. I love eating a lot of their beef dishes with a side of white rice. The tasty and tangy tastes of the restaurant are 'simply' perfect. If you are craving some sweet Asian, Thai, or Vietnamese, or for some delicious beef i encourage you to try Simply It. It is really good and I am writing this review just to get people to eat there, would be a shame if such a great spot closed
