Disclaimer: I have only had appitizers here and also kind of want to give this place 3.5 stars but don't have that option. I've been here on two occassions, both to have a drink or two and check out some local live music. There is a whole lot the folks at Uncommon Ground are doing right but a few areas that could be better. First, I love the decor. There is a relaxed and easy going vibe. I like my craft beers and they have a good selection. Food prices seem a bit high for the area. Again I haven't had dinner here and probably won't because of the prices. There is also a bit of an odd policy with the seating. On my first visit the only table available was in the music room and to sit and eat we had to pay either $5 or $10 each as cover. We would have gladly sat else where but it was that or no table. However, the music was good. On my second visit, we wanted to sit at the bar and listen to the happy hour band. The bar area was packed and we had no choice to take a table. Again, the music was good, the drink selection was solid but the set up was odd. Overall, this neighborhood needs a place like Uncommon Ground and I like the idea of the place, sustainable food, live music, good beers, however it could be executed a bit better.
