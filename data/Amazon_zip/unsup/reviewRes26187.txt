The best restaurant on the planet... at least in my opinion. I've come here on dates, with family, with friends and it's always the right fit. The menu is killer... fondue is such a fun, communal food. The cheese fondue is so amazingly delicious, and the breads they serve it with are sooo f-ing good. Love the sauces they serve with the meat course as well. They make it such a treat! And, the flaming chocolate dessert course is just retardedly good. Oh yeah. I always leave here with a fully belly and with a smile on my face.
