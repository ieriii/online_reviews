We decided to check this place out after a friend recommended it. It was really good. We had the sushi combo and a variety of rolls (Fire Dragon, Godzilla, Oedipus, Spicy Tako etc.) The Fire Dragon was really good. The Godzilla was tasty but not as big as I imagined it would be compared to rolls from other places. We went on a Wed night and did not have any problem getting a table for 5. It's also nice that they have BYOB with $3 corkage which is really reasonable. The wine list is very affordable as well.
