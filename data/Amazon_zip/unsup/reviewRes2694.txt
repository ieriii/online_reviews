I have a sorority sister who likes to celebrate her birthday. She has a husband who likes to go on fishing trips to Canada. The two collided and he uttered these fateful words. "Invite your sorority sisters for a birthday dinner, anywhere you want, I will pay for it." Done, she invited us and our daughters to dine with her at Tru. It was the most elegant meal and the most giggly fun I have ever had. Heck, I even bought new shoes for it. The restaurant was hidden and elegant and when we left they gave us parting gifts. We did the prix fixe with a couple of Caviar staircases and lots of champagne thrown in. Fab-u-lous! If I got up, they moved my chair. When I came back, they helped me in. I remember all the food as just delicious but we did drink a lot of champagne. Cheers! I wasn't a Yelper then but I have always meant to write about this fantastic birthday party. Yesterday I checked in with my Yelp app to remind me. (I didn't have a smart phone back then.) Today, I get a message on Yelp from the self appointed Yelp police - aka the husband of a FORMER Yelp friend - that he has "noticed" that I did a 10:00 am check in at Hub 51 and a check in shortly after that at Tru. He is "contemplating" turning me into Yelp reps as he knows these check ins are not legit and then I will most likely be deported or possibly shot by a firing squad.  Stalk much? Hilarious! It made a memorable evening even more memorable. So be careful, if you dine at Tru, make sure you check in on that exact date or the Barney Fife of Yelp Elites will turn you in.  Tru dinner and a true story.
