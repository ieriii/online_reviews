I fucking love this place. I work in Lakeview (hence, all of the reviews of establishments in the neighborhood, despite the fact I live about four miles west of there) so I get to eat here about once a week. First, and most obviously, the chicken is tops. Being the whitest of the white-boys, I don't know much of anything about Korean food. Hell, I'm not even sure if this is real Korean food. And, what's more, I don't give a fly-on-the-back-of-a-cow-at-100 miles an hour's ass. It's friggin perfect.I might even go so far as to say that dollar for dollar, this is the best food I've ever had. And the Sriracha sauce on the table... well, huge bonus. Beyond all of that, well, the staff here is totally cool. I always feel welcome and recognized. Crisp once accidentally double-charged my debit card for a meal: Not only did they credit my card, they gave me my next meal for free.On several occasions, I've gotten 4 chicken strips when my order calls for 3.Oh, and seriously, these guys listen to the coolest music of any establishment in the neighborhood.Keep it up, Crisp. And, since I'm not going to work in Lakeview forever, I think you should think about opening a second location... about four miles west of the original.
