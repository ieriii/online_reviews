This gets two stars because the food is incredible. Based on food alone, it would get easily a 4 star rating from me, yet the service was so mind-blowingly awful that I will never return. The snarky waitress rolled her eyes at my friend more than once and was very rude to each of us. She took our orders, brought us said orders, then seemed like she was being tortured to do anything else. Then when the bill came it was not split as we had originally asked and we had to find a different waitress to split our tabs apart (one couple had two bottles of wine and I was certainly not paying for that). The amounts were split properly but the "automatic gratuity" was split evenly, so I ended up paying $5.75 for my California roll (which again, was delicious) then $7.95 for a tip.... how does that make any sense? I just wish they were a bit more hospitable in every way. I just don't even want to come back, especially with a large group.
