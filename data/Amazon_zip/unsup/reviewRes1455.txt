On the surface, waiting almost 2 hours for a hot dog sounds like one of the dumbest ideas in the world, and I was hesitant at first to even try Hot Doug's. However, as a man that enjoys his processed meats, I knew I had to try what many have called the finest. The day I went, it was well below freezing. After about an hour, I could not feel my toes, and I was pretty sure that I would lose one by the end of the day. Even with the pain of being freezing cold, it was still one of the best dining experiences ever.  To make it worth the wait, I ordered three items, the boar sausage with pesto, the corn dog, and the duck fat fries. Each was absolutely delicious. The duck fat fries take decadence to a new level. Those perfectly seasoned confections melted in my mouth with each bite.  The corn dog was perfectly crisp with a nice sweet bite of flavor at the end. Mixed with the boar sausage packed with pesto goodness, I could blend the sensations of sweet and savory to take hot dog dining to a place I never knew existed. Even if I had to wait 4 hours, I would go back again and again. Hot Doug's is an experience that should not be missed by anyone that ever visits Chicago.
