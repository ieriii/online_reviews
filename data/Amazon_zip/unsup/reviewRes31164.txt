The food at Chicago Diner is overpriced - even for vegetarian and vegan fare, predictable, and mediocre. That said, the food is very palatable, and while I've never had a dish I thought was terrible, I've also never had a dish I thought was absolutely delightful. I have only eaten there a handful of times over the past few years, and I'm never turned off enough to never return, but I'm never impressed enough to make the trip of my on volition. Ironically, given the typical Wrigleyville douchebag locale, the Chicago Diner is staffed by apparently lost hipsters. They provide solid service and are generally physically attractive and very well-groomed in disheveled art school chic.
