I went to Carnivale for my birthday. To start, we shared the halibut cevice as an app which was delicious. I ordered the Arrachera and could not get enough of it - I cleaned the plate off it was soo tasty. My friend ordered a mixed fish dish (I cant remember what it was exactly) and it was good. We shared some mixed drinks, they were ok, fun to try, and then had dessert on the house. We had the huge ice cream cake but it was a little disappointing - I was expecting a lot more flavors based on the description in the menu. Overall I would recommend this place and would go back myself! Enjoy.
