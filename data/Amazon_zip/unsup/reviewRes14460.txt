Everything on the menu is great. From breakfast, to sandwiches, to seafood, everything tastes delicious. BF even loved the meatloaf sandwich. Their first catch special is a great deal. Soup, salad and choice of fish for $13.99 can't be beat. The all you can eat crab legs on Tuesday are also wonderful. If you are going for breakfast or brunch on the weekends, go early or be prepared to wait.
