Typically these days, I don't wait for anything. Screw waiting in a line for a club. Stopped by on a Friday evening, made to wait maybe fifteen minutes, for an area. Due to all the awesome reviews, decided to wait. Bouncer got us in sooner with a few seats at the bar.  Real cool look. Just a few curtains, expensive looking tall back chairs, Victorian-esque bar. Its different and works.  Dude it is... DARK. It gets darker the longer your there. As the night moves on. Maybe it adds to something. It definitely added to my sleepiness. That accompanied by the potent drinks. Surprisingly not very expensive. The act of the drink preparation and the display make the whole experience much cooler. Check out the ice cubes. Their drink menu changes upon season, so, check out these concoctions while its still available. Its a chill lounge. Your coming more for the drink, the atmosphere and the overall cool. Good for a hot date and trying to get the moment to...  or meeting some select friends.
