I've been twice now as i live around the corner, and twice i've been dissappointed. Good service, though without a smile. The "Banana Heath Bar Pancakes with Praline Syrup" was a huge dissapointment. No praline or Heath flavor. The Reuben was okay. Good coffee; I'm waiting for the food to have as much flavor.
