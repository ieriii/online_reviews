I have driven by the Art of Pizza about a zillion times but didn't realize what I was driving by. The pizza is amazing. Deep Dish Pizza at it's best. The crust is not thick and doughy. It's crisp, but still deep dish. You can order an entire pizza, which is reasonably priced, or just buy a slice. We ordered soup while we were waiting. It was only $2. Best deal in town. Since I live fairly close, I will definitely be back. It's so worth it. 5 star!! The staff is also very helpful and nice.
