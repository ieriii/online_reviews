went here on a Saturday night, and it wasn't too crowded at all...though i guess it was around 9:00. best fish n' chips I've ever eaten in my life...good thing, b/c they were also the most expensive, coming in at $17. Chef Dirk said he spent a lot of time on the tartar sauce...and it's the only tartar sauce I've not only been able to stomach, but actually wanted to lick out of the bowl. the kale was yummy, but could have used a little more garlic, and I would highly recommend the gage ginger fizz...
