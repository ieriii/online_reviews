although the space is cozy and the staff is welcoming, the food experience was good but not stellar... i had the gnocchi with pesto sauce and the butternut squash soup... i felt the pasta was too chewy, i like gnocchi that almost melts in your mouth... i should have ordered the pumpkin ravioli that everyone raves about... maybe next time, but with so many other wonderful choices for italian i'm not sure if i'll be inclined to visit again...
