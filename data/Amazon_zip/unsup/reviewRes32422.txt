Fantastic Ethiopian food in Chicago. Very clean and efficient service. The specials for lunch are a great deal. The Green Mile is across the street and its close to several theatres. I highly recommend. Saw several Ethiopians persons walking into the restaurant; so if they would eat here; it has to be decent right?
