If you're looking for a great place to take visitors, this is it. If you're looking for a unique and gourmet sausage emporium, this is it. If you love hot dogs and hot dog memorabilia, this is it. Don't let the line scare you. It doesn't really take too long to get through. I always order two and usually feel a little sick after from stuffing myself, but I think my family and my boyfriend would eat here every day if they could. Definitely a different and fun slice of Chicago that everyone should experience at least once. Also, Doug is a super nice guy and the rest of the service is always fast, courteous and great! Um, also, the tater tots are the best I've ever had, so get those along with your duck fat fries.
