I've been here a couple of times and every time is just awesome. Love the commitment to local ingredients and I love that you know which farms they're using in certain dishes. Their cocktails are DELICIOUS. Muddled fruit in an already tasty mojito is a good thing. Their Ropa Vieja is obscenely good. The Pernil (rum glazed pork shoulder) is the first thing I ever had there and it's killer. Most recently I had the Arrachera (grilled skirt steak) and it was the closest I've gotten to Cuban heaven since my meal in Miami's Little Havana. My uncle had the Arroz Con Mariscos (like a seafood pallela) and it was the best thing at the table that night which is saying a lot. I'd really love to go back and take advantage of their delicious looking meat and cheese plates. The desserts are pretty largely portioned and not that expensive comparatively so I would recommend splitting one or two per table if you'd like a little sweet treat. The most recent time I was there we split the churros which were good but not the best I've ever had. The space is large and vibrant. Very colorful decor. A little loud which was good because we brought my little 2.5 year old cousin with us and she loved it! She got up and danced to the salsa music and munched on chips and guacamole and some rice. Adorable! Might not be THE BEST place for all young kids but for this kid whose family loves to eat out it was perfect.
