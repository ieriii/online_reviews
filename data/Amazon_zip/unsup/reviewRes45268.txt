Anteprima is located in such a cute, little neighborhood with so much charm! We were able to find a non-metered parking spot right away. The restaurant has a cozy feel to it. . . a lot of smaller tables packed into the room. We started off with the highly recommended grilled octopus, which was to my liking. . . seasoned well without it being overwhelmingly chewy.   We also settled on getting one of their specials for the day as another appetizer. As for the entrees, I absolutely loved their bucatini. . . so light and fresh, using such simple ingredients. I can alone go back to the restaurant for this dish. Unfortunately, the pasta dish with prosciutto that I had ordered was simply just okay. . . it didn't really stand out to me.  All in all though, we enjoyed our experience here from the moment that we got seated right away with our reservations to having such an accommodating waiter who was attentive to our requests. What was even more delightful is their back patio, which was decorated nicely.
