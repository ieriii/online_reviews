Please RC, let people know when they make the rez that you are UNDER CONSTRUCTION. My friend had no idea why I raved so much about this place all the time when I took her here for dinner for her big bday. Steaks were wonderful, service was pretty great, our waitress was a real pro - but I was really distracted by the deconstructed dining area, color me frustrated.
