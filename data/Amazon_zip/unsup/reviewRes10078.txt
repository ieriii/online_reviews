I just read a review that said "I really don't get Piece at all. Bland, thin crust pizza....$35 for a medium size pizza and a salad. $5 for a miller lite bottle." If you're ordering Miller Lite in a bottle at Piece Brewery and Pizzeria, you wouldn't know taste if it hit you over the head. Piece rules. That reviewer drools!
