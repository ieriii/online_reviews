I visited with a friend on a Friday night a few weeks ago. I'd never had Costa Rican food and boy was I blown away! They have a very extensive menu and I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted. My friend was a pro, having visited dozens of times before, and ordered spinach and cheese empanadas, chicken tacos and horchata (all of which she graciously shared!). For myself, I ordered the casado with steak. The empanadas were gooey and delicious! The tacos were also quite tasty! As was the salsa they brought to the table while we waited- and a bit spicy! The horchata (rice water) was way too sweet for my taste. The casado was huge and very filling. Everything on the plate was done well! Irazu has a huge delivery area and very friendly staff, I will definitely be back!
