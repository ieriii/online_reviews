The bone marrow is exactly as I remember from my childhood- completely lacking in flavor. The side dish of salt is provided because it has to be - marrow is boring. The jamon slices were fine but a bit of bread or a few crackers would have made it seem a better value. But it was the $10 draft beer that made me decide to never return. I kept checking to see if I had been charged for two. Nope.  I was very amused by the two older couples next to me grousing about the long drive from the burbs. One of the men asked the server where the wine was from and was told "just outside of Rome". He said "Rome? That's Italy, right?" That sums this place up perfectly. I will say the decor is warm and my server was great. It's just not worth the money, and I spend money like a sailor on shore leave.
