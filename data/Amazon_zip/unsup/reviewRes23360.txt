I have been to this place twice already. The first time I had a salad that was pretty yummy. The second time I had the vegetarian burrito which was delicious. I only ate half of it because it was huge. My boyfriend loved the leftovers too! The only thing that is annoying about this place is that I had to pay cash. I had the oatmeal shake which was much smaller than the strawberry one that my friend had. I will definetly go back here and have the casados meal! a friend said it's delicious.
