We LOVED our evening at Carnivale. The waiter was friendly and helpful, the food was DELICIOUS and it is a festive atmosphere. We were mixed about the drinks - my husband's mojito was almost without liquor, but my "cavarita" (champagne margarita) was GREAT and unique. The only downside was ...the bill. It felt a LITTLE too expensive (like the drinks were $12 each when they weren't large (or generous) enough to qualify as a $12 drink. The entrees were $28 - including a paella type dish that was 40% RICE. Not worth $28. That said, it was all really tasty and a fun place, but just expensive enough to make us think twice about going for "regular" weekday meal.
