So my friend and I came across RJ's by accident as we were walking around looking for a place to grab a bite on my birthday. Once we walked in, we knew we made a good pick! I'm sure, not updated since it opened in 1977. The inside is decorated with an odd assortment of art and what I thought were unknown celebrity photos. As it turns out, the pictures were photos of all the help which has worked there since it opened. To add to the atmosphere, I think every song I heard was from the 80's. The staff was super nice and gave me this great desert for free when my friend mentioned to the waitress that it was my b-day! Finally, the food! They have a fair selection of dinner items including excellent chili. If you are looking for something healthy, they have a salad bar that is very elaborate. I highly recommend checking them out, even if it is only for their great desert or if you are in need to get your fix of 80's music!
