Look, I split my time between New York & Connecticut a.k.a the 2 top places for pizza in America (the third being California, but that's besides the point). So my opinion can also be regionally biased, whatever you choose to think. Plus I'm not in love with the idea of deep dish. I heard about this place as being number 1 for pizza in Chicago from several people and after enough suffering of Giordano's (I refuse to believe a chain is the best pizza, no way), I decided to trek out and try it. I hadn't eaten all day, it was late, I was pretty excited to finally get normal pizza even if it was deep dish. I waited awhile for my pizza in growing anticipation and even though it was burning in my mouth, I needed to eat something soon. But, where was the amazing pizza I heard about? Like Samantha B. stated in her review, I wasn't particularly loving it, it wasn't really much higher up than Giordano's. To counterpoint, my friend thought the pizza was really good, but she's also from another country where they don't really eat pizza. So yeah, it's a cute place but I felt rather cheated afterward.
