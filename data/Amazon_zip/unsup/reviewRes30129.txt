3.5 starsish? I love the modern vibe at sunda but I guess there are so many other places to try-- no rush in coming back given the price? I would def try to share all the entrees because the meat entrees just comes out with just meat so it's not well balanced unless you order other dishes. My favorites were the miso cod and braised short rib (sort of tastes like kalbijim) Roasted duck hash was a bit on the oily side. The crunchy pig hidden lobster roll was kinda texturally strange. Diverse menu so plenty of new things to try next time!
