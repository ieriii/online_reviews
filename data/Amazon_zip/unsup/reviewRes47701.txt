Ugh. Did NOT enjoy my meal, drinks are way overpriced and watery, they actually held you back from the roof deck, and were rude about it, made it seem like it was very VIP up there, but when we finally did go up, about three people. uh, wow, thanks, don't need the smoke and mirrors at this point fellas, really. If you are at fire code capacity on roof, fine. Different story. Beautiful decor, but less than beautiful attitudes, not a fan, which is sad, I looked forward to their opening since I live in the area and was excited for a new haunt.
