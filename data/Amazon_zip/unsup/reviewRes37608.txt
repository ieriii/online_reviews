Absolutely delightful experience. Fox & Obel really reminds me of the little gourmet shops jn New York, except without the crowds. The merchandise was all very thoughtfully and compellingly laid out, and it's full of unusual things that brought to memory all those recipe books I don't use ("Oooh, that's what French dragees are"). I would definitely love to come back here again, except it is about twenty five gazillion miles away from an El station. I did finally because I bought a Groupon, and I have to say that that was about the most pleasant Groupon-redeeming experience I've had to date. (If the owners are reading this, please please please do that again!)
