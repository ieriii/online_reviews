Torn, thats how I feel. On the one hand, the beer selection is astonishing. On the other, the food is mostly lousy, with the exception of the CB&J. The thing I dislike the most, and its not their fault, exactly, is how busy the place is, and how long a wait it is to get a seat, ever. Like Yogi Berra said "nobody goes there anymore, its too crowded." So my recommendation is to go some time when they aren't too busy (yeah, I know, they're always busy). I think they're expanding into the adjoining place, so maybe things will go a bit more smoothly once that goes down, and they'll be able to run they place properly. Cos right now, its a goddamn mosh pit in there. Not a fun environment, unless you're into that sort of thing. I'm not. But if you can manage to get a table, at which point you're golden, good on ya. No reservations, and they won't seat you if your whole party isn't there, and other nasty triage-type restrictions which I understand, due to how ridiculously busy they are, but that's unwelcoming and not cool in my book. Maybe just go when they first open up for the day. Of course, the dining area isn't even open at that point. Well, whatever. Unless you wanted a CB&J (Elvis food, I call it), you're better off just drinking Belgian beers and getting outta there before it becomes a fire hazard.
