This place was so delicious! I went there on a Monday night, so getting a table was easy! I had a specialty drink which was delicious, and my two friends enjoyed theirs as well. I dont normally eat my entire plate clean - but this time i couldn't help myself. Don't worry the guilt was soon to follow. I'm sure if you dig through the menu you can find a healthy choice...however, this place is full of yummy comfort food (and drinks) to make you feel better. Perfect for a stormy night!
