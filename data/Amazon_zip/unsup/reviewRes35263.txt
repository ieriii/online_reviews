I'm not the fishiest girl in the world but I will say this, I have been to Shaw's countless times (can you say Lettuce Goldcard) and have never been let down. The staff is clearly well trained and has made some recommendations on wine that have blown my mind. Crab cakes. Lets talk. I adore them in general but I really love theirs. I know that my frequent dining companion is always amazed by the variety of oysters and blown away by the quality (can't eat them, sorry!) and the lobster. The market priced lobster is orgasmic but if you just want a little forplay, they often have the frozen lobster deal for like 20 something bucks that includes boiled potatoes and corn. The New England Lobster Boil or something like that. Really good considering the price. And don't forget the key lime pie...tart of all tarts with a glorious graham cracker crust. My only problem with Shaw's is the sometimes mysterious wait times. I understand more than the next guy about not rushing people and juggling the book but to make me wait 45 minutes past a reservation and not disclosing the delay is irritating. I would have ordered a bottle of wine at the bar instead of a glass. And don't seat the tourists that were walk ins before me because they look like whales (in the wallet sense of the word).  Seat me because I have a reservation and I live here and am more likely to dine at your restaurant before the next housewares show. My only complaint. Sad but true.
