Almost everyday since owners posted sign "Cafe 90 Miles Coming Soon" I used drive by this place and drool in anticipation. The beautiful wall murals developed over few weeks, breathed- in festive color into this half gentrified hood. During one of my late evening strolls I spotted some lights and men inside. Being curious cat I am, I approached the window and tried to peep inside. The owner, (handsome) Latin guy noticed my silhouette lurking outside. He came out right away and greeted me. I, in the first place, totally taken aback by his cheerful invitation to my slight embarassment for my unsuccessful exploits and my overall appearance (no makeup, baggy attire), stood stuttering some obscure facts about my uncle who supposedly was raised and lived in Cuba. I entered. The interior walls were covered with Castro era newspaper and magazine clips. Couple of old men, perhaps Cuban, gave couple of sezing looks on my potentials of becoming their customer. The owner chatted lil bit about origins of his establishment and handed me their menu. I mumbled something again and bowed out. Veggie empanadas are the best, chicken sandwich rocks as well as the Cuban one. I am yet to try their dinner menu but I am sure they are as good as their sandwiches. They have nice backdoor patio. It is byob, good for group and inexpensice eat outs.
