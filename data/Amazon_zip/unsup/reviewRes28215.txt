By far the best deep dish. The crust is delicious and the burnt cheese on the crust is mind-blowing. A sausage deep-dish from here can turn any day around. It's a little out of the way for out-of-towners but way more worth the trip than going to Giordano's or Lou Malnatti's if you're visiting Chicago.
