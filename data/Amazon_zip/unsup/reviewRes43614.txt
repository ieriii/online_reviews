So my fiance and I called Milk & Honey at about 9:30 on a Sunday to see if there was a wait for 4- expecting some hour long BS or more, I was shocked to hear "no wait." Since we had a car that day we zipped on over, parked easily and got right in- we just beat the rush. I had the famed granola with yogurt and fruit. It is just as delicious as I hoped, I'm not typically one to order a granola breakfast but was very happy. I did have to have a side of bacon too :) I was eyeing the croissants and definitely want to try one of those next time- they appeared to be that perfect balance of crispy/chewy/golden. YUM! Definitely want to go back to try a few other things.
