Great food and location (next to the brown line station and street parking is plenty around there). But the thing that turned me away was their very poor service. Most of the waitress there didn't seem to show some appreciation to the customer (simple gestures was badly lacked in this place). When I got there (and this happen quite often), I always have to literally search around the building to find the waiter to seat me and my friends. All in all, a great place to have dinner during the weekend (especially during festivals like Oktoberfest and Applefest), but just be ready for a very unfriendly service by their waiter/waitress.
