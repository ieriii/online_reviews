A touch over-rated, but very glad that Bi-bim-bop is closer than far north side. I don't think the wings are all that fabulous, but everyone else seems to think that way, so who am I to disagree? Oh yea, that's is the whole point of the review. The burrito thing is decent, didn't really like the hot wings, the Asian BBQ flavor wings are my favorite and the Buddha bowls are very good
