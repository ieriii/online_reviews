Very good- my girlfriend got a vegetarian stew and I got the lamb kebabs. Not the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had but it was still very good and the restaurant had a very comfortable atmosphere to it. We'll probably come back- the only hesitation being that there's so many great Middle Eastern restaurants in Albany Park.
