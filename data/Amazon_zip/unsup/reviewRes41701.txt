The best thing about this restaurant is that you can bring your wine for $5 a bottle corkage fee. But, in truth, the menu was not very wine friendly. First course included olives and a spicy quail egg. Second course a soup. Third course a scallop with shredded asparagus, a certain wine killer. We had to ask for bread to cleanse our palates and he glassware was the cheapest available. What saved the evening, food and wine pairing-wise, was the quail stuffed with rabbit which was a terrific on its own and a great match with our Grand and Premier Cru red Burgundies. The service was quite indifferent to the point of being unfriendly And, of the course, the clientele was dressed to kill in their torn blue jeans and shorts, adding to the joy of this dining experience. With the taxi ride from downtown, the tab for evening surpassed $200 a couple. If you want to experience Bonsoiree you might want to do so soon. The restaurant was only about half-full on a Saturday night which seems not to bode well for its future.
