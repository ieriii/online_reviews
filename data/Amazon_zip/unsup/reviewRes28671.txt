Think thick crust with a layer of cheese, toppings, and sauce on top. This is not like a Lou's or Uno's, but something a little different. Great crust. I read about the caramelized crust edges and I immediately became a fan. We went early on a Saturday and were ushered up stairs. The upstairs had all of the young families and was a bit loud with the kids running around. I wish this place delivered to me.
