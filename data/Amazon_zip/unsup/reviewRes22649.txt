I am a convert. A Costa Rican food convert. Not sure what I am converting from--a Mexican food lover maybe.... Anyway, the moral of that blabber is that my first Costa Rican experience was bliss and had me running back for more--Already twice this week. So much for keeping the scale steady during the holidays. Wait, don't Costa Rican people have bangin bodies? Alright then, moving on... Oatmeal shake. Bloats the belly yet soothes the soul. Empanadas: Plantain, Chicken, Beef and Potato and Cheese... all good, but listed in order of blissfulness. Chips and Guac: Good, but i would skip it next time. TOO MUCH GOOD STUFF! Steak and Chicken Casada to share. These 2 meals are easily 4. Or 4AM leftovers, whichever. Costa Rican Rice, Sweet plantains, juicy and perfectly seasoned meat.... It is a good plate of great food. I ordered tortillas the first time, thinking I would eat the food like fajitas. That was completely unnecessary. Silly Costa Rican Virgin. Friendly staff, easy to-go or delivery ordering process (online). I have the oatmeal shakes just thinking about it.
