I really wanted to like this place, but it was.....eh. We went on a Monday for lunch and it was quite busy. After we got a table, it took over 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us, which was pretty disappointing. I ordered a Bloody Mary, which came with nothing but a slice of lemon. Not even celery or a pickle. Sad. My grilled salad was more charred than grilled. It was just okay. Nothing special. My husband's sandwich was good, but again, nothing special. The decor was pretty sparse. The gray paint on the walls reminded me of a janitor's room. Very blah and institutional.
