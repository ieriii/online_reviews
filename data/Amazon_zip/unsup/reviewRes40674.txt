I've gone in here twice. Both times unsatisfied. It's sooooo busy that its not worth going into. And if its aweoommmmmmeeee like Hot Doug's is for hot dogs awesome.... then maybe its worth the wait. But to be honest, the pho here is not even noteworthy. They have definitely the most visible location, but you're best off just opening your eyes and walking in ANY direction and i'm sure you'll find a better Pho joint.
