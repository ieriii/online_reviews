I've been coming here since I was a student at UIC - i.e. much longer than I care to admit. There are many choices in Greek town, and every Chicagoan seems to have their favorite. For my money, Greek Islands simply has the best food.  My favorite option is to 'make your own combo'. Can't decide on gyros or spanakopita? Choose both - they give you the option of getting two or more half orders (at just marginally more than half the full order price). The kiddies can get a single half order. The absolute best tsadziki in town.  For the uninitiated, be daring and get a bottle of Roditys - the traditional greek wine which is not white but not exactly red either and tastes a bit like Kool Aid at first, but by the time you get to the bottom of the bottle (at a whopping price of about 18 bucks) it tastes just fine. And the valet guys, most of whom have been here for 20+ years are lovely guys - they never ever fail to open my (passenger) door. Tip well. They deserve it and you are still out ahead since valet is free.
