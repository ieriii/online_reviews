Absolutely unbelievable. Better food, better atmosphere than Charlie Trotter's. We are still in awes of the entire menu, but especially the black truffle explosion and the presentation of the two desserts. I do not understand how anyone can give Alinea less than 5 stars... PS - My husband did the wine pairing and I just ordered by the glass. Some of the pairings were suberb, but I do not know if I can justify the overall cost of the wine pairings. I ordered by the glass and was satisfied with the recommendations of our sommelier.
