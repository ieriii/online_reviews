My significant other and I ate here yesterday and we really liked it. The steaks were very good, much better than some on Rush st. The plates were a little too hot though, its like they gave us skillets! But maybe thats how its suppose to be! Anyways I had to comment. Definitely rec. this place for good eats and we loved the tower of liquor bottles.  -See ya
