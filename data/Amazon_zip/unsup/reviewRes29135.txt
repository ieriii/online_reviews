I love this place! They are very fast to serve and it's a BYOB what more can you ask for? Had the fish cakes and chicken satay for appetizer, they were very good. I had the Pork green curry sauce and asked for hot and it was just right. My husband had the duck red curry, which was a little sweet for my taste and was not spicy probebly because there was pineapples in it. Both dishes were very flavorful though. My daughter had the soup, can't remember the name but it had lemon grass flavor and it was very good also. All in all I like this place and would def go back. The service is great! Next time I'd like to be more adventurous and tell them to make it super spicy.
