Agree with Nancy and some of the others. The food was just ok. This is a classic, old-school Italian family restaurant. It was readily apparent there were customers there who had been coming of years / decades, and the wait-staff knew them well! It's like a comfortable old pair of shoes.  Service was very friendly, and quick. The decor had not been touched in DECADES!  So, if you want to slip on an old pair of shoes for comfort-Italian food, this is the spot.
