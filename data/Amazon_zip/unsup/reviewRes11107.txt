This is restaurant ranks as my definitive favorite in Chicago. The atmosphere is lively but avoids the typical douchebag crowd of many other mainstream bar/restaurants. They have plenty of tv's but don't feel like a sports bar, tons of space for large groups (I had a birthday party here that went off perfectly), and most importantly, the pizza and beer are among the best in the city.  Try a white pizza with chicken, spinach, garlic and sauteed mushrooms, or a red pizza with Italian sausage, bbq sauce, bacon, and green peppers. Their Dysfunctionale and Worryin Ale are an excellent addition to any pizza.  Saturday live band karaoke is always entertaining, but it can get a little too loud for anyone having intense conversations. This is also an ideal restaurant option for anyone hosting guests in Chicago, either young or old.
