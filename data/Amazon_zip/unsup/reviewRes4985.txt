Damn, well, just wow. Vegans be damned (you know who you are!). This was my first time here, and despite the mixed the reviews I'd heard from friends, I was highly impressed.  First off, the service was excellent, we were treated very well, our waiter kept us entertained and informed. We were also moved to a better location before we'd even asked (we sat outside and the wind was whipping the tent flaps just behind us very noisily). So props to them for making sure the customers were happy. For the food, we had a lot of swine (and some tuna), and all of it was excellent (except of course for the bit with the onions on top, I opted out of that bit...). The menu didn't mention onions, and I didn't ask for no onions, so this is a minor faux paus on my part.  Still, all in all, for a quick stop for dinner after St. Patty's day, not a bad place to stop, and enjoy some decadence. I'll definitely go back.
