I love these types of restaurants! Fancy-Shmancy restaurants are great! I did the 12 or 18 course tour with wine pairings as opposed to the 24 course tour. I wish I had done the 24.  My initial thought was that the decor was phenomenal, very classic contemporary and clean! The hostesses were nice an pleasant, our server was professional. Our sommelier was hung over and lacked sleep and it was obvious. Kind of a spikey-haired club guy but knowledgeable and the pairings were great.  Then the food started coming out and everything was (literally) mini-bite sized or amuse bouche sized. I thought they would get bigger as the courses kept coming, perhaps has we got to the savories, but nope, never. I believe one course was simply an "essence" and nothing to eat.  Everything was very cleverly presented and beautifully plated. I loved the various explosions of flavor and textures. Delicious for sure BUT I truly wish there had been more substance in at least ONE course.  I have eaten at Tru, Trotters & Moto and I think they're all great Alinea was also great but if I could change one thing, I would make the savories a little bigger. Otherwise, I would strongly suggest the 24 course tour - if you want to be full that is the way to go.
