The ONLY reason I ended up here is because I had an awesome coupon from http://restaurant.com...now that the coupon has been used, I shan't be returning. Maybe it's because we got there early, but the place smelled like dirty dishrags. The food was decent and the place was clean, but the clientele seemed to be a full of Wrigleyville transplants. It's a total douchebag sports bar. I often walked by on my way to the cheaper bars (did I mention the $8 tumbler of Stella I bought here?) and, while I knew immediately that this place was not designed to attract people like me, I figured I'd end up there at some point. Well, I did. I came. I saw. I left with a big bar tab. I will likely never return.
