I am not a breakfast or brunch kind of girl. However, for my friends I will wake-up early on a Saturday. Mostly for friends who are leaving the country. Didn't have to wait in line at all!! Our waiter was nice and the food was great. I hate salt on my food and I think they add to much salt to their dishes, but I am biased against salt. With that being said, I will recommend Yolk to anyone as a great brunch spot!
