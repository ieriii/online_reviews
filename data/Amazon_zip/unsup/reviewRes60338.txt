Good enough for a neighborhood sushi place. Most likely I'll try to reserve Wakamono for take-out going forward given the attitude of the "host" on duty last Friday night when I went with friends.  It may be helpful for the manager to look up the word "host" before placing a rigid, stern unwelcoming, unsmiling miserable employee at the host stand. To top it off, after waiting 50 minutes in the bar, we had to ask about our table which was evidently ready 5 minutes prior. Really? Oh, and if customers come up and ask if there is place to hang a coat and you're the "host" doing absolutely nothing, take the coat and hang it up. If you've tried their sister restaurant across the street, Ping Pong, you know what a bad host looks like. C'mon people, it's called a service industry for a reason.
