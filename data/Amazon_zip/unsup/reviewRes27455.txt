Come'on it's Frontera, how bad can it get? Recently, I tried the duck special and my fiance had the pork loin. The duck was VERY succulent, complemented by an excellent, Bayless-style mole. But the pork loin was dry, we wrapped it up to go and my fiance ended up making it into a sandwich the next day. Overall, Frontera is Frontera. But if you want really good, authentic Mexican food head over to Pilsen. Nuevo Leon will show up Rick Bayless any day.
