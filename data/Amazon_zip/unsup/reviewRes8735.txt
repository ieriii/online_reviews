Been going to this place since before I can recall. We've seen this place grow from a small, unassuming Persian restaurant to the restaurant it is today. Their combo dishes are great, especially the steak and shrimp, and the Braised Lamb Shank is ridiculously good. The service has always been great, and the owner has always been very welcoming to our family. I believe the restaurant is family-owned, so it definitely has a very warm, welcoming feeling- almost like you stepped into their dining room. Highly recommend this place!
