Now I understand what all of the hype is about. A no frills Ma and Pa restaurant where you can get away with dinner for two for less than $15, a free appetizer (in addition to chips, two kinds of salsa and escabeche) and BYOB? Oh and a plate of limes (not like 2 or even 4, ten limes!) That's my kind of restaurant. I love the fact that the gentrification of the area hasn't driven up prices. My friend and I ordered the Combinacion (tostada, gound beef taco, enchilada, tamale) and Taco (three to choose) platters. Easily the Combinacion platter would be at least $12 at Lalo's. Both platters were $6 each. Everything was delicious but the gem of them all was the Carne Asada taco. I haven't had as flavorful and seasoned steak in a taco until Nuevo Leon. The place is legit! (Oh btw, the place is cash only.)
