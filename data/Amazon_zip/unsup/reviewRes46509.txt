I had the opportunity to dine with some friends at RJ Grunts. I was pretty stoked to try it out as it is the original Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant. The service was impeccable but I really didn't find anything special about the place in general. The food was fine, the atmosphere fine...but it wasn't a place where I would hangout and socialize after a meal.
