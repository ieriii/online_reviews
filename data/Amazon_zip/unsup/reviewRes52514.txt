Can I give this place zero stars? All the meat was extremely fatty. Also, when I asked for medium done meat half the time the meat I received was very very rare. Then when I said I was done the waiter yelled at me for leaving food on my plate...yeah because it was gross! We used a buy one get one coupon and the bill was still ridiculous. The server also added gratuity on which I thought was rude seeing as though there were only two of us and he treated us like shit. The only good things were the salad bar, the grilled pineapple and the rolls but I don't think its worth the price. Never again. (My boyfriend was really sick the next day too..disgusting )
