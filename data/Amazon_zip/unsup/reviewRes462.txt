You have to understand, I'm not a pretentious foodie, but I can appreciate the flair and visual appeal of a meal. Honestly, I wasn't a fan. The courses were small and lacking in diversity. Too much time spent on presentation. I left still hungry. My recommendation would be to head down a few blocks to Charlier Trotters or give TRU a shot.
