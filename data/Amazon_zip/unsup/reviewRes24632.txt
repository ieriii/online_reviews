The food was amazing! went for lunch with my wife and ordered 2 appetizers and 3 entrees.  I didn't expect to eat everything, but was really interested in trying several menu items. I must say that i was really disappointed with the portions that were given. I don't mind paying a lot of money for a great meal, but when you order a scallop entree and get 2 scallops at $17 its a bit pricey.
