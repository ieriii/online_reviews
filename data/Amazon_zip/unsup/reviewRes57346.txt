I've always had a lovely experience at Coast, and this weekend I tried carry out for the first time from there. It was an excellent experience!! I called on a Friday evening at 7:30 pm. The person that answered was friendly, reliable, and efficient although it sounded very busy in the background. When I went to pick up my food the place was packed with about 50 people waiting for a table. This added to my delight as the customer service did not fail no matter how busy they were. And yes, the sushi was delicious.
