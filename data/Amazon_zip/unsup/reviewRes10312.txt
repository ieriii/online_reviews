My old man and I came here just for the beer. We got a sampler ($2 each) of every beer on the board. A couple of them were good, but overall they were nothing great. We sat at the bar, and it wasn't busy at all. There were maybe three other people at the bar, and four or five tables with people at them. Once we finished the beer, it took a good 40 minutes to get the bar tender's attention so we could cash out. I don't even know how that can be possible, I don't think I'd be able to avoid someone in that close of quarters for that long if I got a prize for it. Plus, she must have noticed we were finished a looong time ago - she didn't want to check if we wanted to order something else? I was going to get a pizza to go since everyone said it was so amazing, but after we were ignored for the first 20 minutes, I decided not to give this place any more moola. Would not recommend, will not be back.
