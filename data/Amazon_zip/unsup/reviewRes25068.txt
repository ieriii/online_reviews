This is the first time I try Costa Rican food, and I am grateful to the guy that chose this place!! A group of friends and I went here for dinner on Saturday night. And it was an excellent choice. The staff is great and the outdoor seating is so comfortable. Perfect summer night dinner.. It was a little chilly for the girls, so they even brought out a heater to keep the table warm. Ha! Their food tastes homemade. So good. Their Ceviche was amazing. I had the Casado, the rib eye steak. So juicy. Everyone else loved their food. With, like, one exception. The chicharron wasnt too good, not for my taste anyway. But everything else, Delicious! Its BYOB.. Which I actually think is so much more convenient. More booze, for less cash.... And last but not least, the pricing is extremely moderate! Cheap, amazing food. What more can I ask for? I will definitely be here this summer... No questions asked.
