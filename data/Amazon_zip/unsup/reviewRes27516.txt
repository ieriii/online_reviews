This is a Chicago Deep Dish lovers heaven. This is my favorite place to take friends from out of town because it's so unique and delicious! Nothing can beat Pequod's charred crust with the overflowing layer of toasted cheese. If you're one to save your carbs for only worthwhile foods, this is the place to eat your heart out!
