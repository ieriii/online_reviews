I went to Sunda recently with some girlfriends. Got a res through http://Opentable.com and was seated right away when we arrived. The atmosphere is very loud and energized which reflects the decor. There are many sections of seating options to the restaurant. I think if you don't have a res on Friday or Sat, you might not get in. The Food Highlights: Duck with Steamed Bao Buns - Absolutely delicious! Definitely reminds me of Dim Sum Rock Shrimp Tempura - Brings me back to my childhood. I loved this dish when I was a child, but haven't ordered it in a looonng time. YUM!! Baked Seafood Dynamite - So good that we kept re-ordering this roll! Lobster and Wagyu Roll - Does this dish even need commenting?? (and others that I can't remember...) We were too full for desert, but had a fabulous time regardless. I'll definitely be back for more Food Buddha!!!
