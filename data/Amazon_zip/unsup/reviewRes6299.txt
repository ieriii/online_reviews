We went here for my husband's birthday, and I definitely wish we'd gone somewhere else. It was a busy Saturday night, and we were seated in one of the dining rooms... along with a bachelorette party and a large, rowdy birthday party. We couldn't even hear ourselves think and would have paid for a better table but weren't even given the choice to wait longer for one.  The food was mediocre. I've had better steaks at any given chain - Outback, Logan's, etc., for half the money and received twice the food. The filet was cooked as ordered, but was tough and dry. The mashed potatoes tasted okay, but were kind of soupy and cold. The waiter must have known we wouldn't want to stick around, as he brought the check without even asking us if we wanted dessert or more drinks. Definitely a huge disappointment.
