Ate here today for lunch with the kids and it was great. Everything was fresh and very tasty. The idea of "have you ever eaten in a closet" is a bit of an exaggeration, in my opinion. The Palmito salad was great, oatmeal shake was super good and the rice and chicken entree was really good. It was a bit overpriced.
