Despite the fact that I interviewed here and didn't ever hear back (although I think it has to do with some extracurriculars not on my CV- such as hanging around 4am bars) Longman & Eagle is pretty much exactly what I'd want to do if I opened up a place. Only I wouldn't put so much balsamic on the olives. For real though, awesome menu that does a superb job mixing the accessible with the adventurous, great service, stunning interior, and encouraging ladies to have whiskey with dessert should be a much more wide spread practice. I do however wish they would take at least a limited numbers of reservations. Servers know how to turn tables--but I think people feel entitled to sit around after having finished a meal in direct correlation to how long they waited.
