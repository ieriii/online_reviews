Just got back from a Cinco de Mayo dinner at XOCO and it was fantastic. I agree with the reviews about the system being confusing but it wasn't a big enough deal to subtract from the experience. We had the chips and guac(ok portions for the price), chorizo torta and mushroom torta. Both were excellent. The churros and Aztec hot chocolate were seriously phenomenal!! The service was also friendly and helpful. The host gave us a cookie because our dessert was a little slow coming out. All around fun experience, great food and friendly staff.
