Came in here with a friend for a coffee and pastries. Loved it! I had a hot frapp and we shared a Valrhona chocolate mousse and a lemon tart. They were all really good, but I've since been dreaming about the Valrhona. It's a perfect ratio of milk chocolate mousse and dark chocolate mousse on top of a thin layer of cake and all covered in chocolate ganache. Absolutely delicious. The only complaint is the waitress cleared the plate before I could lick the wrapper! Haha. Thankfully, parking is not easy around there or I'd go all the time and over do it. The atmosphere is cute, really relaxed and the waitstaff was really friendly. They were attentive enough, but let us casually sit there for hours, refilling our glasses.
