I liked this place. Service was pretty good, food was excellent and the atmosphere inside is great. Be warned that you will get weekly emails from them if you sign up for their mailing list. They do send good deals and coupons all the time though. Would go more often but it is a bit of a hike from the South Loop. RrL
