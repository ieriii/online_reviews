I've gone here a couple of times, and the first time thought it was a solid four stars. The bf and I came back here last Sunday, and were so excited! The avocado crostini is fantastic!!! YUM. We also got the salad with goat cheese and berries. Too good. I seriously couldn't wait for the butternut squash and was so underwhelmed when it got there. I don't know if it was an off night or what....but I was bummed. It didn't taste fully cooked or something, blah. The boy got lobster ravioli and was having regrets on not just getting the ribs. Tiramisu is one of my FAV desserts, and I wasn't exactly blown away. I have the say the service is outstanding, but I think I'll be up for trying other places.
