Rude horrible diners. As a NYer visiting, this place left a bad taste in my mouth. I wish i can choose to give it no stars. The food was over the top; the bone marrow that everyone spoke about was so fatty it almost made me hurl. And I am no stranger to bone marrow. And the diners were so rude and kept stealing seats. If you're going to do that, at least have some taste in food.
