I kind of like deep dish pizza. Kind of. And The Art of Pizza is just as comparable to Lou's, Pequads, Uno, Giordano's or Gino's, if you can ignore those little differences that seem to be a big deal to everyone except me. They get 4 stars because they consistently deliver a hot, cheesy pizza with loads of toppings. The crust is good and the appetizers and salads are always delicious. Definitely worth trying.
