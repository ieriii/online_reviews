I'm an out of towner so I had no previous knowledge of this bar until I went there. There was a line even though it was kind of early on a saturday (8ish), and we stuck it out even though I would normally just move on. They had a lot of house rules, which weren't a bad thing, I liked the exclusivity concept, but once inside the place kind of lost that feeling for me. Visually, it is pretty cool, high ceilings, highback chairs, low lights and everything in a calming blue, but once you got over that the place wasn't much for entertainment. If you wanted to impress a date it would be great and force you to converse with each other because the set-up prevents mingling with other guests, but if you really wanted to sit and relax with a few friends you'd be better off getting a bottle of wine somewhere quieter and more comfortable.  Since they were busy they didn't have enough chairs for our group (apparently you can't stand and drink either) so I was stuck sitting on a foot stool which definately put me on the "low social status level" for this particular bar,. After one drink we moved on just because we were a bit bored.  Its worth a look, but definately not the most enjoyable or best bar I've ever been in. It wasn't even the best that night!
