I feel there should be a cap on how many reviews an establishment can get, as the "me too"s get a little old. And with that in mind... ME TOO! Had a company dinner at Fogo de Chao last Friday night. Dropped the boy off with my mom and made the trek downtown to get our meat on. And oh was it on. I'm not going to sit and harp on the quality of the meat, which was outstanding, or the service, which was equally outstanding. Instead I'll just say that if you're reading this review and are somehow on the fence about spending the money on a night at Fogo, you're wasting good meat-eating time. Get to Fogo, have a whole lotta food and then come back and add your own "Me Too" to this ever-growing pile of praise.
