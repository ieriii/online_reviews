I absolutely LOVE both the pizza and beer at Piece. When I had heard that those MTV kids (road rules or something like that) worked here, I scoffed initially. But, once I stepped inside of Piece for the first time and realized that it's a cool place, that initial thought subsided. Being from Connecticut, I like my pizza large and flat and have somewhat of an aversion to deep dish pizza as the norm.  So, Piece is perfect for my New Haven style pizza cravings. Apparently, the owners used to work at Pepe's and Sally's (respectively) and brought this delicious style of pizza out to Chicago. I love the pizza at Piece so much, I always order a large, because then I get left-overs for days afterwards. And I don't think I've heard of one person who says they don't like Piece. It's not deep dish, but it's darned good! I personally would recommend the red sauce over the New Haven style or white (although white is good for certain occasions), but the red has both mozzarella and parmesan, and ample sauce, so isn't quite as dry as the New Haven style. I've never actually tried any of the food other than pizza, so perhaps I gave it a 5-star rating a little too hastily... Plus, the micro-brewery is awesome. As many have mentioned, their beers have won awards and are fantastic. A fan of wheat ales myself, I love the Top-Heavy and the Dark and Curvy. In the summertime, Baron von Awesome is an excellent choice. Piece is additionally fun, because when you arrive and inevitably wait for a table, you also feel like you're at a somewhat trendy bar, when in reality, the majority of the patrons are waiting for a table like yourself. Come on a Thursday night and embarass yourself by singing along to karaoke at 9.
