I love this place. Easily my number 1 for the best Cuban food I've had in this country. My girlfriend and I have been here on several occasions and we are overwhelmed with how good the food is every time. We usually start out with a few appetizers, croquetas, yuca, and empanadas. But the Choripan is the real winner in the list, try it, you will not be mad especially if you're a chorizo fan. Their Lechon and Ropa Vieja are really good but their signature dish, Puerco Rotizado is absolutely UNREAL. The meat is extremely tender and the flavors really bring out the flavor of the pork without over powering the dish. I want to go back.
