Love Hot Doug's!!!  It's simple: Bring cash. Prepare for lines. Always check the specials. Be respectful of seating. Enjoy!!! This establishment is one of those rare experiences that's worth the trip and time. You will not be disappointed. I repeat, you WILL NOT be disappointed. We tried the following: The Frankie "Five Angels" Pentangeli Italian Sausage, The Elvis Polish Sausage (both with everything), The Sauternes Duck Sausage w/Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras mousse and Sel Gris, & The Blueberry-Infused Venison Sausage w/raspberry mustard.  Oh, and Duck Fat French Fries. Yes, my Law...YES! Did I mention that I LOVE Hot Doug's?? If you live in Chicago and haven't gone...go. If you visit Chicago, don't waste your time with Navy Pier...go to Hot Doug's and have a true Chicago experience.
