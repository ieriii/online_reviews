I went to some great places in Chicago...this was one of the best in all respects! I walked in to what looked like a neighborhood bar -- it was nice yet comfortable. The hostess greeted me promptly and took my reservation for dinner. Found a place at the bar and took a look at the drink menu. This place is heaven for whiskey fans! I ordered the Rye tasting menu...which had my new favorite -- Whistlepig Straight Rye 10 yr (exceptional). The bartender was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick...despite the fact the place was packed. The bar shines...but the food is where this place rises to the next level. As the reviews mention, the menu is split into appetizers, small plates and entrees. Honestly, I think getting a mix of small plates and appetizers followed by one entree to share is the best way to experience this restaurant. I had the Pretzel (smelled and tasted delicious), Artisanal Cheese Selection (nice selection), Grilled Berkshire pork cheek (very good), Tete du Cochon (Incredible!), Ricatta Gnuddi (would skip), and the Maple Braised Pork Shank entree (Simply perfect and highly recommended!). The service was friendly, prompt and impeccable. Over the course of dinner I also had a couple drinks - Manhattan and Old Fashioned. Great cocktails with top notch ingredients! For Dessert: Warm Gruyere Donuts and Roasted Chestnut Custard. Both were great. This place is a home run. Great bar, friendly service, exceptional food and fair prices. Recommended!
