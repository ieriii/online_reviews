Oh how it pains me to write this review. I love Carnivale's food and I've previously recommended it to everyone and touted it as one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. But last night the service was just so bad that I don't think I'll be doing that again. We had reservations for my mom's birthday for 8pm and arrived there at about 7:50. I checked us in at the hostess desk and was handed a buzzer thingie and was told, verbatim: "just give us a couple minutes to get your table together."  Ok, so I was already slightly annoyed because why the hell am I being handed a freaking buzzer like I'm at Chilis? But fine, I smile and say no problem and go back over to rest of my party. There was 7 of us, so I can understand that they may need to pull some tables together. That being said, there were about 6 tables of 4 in sight that had "reserved" markers on them. Tick tock.. tick tock.. now it's 8:15 and my dad goes back over to the counter to see what the heck is going on. He comes back and says, the hostess told me that they are running thirty minutes behind. Really? So, then, what.. she just lied when she said to give them a few minutes? *sigh*. tick tock... it's 8:40 when we finally get buzzed and led back to our table. The waitress came over pretty quickly after to take our drink order and appetizer order. This seemed promising since we were incredibly hungry by this point and at least would have something to eat while we waited. Well, that would have worked except that we were done eating our appetizers (they were brought by someone else) for about 20 minutes before she came back over to even take our dinner order. On top of that my brother hadn't even received his beverage. Things moved pretty slowly after that. Thank god the food was as fantastic as usual or the whole night would have sucked. Too bad they can't get their shit together to handle a Saturday night. If I wanted to stand in line for an overbooked seat that I thought I'd reserved I'd fly United.
