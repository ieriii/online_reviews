The house poutine was so salty, we could not finish it; that having been said, I had the antelope tartare and it was phenomenal. I was sad that I was only in town for a bit and therefore couldn't sample more of the menu, which contained a seductive array of delicious fare ranging from hiramasa to elk prepared with attractive flavor combinations. It was also great to sit outside, right across from the park, and lose myself in food and conversation; maybe that's making this review a bit biased, but I definitely recommend this place.
