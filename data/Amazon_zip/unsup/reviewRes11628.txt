I've long believed that M. Henry was the best brunch spot in the city, but that may have changed after my first trip to the Bongo Room in Wicker Park. Though my party arrived just before the 2 pm close time, they gladly seated us...and didn't rush us along too much. I had the breakfast sandwich--a croissant with eggs, bacon and Muenster cheese (my absolute favorite). Others in my group had the breakfast burrito and a sweet breakfast pancake. So very very delicious, and I've been dreaming about it ever since.
