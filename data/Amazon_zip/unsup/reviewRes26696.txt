This place has been on my must try list for well over a year now. I was more than delighted when my friend suggested it for dinner last night. Seeing as this is in his 'hood, I figured he knew best! So we grabbed a 6-pack of Modelo (BYOB) and off we went. The place was packed on a Thursday at 6:30! We grabbed a table right away and went to town. Looking back on it I probably shouldn't of given myself a free day on the diet in this place. We ordered carne asada and some type of spicy carne asada with an enchilada. Everything was ridiculously good! He did comment that the enchilada was nowhere near as good as his mothers, but I can't blame the place for that! The service was great after a somewhat slow start. Parking is super easy and you always know the place is good when you see at least 15 cops in the place eating! I'm just sad I had no room for coffee and flan. Next time!
