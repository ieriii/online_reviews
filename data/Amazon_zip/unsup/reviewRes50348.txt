We came here to watch the world series,, somehow we had the impression that it was a sports bar with good burgers -- which is exactly what we were in the mood for. when we got inside,, we realized its not really a sports bar. while the tvs show sports, over the speakers we had to listen to early 2000 rap and hip hop at top volume. downstairs you could hear the rowdy calls of drunk people acting crazy. huuuup. we had already committed,, so we were hoping that the burgers would make up for the terrible surroundings. while the burger was juicy, and cooked like we had asked ,, it is nothing like a burger from kumas. im not sure who though this would be an appropriate comparison -- but them me tell you, its nothing like an aaamazing burger from kumas. yes it was tasty but don't kid yourself. oh and did i mention that pints of 312 are $8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
