Went for lunch. completely over-indulged. we ordered the burger, the pork belly sandwich, and a salmon sandwich. all good, but rather greasy. I ordered a side of Mashed potatoes, not knowing that the sandwiches come with fries (doesn't say on the menu) but it would have been nice if the waitress would have mentioned this, especially after we ordered the confit fries. I totally get that we didn't order salads, but too greasy is just too greasy.
