I went back to Sapori for a second time after I received a handwritten note from the owner and a giftcard. I am sure everyone gets one but this was just too nice to pass up. The restaurant was crowded but this time we had a reservation. Unfortunately our table was by the bar/waiting area so it was pretty crowded. Without even complaining though the owner sent free glasses of pretty fantastic wine to our table! It made the night even better and the food was still delicious!
