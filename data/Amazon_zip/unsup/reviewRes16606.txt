I do so enjoy the Violet Hour. I've been coming here for quite some time, but just hadn't had the urge to Yelp it. I'm ready now. Firstly, I love the appropriate, slightly snobby insistence of no signs/traditional storefront windows outside. Those who know where the light is, open the door and step through the heavy, soft drapes into a very muted, initmate place. The darkness of the rooms are made further dramatic by the sweeping high-backed chairs that leave one feeling like a cross between Alice In Wonderland and Elvira. Maybe that's just me. I like the wide whiskey selections (on behalf of my whiskey-enjoying friend who does not Yelp, poor soul). I have only ever had one drink I didn't prefer from this place; and the reason I phrase it that way is because the drink was balanced/mixed perfectly; I just didn't like the flavors together. Many other people probably do. This is a very unique place to bring someone to have an intimate conversation and to deliciously, inobtrusively gawk at the trixie nodding off in the chair next to you. The drinks are so perfect if there's something off about them, it may very well just be that your mouth is wrong. And if you're not sure what you would like, simply reveal to the server your favorite drink or libation and he or she will make a suggestion which will most likely knock your chic, pretty shoes off. Definitely a staple in my, 'show my friends who's all cool and knows about the "secret" speakeasy spot' weekends...
