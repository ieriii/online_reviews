This place was recommended by a Pakistani acquaintance, and was a hit for us. The kababs (we tried the lamb cubes, ribeye, chicken, and koubideh or ground sirloin) were perfectly seasoned and delicious. Son also had the lamb shank, which was tender and delish. The dill rice that came with the kababs was a huge serving and also perfectly prepared. The dishes were very reasonable and in the $13 - $17 range, and portions were huge. We didn't like the kadig - crispy rice appetizer quite as much (the beef stew sauce was a little too tangy), but it was good to try. The single dining room was colorful and vibrant. It seemed about 75% of the clientele was Persian/middle eastern, and a telling endorsement of the authenticity/value of the place. There were always folks waiting outside to get in and we had about a 35 minute wait on a Sat evening.  We'll be back, as this Albany Park neighborhood also has a huge, diverse selection of good eats to bring us back.
