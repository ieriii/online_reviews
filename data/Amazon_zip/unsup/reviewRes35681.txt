Took my husband to Shaw's for his birthday. Now the only time I'd ever been here before was for a work function a few years ago, and I ordered the king crab legs. I wasn't really impressed - they were kinda scrawny. My husband had never been here before and we had L.E.Y giftcards to spend, so I figured I'd give it another shot. This time around was awesome. We had the shrimp cocktail as an app and they were so fresh, they popped in your mouth. My picky husband actually ate them they were that good. For an entre I had the grilled halibut and it was delicious. Nice grilled flavor, and it came surrounded by fresh peas - I'm pretty sure these peas were just shelled prior to cooking, they were so fresh. Hubby had the lobster tails and they were cooked to perfection. Ever had a lobster tail that wasn't cooked right? Gross. These were absolutely perfect. We shared the au gratin potatoes as a side. One word. Wow. Cheesy and creamy and smokey and gut-busting delicious. They comped us free dessert (for hubby's bday), which was very nice. We ordered the chocolate cake and they threw in the sampler which includes key lime pie, pecan pie, raspberry pie and creme brulee. Everything was very very good but if I could only order one thing, it would be the chocolate cake, no question. So overall we had a fantastic meal. I only gave 4 stars because for a place that should have awesome king crab...well...they should have awesome king crab, and I felt you could get better legs at Costco.
