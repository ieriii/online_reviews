Just go eat here without delay. This is the real thing. I'd been away from California for a long time, and on an eternal search for Mexican food. Bayless knows what he is doing. This was one of the few culinary experiences I'll never forget. Start with the seasonal margaritas, or any of the margaritas they offer. You can't go wrong with any of the menu selections. The best of Mexican food with the finest and freshest of ingredients. They don't take short cuts. To top it all off, the Frontera is cheaper than I'd usually expect for such quality.
