The last time I was supposed to go to Piece, they were doing construction on the street right in front of the restaurant. I was going to valet my car, so I pulled up front, and got my car stuck in a hole in the ground that was NOT blocked off by cones/horses/anything. I asked a few guys in line to help push my car out, and a homeless man nearby even lent a hand, so I slipped him a finski for his troubles (thanks dude!). AFTER I got my car un-stuck, we found out there was a two hour wait. Crap! Regardless, I have been there a few times and I really like the pizza. I might like the beer better, and the goofy names for the beers. I like beer. I like hangin out in the Pit, we were down there last year for a friend's birthday. It's good if you're friends are obnoxious, it's nice and secluded down there, so you can act like buffoons and no one notices.
