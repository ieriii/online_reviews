I can't believe it's not meat! Lovely sausage (?) and biscuits. Cool beer selection. Fancy, expensive and ultimately, a little disappointing Bloody Marys. (Think it was the weird organic vodka they use). Hipster waitress was good, not great. Laid back brunch crowd. Relaxing, small interior. Prices seemed reasonable.
