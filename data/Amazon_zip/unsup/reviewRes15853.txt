Two words. SUPER YUMMY. Linguini fruiti de mare was so succulent :)' The scallops, shrimp and mussels were the biggest I've seen, ever. The portions are huge and the bread baskets offers foccacia topped with a delicious tomato mix. I will definitely be back in a jiffy. Atmosphere was relaxed, yet appropriate; no incriminating white table cloths :)
