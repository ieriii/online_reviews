The Purple Pig was perfect for after-work drinks and snacks. We went promptly at 5 and it wasn't too crowded yet. We sat at the long, communal tables but had ours to ourselves. Our server brought us menus immediately and gave us time to peruse. As more of a beer drinker than wine drinker, I was a little disappointed at the drinks menu. Yes, I know their motto is "Cheese, Swine and Wine," which is perfectly okay. But, given that they did have some beer options, I was wondering where the American craft beers were. All of the limited beer options were European. I just think it's unfair to think only European beers can be paired with the fine cheeses and meats that they serve--surely they've heard of at least 3 Floyds and Goose Island who are local and make some very elevated, even "fancy" beers that pair great with finer dining. But, I digress. I did order an Italian wheat beer called Genziana that was satisfying and new to me. For food, we ordered the Pigs Ears, Salt Roasted Beets, and a plate of 3 cheeses--a pecorino, manchengo, and a soft-goat cheese that I forgot what it was called. The Pigs Ears were great and a new experience for me. They were nice and crispy, topped with a fried egg, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite toppings! The beets were delicious as well--sort of a ceviche topped with whipped goat cheese and pistachios. Very refreshing. And the cheese were of course great...I've really never met a cheese I didn't like. And they brought out more bread as needed, which was a plus. I would love to come back for dinner or maybe even another group outing where we could try even more of the small plates. I would love to add some cured meats to my next experience.
