Great place for a birthday, although we were seated about an hour after our reservation time (eek!). Started with home made chips and pickles (nom!). Each bowl of gnoshes was immediately replaced once finished. Cocktails came quick and were delicious. I had the ginger fizz, which resulted in a new obsession with dark & stormy cocktails. Pulled pork shoulder was insanely juicy and flavorful. Our server said it could be prepared as a plate or a sandwich-- choose sandwich because Q has amazing pretzel rolls. Sauce was brought out in four little pots and was a perfect way to sample and taste by the spoonful. Did I mention the MOUNTAIN of cole slaw? So good. Also ordered the mac and cheese and corn bread to share. We scraped the bowl clean of the rich, thick creamy and sharp mac & cheese. Corn bread was tasty too, but more of a side note to the serious entrees and sides. For dessert there was cheesecake, kentucky derby pie, carrot cake, brownie, bread pudding and it was insane-- It was a birthday afterall! The desserts definitely stood up to the entrees. The manager even brought out a round of bourbon to make up for our rough start with the long wait. Well done! Had a great time and will definitely go back.
