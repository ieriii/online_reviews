Well hello Big Jones, yes I WOULD like some free, hot beignets to share with my friends the moment I sit down. Why thank you. We also shared fried green tomatoes--Three Sisters Garden cornmeal breading, remoulade, pickled shrimp, green onions--and cracked pepper and goat cheese biscuits with rhubarb preserves. Mmm. And the mushroom and leek omelete was delish. You're relatively new in town, and you're pretty darn cute. I don't often share so soon in a relationship but first impressions are quite positive thus far. A second date is in the cards for you. See you soon!
