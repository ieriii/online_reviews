As a Costarican I don't want people to think that I am biased when I review this place. On the contrary, it gives me better ground to rate it since I know the food from my country very well. First thing you have to know about Irazu is that the food here taste like homemade. It doesn't taste like restaurant food. I can't tell the difference between their dishes and those that my mom and my sisters prepare back home. And I think that's enough to say about Irazu. The smell of their pudding bread transported me back to the times when I was a child and my mom backed pudding for us at home. The smell of the house when you come in after your school day... mmmm!!!!! Sabroso! The service is excellent and the place is neat and clean. Five stars and Pura vida to Irazu!
