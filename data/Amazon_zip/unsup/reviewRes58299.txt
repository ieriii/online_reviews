Mmmmm Pequod's. My favorite Chicago-style pizza yet.The caramelized crust is truly a thing to behold. And I love that the pizza is brought out in a cast iron skillet. It was surprising the first time I went there. The environment isn't too great - very much like a sports bar, with multiple TVs showing multiple sports games - but some people are probably way into that. The waitresses all wear the same (weird) uniform, consisting of shorty-shorts and weird hats (I think?), but that didn't really bother me, although my sister-in-law didn't care for it. But the Pequod's salad was great and perfect to split between four people. We got one 14 pizza and had two pieces left over to eat later. Delicious as always.And personally, I'm a fan of this place not only for their good food, but also because it isn't full of tourists, which create ridiculous waits.
