This was definitely a fun experience. We had a few beers, some soju (really good - WAY better than any saki I've had), chicken, and two types of beef. The chicken was by far my favorite of the meats, due to the seasoning used on it. I didn't really have access to the sauces at the table, which may have made me like the beef more.  I did not have any interest in manning the grill, so make sure to go with someone who is willing to handle that. What I enjoyed most was trying all of the small dishes of things that came along with the BBQ. I made a point of trying every one of them. Service was efficient, but not pleasant.
