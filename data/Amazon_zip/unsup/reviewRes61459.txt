Not to contradict anyone else (which seems all Yelp is good for sometimes) but I just came from here last night. Service was fine. I should say that I came in around 8:30ish on a Tuesday, perhaps that matters. Now I am from the south, so when ever I here that someone has got some fried Chicken goin' on I am there. Pakistan don't F*** around with it's chicken. This was tasty. Moist and bursting with spices. This process (as I understand it) is one of quartering, marinating, frying, re-seasoning and then baking. So, if your interested or unsure how to navigate this particular ethnic menu go with the chicken Charga. I also had the plane naan and the goat briyani. I can't wait to go back again. It was a little on the salty side but not overly so. The service was fine. English was not a problem. The man was very kind and we even talked a little bit about the name sake and the fact that this was hallal. I understand that this is a cabie hot spot and the hours are late night. Only 4 stars because I have only been one time. I predict it will get bumped to five. Excellent late night cheap eats.
