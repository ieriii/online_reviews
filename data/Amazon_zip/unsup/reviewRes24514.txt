Let's be very clear. You come here for the atmosphere. The food is good but the price you pay is for the atmosphere and the service. Make a reservation and come here for dinner. If they don't let you request a booth when you make the reservation, ask for one when you get there. Considering that the booths have a much bigger table and there's even a curtain that goes with it, the open tables just feel too small and you run the chance of having people bump into you. I came here with a girl I was dating and the waitstaff was so pleasant, I was impressed. Our waiter didn't assume anything and laid out the table following how we decided to sit. Very LGBT friendly but not the kind that tries to be too friendly =). As for the food, the meat fondue and chocolate fondue were good, the cheese fondue was amazing (cheese + grapes = deliciousness). They won't let you take home any of the meats for health safety reasons so eat 'em while they're fresh! Oh and it's pronounced "gay-hahs". I learned that from my hair stylist after totally butchering the name.
