The French Laundry of the Midwest. The food is different but the experience is just as superb. Of course the focus here is on molecular gastronomy. There is only one option when dining at Alinea- you'll have the 21-course (give or take a few) prix fixe menu, which will run you roughly $300. If you want the wine pairing, add in another $150. Trust me, it'll be worth it. You'll leave drunker than a sorority girl, but a happy one. There is no menu, and everyone at your table will have the exact same thing. If you have any dietary restrictions or allergies, be sure to let them know up front.  You'll start with some frozen cocktail creations, with just a touch of alcohol in each. Other than this, there is no liquor so don't ask for a martini. Then you'll move on to a few cold dishes and progress into the bigger, meatier dishes (including rabbit and a piece of venison, which was soooo good). Try to keep count if you can, so you can pace yourself accordingly. If you eat everything on your plate, you might be too full to enjoy the last several courses. The dessert presentation is absolutely spectacular and unrivaled by anywhere else I've been. All in all, expect to be there at least 3 hours, closer to 4. Bring good company, hungry bellies, a thirst for creative dishes that you'll never see anywhere else, and hopefully- your company's credit card or a sugar daddy.
