Great food with a relaxed atmosphere. Dined here last night on their no-menu Sundays and I loved my experience. The food is amazing, especially the first 5 courses, which leaned towards Japanese cuisine. The service and restaurant itself is very unpretentious. I hate being monitored so closely by an attentive staff you're afraid to sneeze. Those kind of restaurants are not my thing. I liked the pacing of the meal as well, there was down time between each course, which made me feel like I could enjoy the night and eat as though I wasn't in a race. All the staff seemed friendly and accommodating.
