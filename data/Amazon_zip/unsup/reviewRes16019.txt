I actually love this as a 4 star but I can't let people think that the food is that great because it isn't. The pizza is probably the best thing on the menu. It is the whole package that's great. This is like going to your Italian friend's house to hang out. The staff is friendly and accomodating although sometimes a little slow. If you sit in the bar you might encounter roudy sports fans watching all the tvs. Where else in the city can you go for upscale food, decent alcohol, affordable prices, and watch the game? If you are more in the mood for a romantic dinner, you can sit in the dining room or even outside. The decor is romantic and welcoming. There is something for everyone at Calo's.
