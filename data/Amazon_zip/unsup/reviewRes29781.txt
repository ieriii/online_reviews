This place is divine. My boyfriend and I had breakfast here, and it was amazing. The only downside of it is lack of space. The tables are so close together and you can eavesdrop on neighboring conversations. The portions are too generous, but that's fine by me. I ordered over had eggs with bacon and hash browns. I chose the toast as my side. The coffee was really good that I actually had a second cup. My boyfriend ordered one of their omelets, and it was huge, but he enjoyed it. My dish was delicious! The eggs were cooked to my liking, although there was a part of it that was a bit yolky. The hash browns were amazing. The bacon was actually the best part of the meal. They were like bacon on steroids: thicker than average and probably 5x unhealthy, but I ate them all. Because it gets so crowded, the waiters/waitresses can't keep track of who needs refills on water, coffee, etc, so you'll have to flag on of them down if you need something. Overall, a good experience and great breakfast foods.
