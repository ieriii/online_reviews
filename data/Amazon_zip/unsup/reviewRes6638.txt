Not being from the South, I have no idea how "authentic" this place is. And Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn: when I crave meat in my mouth, this is where I go. My Yankee ass leaves happy every time. I love this place, and so does pretty much everyone I take here. I could live on the bread-n-butter pickles alone. But cucumbers do not a BBQ make. I like to split a half order of St. Louis style ribs (the meat literally falls off the bone) and a pulled pork and chicken plate. They also make a great mint julep on real shaved ice in a big frosty metal cup-- perfect for hot nights outside. Oh yeah.
