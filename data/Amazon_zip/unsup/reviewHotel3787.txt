We stayed one night in the tranquil suite the night we got engaged. The room was fantastic--incredibly spacious, unique views of downtown, and a minimalist aesthetic that we enjoyed. The living area of the suite has a pretty large mini fridge, couch, and coffee table, so it was a nice spot to relax and have a bottle of wine before dinner. The bathroom was incredible--I am still dreaming about the double rain shower! I can't give this place 5 stars though for 2 reasons: 1) the bed was incredibly uncomfortable. I felt like we weren't even sleeping on a mattress, but rather a giant padded pillow. And not in a "it was so soft" kind of way. The bed was just incredibly unstructured--lumpy, sagging, not comfortable at all. It was bad enough that I wouldn't be willing to pay full price for a room here, and especially wouldn't be willing to stay more than one night. I'm not really picky about beds, but there was just something wrong with this one (my fiance agreed). I haven't noticed any other complaints about this though, was ours just defective?? 2) We didn't interact with the concierge much, but it seemed like the staff could be a bit absentee. I don't really care about luxury service or anything, but if you're the kind of person that does, I could envision this place not being attentive enough for you. Overall, a positive and memorable experience, but what was wrong with our bed??
