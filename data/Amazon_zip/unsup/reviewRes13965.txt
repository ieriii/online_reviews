Glenn's could get more stars in the future, however, I live not to far away and stopped in with a friend to have a beer after lunch. We were served "A" beer and told we couldn't stay and drink unless we ordered food. I may have thought about getting an app or something but as I sat and stewed over it more I thought forget it. If you don't want someone to sit at the bar and drink... Then don't have one! Anyways, it was my first experience here. The place is small and quaint and comfy feeling inside, It kinda left a bad taste in my mouth. I need some time but am willing to maybe give the food a try.
