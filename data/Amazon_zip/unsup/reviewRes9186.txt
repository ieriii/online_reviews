Wow, really beautiful place with yummy food. Pleasant on the eyes and taste buds. The place was beautifully decorated with murals and paintings. The food was tasty and in large portions. I REALLY recommend the dill rice and the kabobs. This place beats Reza's anytime. There's a take out place and the butcher shop right next door.
