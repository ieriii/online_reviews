this place offers solidly good food in a very enjoyable atmosphere for a fair price. i love the staff, too. not your usual cooler-than-thou situation. i eagerly await the special of the day and think that the pastries are quite tasty. i highly recommend the gouda/avocado sandwich, which reminds me of california (sniff).
