This was my 2nd time at Cafe 28. My husband and I went with another couple who had never been there before. Let's start with the drinks...The Habana Light Martini is delicious! It has actual pieces of coconut floating in the drink! We had dates rolled in bacon, shrimp rolled in bacon and coconut shrimp for appetizers....yummy! For the entrees we had the pork, almond crusted halibut, ropa vieja and bistec for me. I asked for it medium and it came back a little too pink for me and I sent it back. When it came back it was VERY WELL done but I had already filled up on drinks and appetizers so no big deal. For dessert we had pistachio rum cake and guava cheesecake! The cheesecake was phenomenal and the cake was moist! This place is just great! I want more people to go and try it!!!!
