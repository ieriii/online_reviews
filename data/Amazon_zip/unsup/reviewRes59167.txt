YUM. This place has the best Godzilla roll this side of Phoenix (just kidding. I've never been to Phoenix and I assume their sushi is bad). In all seriousness though, this place is great! The atmosphere is minimalist monochromatic, but I think that separates it from every other sushi restaurant in Chicago. Delivery is also well presented (and FAST) - the packaging and the preparation are leaps and bounds beyond the typical styrofoam mess from other restaurants. LOVE IT. Great job, Sushi X!
