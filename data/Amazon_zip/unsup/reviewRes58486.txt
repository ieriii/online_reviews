(1) I love the food here -- sooo good, reasonable prices, etc. (2) The staff/owners really appear not to give a #@$ about their restaurant. Three times now we have gone and been told that they are either closing in 10 minutes or the kitchen just closed -- Sorry! usually an hour or more before their scheduled closing time. This is so NOT how to run a restaurant -- especially given their central location in the middle of Andersonville -- and when their web site says they're open until 10 pm, why are they closing at 9? I would understand if it happened once, but three times?!? We went to Antica down the street -- had some awesome pizza instead, and while their door advertised a 9:30 closing time, they [gratefully] welcomed people until easily until 10pm (on a Wednesday night).
