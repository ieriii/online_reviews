Best pizza in town, both thin crust and deep dish! Definitely better than Lou's and Pizzeria Uno. I've never had a bad pizza there and the wait is never as long as they say. They have a bar and a good system for putting your order in. Even though waits can be a little long, by the time you sit down, your pizza is hot and ready for you. Outdoor is also great there. Waitstaff is attentive and quick with drink orders and food orders.
