Ya know those nights where you can't make a decision on what you want to do and what you want for dinner and you're not sure if you should just stay in but you're hungry and lazy and you know you don't want to spend a ton of cash....go here. I've eaten in the restaurant many times, and while the atmosphere is nothing special the food and service are consistently good. Also, a friend and I can go and split and order of guac as an appetizer and a #3 combo for dinner and both leave STUFFED for less than 15 bucks total. Also, I've ordered takeout from Garcia's and it's always good portions and they're very quick. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
