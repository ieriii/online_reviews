This is the brewpub of which _everybody_ in Chicago was aware (its build out was covered in the alternative, and then crossing over to the mainstream, media). Its beer was actually ready before it opened. (The "Eugene Porter" was offered at the Chicago Beer Society's 2010 'Brewpub Shootout'.) It opened to crush attendance. I elected to wait for subsidation of the crowds in order to give the venue a better chance at making a solid impression. My first visit was on a Thursday night. It took 30 minutes for me to be served due to the crowd. I wound up having two beers in a little over 70 minutes, at which point I decided to escape to Quenchers further east on Fullerton (I was on a CTA 1-day pass.). The India Pale Ale is a good one. It isn't hopped up the wazoo like many American Pale Ales. But my favorite is still the Porter. The dark malts prevail in the taste over the hops. It does cost one dollar more than the other beers, probably due to the malt bill. The motif of the venue angles toward radical, "wobbly" politics. That's to be expected when you name your concern "Revolution". But don't let this angle, or the beer names, keep you from visiting here. It is not overt. This brewpub shall energize the entire neighborhood, from Ronny's on the south to the Two-Way Lounge on the north. I anticipate _better_ beers appearing at other nearby venues to sponge up patrons that depart from Revolution (or don't want to put up with the crowd). I haven't eaten here. Supposedly, the food is solid. Transit options: The Blue Line "L"'s California station is 1 1/2 blocks south & east. The #56 Milwaukee bus runs northbound until 10:50 pm every day. The #52 Kedzie-California route quits here at 10:30 pm (in both directions). The #74 Fullerton bus runs eastbound until 11:45 pm, and westbound until 12:40 am.
