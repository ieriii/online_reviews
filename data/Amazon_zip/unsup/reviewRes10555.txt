Simply put, Piece has award-winning hand-crafted brews on tap (made right there!) and great pizza. I highly recommend the Dysfunction Ale. Nice hoppy beer, great finish. Now here is the must-try from the menu: Order the Red-pizza, BBQ-style with banana peppers and italian sausage. Mmmm Mmmm such a GREAT combo.  The peppers are sweet (not spicy after getting cooked). Service at Piece is outrageously great. By accident, they got our pizza order slightly wrong with a topping. Heck, still tasted great. But they insisted in buying us a round of drinks on the house and giving us a discount on the pizza. And we didn't even make a fuss. THIS IS first-class SERVICE to customers! The staff is attentive and very knowledgeable about the beers too. Enjoy the great beers, large tv's on the walls, and yummy pizzas.
