I have only sat at the bar, but I have had most wonderful food and drinks while sitting at that pretty bar and the funnest most handsomest service. (How's that for a run on sentence?) Maybe it's because my drink tab was picked up, maybe it was because my drink tab has been picked up every time I've been there but I dig the joint. I had the rabbit salad last time and it was perfection, tender baby greens and luscious rabbit, dreamy. The fondue was one of those dishes you fight over who gets the last bit of cheesey goodness. Good specialty martinis without going overboard on the sticky sweet stuff. Nice wine list. Great beers. Outstanding service. The bartenders really went out of their way to make us happy.
