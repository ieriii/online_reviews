The Green Mill is a Chicago institution. This place is classic. Is it a landmark yet? You can really feel a sense of history just running your hands across the bar. Maybe putting back a couple drinks helps with that. I'm an avid Manhattan drinker, and Green Mill consistently serves up the best Manhattan's you'll ever drink. Prices are moderate, but the atmosphere is spectacular. From the glowing green bulbs on the outside to the classic sign above the stage, everything oozes class and cool. You'll feel like a schmuck if you walk in wearing jeans and a t-shirt, especially on Thursday when they clear the dance floor for swing jazz. A great place for a date, and they're open 'til 4am. As a matter of fact, what am I doing home right now? Off the the Mill guys. See you there.
