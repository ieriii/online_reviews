This place was fantastic! I pride myself on having a high tolerance for spice, the hotter the better is usually my motto, and rarely do I find a restaurant that makes food so spicy I can barely tolerate. That being said, this place delivered! No extra hot sauce needed, their dry chili spicy chicken was not only well cooked, it had me sweating and mouth tingly within the first few bites. My personal favorite chinese dish is stir fry potatoes, and this place's version was very well done. Just the right amount of spicy and vinegar added!
