Great, simple pizza. Pick your crust, your sauce and your toppings. Fun loud atmosphere. Be prepared to wait, especially on weekends, but it is worth it. The mixed green salad is heaven -- don't let the name fool you. It contains sweet candied pecans and pears. Also try their yummy selection of beers, some made in-house. Live bands can make the night all the more fun. Sometime I want to try this place for NYE -- I've heard it's a blast, and fairly priced.
