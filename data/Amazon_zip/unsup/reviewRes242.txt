It pains me to give Alinea only one star. My entire trip to Chicago was planned around eating at Alinea. For an entire year I have been eagerly awaiting the dining experience of a lifetime.... Unfortunately, it was only memorable as a nightmare. The food was presented beautifully and the technique is out of this world. But the taste was terrible. The savory dishes were so salty I wanted to gag and the sweet dishes came too often. The chocolate and menthol dish at the end tasted like tooth paste and there was WAY too much of it. I really, really wish I liked it but I found myself trying to hurry up and eat so I could get out of there. The staff was so attentive and the experience was top notch but I hated the taste.
