This could be the review where I say i have traveled all over the country eating burgers, which would be true. Instead I will make this short and sweet. Hands down, without a doubt, the bet burger I ever ate in my life. The BEST BURGER. I highly recommend the Red Dragon for those of you whom enjoy a bit of spice, extra so if you order the hand cut and seasoned creole fries. Will I go back? You bet your sweet ass I will.
