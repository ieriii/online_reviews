after reading all of the yelp comments about this place, I decided to try it. I must start off by saying that I lived in Miami for many, many years before moving to Chicago, so I'm used to having very good Cuban food. That said, this was just OK. The chicken was not as tender or well-seasoned as I would have liked. The maduros (sweet plaintains) were OK, but nothing to write home about. I also had the guava pastry. It was nice and flaky, but a little hard.  Compared to what i'm used to, this was edible, but definitely not top notch.
