Best. Meal. Ever. We ate for over 4 hours and were happily stuffed by the the time the last dessert dish finished. The excellent pacing of the dishes really made the difference. If I could re-do the meal, I would skip the wine pairing and instead ask the sommelier to suggest a glass or two [unless you use $100 bills as toilet paper, in which case, knock yourself out and enjoy the wines]. Spoiler alert: I think it's really fun to come here with no idea of what the dishes are, but if you're one of those people who don't like surprises, full meal report with photos over at https://www.facebook.com.
