I like this place, I go here, but I think that 4 stars should require salivation and at least some lost sleep. Crisp, however, does not offer this level of quality or value. I got the Korean Burrito, because I love weird fusion fast food like that. It was good and all, but it didn't pop, if you know what I mean. It just had that Korean flavor which can be squeezed out of a tube of Annie Chun's. The rest of it - including the meat - might as well have been filler. To recap: good not great, tasty but in a predictable underwhelming - albeit notably Korean - way.
