Quick update on another great experience... I ordered catering for an office meeting on the Northiside of Chicago.It was last minute, and Ididn't think I was going to be able to find someone to cater. I called Fogo around 9:30am, and they were able to make the catering happen for us by noon. I was able to feed 20 people, got some pizzas and salads, and the owner actualy delivered it along with another employee. VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!!  Almost forgot..When I ordered, the employee told me to go to their website to say 10% on my first online order as well. Eventhough I am not spending my own money, I realized what a great deal this is, and that placed the order online as well..Thanks FOGO for making my day!!!!!!!!
