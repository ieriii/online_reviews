After reading many of the reviews of this place and actually trying Sultan's Market, I can only assume that Chicago's population is suffering from a lack of Middle Eastern restaurant choices. I got the lamb dinner and my girlfriend got the chicken shwarma. The lamb was extremely dry and bland, while the chicken was not much better than that found at a reception of a shotgun wedding.To top it off, the guys behind the counter were really suffering from the 'cool factor', rushing everyone along and yelling at one woman taking 5 seconds too long, hey LADY, what do you want... Although the hours cater to the working crowd, the Haifa Cafe at 318 W. Adams beats this place hands down with its overall food, freshness, flavor, and attitude.
