Went here for mothers day and the brunch was phenomenal. Their Bloody Mary's are spicy and delicious. There is a great mix of breakfast type and lunch type food. I had a Cajun style omelet and my girlfriend had raspberry pancakes. The pancakes were some of the best I've ever had! The size and decor of the restaurant were great and the service was top notch. I will be going back to Wishbone soon!
