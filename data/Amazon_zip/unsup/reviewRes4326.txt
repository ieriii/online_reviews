I really need to go back here! Last summer I went with a two friends and had a great night. We went later in the evening, but we were able to share a booth with an older man who was there by himself. That was probably the best part of the night. The music was great, we got a seat...but we also got to hear all about the history of the neighborhood from a man who'd lived in the area and had been going to the Green Mill his whole life. So...yeah, I need to go back!
