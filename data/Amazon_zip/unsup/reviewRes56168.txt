RUDE! My husband and I live in Andersonville and enjoy going to Icosium for a salad or crepe and their tasty soup. However, the last several times we went there we were greeted by the staff telling us they would be closing soon. It was 8:30 and they closed at 9:00. I've never had to work so hard to purchase something. Most restaurants will tell you when the kitchen closes, and give you time to enjoy your meal. There were diners at several tables. The food is good, but service can be rude and slow.
