Really good place to have sushi! A very creative menu with many options that combine the best of japanese food. I had a miso mushroom sop that had lots of enoki. I also had a salmon spiced with truffle oil, enoki and other vegetebles and ended with a spicy tuna hand roll. All plates were very unique in flavor and liked them. I had a cold sake to go with it that liked very much. Ended up with a mango tiramusu. It was good but nothing outstanding, I think that I got a little bit lost around the texture. Not cheap but if you want a good experience overall it is worth it.
