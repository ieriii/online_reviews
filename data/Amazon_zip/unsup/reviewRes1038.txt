I was just in Chicago for the weekend and I had a few things on my list to check out - a cubs game, the architectural boat tour and the aquarium. I also wanted to check out a few restaurants and then be sure to get in a Chicago dog and deep dish pizza. And the quest for that Chicago dog is what brought me to Hot Doug's. After seeing the Foie Gras Dog on TV, I knew I had to get that. After walking in, I noticed game of the week was Kangaroo... I'll make room for that. But wait, the celebrity of the day was Apple Pork Sausage? I'll get that too... and a side of duck fat fries as those are always good. All three hot dogs were amazing. The Foie Gras Dog blew out my expectations and easily surpassed its knockoffs at "gourmet hot dog" stands in Texas. The Kangaroo had that amazing gamey flavor and worked well with the heat from the jalapenos. The apple pork sausage was the right amount of savory and sweet. The duck fat fries were good too, but not the best I ever had. After leaving Hot Doug's in a almost drunken daze from the delicious array of encased meats, i realized that I failed my quest for a Chicago Dog. But at that point, I really didnt care... all three hot dogs I just ate were f*cking amazing.
