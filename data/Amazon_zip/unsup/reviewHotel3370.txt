The hotel was fine. The room was clean, quiet, and most things in the room worked. Things that worked: AC, Shower, toilet, sink, TV, outlets, lamps. Things that didn't work: Heater, Internet. Regardless of where the dial was, it would only produce cold air into the room, thank goodness it was summer time, but i'd hate to see what would happen if it was during winter... or fall.. Anyways... my biggest gripe with this damn place is the internet. 5.95 a pop and it's extremely slow. i'm talking about 600+ latency and 0.05 or Less Mbps. The 3g on my iPhone was much faster. Very bummed out about that little prospect. The pool and gym area were clean and as described. Very happy about that.
