We finally found a restaurant where all three of our kids can find something they're excited to eat...thanks Crisp! Let me start by clearly stating that if I were to review Crisp as a Korean restaurant, I'd probably need to give it 3 stars. But I'm reviewing it as a casual, fried chicken/wing joint with a Korean theme that's quick and affordable. And within that realm, it crosses right into the end zone. Fried chicken: excellent. Flavorful without being too greasy. Chicken wings: outstanding. The BBQ wings had a great balance of sweetness and spice. (Although for traditionalists I suppose they could use a little extra kick). Bulgogi bowls: the bowls were average. But they were still tasty and quick. That is, I wouldn't go here for the bulgogi. But once here, the bowls are quite satisfying.
