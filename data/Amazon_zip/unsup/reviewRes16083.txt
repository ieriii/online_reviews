I was looking for a place that doesn't charge a fixed price for dinner tonight and after reading Jennifer's recomendation i decided to give it a shot. Although the place was packed, they had a table ready for us, the waitress knew a lot about the different dishes and luckily for me suggested that I had ordered one plate too many. I got the grilled Octopus and the Vongole and both dishes were cooked right and the portions were plentiful. If I only had the Octopus, I would have given this place 5 stars, but the Vongole was a bit more acidic than what I would have liked and the side salad was average.
