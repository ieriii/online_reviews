One of the best steakhouses I have been to in a while! A little pricey but nothing you wouldn't expect from a really good steakhouse and definitely worth it. Good place to go all-out, our table of 5 got a bottle of wine, a chopped salad, steamed spinach, filet medallions and dessert. One of our diners was a frequent customer at Wildfire and suggested the Filet Medallion Trio and we all ordered it. The meat was cooked perfectly and it was nice to be able to get meat with 3 different crusts for variety (you have your choice of Horseradish, Mushroom, Blue Cheese, Double Baked Potato, or Parmesan Barnais). I haven't had other entrees from here but after having the filet medallions I feel they are something everyone should try! The seasonal berry crisp was the perfect refreshing end to our meal.
