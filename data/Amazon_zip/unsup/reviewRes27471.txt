The main reason we decided to go to Frontera was the fact that this is a Rick Bayless dining establishment. Watching Top Chef Masters i would drool over the dishes Chef Bayless was serving up on every episode, and couldn't wait to try his food someday! Well my dream came true, and whether THE chef himself was cooking back there in the kitchen or not, i didn't care...all i knew was it was HIS restaurant, OMG! Anyhoo, we ordered the chips & salsa to start which was a small serving and overall good. Then for the entree we got the "Mixiote de Borrego" (lamb shoulder slow-roasted with ancho-pasilla sauce, giant butterbeans, chayote & epazote all wrapped in a parchment package and served with a frisee-watercress salad). That lamb was perfectly cooked, the sauce was delicious (a bit on the spicy side), and the salad had a really nice lemon dressing. Since this is a Rick Bayless restaurant i was expecting a mindblowing experience, instead i was bit underwhelmed. The food was very good, but it could've been excellent. Also, the place was packed. That is the customers were packed into tables like sardines from the tight seating setup : / Side note: be sure to make a reservation, otherwise there's a 1-2 hour wait.
