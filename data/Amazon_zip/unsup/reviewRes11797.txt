If you're a devotee of Chicago style deep dish, you might not like this place as much as I did. But Chicago deep dish is an abomination (waiting for the flamewar here), so the thin crust at Piece is pretty tasty alternative. The crust had a good flavor, and the basil was very fresh-tasting. They also are good-sized: a large was more than enough for the 3 of us. I liked most of the beers I had. I saw they have a takeout deal on Sundays - a large pizza and a growler of beer for $25. I may have to try that sometime.
