This place is hard to beat for breakfast- it doesn't get much better. I had the fresh juice- outstanding! I decided on the buckwheat crepes with fresh fruit- out of this world! Just enough honey was used to sweeten it up, the fruit was spot on (fresh, sweet, great variety) and the crepes couldn't have been better. My mom was raving about the buttermilk pancakes as they were made from scratch. She was in the culinary arts and is really picky when it comes to food, especially when it's made from a mix. Well, you could be assured these are from scratch! Just like I said in my previous review- this is a no brainer!
