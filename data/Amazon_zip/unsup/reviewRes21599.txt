Wow, expectations exceeded! My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try XOCO for weeks now, but were hesitant because of the "long wait" comments in most of the reviews. We decided 30-45 minutes was our maximum waiting time before we would give up. WELL, rest assured, it is not always crazy-busy; at least it wasn't for us. We walked right in at 5pm on a Wednesday with NO line and plenty of tables. It is a small place with seating for only 40ish, and it did fill up within the half hour-ish we were there. The food was divine. I had the Vegetables & Black Bean Caldo (soup) which is described as "woodland mushrooms, zucchini, potato-masa dumplings, black bean broth, spinach, avacado, serrano chile" aka a hearty soup, perfect for vegetarians. Make sure you squeeze the lime into it. So delicious! We also snacked on freshly-made chips and salsa. Mmmmm!!! My boyfriend had the Choriqueso torta, which consisted of homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese, tomatillo salsa. He loved it, and raved about the bread. As if that wasn't enough food, we tried churros and the traditional hot chocolate... a perfect ending to the meal. Keep in mind that you can order churros with your meal at the counter, then just tell the servers when you are done with your meal and would like them to bring your churros and hot chocolate...a fresh, warm and delicious dessert. Don't be deterred by reviews saying there is a long wait... maybe you will get lucky as we did! It is worth the wait. Plus, you have to wait weeks or even months to get into Frontera or Topolobampo (sp?), so waiting about an hour is a more practical option if you want the Rick Bayless experience.
