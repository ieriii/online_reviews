WOW! For 8 years I have heard good things and finally I had the honor of eating their pan pizza. I went for lunch and had their personal pan pizza and a soda for 5 dollars. Yes, 5 dollars! Best deal in the city. I had sausage and jalapenos on my pizza and it was terrific. The crust was perfect, the sauce amazing, and my toppings made it all come together. I highly recommend this place and I may just go back once before I leave. If not I will for sure come back when I visit Chicago in the future. .
