Yes, their oatmeal shakes ARE really that yummy. We got it soy style as the waitress suggested and it was the bomb. I've always been an oatmeal fan but now even more so. I drink like a whale so that was finished in no time. The guacamole appetizer is HUGE and plentiful. We just said "sure" when they brought over the chips and asked us if we wanted any, and didn't think it would be such a big plate. There had to be at least 2-3 avocados in it. The award winning veggie burrito is really good! Esp with sauteed mushrooms. The wrap was thinner than most I've had and unlike many other burritos where I feel like I'm just downing a ton of carbs due to hormonized wraps and rice, there was plenty of veggies in it, including carrots! I wasn't impressed by the Costa Rica sandwich, though. The beef was tough and they doused it in mustard. Besides perhaps the beef and hot peppers, it was nothing more than a regular ol' sandwich.
