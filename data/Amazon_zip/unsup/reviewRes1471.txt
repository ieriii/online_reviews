Hot Doug's Rocks! I remember the first couple of times we went to try this place...the line was out the door and down the street...I looked at my wife and said not today. Then one day as we were driving by we saw only a couple of people in line...my wife jumped out of the car and I went to find a parking space. The next thing I knew there were 10 people behind her...this place is like joining a cult for encased meats! The sausage and dogs are so good! The line is worth the wait. I have heard stories that if you are not in the door before closing...you will be locked out...so come early! I do recommend you check the website before going because Doug likes to take time off. A couple of times we went....only to find the door locked. This place makes you work for your food but it is so worth it. The website also has the current menu.
