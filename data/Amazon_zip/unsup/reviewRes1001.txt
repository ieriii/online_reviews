I've seen Hot Doug's featured on TV in a few shows. When we planned a trip to Chicago, I was excited to finally get to try this place. I knew to get there early because I've heard & read about how long the lines get, which worked out pretty well because the line went pretty quickly. My daughter had the Dave Pound (a corn dog). I'm not crazy about corn dogs but I would totally eat this one. My husband had the Elvis (polish sausage) with everything on it. He said it was probably the best hot dog he's ever had. I had the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse & fleur de sel). Ohmyfreakingoodness was this absolutely amazing! The sausage was so flavorful and moist. The foie gras mousse was creamy, not too saulty. The truffle aioli and fleur de sel just brought out all the flavor goodness. I could've eaten a 2nd one! We made the mistake of going on a day other than Friday or Saturday so we missed the chance to try their Duck Fat Fries. Their regular fries were still yummy nonetheless. The decor is great. Vibrant, lively colors. The artwork in the bathrooms are pretty funny. Doug was taking orders and was nice enough to pause for a quick picture. I'm sure we will go back to Hot Doug's every time we're in Chicago...it's THAT good!
