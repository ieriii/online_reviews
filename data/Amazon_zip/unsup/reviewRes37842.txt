My friends and I studied abroad in Brussels, Belgium for 6 months. Needless to say, we are endlessly trying to relive our glory days and recapture the city that brought us all together. Hopleaf does not disappoint. In fact, Hopleaf is probably THE closest one can get to Brussels without actually hopping on a 8 hour journey across the Atlantic. The only downside? The two-hour wait. Though, that was easily rectified by the massive collection of beer and superfluous recollections of "remember that one time in Brussels" stories. Suggestions pour la bire 1. Delirium- Can you get any better than a beer who's mascot is a pink elephant? 2. Westmalle Tripel- Anything with the word "tripel" and I'm in 3. St Bernardus Triple- Another triple. A great option. 4.Koningshoeven- C'est la trappe quadruple!!! What more can I say? 5. Grimbergen Brune- A good starter beer.
