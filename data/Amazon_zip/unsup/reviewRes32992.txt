I loved this restaurant. A group of friends and I make a point of trying new cuisines every few weeks, and picked this place based on customer reviews we'd read. The waitstaff was friendly, the courses were delicious, and even though I was stuffed I forced myself to try their amazing chocolate crepe dessert. As mentioned by other reviewers the owner is super friendly, which I thought only added to Little Bucharest's charm. He even offered to let us sample their "holy water"; I won't spoil the surprise but try it if you get the chance!
