We actually made the very wise decision to show up at 7 here on a Saturday night because we had a big group. We got seated immediately, as it wasn't crowded yet. It took a while for my eyes to adjust to the candlelight, but when they did I was loving the high-backed chairs and cute stools, and the little square tables. I loved that the outside of the bar was deliberately nondescript, like a speakeasy should be. Big velvet curtains opened into a really tidy, modern looking but elegant space. This is a place whose posted rules include no cellphones, no grey goose, no cosmopolitans, and nothing that ends in the word -bomb. It's a place to go for creative cocktails unlike any you can get at most establishments. It's all about the ambiance, and is a great place to go all dressed up and fabulous. There are no TVs in here. The music is quiet enough so you can talk without shouting. So basically, it's my idea of perfect. I had two $11 cocktails... a "Julet and Romeo" that was Beefeater, Cucumber Water, Mint, and Rosewater. It was delicious. Not a big cocktail, but amazing. I tried to savor it. I then had one that was hmmm Vodka, Grapefruit, Elderflower Liquer, and something else. My husband's cocktail had egg white and orange pekoe tea in it. There's one back page of nibbly things. Little sandwiches and fried pickles among them. This is not a good place to show up at hungry, but it's not trying to be a restaurant. Because we had a group of 6+ (we had more like 15) we were eligible to order drinks by the carafe for $90. I was surprised at the price until I considered how quickly the $11/each drinks add up. Anyway, amazing cocktails. There was a line outside by the time we left, and I felt kind of badly because we'd been trying to get our checks and leave for about 30 mins.
