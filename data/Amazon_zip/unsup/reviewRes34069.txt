This place is always busy. They do a really good job in getting people in and out. The service is always solid and personable. I really do not remember having to wait for anything. It has a lively upbeat atmosphere. The food is good. Each time that I have been here, I have always ordered a different pasta dish and none of them have ever stood out. They have all been good but that is it. I should probably tell that my family is from Calabria, Italy and that I have been making my own sauces since I was a little kid. They have a decent wine list here. There are some pretty cool vineyards represented at decent prices. I have always had a positive experience here.
