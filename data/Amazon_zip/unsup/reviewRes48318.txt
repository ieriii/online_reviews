Have to say, after hearing all the hype, we were a tad disappointed by our visit to The Publican. We chose this for our monthly Girl's Night dinner, as we always try to pick someplace new. The much anticipated food....meh. Nothing was bad, but nothing was amazingly good either. (We had the half chicken, and the farm cut ribs.) On the plus side, we thought things were quite reasonably priced...to the point that we WAY over-ordered. And the washroom....very cool. Worth a trip when you're there. And, quite a fabulous beer menu. But, all in all, next time we're in the mood for communal dining and shared plates...we will be going somewhere else.
