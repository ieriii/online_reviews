I am drooling as I write this review. My family and I stopped here when we were in Chicago for the day moving my cousin into her college . Upon arriving at the restaurant, there were tons of people waiting outside to be called for a table. We went inside and gave our names. We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. We decided to wait. It was far less than 30 minutes, perhaps more like 15. We were seated and had the best waiter ( I am sorry I forgot your name sweetie). The menu is huge. But not overwhelming! There are many many options to chose from! I asked him his opinion on which he preferred, the Belgian waffle or nutella crepe. He suggested the crepe and I went for it.  Oh my goodness. It was an orgasm in my mouth! The Nutella crepe was to die for! The crepe was covered with bananas and strawberries and powdered sugar and chocolate and whipped cream. This is to die for! I can't wait to go back to Chicago and order the crepe again!
