OMG! The pizza here is ridiculously delicious! I have been telling everyone about it since our visit. The Pepperoni Festival is absolutely amazing! We also ordered the 4 Queso Pizza which my daughter ate half of it on her own. She said it was the best cheese pizza ever! The place stayed consistently busy the entire time me and my family were there. We waited about 45 minutes for our 2 medium pizzas but honestly it was well worth the wait. Buy 1 Pizza, 2nd is 50% off!! The only con is that there is minimal seating. But that's no reason to take away stars... The delivery girl looked worn out. No sooner than she walked through the door she was headed back out again. I hope patrons tip her well. Brad, the manager was very attentive and checked on the customers often to make sure everything was going well. They did something for us at the end that made us say, "Wow"! I would tell what they did but then everyone might expect the same... Let's just say whatever inconveniences we had during our visit the pizza itself blew them right out of the water. Amazing, authentic wood-burning stove pizza! Worth the trip up north for us! We loved it! 5 Stars!!!
