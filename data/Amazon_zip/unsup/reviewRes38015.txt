Hop Leaf - you're great. You have all the beers I love to see on your menu (except you need more porters - Edmund Fitzgerald, anyone?). You serve (very) tasty food (I've been to Amsterdam 3 times and done the frites + mayo thing, I've heard Vincent Vega talk about them, but for some reason, Hop Leaf is the only place I actually enjoy them!). I always have a good time when I'm here. My only question is: WHY ARE YOU SO F-ING CROWDED EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK?!? I love it that your business is thriving, and it's not really a valid criticism on my part, more of just me whining about not being able get a seat (or even make a 180-degree turn without bumping into someone) on a MONDAY NIGHT! Come on! So - please - people; stop going to this bar when I am here. I need more space to maneuver and I'd like to sit down. Thanks!
