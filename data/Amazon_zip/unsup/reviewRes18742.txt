I was in town on business, and wanted to meet up with a friend for some drinks and some light bites. Neither of us were overly familliar with the neighborhood, but after yelping 'good food and beer' we ended up at the Gage.  The atmosphere seems to be dictated by the area- lots of people in suits (on a Thursday night when the Bears were playing...) but this did not deter me and my Toms. We had a reservation, but found a place at the bar faster- so we went with that. The blonde bartender was the sweetest person ever! She was prompt, friendly, and had great suggestions! We tried all sorts of different beers. Being from Philadelphia, I didn't expect that Chicago would be able to compete, but we were surprised by the awesome micro-brews at the The Gage. I forget the names of the brews we tried, but they were all awesome- and not familliar- which in my book is awesome. To compete with the high ABV's of the beer, we ordered some light bites. I'm a vegetarian so I'm a bit of a pain- i must warn you. We got the cheese fondu, the chickpea fritters, and then we split the risoto of the day which had some root vegetables. Each and every dish was a treat in its own right. The 3 dishes together were all we needed for the night. Everything was delicious, soul-satisfying comfort food. Chicago does it right! Props to the Gage. Next time i'm in town on business, I'll be back! And to boot- its across the street from the Bean in Millenium Park!!!
