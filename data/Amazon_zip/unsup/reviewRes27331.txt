This, ladies and gentlemen, is what it's all about... I'm not going to ramble on and on about how much I love this place but I will say this- You know how you always wished that cartoon food could be realized because it looks so damn good? This is where that magic happens. And it tastes just like you imagined. If you're not willing to be around a lot of people or stray away from your posh restaurant where the waiting staff is forced to smile and pull out your chair, simply don't go. You won't be missed. But if you like great tasting Mexican food at a place that won't hit your wallet hard then you are in business. The Quesadilla Raul, Tacos de Sabinas, and Carne Asada are real stand-outs. Don't forget to bring cash and BYOB. I'll see you there.
