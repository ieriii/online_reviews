I personally like this place more than near by Bongo room, their menu is more extensive and they have more hearty breakfast choices opposed to just desert-like meals. The line at this place can also extend out the door, so arrive early, especially on Sundays. If you don't live in the area they offer parking in the apartment complex next door for a reduced fare, I believe. Both times that I have been here I have been quite pleased with their offerings. Try their Crunch-Berry Oatmeal topped with crunchy granola, blackberries, and blueberries or their Pecan Waffle loaded with pecans and topped with fresh sliced banana, served with a side of caramel sauce. Both are very tasty!
