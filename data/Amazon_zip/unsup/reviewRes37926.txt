We love Giordanos and recommend it as our favorite Chicago style pizza to anyone who will listen. Who cares if there is an hour wait? Put your name on the list. Order your pie while you wait to be seated. Drink a pitcher of beer. Hear your name called to be seated and prepare to tear up when you taste that amazing cheesy goodness. The hubby prefers plain cheese but I like some ingredients tossed in to keep the cheese company. Either way you slice it, you can't miss here. Sooo good!
