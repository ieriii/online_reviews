Food was good, the decor was cute, the service was good. Food: I had the Bangers and Mash - it was a good dish, similar taste to other bangers and mash I've had at other places with the addition of pinto beans but it was a good addition. The only negative about this dish was that it only needed a VERY slight bit of salt. My friend had the Pacific Cod & Irish Cheddar Sandwich - this is hearsay but...he said he enjoyed the sandwich and that it had a good flavor. Decor: Looking outside in I wasn't expecting the inside to be what it was. The bar/restaurant has al fresco dining and window seating with windows that open to let the warm summer air in. However, if seated inside, the place has a cute area they call the "library" and it is designed as such, with bookshelves and all. Service: Service was good, it is what you would expect at a bar/restaurant - the waitress was averagely attentive and friendly.
