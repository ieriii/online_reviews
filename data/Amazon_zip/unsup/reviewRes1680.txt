I absolutely love this place! It is well worth the wait it takes to get in. Doug is incredibly inventive with such a normally mundane food. I had the foi gras dog and the duck fat french fries. The foi gras dog is incredibly rich, but also very flavorful. I couldn't really tell the difference with the duck fat french fries, but they were very good fries.
