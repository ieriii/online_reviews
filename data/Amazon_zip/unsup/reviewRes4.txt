I have no idea how to write my review - dining at Alinea brings a whole different perspective to food, life and Chicago! I think everyone has a unique experience with the food - ingredients and presentation - but two things I'll highlight about my personal experience are: 1) This was an amazingly vegetarian friendly place for the experience. After you've bought a ticket, they'll call to ask a few days ahead of the reservation about any dietary restrictions and that's when they record vegetarian. I didn't feel that we missed out on even an ounce of the experience that non-vegetarians have. in fact, I admire the kitchen's ability to do such a great job with it! 2) this place is very unique and of course, expensive, but not a single staff member here was pretentious or stiff - they took a lot of pride in what they do but in a natural friendly way (the American way as my dining partner put it). You can be comfortable, natural and just enjoy.
