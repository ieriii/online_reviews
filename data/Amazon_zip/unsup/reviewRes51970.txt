This place has everything from ambiance, to excellent wait staff, to awesome pizza. My kids loved it too, and there were a lot of families there. There is a little wait (35-45 min) for the deep dish pizza but so worth it! My four year old had his own thin crust pizza and it was the perfect size. Awesome!
