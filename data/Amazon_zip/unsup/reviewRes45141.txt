The food here is AMAZING. My favorite things are the roasted cippolina onions and the spicy lamb sausage pasta. They are so delicious! I keep thinking about them... hmm, maybe it's time to head back. (My husband is a fan of the bolognese, but I think it's a bit bland) In the summer, the back patio is very nice.
