On the one hand, I really love the fact that Xoco uses sustainable, natural ingredients from local farmers. Eating quality farm-raised meats is important to me and I didn't have to feel guilty about eating red meat here. On the other hand, I was disappointed in the lack of flavor of our torta's and given that lack of flavor the price of them. We had the pepito (braised short ribs) and the special of the day - the mole poblano (with pork). The tortas sounded amazing, but I was surprised that they didn't have much of a pop of flavor - especially because the ingredients were all seemingly flavorful components. I got bored by the time I got to the end of my torta and couldn't even finish it. Perhaps it was all the hype leading up to my experience?  Or me watching the chefs do their thing while waiting to order - the whole time thinking about what an amazing lunch I was about to have? Maybe the 45 min lunch line? I don't know, but both me and my husband walked away and said "meh, I've had better".  Guac was good, salsa and chips were just okay.  But for about $35 for lunch, I wanted something better. I will say that they have a good system, the dining area is very small, but they manage it well. However - not worth a 45 minute lunch wait!
