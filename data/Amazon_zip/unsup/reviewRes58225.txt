Oh my sweet gherkins!!!I went there last week after helping some friends move and I have FOUND MY NEW WING SPOT!!! The wings are super CRISPY! Apparently they use a gluten free flour to batter the wings and this enhances the crispness. Really, there's nothing worse than a slimy, over breaded, chewy chicken wing.... Needless to say these wings were fabulous!! As for sauces, I highly recommend the Seoul Sassy. I tried the Crisp BBQ, which seemed more enticing because of the great red color, but after the taste test, it was the Seoul Sassy that won my heart. By the way, the steak bowl was pretty darn good too.
