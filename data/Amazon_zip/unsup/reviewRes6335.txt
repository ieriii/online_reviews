Advantages: -We were seated right away (Sunday night). -Great ambiance, very romantic and rustic. -Large wine selection. -Service was excellent. -Food was good (we had the sausage pizza with garlic oil and Kale - the Kale was a little wet, but overall, good; the giant ravioli with Italian sausage, and the goat cheese salad with watercrest, roasted squash or was it zuchini? and walnuts). This was excellent. Disadvantages: -The servings were kind of small and it was kind of pricey. Overall, I enjoyed my experience, but for someone who loves to eat, I can't say it would be my first choice for Italian.
