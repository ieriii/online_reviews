Hands down my favorite deep dish in Chicago. Ever since I found out about Pequod's, I've never gone to Unos, Giodanos, Ginos East, Lou Malnatis - no thank you. The caramelized crust is just to die for - if you have a problem finishing it, i will gladly eat yours for you. If you are dining in and have a part of more than 4, call ahead to try and have reservation. If not, they are still pretty good about turning around tables inside and while you wait, you can put in your order for pizza (takes ~ 30-40 minutes for a large). Ask the guy with the gray ponytail why the logo is a whale with a thong on its head. Awesome.
