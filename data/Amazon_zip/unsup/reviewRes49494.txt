Would certainly be 5 stars if they stepped up their game in terms of beer and drinks - it's a wine only BYOB and their cocktails leave something to be desired. That being said, the skirt steak is astonishingly good and my sides of yuca, potato, and plantain were all spot on. They serve the steak with some chimichurri-ish sauce but it's so darn good by itself that I barely touched the sauce.
