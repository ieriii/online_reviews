HA, I went to Gino's East twice in my Chicago trip. The first time was for Pizza which wasn't that great. No cheesy gooeyness and he flavor fell flat but the crust was tasty. The second time we went for the right thing the Italian beef sandwich which is omg good! So meaty and juicy with extra au jus to dip and those yummy pickled veggie n peppers. I can't wait to go back - plus the soup that came with it I think was a tomato bisque but it tasted like lobster bisque. I will come back for a sandwich at this pizza place.
