great food. everyone is doing bone marrow now, but i think theirs is the best. the steak tartare is very good and so are all the pastas. i also really like their roasted chicken dish. another bonus is the wine list has some great value for money. the bad? the service here is AWFUL. look, i know you're the hotspot right now, but that doesn't give you the right to treat your diners like sheep. totally not right. publican and longman and eagle are doing a similar thing right now...and they're doing it with a lot less attitude.
