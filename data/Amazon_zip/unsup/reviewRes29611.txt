Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at. It's in our neighborhood, so we're tempted to go there a lot. Our favorites include the Shu Mai and Tiger Cry appetizers, the Poh Tak soup (great when you have a bit of a cold or on a blustery fall day), and any of the curries. I had Gaeng Masaman last night and it was divine! There's usually a short wait on weekends, but it's worth it. The service has always been friendly, quick and precise. Also, it's BYOB, so you can have dinner for two, with appetizers for under $40. Prices are more than reasonable. They also do takeout and delivery within a certain radius. We called at 9:02 one weeknight, not realizing that delivery ended at 9:00. They were kind enough to go out for one more trip!
