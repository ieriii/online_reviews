After reading all the reviews, I was really wondering if this was going to knock off My Pie as my favorite deep dish Chicago pizza. But I have to say My Pie still holds strong at #1. When I ordered from Art, I did get the stuffed crust, and maybe I should try the pan next time. I thought it was pretty good deep dish. It was definitely the heaviest and most dense pizza I have ever gotten. I can put down some pizza, but even two slices of this was too much. It was a lot of pizza. When you spend over $20 they give you a free litre of soda. That's nice. It was good pizza, but I didn't see a lot that separated it from most other Chicago deep dish joints. I'd say it was closest to Giordano's. The sauce was better, but the crust was a little too doughey. The dining room really didn't look too appealing, so I doubt I'll ever eat there. But I may pick it up again sometime. Or stop in for a slice. Not #1, but it's in the top 10 somewhere.
