I'm a jazz lover and you can't get better atmosphere than this club. Reasonable cover charges and drink prices top off what can be a great evening. My only beef is that the place is too popular. It fills up quickly on weekends and if you really what to hear and see the musicians you must get there well before the music starts to get a seat. Also it will get very smokey there as well. Can't wait until the citywide smoking ban is in place.
