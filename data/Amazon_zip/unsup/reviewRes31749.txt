ok, just got back from this place. May I say that this was probably one of my best culinary experiences ever. I am slowly converting to a vegetarian and the chicago diner makes me wanna get down with the vegans! I took a non-vegan with me and she was quite smitten with her choice as well...Loved it! I'm sure the weekends are hell when it comes to seating but to come on a weekday is just fine. I had the diner burger with a side of raw kale salad, vegan cheesecake and a Mexican hot chocolate. yum. will be back soon.
