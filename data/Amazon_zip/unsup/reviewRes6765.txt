YUM! Came here to carb up the night before the Chicago Half Marathon and was definitely not disappointed. The restaurant itself seemed pretty unassuming and fairly busy... the interior was nice - clean and charming with the old school tin ceiling. The waitstaff was super professional and on the ball - my water glass was never empty and we had a constant supply of bread at the table (good and bad thing). Good that night since I was loading up for a run the next morning. :) I had the Carbonera which was a good serving size. The creaminess and the bacon made me eat the whole thing! It was delicious. My sister and her husband tried the large lasagna and the squid ink gnocchi - both looked very good. Overall I am a big fan and can't wait to find an excuse to visit Chicago again to try other offerings from this place.
