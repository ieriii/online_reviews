This is a fab bar, w/incredible food. It gets insanely packed on the weekends though, so be prepared. Also they absolutely will not seat you/will give up your table if the whole party isnt there. hostess wont budge an inch on this. otherwise; totally worth it, and they do open up the patio for a great beergarden when summer eventually gets there. Great mussels, CBJ is phenomenal, yummy fries and onion rings w/a homemade garlic aoili, stilton mac n cheese is also a winner. They're famous for their ham sandwich.
