Well, I was pretty let down. This place looked cool, and the menu sounded good, but the whole deal was pretty weak, save for the wine. Thankfully, yes, the wine was great, and above all, REASONABLE. They must take a loss on the wine and then make it up with the overpriced food. The appetizers of mussels and red curry scallops were both very tasty - however, the portions were tiny, even by fancy-restaurant standards. The main courses were also all very small, and none of them were memorable for any reason beyond their mediocrity (we had the hangar steak, venison medallions, swordfish, and vegetarian plate, which was oysters with big flat noodles). Even the desserts, which I'd heard would be great, were both really underwhelming. Our waiter seemed overworked, and wasn't around very often, but when he was, he was polite and helpful. All in all, I would not go back for dinner, but I am looking forward to snacking on some wine and cheese next time I'm at the House of Blues or something.
