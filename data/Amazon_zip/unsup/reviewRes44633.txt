Giordano's is the best place for Chicago-style pizza, hands down, end of story. Better than Lou Malnatis and much better than the cheese-and-sauce soup in a bland crust they serve at Gino's East. If you have yet to experience the magic of Chicago-style deep dish or have guests from out of town wondering what the fuss is about, go here. Also neat: if you live anywhere in the contiguous US outside of Chicago, Giordano's will ship you a half-baked pizza on dry ice for you to finish baking yourself. It's not quite as good as eating it fresh from the restaurant but it got my family by when were living in Pennsylvania!
