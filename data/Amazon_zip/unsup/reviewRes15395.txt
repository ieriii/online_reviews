I saw this restaurant in the Chicago mag not too long ago and put it on one of my to try restaurant lists in the Chicago area. My bf and I finally went here last night hoping to get there early enough to beat the long waits. Well, unfortunately we got side tracked and didn't end up arriving til almost 8 in which we were told it was a 1-1 1/2 hour wait. Yikes! Given our motivation to try it and their beer selection, we decided to tough it out and found a nice, cozy spot by the bar to settle in. About 1 hour into the wait, we were getting restless. We both thought the beers that we tried (the wheat and pale ale) were a little one dimensional and bland, but I was very satisfied with my second beer (blanking on the name) and the beer list was reasonably priced and thorough. Finally, the spots right in front of us opened up at the bar and we ordered quickly and the food arrived in about 10 - 15 minutes. We loved our sandwiches - the burger w/ pulled pork and the pulled pork sandwich with fresh slaw on top. The burger was maybe one of the best in the city. I love places like this and given that, I would go back in the future, but would try my best to avoid going during prime times where the wait is over an hour.
