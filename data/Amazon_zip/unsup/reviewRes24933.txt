I loved it. I grew up in Chicago but had never heard of this place until the Groupon popped up and a coworker of mine told me I had to check it out. I will state my only gripe here in the beginning, as it was when we were first seated that I came across it. A lot of the tables are way too close together, especially in the little alcove where we were seated. It's a little difficult to have a romantic date when you're a foot and a half from the next table. My boyfriend and I spent a lot of time listening to the conversations of the tables next to us, which is always fun, but there's a time and a place for everything. Next time, I know to request one of the little secluded private booths when I make my reservation, because all of the booths looked quite appealing. Everything else was great. The service was friendly, the busboy was really on top of his game. The fondue, of course, was amazing. We opted for only cheese and chocolate fondue with a cheese plate in between, and next time we know to order both of our cheese courses at the same time so that we have more stuff to dip in our fondue! ("We could dip our cheese in cheese!" says my boyfriend with glee.) I only say this because there was only just a little bit of cheese left when we were finished with all of the dippables - not enough to really warrant asking for more bread or fruit but definitely enough that we were sad to see it go. :) The chocolate fondue was, naturally, sinful and delicious. I kept thinking I was going to get outdone by the richness, but since there was such an array of different things to dip in it, I was able to keep truckin' til the bitter end. Although I'd call it more bittersweet, since I was sad to see it go but knew it was time to say goodbye. Bonus points: really inexpensive wines by the glass and they give whipped cream with coffee! YUM. SUPER bonus points: they don't allow kids under the age of ten! EXCELLENT!
