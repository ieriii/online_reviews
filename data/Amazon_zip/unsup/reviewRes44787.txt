First time in Chicago and first taste of true Chicago style pizza...Giordano's did not disappoint! The pizza was much better than I anticipated and was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of toppings and cheese. The doorman at our hotel recommended this over Lou Malnati's which is where we were originally headed...thought it be best to take a locals recommendation and boy, was I glad we did! We ordered a small special stuffed pizza and it was more than enough for me and my hubby. We left full and satisfied, but I was still talking about it and craving it before bed! Highly recommend for pizza, just know it takes approx 35 minutes for it to cook so enjoy some vino and salad while you wait!
