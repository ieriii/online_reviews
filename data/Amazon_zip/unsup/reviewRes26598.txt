I do love the food here but the management is lacking in consideration of their customers. I was entertaining guests at the Auditorium and booked brunch at the restaurant prior to the performance about 3 weeks ahead of time.  I called to reconfirm a couple days prior as I had received an e-mail in error confirming my attendance at an Iron Chef event that evening. I did not get the call regarding the calcellation of my brunch until the afternoon before - incredibly inconvenient and inconsiderate.
