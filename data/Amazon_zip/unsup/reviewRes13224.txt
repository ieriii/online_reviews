What happened?! I had gone to Revolution Brewing weeks prior and had a fantastic experience and meal. That time, the service was impeccable and the food delicious. I had the exact opposite experience this last Saturday early afternoon for brunch. The service was terrible. I believe our server was high. We had another server help us out which was unfair to her. The place wasn't even that busy. Our food was just as terrible. For starters, my bf's eggs were raw and my meal was significantly a smaller portion then the last time I was there, it also had different ingredient than stated on the menu. For example, I had corn instead of asparagus. I just don't understand that. It's too bad since I was looking forward to revisiting for brunch. Unfortunately, I was gravely disappointed. Wish I had dined elsewhere...
