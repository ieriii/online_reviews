I know the reviews say it's all about the meat, but they've neglected to mention the CHEESE BREAD! This isn't your ordinary "Red Lobster" cheese bread - this is the Mother/Father/MoFo of all cheese breads! Back in the summer of 2004, I came here with several friends and while we were wowed by the meats, the cheese bread is the one thing that we STILL talk about.  The meat selection is great and the fact that they come around to you is even better. I look forward to visiting the Beverly Hills location and any others I can get to.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
