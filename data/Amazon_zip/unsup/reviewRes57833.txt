Went to Nana for brunch with a small group - and was hoping for something great after all the positive reviews - especially since so many great brunch places are on the north side and I live in Pilsen. In the end, it was ok - I've definitely had better. My partner got the tofu scramble with 'seasonal vegetables' (we're debating how in season and locally grown bell peppers can be in the Midwest). The black beans tasted like they were from a can and the veggie chorizo was kind of meh. My roommate got the garden omelet with 'foraged mushrooms' that looked an awful like the regular button mushrooms that you get at the store ... I enjoyed my veggie benedict - but, again, the side of vegetables was pretty bland. Definitely enjoyed the pear cocktail though. Maybe the meat dishes are better ... if you haven't been there, I would still check out!
