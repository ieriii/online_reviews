first off, I'm biased because I LOVE DALE. LOVE DALE. he's so cute and soft-spoken but his food is always fun and whimsical. anyways, I finally got a chance to experience Sprout when I brought the bf here for special Goose Island pairing dinner. 4 courses paired perfectly with 4 Goose Island beers-including Fleur, Sophie, Matilda and Pere Jacque. My favorite course was the steak (COOKED IN DUCK FAT) and crab (ooh..sweet, succulent delicious crab) with their housemade worcestershire sauce-SUPER AWESOME 2nd favorite? surprisingly enough..the OATMEAL cake! like risotto cake but a whole new spin. It was surprising and sooo flavorful. I'd eat a whole bowl of that! please give me with the fried pork belly. to say the food (and beer) was good is way too much of an understatement so I will end it with...I LOVE DALE and everything he does is amazing. the end. p.s. I want to come here for brunch. and I hate brunch. enough said.
