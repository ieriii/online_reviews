OK the interior is adorable, and I felt like I was stepping into the 1920s. I did not enjoy the layout of the restaurant, since it was so tiny, the tables against the wall are literally side-to-side touching -- meaning they lock you into the booth, and the manager comes over to move the table if you need to get out. The hubs and I used an A-la-card and shared 4 appetizers -- #1, #6, #8 and #11. Yes, I gave you numbers. I mostly enjoyed the crispy spring rolls. It was nicely fried w/o being oily. And I enjoyed the pickled carrots & daikon, and mint & cilantro to fill your little wrap with. Oh yeah, you're supposed to wrap the spring roll in a piece of lettuce. The ravioli was tasty as well -- get it! For the prices, I felt the presentation of the dishes should have been better. The flavors are cleaner than what you'd get in Viet-town, and you're paying for the service too. Funny story: A dude in the group next to us was claiming he was allergic to fish sauce and demanded no fish sauce in any of his food. Seriously, if you're allergic to fish sauce (I'm pretty sure he just secretly didn't like it), you should not be visiting a Vietnamese restaurant.
