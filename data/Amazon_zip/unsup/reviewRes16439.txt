Lunch buffet is where its at! Great place, very clean. Their buffet had a great selection of rices, and dishes. From spicy to curry to sweet. I will be back for sure for dinner for entrees, because everything was so tender, fresh and full of flavor. The naan was bottomless and not greasy. They also have a nice sizzling chicken and onion portion they give your table when you order the buffet. I thought that was a very nice touch. I will be back for sure!
