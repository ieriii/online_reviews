I was extremely disappointed with both the service and the cuisine at Caro Mio, after having read so many complimentary reviews about the restaurant. I expected so much more from our dining experience.From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the man greeting us at the door owner was rude. They gave us a small table in a very obscure and noisy room.The server did not approach us for at least 7 minutes without even acknowledging us during that time. The two entrees that we ordered were mediocre and warm at best. They never came back to refill water glasses or to ask if our meal was satisfactory. We decided not to order dessert or coffee because we felt we had wasted enough time and money on a very poor dining experience.We are not pretentious or snobby, but we love Italian Cuisine and we are used to eating in good restaurants and expect good customer service and good food. What a disappointment Caro Mio was. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Jerry Nunn
