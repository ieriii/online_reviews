The self-proclaimed Sausage Super Store and Encased Meat Emporium, Hot Doug's should also be home of the regenerating line. When we finally got to the front, the line behind us had grown to exactly where we were standing when we had got there an hour before. Worth the wait? Surely. I don't think I would make a habit of waiting an hour, but it's definitely part of the experience. That said - the food. Let's talk about it. The Dog (Chicago style - grilled or steamed) is a must. For under $2, there really should be no debate. The Weekly Specials are incredible. I had the Foie and Duck sausage and was in love. The sausage is salty and the foie is nice and creamy - so rich. Though, this dog is really rich and there is no way I could ever finish the whole thing (I feel like it would be perfect to share). The celebrity sausage was the Maurice White (a spicy Thai chicken sausage with a chili-garlic mustard and topped with a seaweed salad ) - which we also had. This sausage had a bite and the seaweed salad was awesome. Finally duck fat fries. Delicious? Yes. Could I taste the difference between that and regular french fries? Sad to say -- not really. Worth trying for the novelty, but not necessarily a must.
