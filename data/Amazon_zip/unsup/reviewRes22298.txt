I'm not a Chinese food connoisseur, but I thought Lao Sze Chuan was authentic and had a nice atmosphere. This is a extremely busy place on a Saturday evening, which is when we went. Some reviewers mentioned you can call ahead to be placed on their wait list. I will definitely give that a try the next time. A little heads up, they will bring a spiced cabbage starter to your table. It is very SPICY. I really enjoy spicy food, but this made my lips burn for at least an hour. I will likely avoid the cabbage starter on the next trip. For the main course we ordered the dry chili chicken and cashew chicken. The dry chicken chili was labeled extra spicy, but it was not nearly as hot as the cabbage starter. The dry chicken chili was OK, in my opinion. As other reviewers stated, the chicken was a little overcooked. I really enjoyed the cashew chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the veggies and mushrooms were amazing.  I have one dislike: our waitress went missing. She served us our appetizers and took our orders and disappeared after that. Random waiters/waitresses refilled our beverages, cleared our dirty dishes and got us our check. I sure hope she (missing waitress) is okay.
