This is a great find! All the fantastic reviews do not lie. Although we had initially planned on having the Prix Fixe dinner (which is now $30, but still a deal), upon looking over the menu, we decided to splurge on the 8 course tasting menu (or as Paul, our waiter said, "let us cook for you".... so we did). And it was wonderful. The menu changes regularly, so I won't even bore you with describing all 8 courses... but, each course was better than the last, ending with a trio of chocolate panna cotta, rich bread pudding with white chocolate creme anglaise, and a macadamia nut cake. Not one course had anything left on the plate.  Paul was a great waiter, attentive without hovering. It was easy to make reservations, and even though we were a little bit late, we didn't have to wait. By 8:30 on a Wednesday the place was about half full. But, with as wonderful as this food is, I imagine it will not be half full for much longer.
