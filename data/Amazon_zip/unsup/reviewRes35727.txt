Great look, nice and clean, great food but damn......I have to hunt down servers for my check end up paying at the counter. Been there about 3 times and the service is questionable sometime I think I should serve myself. I have mix feeling about this place because this is one of the better Chinese restaurant on the northside but their service is horrible. I definitely recommend the food for takeout but eat there at your own risk because you'll be waiting for service.
