I decided to try this place out based on all the great yelp reviews, and to there credit, the pan pizza was amazing. Delivery was on time only 45 minutes, you must be thinking why I am giving this place 1 star? Well as I was eating this delicious pizza I see a huge hair in half of my pizza baked in, disgusted, I call them and asked for a refund, or a new pizza. They tell me that, all employees use hairnets and I probably placed it there to get a free pizza. After hearing this, I will not be back, though there pizza really is delicious. 5 star pizza 5 star delivery time 1 star customer service.
