Bar and dining room full of hipsters, trend setters, adults, scallywags, and the guy doing a crossword puzzle at the bar. I walk in soaking wet from riding my bike, not a person looks at me strange or thinks its out of the ordinary to show up looking so terrible. Barkeep states, "you nee a drink." This place is fun on multiple levels. You can go with your significant other or family member and have a nice dinner in the dining room, or sit at the bar with close friend, or go with a small group when it's late and just catch some good conversation but probably better beer. Their selction is intense at first, but if you know what you like you'll manage pretty quickly. For amateurs and pro's, their menu is superbly put together. Very easy to read through and I dont feel like I'm ready for a pop quiz by the time I'm done. Not to mention they typically have fantastic beers on tap. Go for a pot of mussles, go for their Steak Frites, hell...just go for any reason.
