After a frustrating and unsuccessful attempt to have dinner at another establishment this evening, we thought about where we could go and be sure not to be disappointed. We immediately thought of Sapori and were glad we did. We ordered the filet and the Lasagna Vegetariana. Both were excellent. We did not have any sides or desserts tonight but know from previous experience with their Monday family dinner special that those are all excellent as well. Their Monday special is a phenomenal deal, by the way. We have probably dined here 10 times and have never been disappointed, so it's high time that I should write this review.
