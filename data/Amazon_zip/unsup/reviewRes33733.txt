First, I don't think the wait is ever worth it. If you are going to attempt to go for weekend brunch, go with a small group and opt to sit at the counter if possible. Our waitress managed to mess up my order- Chocolate Chip pancakes. They're on the menu, I didn't make any special requests or anything, and she brought out plain ones like I had ordered them a la carte. Really? And they weren't that impressive. A little over priced as well. I'd take your chances somewhere else.
