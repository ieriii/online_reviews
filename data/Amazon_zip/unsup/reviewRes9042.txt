This place is Un-Pho-gettable, in every way. Was drawn in by the restaurant week menu, but we will return because my husband and I really enjoyed ourselves. My best friend and her husband had a good time as well. When we walked in I fell in love with the decor and lighting, it was dimly lit with candles everywhere and rich dark colored wood and walls. Swoon. We started with the Pho and Ca Bam Xuc Banh Trang. I loved the Pho, and my Dh preferred the Monkfish. Needless to say after starting the dinner with tasty apps were were ready to be blown away. Next we had Ca Nuong and Cari Tom, the Salmon was perfectly grilled, nice char marks on the outside and a beautiful medium-rare on the inside. The rest of of the dish was OK, and my husband was underwhelmed by the coconut curry, said it seemed watered down. On to dessert, I had the Banana Wonton and he had the Macaroon, both were delicious, but I wish that the Wonton came with Ice Cream. I still give them 4 stars even though 1 course wasn't the best. The ambiance, wine list, servers, and Pho make up for any mishaps. Dinner for 4 including drinks and tips was 260. We will be back again soon. Don't Pho-get us, lol.
