This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago! It's pricey, but worth every penny. The atmosphere is fantastic and a nice waitstaff too. Be sure to fast during the day so you have room for all the meat you can eat. I love their huge shrimp and their bacon wrapped chicken & bacon wrapped fillet minion. I love how often the servers came to our table and how they cleared your plate for a nice warm one and even how they took a palm-sized sweeper and swept off any crumbs off of the table. It made me feel like a queen. The salad bar is also great and not your typical salad bar and included oysters, vegetables, meatballs and other fantastic options. I also loved the fried banana and mashed potatoes they kept replenishing at our table to cleanse our palates. I have eaten here before and will eat here many more times in the future. Another great thing is that they offer a half-priced lunch during the week. The only downside is that it doesn't include any of the seafood - but is still a wonderful deal for during the week. Be sure when you go here to bring your appetite.
