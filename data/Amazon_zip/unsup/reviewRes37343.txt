Fox & Obel Cafe offers traditional cafe items with a creative spin using fresh ingredients. If I had my way, I would have tried everything on the menu. Alas, I only had the salmon burger, vege chili, cinnamon swirl, coffee, and nutella banana panini...not all at once, though. The salmon burger, with a wasabi mayonnaise, was delicious. The salmon patty itself was sooo flavorful...I wonder if the market sells the patty? The fries with the burger...I could not stop eating them! I don't know if it was the flaked salt on them, or what--they were delish! The vege chili is good, but I just want to warn you that it's not thick like you expect chili to be. It should be called vegetable soup.  Breakfast on another day consisted of the coffee, panini, and cinamon swirl. The coffee was strong and flavorful. The swirl was good, though a tiny bit dry. The panini? Easily the piece de resistance of the meal; light and crunchy bread, warm and oozing nutella, and fresh slices of banana--perfection.
