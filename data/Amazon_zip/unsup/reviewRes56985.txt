I never yelp, however this place was amazing! My friends and I showed up at 8:30 on a Thursday night and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. Normally, we would be scared off by such a wait but there is a bar and a large enough waiting area that it seemed fine. We were originally a party of 8 however became a party of 13 as the time went on. The wonderful host was so accommodating, as a hostess myself I would say that he deserves five stars alone! The staff was friendly and prompt and the food was out of this world! Because we had vegetarians at our table we ordered the basil, goat cheese, and garlic pizza...one word...DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The beer they brew there is delicious, try the moose knuckle brew on tap. Over all Piece was friendly staff, great atmosphere, delicious food and beer. I would say to anyone that this place is worth the time.
