Durian. Its stinkiness is often enough to make the weak run in fear and the bold weak in the knees. But that's not what I came here for. Pho is what this place does and it does it well, there's no disputing that. I came here for pho. *But* the durian smoothie won me over and made me swoon a little, and like a dare, I couldn't get it out of my head. Once the smoothie arrived, to answer your inevitable, burning question, it didn't smell that bad. Perfectly durian-y. You're either a fan, hate it, unsure, or are simply frightened. For the unsure, give it a try, especially since this isn't as stinky (or as difficult) as cracking open your own fresh fruit. Back to the pho. Don't let yourself get distracted by the other menu items. I'm sure they're good. Get the pho. Do not pass go. Do not collect anything, except meatballs with a side of sliced beef, which is what I prefer. The portion will be huge, so be hungry. For the uninitiated, go with a seasoned pal to show you the pho ropes, if possible. Lots of stuff to add and lots of ways to make a great pho even better. Service here is friendly. Expect to be given a hard time if you can't finish your giant bowl of pho and want to take it home. I know it doesn't taste the same the next day, but I'm the durian eater, remember? I live dangerously.
