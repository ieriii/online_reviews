I bought a voucher for this place through KGB deals. The voucher was for $40 worth of food and drinks + limo service at Little Bucharest Bistro. So I called to make reservations for six people. The man on the phone refused to accept the deal and said it was either $$ off or the limo ride. He was quite rude on the phone. Needless so say we will not be eating at this establishment. If the owner can not afford the deal DO NOT offer it to the public.
