Out of 12 courses there are going to be highs and lows. But the unfortunately I dont remember any of the highs. There was nothing memorable about the food. The presentation was excellent and I highly recommend the wine pairing, where they present a story with each of the wines. However, the food was average and the sequence of the food seemed off. The best dessert course was artistic...yet they had 2 more dessert courses afterwards that were not merely as impressive artistically and were borderline disgusting.
