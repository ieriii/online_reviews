First of all, it's a little pretentious and pricey. It looks like a dive on the outside, it's kind of cold, and not a whole lot of smiles.BUT the drink menu is one of the most creative I have ever experienced. The decor is classic and beautiful. No cell phones, so turn it on vibrate.It's nice to see something like this in Chicago, it may not be for everyone but it is definitely unique.
