I wanted to love this-- but it just wasn't meant to be. From a service stand point it was fine, but the food was bland and that pretty much is a sin beyond repair. Such a shame.. Indian food is my passion and I have much to compare it to.. but the meal was absolutely lacking in that rich complexity of flavors that traditional Indian food.. if done well, exhibits. Sorry..
