The cafe is definitely quality. You can really see the care that went into preparing the food, freshness of the produce, etc....I used to love getting the Tortilla Soup and BBQ Pork Sandwich on Challah. They got rid of both as regular menu items, and therefore I go to F&O only when I need a $40 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar.
