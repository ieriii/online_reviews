Huge fan. The Korean BBQ and Soul Sassy are really different and delicious. Love the Baby Buddha Bowl (rice with marinated veggies) with beef. Skip the red sauce it comes with and ask for Amy's Atomic. It's spicy and really yum on top of the rice bowl. If you order fries with anything, they are large enough for two people, at least. The service is fantastic. The people who work here are always friendly, nice, and do everything possible to accommodate special requests. I pick up from here all the time and the food is always read in five minutes!
