I love this place and the best part is that its walking distance from home! The staff is super friendly and as I had not had tons of sushi lately the server gave me tons of great recommendations. She was fantastic! I really feel bad for not remembering her name, I love to give props to specific people who are awesome. The prices here are great and the selection is a lot begger than I thought it would be. This is going to be a staple of my diet from now on.
