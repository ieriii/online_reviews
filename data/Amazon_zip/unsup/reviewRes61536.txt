I've passed this place a bunch of times on my way to Olympic or Northwest Cutlery, but today I finally went in. I picked up a LB of some gorgeous shrimp and a perfect 1/2 LB tuna steak for 20 bucks. Scallops, oysters, and mussels also looked great. I will definitely have to pick up some next time I'm down there. I think I found my new goto spot for seafood. Rubino's is clutch.
