I love this place. Fantastic food and nice fresh atmosphere. For lunch the strawberry salad is really delicious and for breakfast I love the down on the farm skillet... but really I haven't had something here that I wasn't happy with. Everything seems very fresh. The service is good but not rushed. If you have a time crunch this might not work out for you but if you really are not in a hurry it is a wonderful brunch or lunch spot. I highly recommend this place.
