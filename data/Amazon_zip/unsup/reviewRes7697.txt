Carnivorous Heaven :p My girlfiend and I went to Fogo de Chao the weekend of Valentine's day on a Saturday night. Oh what a night it was... The hot spot in Down Town Chicago was filled with families, couples,tourists, and everything between ready to engage in the cheesy holiday! Once you're seated the whole dining experience begins.. The endless side dishes include brazilian po de queijo (warm cheese bread)...polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas yumm yummm yummm! You then have the option of choosing the salad bar but I do not advise you to do so because you need to save all the space you can for the endless meats... When the card that was given to you is red: No one comes to you and you enjoy what's on your plate However when its green... You have different meats coming towards you ready to be freshly sliced onto your plate From delicious top sirloin, filet mignon, beef ancho (rib-eye)....let me just put it this way ENDLESS delicious meats! To end the night with some strawberry topped creme brule! Ahhhh seriously AMAZING! From the service to the food :)
