So... I've come to see that I am the minority in my less than stellar review of Alinea. I shall then assume that it's me. I am both too immature and not cool enough to appreciate this restaurant. Must admit the atmosphere is pretty interesting. There are sliding doors, no windows, uber modern. But then again, so is a spaceship. But really - people actually like the food? Really? I guess my palate isn't sophisticated enough or personally not pretentious enough. "Heaven", "best dining experience ever", "touches every sense and beyond","gustatory hedonism", "food orgasm", like other reviews claim? Wow. Personally, a fried mozzarella stick has gotten me closer to climax than anything at this place. But again, it's just me. I gave it two stars because the caramel dessert was rather cool - it's solid and becomes liquid in your mouth. Guess that's my sexual innuendo in this review.
