Do yourself a huge favor and go eat here now. It is truly remarkable. My husband and I came hungry for brunch. Every aspect of the experience was perfect, from the huge pig canvases on the walls, to the expansive beer and wine list, to the awesome European butter, and of course the food. We ordered the cashew sticky buns and Publican bacon to share. My husband ordered the fried oyster omelette and I ordered the fried French toast. Our food came in ten minutes! As we took our first bites, we were speechless. Everything was perfect. The sticky buns were so soft, and the sauce was so tasty. The bacon was literally a hunk of pork belly, cured in-house, how bacon should be served! My french toast had this great caramelized crust and then a soft, buttery inside. The dish also came with maple breakfast sausage. I don't even like sausage and I could have had ten links! My husband's omelette was very tasty and unique and came with grilled sourdough toast. Our server was great and the decor is also really fun. We will definitely be back.
