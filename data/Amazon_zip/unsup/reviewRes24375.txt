The atmosphere is great, really dark and intimate. Loved the cheese and chocolate platters in the beginning and the end, but can't say the same for the main course. I'm willing to pay extra for amazing food, but come on, $50/person for 3 pieces of RAW chicken, that's a little too much, dont ya think Geja? Plus they charge $10 for splitting the dish. They have no timers or indicators for how long to cook the meat/seafood for and I ended up overcooking all my food, because I was afraid of getting sick form UNDERcooking it. Overall, I would much rather NOT have to worry about my chicken over-cooking, while I can do that at home on a weekday and NOT on my birthday.
