Quite possibly my favorite place on Earth! This place has everything you could ask for in a Latin restaurant: amazing drinks, outstanding food, and fabulous music! The atmosphere is impressive as are the raspberry mojitos.  Dress to dance and impress.  I go as often as possible- You will not be disappointed!
