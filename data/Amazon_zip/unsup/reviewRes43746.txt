My wife and I went here on a Monday evening for our anniversary. We were seated immediately and attended to by the friendly bus/water guy. They have half-priced bottles of wine with purchase of two entrees on Mondays, so we started with a great Rioja (one of the cheaper options) and nibbled on some bread. Our waiter, Burton, was great and started by telling us about the awesome specials that were going on. We ended up ordering both.  I had the 14oz Ribeye with 2 Jumbo Shrimp, Truffle Mashed Potatoes, and Asparagus. The Ribeye was wonderful; maybe a little too much marbling and just slightly overdone (I ordered it Medium Rare), but otherwise very flavorful and a great piece of meat. I don't eat truffles all that often, but I was not a big fan of the mashed potatoes and I actually left them on my plate, something I never do. The asparagus were asparagus. Very tasty. My wife had the Perch special, which was a beauitiful, light, tasty piece of fish. She loved the mushroom risotto. She also got a side of the Broccoli Fondue with melted Gouda Cheese. This was absolutely decadent and went great with both of our dishes. Our waiter brought us a complimentary cheesecake, which is always a nice touch.  The ambience is amazing. Very old school, lots of wood, nice, light jazz music playing at a reasonable volume.
