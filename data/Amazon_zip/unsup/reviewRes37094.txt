First of all, I'm not a beer fan but the Lambic Kriek is amazing. It's like a cherry slushy without the ice. I'm craving one right now just thinking about it. And the food......if you don't like the food here, I'm truly sorry. The mussels, onion rings, rabbit, chicken....the list goes on and on, AMAZING! It's not your typical stuff you mom would make and that's what I love.  We had Charcuterie Trio to start with. We were given a list of items to pick from outside of the menu. We picked the headcheese (tender and great favor) that is worth trying. I promise, if you like pig, you will love this. Then the liver mousse that melted in your mouth. And the duck prosciutto that was so delicate.  For the main course my husband had the rabbit and it wasn't gamey and very tender. Just fell off the bone. It has a little touch of spice to it. He love the light salad or vegs on top that he couldn't quite figure out what everything was. But with each bite, he was saying, "yum". I had the PB & J sandwich. The mac and cheese was amazing, great favor and cheesy. I asked for a side of thin cut onion rings instead of the chips. Best onion rings I've had in a long time. Sandwich was good, not too rich and it was a nice change from the mussels I've been ordering for years.   The service is better than most places. They know their beer and give great recommendations on the food. The owner is also very friendly if you ever have the chance to meet him. Just a regular hardworking guy with a great business plan! Cheers!
