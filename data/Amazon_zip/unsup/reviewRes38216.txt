After having a disappointing experience at Lou Malnati's, I texted my friend from the midwest and asked her for suggestions and she said Giordano's. We went at 4PM and they said there was a line so we had to order the pizza and return in 40 minutes..we did that and when we came back and got our table, our pizza came out in 15 minutes...even though it was ready I guess it took some time to get out because the restaurant was PACKED with people..even though it was well before typical dinner time. I really enjoyed the special...it was a real deepdish! I couldn't even eat anymore after the 2nd slice. So filling and so much flavor..I really enjoyed this pizza, but I think that too much of it too often might be overkill.
