I am a huge fan of this place. I went for lunch and was thrilled to see a beet salad on the menu. It was very good. I ordered fish and chips which I have not had in many years and it was amazing. I was able to try three different desserts and the molten chocolate cake was out of control. I loved the feel and decor of the restaurant. Highly highly recommended.
