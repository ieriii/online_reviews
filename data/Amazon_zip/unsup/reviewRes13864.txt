I love this place, and I can't wait to go back and take more people. Pros - Great food. Everything tastes homemade like someone's Momma made it. Portions are also big, but not ridiculous. - BYOB and theres no corkage fee. I saw people bringing in large containers of margaritas for large groups. - The food has a great price point. We had empanadas, skirt steak, shrimp, and some slow cooked chicken dish. Everything was great, and the bill was under 100. - They have a great sangria. All you need is the red wine. - Fun atmosphere, great outside seating. I felt like I was on vacation. Cons The only negative thing is that the bathroom is small, and there's only 1...and it's in the middle of the kitchen. I kept drinking to much wine, and it was a pain to have to go to the bathroom. Oh well....
