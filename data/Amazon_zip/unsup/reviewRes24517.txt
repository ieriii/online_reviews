I was travelling through Chicago and passed Irazu a few times. Since I'd lived in Costa Rica and have never seen a Costa Rican restaurant in the U.S., I was intent on trying it. Irazu came through - delicious gallo pinto; plantains, and iced coffee mixed with horchata. Not too sweet. My friend had the avocado with scrambled eggs (also great), and we sampled the oatmeal shake. If you like sweet, you'll love the shake. Tasty. And prices were very reasonable. Great meal. I hope to be back soon!
