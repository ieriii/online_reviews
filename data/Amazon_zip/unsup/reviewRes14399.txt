I won't go back again. We went before the dinner crowd so we could get a table. Score. Ordered the Alaskan King crabs to split with my son. And we each got a bowl of soup for starters. For those prices, can't they put a bowl of rolls or something on the table? Instead, you get basket of individually wrapped 'pepperidge farm" type crackers. Gross. He got the french onion soup. I got a bowl of chowder. Both were not hot and both had a distinct sweet, almost sugary taste. In addition, my chowder was nothing but a mush of tasteless slop with a few chunks of what tasted like canned clams. Campbells with a little salt is better. The service was just as lukewarm. In fact, we were victims of a change of shift. Two more things really bugged me. They do not have the type of utensils to really crack crab legs so that you can break them in the middle and pull the crab meat. They only offered that little knife thingy. Well my kids were raised to crack and pull. Not cut down the shell and dig out little pieces of what was by the way, previously frozen not sweet crab meat ($40.00 an order). To top it off, it really bugged me to see the owner pacing in and out of the back, out the front door, staring down the street and out the window. I won't go back.
