Sushi X gets 5 stars in my book for its food, however the atmosphere is a bit lacking. Sushi X is located in a very small, inconspicous building off of Chicago Ave. Once you enter inside you're overwhelmed by a anime cartoon projected onto the wall. Most guests don't seem to pay attention to it, so I think they'd be better off without it. The servers are always helpful and nice. Definitely stop here if you're looking for great sushi and better yet a BYOB restaurant.
