I had dinner here on Friday evening. I thought if was an ok place. The decor is supposed to have that 1920's feel of colonial Vietnam. The service was excellent. The lighting inside is on the dark side. I had to use the candle to see the menu. I first ordered a mojito which was excellent. I had the pho soup which was very good. Appetizers were spring rolls which were also very good. My entree # 29 turned out to be very similar to a combination chow mein. It wasn't seasoned very well because I needed salt to add to it. My desert was creme brulee. It was excellent because I could tell they used a torch to carmelize the sugar instead of the broiler. Overall I thought I could get better Vietnamese food for a better price in the Argyle and Broadway area. Kinda pricey but it is on Rush street. I 'm glad I don't need to feel I have to frequent places like this because I have been around the world. In fact, I am going to Viet Nam next year.
