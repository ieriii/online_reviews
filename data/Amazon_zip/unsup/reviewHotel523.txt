Very clean, comfortable spacious rooms. The hotel has a great small gym which I took advantage of and also a pool that looks very nice although I didn't have an opportunity to go swimming. The best part is that breakfast is included with your stay and you can get a hot beverage any time of day. I will definitely stay here again on my next business trip to Chicago.
