Came here with some co workers, I gotta give it an A for service and an A for ease of making a reservation. We sat on the top floor. The place is nice and great for happy hour and lounge food in the cool area upstairs. the price is ok but the food is NOT all that. We had this fried stuffed prawn appetizer and spareribs, it was NOT all that. It was OK. The prawns were big and all but nothing impressive. The ribs, barely any meat and it was cold. We ordered the shrimp and broccoli fried rice, so bland. The good thing was that they did put a lot of shrimp pieces, so I have to give it up for that. We got the fried trout..pretty good, great sauce, but nothing so WOW about it to be $22. We also got the yam and chicken curry..bland and nothing spectacular. We also got the duck and that was just not impressive at all..dry and bland..had to ask for hot sauce and in the end, it was like just some plain dry duck with lots of siracha..bleh! The only yummy thing was the mango and vanilla dessert. We also got the mousse cake but that was ook.
