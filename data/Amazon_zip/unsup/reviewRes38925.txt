Stellar breakfast with nice outdoor seating and friendly service. This is probably the most cost effective Michelin star restaurant I have been to in any city. All the breakfast items I have tried were very good. They aren't overly fancy, which I view as a positive. They are just good concepts with a couple ingredients and expertly executed on.
