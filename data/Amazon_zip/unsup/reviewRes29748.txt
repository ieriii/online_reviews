The 3rd Coast is not short on charm -- the place is delightfully anti-trendy, resembling a cafe you might find in a small town train station, or the lobby of a Comfort Inn. It's so not cool that it's cool. It's a wine bar that also serves breakfast all day and has muffins in saran wrap in a glass display case. You can get a side of blueberry pancake with your burger. I can't say I've really ever been any place like it. The food is better than you would think based on the decor. The New Orleans burger I ordered was juicy and cooked rare, as I requested. Kudos for not overcooking that thin-ish patty, grill guy! Pretzel bun = genius. The Diablos beef sandwich is also great. The breakfast platters are massive. The wine list is perhaps not expansive or interesting enough to earn the title of wine bar. It's probably partially a marketing thing, to establish that they're not just a breakfast joint. The vibe inside is definitely more diner than wine bar. The servers are very chill and super friendly. They actually seem happy to be there, or at least not counting the minutes till they get to leave. Women, you have to use the ladies' room. It contains the most flattering full-length mirror in all of Chicago, I kid you not.
