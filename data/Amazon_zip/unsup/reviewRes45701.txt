I really like this place, it was designed with a lot of good taste and the bathrooms are beyond lovely( I have a bathroom fixation, I know its wierd). Service was good, manager was Irish, she was very friendly. The food was good, esp the potato app, but just a little out of my budget to go here as often as I would like to.
