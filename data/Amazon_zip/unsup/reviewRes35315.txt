Went to dinner here and I wasn't feeling that hungry at first. As soon as we walked in the aroma made me wanna eat like a mad man. BYOB was what makes this place even better. We had the Peking Duck which is carved in front of you. The rest of the meat on the bones is used for soup and fried rice. Genius. The duck you rap in white bun and some veggies... Savory goodness. We also order a pork dish which was ok. This place is awesome. I'd go back to try other things but always go for the Duck!
