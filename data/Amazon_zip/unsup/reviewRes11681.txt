Great food can more often than not make up for bad service. (see weiner circle for example). what happene to you last nite was probably a freak nite where 3 people called in sick. I used to work at a restaurant - these things happen in the rest industry. Usual guy could havebeen on vacation. I would never judge it by one visit.  Thie pizza here is great. and so is the beer.
