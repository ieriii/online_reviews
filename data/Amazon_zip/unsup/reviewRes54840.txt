I have never understood the hoopla surrounding Hopleaf. Yes, it has a million beers and even an extensive wine list. But the crowd that surrounds this place reminds me of bees swarming a honeycomb and it is what keeps me far, far away. Before checkplease and other media that this place received, it used to be a quaint and quiet neighborhood place. Now, it feels like the entire art district of Wickerpark and Bucktown has transcended on Andersonville. Don't even think about getting a table on almost any night of the week in the bar area. THANK GOD it is now a non-smoking establishment. But just walking by the place, I feel my lungs collapsing from smoke inhalation. Smoking must be a requirement for every person who goes to Hopleaf. I do feel devious that I can't wait to watch those hipsters freeze their asses off when Winter strikes its ugly head again. Anyways, I digress. What's with having to present an I.D. to pick up a to-go order at the bar? I'm not staying for a drink and clearly, you can see that I'm walking right up to the bar to get my food. Clearly, I'm of age. It just seems a bit crazy that I have to dig through my purse to show an I.D. only to be in and out within a minute. Food is nothing to write home about. Could've been a cute and quaint neighborhood spot, but unfortunately has become an entity that I choose to stay far, far away from.
