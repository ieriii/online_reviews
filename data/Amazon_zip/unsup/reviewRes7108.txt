This place is great! Went here with a bunch of girlfriends and we left raving! Alfredo was our waiter and couldn't have made our experience any better. He truly takes his job very seriously and provided exceptional service. Ask for him! The atmosphere is great, as it is pretty nice for a bbq place. You can still feel like you can show up in jeans, but you could still make it a nice weekend night out. We were thrilled to not only meet the chef, (a female, which we love, but she has some interesting creds too...was challenged to a throw down with Bobby Flay, and has been on BBQ Pitmasters a few times too), but we were given a kitchen tour! We also saw their private, upstairs room, which would be a great spot for a party or group dinner. You have the upstairs to yourself, there is an enclosed room with a wine wall, and then an adjacent living room area with a big screen TV. I'm even more thrilled to discover that q is now on OpenTable...even better! I'll definitely be back.
