So I had prepped by reading reviews and I must say, I enjoyed the Violet Hour. Yes, it is pretentious, but that doesn't stop 'El Comandante' from being a delicious beverage; this isn't the place to go with a chatty group, but for an intimate, low-volume setting, it was great. It was almost full but not with a wait on Sunday at 8pm~ make sure you check out the pics to see what the entrance looks like because there really isn't a sign and the door looks like one you're not supposed to open. Cocktails are $12 and there is a large menu divided by spirit. Def want to go back!
