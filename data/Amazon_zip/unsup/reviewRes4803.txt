Purple Pig is an over-rated tapas joint, with communal seating that reminded me of an elementary school cafeteria. The good: The JLT (Jowl Lettuce Tomato) comes with a fried egg on top and is tasty. The mussels were fresh and served in a tasty broth. The chicken thigh kebabs bordered on dry but thanks to the delicious tzatziki sauce ended up being one of the meal's highlights. The Wagyu sirloin tip was pretty tasty, but the potatoes with olive and bone marrow vinaigrette really left the dish on a positive note. The meh: The charred cauliflower was a salty mess. The fried Brussels sprouts, while not as disgusting as regular Brussels sprouts were still not something I'd want to eat more than a forkful of. The bone marrow is average at best, and probably only raved about on this site about because it's now hip for yuppies to eat the food their grandparents escaped Europe to avoid. The calamari (or possibly octopus) came grilled and served in a bowl full of some sort of beans, but if there were more than 6 pieces of calamari (or possibly octopus) in that dish I'd be shocked. All in all I'd say this place is in the 2 1/2-3 star range, and I'm rounding up because the service was good. I wouldn't say to avoid the Purple Pig but I definitely can't understand why people are waiting for over an hour to eat average tapas while crammed next to strangers. I'm glad I had the chance to see what all the hype is about, but I don't see myself going back to Purple Pig unless you're paying.
