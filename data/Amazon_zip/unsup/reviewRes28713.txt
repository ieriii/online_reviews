I had been dying to go here for a few years, and finally managed to convince my boyfriend to take me for my birthday. He was a bit stunned when he called for a reservation and found that they're not open on Sundays or Mondays AND don't take reservations. He was instructed to line up outside the restaurant at 4:15 to have a shot at a reservation for that night. So...that's what we did. Actually, we arrived at about 4:45 making us about 50th in line. They opened the doors at 5:00 and once we made it to the front the wait for two was up to 1 and a half hours. We expected as much though, so we headed to the bar for drinks. FABULOUS drinks. I got something champagne based and the bf got a mango mojito. Both excellent. We got a great table outside and enjoyed great appetizers. The main course was slow to arrive, but we were in no hurry in the great weather, and our server was very polite about it. The bf's chicken dish was waaaaay better than my pork dish, but both were tasty. Prices aren't outrageous either, at about $22 for most entrees. I don't know if I'd go back, but I'm definitely glad I went. Very enjoyable dining experience!
