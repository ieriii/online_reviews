So, many raves befuddle me. This is neither a pan of the place, but nor is it a glowing five star review.  Take a hunk of pork shoulder and braise it until fork tender. Then, whip up some potato with a tad more cream than needed. Throw on some gravy and serve with a parsley garnsh. Now, make-up a few dozen similar tapas-like things, serve in a walk-in closet wired for sound and you have The Purple Pig.  I'd go back after a hard day at work and needing to blow off steam, for sure.
