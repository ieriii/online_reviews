I want to like this place. There are times the food is absolutely mind blowing (the vegan mac and cheese and the vegan nachos have never failed me!) and there are times where the food makes my tongue numb from the salt (reuben! I'm calling you out!)The atmosphere is wonderful and the music is a win for the most part, but man - avoid that reuben at all costs unless you just enjoy licking salt shakers...
