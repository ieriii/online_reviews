Tru is truly exceptional. There are no words that can sum up the experiences you will receive at this place. I've dined at Tru more than once and every time is a new experience. We sat in the private room near the kitchen. The service and hospitality is impeccable. We had 8 courses paired with 8 variety of Bordeaux, after the 8 courses came desert and cheese pairings. After the dining experiences, everyone received an autographed (chef and master somnier) menu.
