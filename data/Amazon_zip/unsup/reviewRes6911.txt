We checked out the Q a few weeks ago on a long weekend vacation and we weren't disappointed. A bit tough to find this place, cute little white building off a side street. No beer on tap, as others have said but I'm cool with it. Capitol Supper Club? Yes please! I've missed you! One of the best things about visiting Chicago is getting some of my old Sconnie beers sneaking across the border. The service here, it should be mentioned, is the best I've had in a long while. The food - very good, I'd say. Sean had the brisket which was very tender and excellent. I had the pulled pork/chicken platter. Also really really good. Baked beans - great. Sauces - varied and really tasty. Cornbread - the only real disappointment. Really dry and not good. The only thing I have against this place (other than the sub-par cornbread) is the atmosphere. This was the weirdest BBQ place I've ever been to. We didn't know what to expect so we just wore jeans and casual attire......and while not terribly so, we did seem under-dressed compared to the rest of the diners. I found this odd. I have never been to a barbeque place where jeans weren't the norm. Or one with a coat check. I mean the Maitre d' was wearing a full-on SUIT! Complete with pocket square. Not really bad, just very strange. Bottom line - good food, skip the cornbread, wear some khakis.
