I've never left Ruth's Chris unsatisfied. I think this is the best steak in Chicago. The petite filet is perfect. My sister loves the pork chops as well. I also really like the atmosphere here; very classy - it's a great place to go with family, friends, a date....pretty much whatever. The one thing I wish they had was souffle like Morton's... but oh well. Their desserts are good anyway, just don't order the ice cream sundae because it's not that good (and is the reason I had to take away a star).
