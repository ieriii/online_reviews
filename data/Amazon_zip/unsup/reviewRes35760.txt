Yummy! I may have finally found my new favorite Chinese place in Chicago. Considering I'd all but given up on finding good Chinese food north of Chinatown, this is a big deal. I plan on going back to try more, but myself and two others shared the awesome Peking Duck Dinner ofr $30. I'm not a gigantic fan of duck, but this was hot, crispy and amazingly rich. It was dinner and a show since they come out and let you watch them carve it up. The first course is the hot, sliced duck in soft buns with veggies and a sweet hoisin sauce. YUM! This was the favorite of my two dining companions. Then comes the duck/egg/daikon soup. I wasn't really impressed, but get that they have to cut corners somewhere if they're going to charge only $30 for the entire duck meal. The duck fried rice was awesome, though and my favorite. I'm definitely going back for the fried rice, you can guarantee. It wasn't as greasy as most places are and had a great, basic chinese take-out done well feel about it. We finished the meal with impossibly fruity strawberry and pineapple sorbets (also included in the price). With three people, we ate until we were stuffed and had enough leftovers for lunch the next day for my boyfriend. Definitely recommend this for duck lovers and for anyone who wants a fun, cheap dinner out with multiple, good courses. The atmosphere is no frills and pretty dank, but the service was friendly, funny, fast and nice. Very good.
