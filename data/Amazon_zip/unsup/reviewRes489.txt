Ok, the food was out of this world. BUT, there was ONE, count 'em, ONE woman anywhere in the restaurant beyond the coatroom, and apparently when I asked, there are two on the kitchen/ server staff in total. That means the ENTIRE server staff is male, and most of the kitchen too. They told me its a pretty demanding job, with lots of stairs etc, but I'm sorry, with a place of this caliber, it would not be hard to attract qualified, high quality female personnel who can stand a workout. A large element of the meal is service, with many dramatic courses, and I found the gender imbalance an egregious problem that partly ruined my experience. I'd urge the restaurant to reconsider its hiring practices.
