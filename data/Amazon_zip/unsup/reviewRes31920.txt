In town for a biz trip. Alone. Sitting at the bar. Alone, and this place still delivers . Duck balls, yes balls, and miso black cod are perfect. Cool vibe. Bad: too loud, service just average. Im droppin at least $75. My service should be better, or at least fake it. Id still recommend just on food and fun alone. Next time i bring a crowd, and we make some noise. Cheers
