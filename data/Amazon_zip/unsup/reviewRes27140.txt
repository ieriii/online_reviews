Twice - once for my birthday (right after Graham opened), and once for my wife (just last night). She loved Graham so much - the great food, the interesting touches, the ambiance, and casual nature. . .that we had to go back. I actually liked the 2nd time a lot better than the first. I started with the Foi Gras Partfait (a foi gras over rice krispy treat. . you must taste it to believe it.  A celebration of the repealed ban on Foi Gras! There was four of us, and though we tried a lot of different items. . .I'll stick to the highlights. Venison Schnitzel was great (a take on the German, but different - amazing).  The crusted scallops (was that hazlenut? damn!). . . What about the Pumpkin Creme Brulee? good - but no where as good as the deconstructed snickers bar. Almost forgot - the red wine risotto . . I liked it better than the cheeze it one :)
