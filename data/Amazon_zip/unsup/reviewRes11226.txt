ok... for me, it is a Chicago staple... I used to come here all the time, and there is no reason why I haven't been here in quite some time other than to try others... yesterday, I experienced it for the first in years was glad to see nothing has changed... quality, generous food... pleasant, informed service... comfy, bright atmosphere... when it's right, it's right... no need to change anything...
