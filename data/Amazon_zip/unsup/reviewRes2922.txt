Tru was enjoyable...but I wouldn't say it is my top pick for fine dining in Chicago. The atmosphere was probably the best part of the dinner. I also enjoyed the chair for my purse, cheese cart and dessert tray. Well, be honest, I enjoyed the cheese cart the most. My foie gras wasn't the best and had a rough patch that appeared to be intentionally hidden. I'm kind of leary of a business (Lettuce Entertain You) that has restaurants on such a low to high spectrum.
