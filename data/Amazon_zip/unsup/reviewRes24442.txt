What would I do without this place? Love this light & airy bakery/cafe which opens late! There should be more cafes that open late for people to hang out/linger after dinner. I tried their ice coffee before and liked it. This time I had the galaktoboureko, but thought the custard was too doughy for my liking, though flavor-wise it was quite pleasant. Service was a bit slow, would be nice if they'd just leave the water decanter so we didn't have to hunt them down for water. But otherwise a good place to relax.
