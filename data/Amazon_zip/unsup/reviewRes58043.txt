We went to this restaurant today w/our 2 grandsons; a big mistake!When we arrived, we waited 10 minutes for the waitress to honor us w/her presence. We ordered & she came back w/my husband's soup & entree together, no other food. When I inquired where the other 3 soups & entrees were, she walked away. After waiting almost 10 minutes, my husband finally got up to complain to the cashier/manager. Another waitress came w/glasses of water & then came back w/the other 3 entrees & soup, again, all at the same time. There was't enough room on the table for all the dishes!The food was so-so, servings were small & not very tasty. And since when do you have to pay extra for rice? It was a very expensive meal for what we got.I am at a loss to understand what all the hype is about this place.I should also say the restaurant was not busy; it was well after the lunch hour. Only 2 other tables were occupied. I would not recommend this place. I have had better, more flavorful, meals @Noodles.I agree w/J.C.R. about the waitress; hopefully, she will be fired. No restaurant today can stay in business w/this type of service.
