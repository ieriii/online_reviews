So they used to have a REALLY awesome waitress, named Abby, who moved to California, and after that, the service there really started to suck. I haven't been back in probably a year, and I really do miss the Cuban veggie sandwich and the plantains. I may have to make a trek back. The couple who owns this place enlists the aid of their daughter, who I always thought was rather attractive. The wife is surly and takes no guff. The husband is a CTA employee. I'm not sure what any of that has to do with anything, except perhaps if you like surly, or attractive Costa Rican women, or want to shoot the shit about the CTA and it's mismanagement. The water based shakes are pretty good, a bit pricey for what you get, but doable. Would smash again.
