First of all, the place is gorgeous. I am in love with their tables and chairs. If they could tell me how I could get my hands on them, I'd totally splurge. It was a weeknight, and it was more busy that I thought it could be. The atmosphere is nice and casual, with a hint of sophistication here and there. Too bad their food didn't live up to the decor. We had 7 people in our party. It was mommy's bday so I thought it would be nice to try something new. BIG mistake... I don't remember everything we ordered but we spent upwards $500, so I'm sure there wasn't too much on the menu we didn't order...We gave the flatbreads a try, the paella, short ribs, dates, mushrooms, baby squid ink pasta, fish, lobster, steak, sangria, potatoes, scallops, shrimp, etc.... Almost everything was either underseasoned or oversalted. I think the best dish was the grilled rib eye we ordered which is sad because I can make a hell of a grilled steak at home. The flat breads came in second to the steak. The Sangria was SO boring... much different from the way they described it in the menu, but daddy managed to finish off the pitcher. Our waiter was mucho attentive, knowledgeable, and nice but I wish he would've recommended me to get the chefs selection thing for $55/ person because I didn't like the fact that 2 tinyyy dishes came out at a time, to be shared amongst 7 people... I tried to have our waitor wait for things to come out before he started serving but he said the kitchen was scared that it would be too much on our table. As if too much food was a bad thing....
