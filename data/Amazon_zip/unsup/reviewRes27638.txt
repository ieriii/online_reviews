Great place for pizza when you want a change of pace from the typical Chicago-style deep dish. Stick with their pan-style which leaves the best crunchy and crispy crust around the edge. Usually we order the pepperoni and sausage and you can't go wrong. If it wasn't for the very slow service (always slow from when it's packed on weeknights and weekends to even at 3:00p.m. with only 5 other tables occupied), I'd be giving it 5 stars. Sometimes you always have to have an empty glass of beer or soda at this place. Oh well.
