I can't believe I haven't Yelped this place yet. We come here at least 4 times a year, while making numerous stops to other Brazilian steak houses and South American restaurants. This one, BY FAR, is our fave. I love coming for dinner - the turnover rate of the meat is high and the service is super attentive. Whenever we'd asked for anything, it would magically appear within 1 minute, like they're communicating via telepathy. The bread was always warm and soft and replaced instantly as soon as my fiance polished off basket after basket (he inhales food!) The polenta dish is much better at dinner than at lunch b/c it's actually warm and soft on the inside and crispy on the outside - I usually avoid it at lunch meals when it's cold and dense (gross).  I was very surprised that when I asked the server what kind of wine he recommends for me, he offered one of the cheapest ones. And it was right on the money. Normally I feel like the server offers the most expensive ones to make a few more bucks in tip- in this case, he made more $ in tip b/c he actually listened to me. Good job :)
