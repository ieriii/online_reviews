There are so many reasons to not like this place. For the price, the setting was crowded and weird, the music was loud and funky, the location was out of the way, and the reservation process was a pain. BUT I FREAKIN LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is out of this world good! The octopus salad, the veal-heart tagliatelle, and the extra truffle ravioli were life-changingly delicious. The flavors were unique, but oddly enough the food brought a sense of nostalgia - you feel that you've had this before, but you can't remember where and when. Either way, the food is just so damn good!! The rest of the dinner was equally delicious. The only thing I found unimpressive was the dessert (good but not as good as the savories). But since the rest of the dinner surpassed my already-high expectations, I think a 5-star is absolutely justified.  A few words on its service. Don't expect the traditional fine-dining service. They call you "dude," "man," or "brother." They all sound and look high on something that could be medicinal or herbal. But I felt welcome there. They were so genuine and friendly I felt I was their house guest. There was a charm in their funky way of service. It's not Alinea service, but it's certainly not Chinatown's piss-in-your-face attitude (btw I'm Chinese, so don't send me hate mails calling me racist. Just ripping on my own people here).  Plus, BYO worked like a charm. My glass was never empty - this is more than I could say about some of the other high-end places with "traditional" service.  If there are two places in Chicago that you MUST go, I'd say it's this and Alinea. Go to Alinea to feel pampered. Go to Schwa to feel like you're a guest at the chef's home. Both with amazing food!
