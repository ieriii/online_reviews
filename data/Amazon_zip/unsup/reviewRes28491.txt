I had a great experience at Graham Elliots and ate there when it first opened. My Beef Carpaccio, Halibut, and strawberry shortbread-ish dessert were all wonderful.  That being said, I've heard from others that said they weren't wowed although I have a feeling those two people I talked to went after the Michelin ratings came out and were expecting something different. Good food doesn't always mean high-end table clothes and pretentious waitstaff. I loved it and would recommend it to everyone!
