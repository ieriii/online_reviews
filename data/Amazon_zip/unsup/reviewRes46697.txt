The food is satisfying and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere fun and inviting. The main reason I'm writing a review in the first place, however, is to spread the word about cookie in a bowl. Pure genius! I can't believe I didn't invent it myself. And the cookie is warm, ever so warm, inside the ice cream. Even non-sweet-toothed friends have sung the dessert's praises many times over. So go forth in good cheer ye dessert hunter. Eat your sandwich or wrap and enjoy. Then order cookie in a bowl and be raptured, or at least really, really happy in a deliciously superficial way.
