what happened to you Garcias? I think perhaps you're still trying to pay for the remodel?  We used to grab Garcias frequently as a good buy for a to go meal. I decided to grab a veggie burrito tonight - beans, rice, lettuce and a few bites of tomato - $6 - no guac, no cheese, no sour cream - $6. Are you kidding me? I guess I should thank you for saving me the extra calories. So long old friend....
