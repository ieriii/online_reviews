I had them cater an event for work and it was perfect. The delivery was right on time, the food was hot, there was the right amount of food for the number of people and they were a joy to work with. The food was so delicious - everyone loved it! And their vegetarian dishes were incredible for our vegetarians. Would order from them again in a heartbeat!
