After my second visit this Sunday before Memorial Day I decided to write my review. Got to this prohibition themed drinkeria around 7:15 (to avoid the lines that form early, ~8pm) to which it was still light out. To get into the place, you end up feeling your way through the multiple layers of velveteen curtains that made me flash back to that scene in one of the freddy movies where the future victim is under the sheets of their bed, crawling and crawling through the sheets to try and get out of the bed but only finds freddy. Well kind of like this anyways except at the end of the peeling back of the sheets there is a friendly hostess in the darkest room I've drank or eaten in. Was seated in the booth for the first time (well I guess thats the only place a group of 5 can sit). This booth had the small window to the outside and as the sun went down we got to partake in the actual "Violet Hour". Yet it was kind of annoying since the darkness of the place is one of its major selling points (yet at the same time an annoying point as you have to hold the menu's up to the candle light, basically setting them on fire to see anything). I try to make a point to get at least three drinks per visit (yes thats $33 clams). One of which I usually want to be infused delitcately with Wild Turkey 101 (is there anything delicate about WT 101? If so this is the place to get it). No appetizers tonight, but last time I was there, they ran out of the crab cakes. I would've gotten that fried BPJ thingy if I was givin the option. Our group only had one drink all night that had the orange peel-fire trick performed as it was served(downer). Cool place to take friends from out of town or to experience a couple times per season as the menu changes. Also notable, they have George Dickel whiskey for your pounding pleasure.
