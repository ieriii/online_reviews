come here with your appetite. The food here is glutinous and mind blowing. And the place is huge!!! You wouilld never guess from driving on Ohio, as there are no large windows to the place  The meats are all succulent and flavorful. The capirinhas are made pretty strong!!! Salad bar galore!!!! Have great cheeses and breads, but keep those as bay, as you want to save your appetite for the meats great service, great food, great ambience
