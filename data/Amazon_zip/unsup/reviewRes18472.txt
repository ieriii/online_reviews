Caro Mio has a special place in our heart because we were engaged here. Years later, it is still amazing. We had Christmas dinner last night with my parents, and naturally will be enjoying the leftovers for days to come. Being the kind of people that make homemade pasta in our own kitchen, the only acceptable way for us to carb out away from home is...well, homemade pasta. They've done away with all the greenery in the front window, which is kind of a shame because it was so pretty, but the place is always packed. More seating just naturally won out. Entrees take a bit of time to come out, but I would not want it any other way. This is beautiful made-to-order pasta. My father had the monster of all dishes, the special chicken parmigiana with homemade rigatoni. (Incidentally, this was also the dish I chose on the magical engagement night. My husband must really love me considering he still proposed after watching me scarf down half a plate of a not-so-ladylike dish.) Hubby went with the linguine and clams Diablo - a classic, nice and spicy and garlicky. I had the angelotti with peas and prosciutto, one of my standby favorites. The perfect mix of sweet and salty. But my mom won for the night. The special pappardelle with sun dried tomatoes, chicken, spinach, and gratineed to perfection. Damn. Go early for a little romance, the later it gets, the more crowded (and noisy.) But walking home from Caro Mio, a little boozy, smelling of garlic, hand and hand with your sweetie, the other hand holding tomorrow's lunch, it doesn't really get better than that.
