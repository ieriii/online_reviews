I went to this place a while back, and I loved the ambiance and the environment. The food was pretty good, and was impressed that you could get a glass a wine for $4 and a beer for $2, but still had the option of getting an expensive cocktail. I was definitely planning on returning. And I did, but it was even better. Gilt Bar must have revamped some of their recipes because the food was much better than I remembered it being. The mussels are amazing, the cauliflower delicious, and the caprese salad fantastic. I recommend this place to anyone!
