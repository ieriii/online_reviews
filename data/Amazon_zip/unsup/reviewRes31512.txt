Went here for "guys night." Decent place, however, I'm not the biggest steak fan... which would explain why I went here and ordered the Lamb Chops. They were really great, and my friends loved their steaks. If you go, be sure to get their French onion soup... OUTSTANDING. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, we shared sides of the creamed spinach - I've had better; the gouda mac & cheese - very good; sauteed asparagus - OK; wasabi mashed potatoes - AMAZING. I only had a non-alcoholic drink, but my friends went ahead and ordered bottles of wine that were 3 figures each. So at the end when the bill came to a crazy amount, I only have myself to blame, since I didn't taste any of the wine myself. Anyways, the service was very good, but a little overkill at times, like the water being refilled each time I literally took a sip. Again, i'm not the biggest steak fan, and I enjoy my food, but at a moderate price. So I doubt I'll be back here again, but you never know.
