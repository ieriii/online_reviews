Am I hip enough to hang out here? Probably not. But I've been in several times anyway because the food is great and the space is warm and comfortable and it's a huge improvement over what used to be Speakeasy. The wine list is eclectic and short, which apparently garners one of two reactions: "WTF?" for those looking desperately for something recognizable to "Cool!" for those happy to see that someone has taken some care with the selections. Just a forewarning on that if you plan on having wine. I haven't tested the staff's knowledge of the list, but from what I've tried so far it ranges from inoffensive to pretty good so if your knowledge is minimal you probably won't accidentally order something you hate. The food is great for sure (the sweet potato fries are the best I've had, I believe) and I appreciate and support the green/local mission, I just sort of wish it was all served up with a little less attitude. Maybe it's just me, but there does seem to be a bit of a divide between the neighborhood clientele and the hipsters that flood the place. I haven't encountered "bad" service, but I've definitely run into something like "disdainful" service and eyerolling answers to questions. I'm happy they are there, and not because we needed something "upscale" or "expensive", but because we in that particular section of RP/Edgewater need a few more real nearby options. Clearly it was going to take someone with a little weight behind them to pull this off and I think Uncommon Ground has what it takes to be successful in what is really a pretty awkward location.
