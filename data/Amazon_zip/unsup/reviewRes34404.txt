Nothing can beat the cheap delicious eats at Sultan's Market. When I first moved to Chicago I lived right across the street and it was the first place I found to eat, and I am glad I did. I have never had anything here that I wasn't happy with. The lentil soup is perfect, stuffed grape leaves are yummy and of course the falafel sandwich is perfect. And they deliver!
