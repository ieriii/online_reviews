I just had dinner at Piccolo Sogno. I have to say that the food is really Italian.. The appetizers were very good: my "burrata con culatello" was really excellent.. The pizza prosciutto was well done and tasted great; thin and crusted that is the way I love pizza. The meat was good. The desserts were delicious: I had "tortino al gianduia" super! My husband had "millefoglie" also very good. The only thing that needs some improvement is the service: too slow. Highly recommended.
