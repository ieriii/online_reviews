I went to Longman & Eagle on a Wednesday night with a group of 5 and had a great evening! The wine/beer/cocktail selection is well-rounded, and the variety of dishes is impressive! We didn't know what some of ingredients referenced on the menu were but had no fear.  We shared some small plates, scallops (delish!), bone marrow (okay), and pretzel with cheese (never fails). They were all about appetizer size. My entree - pork belly - was perfectly tender yet crispy, and the side dishes were tasty though small.  Portions overall are moderate, but the food is of good quality and appropriately priced. The ambiance is cozy but many notches above that of a typical pub. The service was good as well. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well and we would definitely return!
