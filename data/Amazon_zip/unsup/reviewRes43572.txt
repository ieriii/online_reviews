I admit, I dragged my boyfriend here because the name drew me in. The cafe is so cute! It was definitely packed and there was a big line (probably didn't help that the Renegade Craft Fair was going on ;-)) so we opted for take-out. They make a killer avocado sandwich and pack a pickle to go with a bag of homemade chips (hardly salted, so I liked them, but my boyfriend didn't). I'm definitely coming back! ** Update: 5/17/08 ** We finally came back for another day in Bucktown and decided to eat in this time. I don't know what the big fuss is about the line and the crowd because we didn't wait long (even though it was 11:30am) and got a great table with room enough for us to stretch out and not bump into anyone. Given that you order before being seated and collect your own silverware, I don't know what kind of sit down service people are expecting. We were just happy that our food arrived promptly and tasted good - we split the avocado sandwich again and the pancakes of the day (buttermilk with nuts, mm!), and my hazelnut latte was delicious.
