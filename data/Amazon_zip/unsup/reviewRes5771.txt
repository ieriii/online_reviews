The sea urchin linguine was indeed a hit. Creamy, rich and flavorful. Yet the serving size was simply too small. Sea urchin may be expensive, but couldn't they add more linguine in it? Sigh I also tried the truffle egg toast. Not bad, but the choice of asparagus seemed a little random. Plus the way it was done didn't go quite well with the toast. Again, tiny portion. Before I realized, it was all gone. Our waiter was patient and courteous, and I need to add points for that. I like their food; I just wish they were a little more liberal on the quantity.
