This place is fantastic. From the second we walked in we felt at home. Even though the place was quite full, the friendly host rushed around trying to get us a table and apologized prefusly for the five minute wait. They have a full wine bar, but we brought a bottle of our own and paid the $8 corkage which is totally reasonable considering they have a full bar. We ordered Massob-- so you get to pick a variety of dishes and they come on a communal sharing plate that everyone digs into with this doughy pita called injera--- I've had Ethiopian before but every time I forget which of these confusing names is my favorite. The waitress was so helpful! but what is more the menu outlines the options really well so you can get a feel for what is coming. The food itself was an intermingling of flavors. We got 1 lamb, 1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 tipalia, and 2 veggie dishes. I cannot even tell you which was my favorite because they were all delicious and tasted both sweet and savory. I am the kinda eater that loves variety. This is my heaven, Next to sushi i cannot think of a more fun place to go out to eat. I woke up the next day craving all the flavors and dying for just one more bite of that goodness. my only question is when can we go back?
