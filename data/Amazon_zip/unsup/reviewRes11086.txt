Alright, I've been to Piece quite a few times now, and while I absolutely hate going when it's crowded..........I'll do it. I've been seated all over the place and certain seats aren't as bad as others. The ones to the right of the bar (if you're looking at the bar).......or NORTH of the bar for those that know their directions suck. The tables/seats are up against the next table/seats and while we had a large party that just kept growing (started with 5 and grew to 12 at one point) my friends (and people in the parties at the tables on both sides of us) were in the way of servers.  I want to say these are the seats you can hop out the window, but that could have been another bar. Regardless, if the windows are indeed that close then my friends hopped out of them several times to go smoke just to avoid trying to get through the crowd. The pizza's good though. I'm not extremely hard to please when it comes to pizza, but I've come with many different people that like different (and sometimes random) things on their pizza and I've never been disappointed. Came here on my 22nd birthday and had leftovers that I brought to the Map Room and shared with bartenders and friends. I have had some awesome beers here, but seeing as how I haven't been drinking beer for awhile, I can't remember what.  I do seem to have the worst luck though, because as soon as I spot a beer I want they either don't have it anymore or ran out. Bummer. I'm not a fan of crowds and I usually tend to stay away from this area on weekends (ok, not true, I'll head to Flat Iron or Nick's every now and then) but if you're in that area you know what you're in for, so don't pass up some good food.  It can be pricey when you start adding ingredients to your pizza (which, when splitting with 3 other people can be a lot) but don't let that deter you.
