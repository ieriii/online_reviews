I really like Meli. I go there almost 4 times a month because the meals are delicious, pretty good portions and the best breakfast place in the neighborhood. But something about that lady who stays by the door....  She is never smiling, i dont feel welcomed there. i asked her to be seated to the bigger section last time i was there instead of the small section which is by the door and she rolled her eyes at me. She is there every-time i go and i get a terrible vibe from her. Mr. Meli, maybe you need to hire a new hostess for better business.
