I usually go to the west loop location since it's close to work, but I wanted my friend to try this place, and this one is closer to our apartments. We went on a Sunday during peak brunch hours, but the wait wasn't very long. And there was a huuuuge xmas tree for me to look at, so extra points for wishbone. I ordered what I typically get, eggs, chicken sausage, a biscuit, and cheese grits. I'm in love with the cheese grits. It's like the sauce from mac and cheese and some grits. So good. My friend ordered crunchy french toast which I had also considered. And that's how I discovered my new brunch love. Three of my favorite food things: french toast, corn flakes, and crunchiness. Hooray! I would've eaten all of her food if she had gotten up to go to the bathroom. And it even made the cheesey grits seem less amazing by comparison. I also got a strawberry mimosa which wasn't that great. But oh the crunchy french toast!
