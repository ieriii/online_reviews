I'm wary about giving this place too good a review - I love it so much, that if I give it I really tell people how awesome I think this place is, everyone else will start coming in droves and there'd be lines to get in going around the block on Friday evenings. Then where'd I get to go?The Third Coast is a lovely experience. The place looks like a genre painting, and the egshell white walls nicely complement the subdued lighting; the place is perfect for late night dining. I've been going to the place more or less weekly for about 2 years now, and love it. Its a favored haunt of local artists, in particular, and the place displays art of its own.The Third Coast is quiet, which is a rarity - most bars blast music from a jukebox, some drunk jerks playing ac/dc all night. Not this place - the music is unobtrusive, and you can hold a pleasant conversation at a normal talking voice. That's not to say that the music isn't there - in fact, it's noteworthy, an indie lover's dream. The waiters hook their iPods up to the speaker system, and they have immaculate tastes - I've never heard top 10 garbage here. I discover new music all the time here.More on the staff - during my usual hours there, they have spectacular waiters. My two favorites are mindreaders - I love it. They'll arrive with your drink when you're ready for it. They're also fascinating people, and on slower nights, have learned they are good conversationalists and overall fascinating people.The food here is good; you'll be able to find something that suits your taste. They have an excellent selection of beers which are well worth sampling.So, come on down, crowd the place, it's well worth it. But save me a spot, too.
