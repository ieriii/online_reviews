I'm a fan! Really cool and laid back environment, and the choices are a bit intimidating. I would highly suggest looking at the menu first via Internet, although sometimes it is not as updated. Me and a buddy went and split four different dogs. We had the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Sriracha Mustard and Sesame-Seaweed Salad,Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris, and chicken sausage with pepper jack cheese and guacamole. We went just to say that we went, really unique styles of dogs, so we have to come back and check out what the commoners are having. Overall meats were good a bit heavy with the sauces and such.
