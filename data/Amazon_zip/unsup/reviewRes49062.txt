Great service and an extensive menu. I loved their panchetta dish with lentils. The server gave us good recommendations to try. We went early on a saturday (before 6:30) and were able to be seated right away. It got quite busy in the next few hours as we ate. They have communal seating so you are very close to your neighbor at the table but it seems to work okay. I would have preferred to sit in a booth but they were full. Great wine and beer options.
