I made my second reservation before I left for the evening....three simple words: simply the best! Sprout is intoxicating. Provacative dishes with such love. I came here with friends for a Saturday night dinner . The ambiance is sleek and sexy, yet has a warmth to it. Would recommend taking public transportation or a taxi as parking on Fullerton can be tricky. My friend and I both ordered the Ono to start, the Pork as our entree's and Beet for dessert ( he ordered a different dessert). Our other friend ordered the Egg, Lamb and think the Banana. Christopher, our server, completed the overall dining experience. He was so personable and made excellent recommendations.
