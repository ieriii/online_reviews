In terms of the food, this place deserves five stars. The drinks could have been better, and all the more so because they seem to be a pretty large component of the dining experience there. We had breakfast dishes, plaintains, margaritas, mojitos, masa cake appetizers, and the chips and salsa. The chips weren't great, but that was no big deal in the grand scheme of things. The masa cakes were bite sized and topped with braised beef and were excellent - that would be my number one menu recommendation. Both of the egg dishes were also great, particularly one we had with mole. Stay away from the mojito unless you're really looking for a margarita, which is what it tasted like. The mint taste was negligible. I can't speak to service because we sat at the bar. I wouldn't recommend doing that because it gets very crowded even at lunch with people leaning over you to buy Frontera merchandise.
