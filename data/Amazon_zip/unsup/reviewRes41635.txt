I find Bonsoiree to be a true diamond in the rough. The wife and I have been here three times, and have thoroughly enjoyed our experience each time. Although it is located in a 'hood not known for its restaurant or nightlife scenes, the chef there is amazing, and provides a great meal (the one negative is that the price is a bit high). Further, although the menus are set, they are very accommodating to those with dietary restrictions, as my wife does. For that, they should be roundly commended, as the staff has gone above and beyond the call of duty every time we've dined here.
