Never had Costa Rican food, but my God....I shall be back! I had their vegetarian burrito (their menu claims its award winning....Challenge Accepted). Upon its consumption, I awarded it the Maram's Delicious Burrito Award and the Contains No Meat Award for Central U.S. It had so many flavors going on. I think it was that plaintain, yeah, that plaintain. My better half had their signature all-inclusive Casado. Basically everything they've got thrown onto a plate. I had a bit of the steak and it was amazing, lots of flavors and tender. It comes topped off with an egg and he wasn't too happy that it was cooked over hard. He expected gooey-ness to overtake the plate in a sneak invasion. It was more of a planned occupation in which the ministry forwarded a letter of warning. Horchatas were nice and heavy on the cinnamon. I prefer it that way, not sure what the true authentic way is. It wasn't that sweet which was another plus. ALMOST forgot, the starter guacamole was incredibly fresh and tasty. A definite must. AND SERVICE was great too. This place is usually crowded so we were lucky we made it here after the beach on a holiday weekend. Loved it and can't wait to go back!
