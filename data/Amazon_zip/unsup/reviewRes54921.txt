I liked it quite a bit. Great food, liquor and ambiance. Quite impressed with how they handled my better half who is a veg. The chef was more than happy to modify a couple things on the menu to accommodate her tastes. Good - Chicken, meatballs and bourbon..Bad - ventilation (was pretty bad, but the host said something broke that evening and would be fixed the next day). Overall I think I found my new watering hole.
