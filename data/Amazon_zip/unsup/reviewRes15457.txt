Pretentious. Right when you get inside you see a list of rules. Some of them are understandable, some of them are just plain stupid. This place tries way too hard, like the dude that walks around campus with a pink polo, popped collar, wearing aviators... except fancier than that dude. It also takes itself way too seriously. FYI Violet Hour: you're in Wicker Park, not at the top of the Park Hyatt Tokyo. It gets two stars because inside is really nice looking and unique. I've never been in a bar like it. But whoever said this place is supposed to take a hint from 1920s speakeasies... what are you smoking? Aren't speakeasies supposed to be... fun? Happening? Dancing? Merriness? The chairs are really cool looking but they're not comfortable at all. The drinks are ALL $12. Does that mean you're going to get a better cocktail? Maybe. Is it worth $12? No. I ordered a whiskey old fashioned. It was damn good and had excellent flavor. For ice, they use a gigantic ball of ice instead of separated cubes. It's cool, but makes it so that you get even less drink for your money. That ice displaces so much liquid you're drinking half as much as you would be with cubes. One of the rules on their little sign might as well have said, "No having too much fun." It's like a bunch of 20-somethings in a room together trying to be on their best behavior. Why? For who? Nobody is loud. Nothing is excited. It's snobby. It's yuppie. It's not for me. This place is for 21 to 30 year olds who want to pretend like they're rich and elegant for a night. Nothing wrong with that. Just not for me!
