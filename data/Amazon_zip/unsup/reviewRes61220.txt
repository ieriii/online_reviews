I do alot of traveling and have lived in 7 states since becoming an adult.  I grew up in AZ and this was just like sitting down at my best friends grandmothers table. She didn't speak English, but could cook heaven on a plate or in a bowl. OMG! My heart skipped a beat and I savored every bite at this restaurant. There aren't any words to do it justice. The salsa has so much flavor and you can feel spice without the burn. Amazing!!!!! I am hitting this restaurant every time I visit Chicago.
