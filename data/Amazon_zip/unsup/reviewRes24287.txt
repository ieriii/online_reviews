Meh. Wasn't impressed. The decor and service was great but the food was mediocre. The presentation was nice but the flavor was not...my cousin had a fixed-menu for our group (his family and wedding party...at least 25 people) so we got to try a bunch of different things. My sister found plastic in her salad...the manager (?? not sure what he was) apologized and brought it to the attention to everyone in the kitchen to make sure it didn't happen again but for the type of restaurant that it presents itself as, it shouldn't have happened in the first place. Oh well, mistakes happen and luckily my sister didn't swallow it.  Maybe the items chosen for the fixed menu were just not to my liking but again, I wasn't impressed so I am not likely to return. The food is pretentious and sounds fancy but didn't live up to my expectations (if you want amazing bacon-wrapped dates, go to Avec instead).
