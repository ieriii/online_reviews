Hands-down the best falafel sandwich I've ever had. And I've had falafel sandwiches in Turkey, Spain, Greece and India and throughout the US, but nothing rivals Sultan's. The falafel is so fresh and tasty as is the pita bread, hummus and tahini sauce. When I lived in the neighborhood, I was eating here weekly. I now drive back to the area whenever I need to get my falafel fix.
