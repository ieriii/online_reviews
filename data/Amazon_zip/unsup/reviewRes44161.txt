Hands down my favorite sushi spot in Chicago. I have yet to visit since their remodel, but I can only imagine it's making the place that much more popular. The service is always very prompt and polite. The sushi is always amazing. I love that it's BYOB and the overall experience feels quaint and personal. On another note, last time I was there the Backstreet Boys "Millenium" album was softly playing in the background. I don't know why, but it made me love this place even more.
