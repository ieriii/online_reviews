There are a lot of stake houses in Chicago but this is one of the best. While waiting for friends to arrive, I ordered a martini at the bar. The bar area was packed and very busy, but the bartenders were very attentive. I really wish I knew ahead of time how they made their martinis, otherwise I would have prepared myself for 18 plus ounces of chilled Bombay Sapphire.  For dinner we sat in the upstairs dining area, which was very intimate and quiet. The servers were incredible and very attentive. My friend brought his own bottle and they decanted it for us (with a corkage fee). I had the bone-in filet and my friend had the rack of lamb. We both enjoyed them and thought they were great. The steaks are served on hot plates (a la Ruth's Chris).  Overall, a very enjoyable experience.
