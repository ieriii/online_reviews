My dining experience at Longman & Eagle made me realize that there is a heaven and its really close to my house. Every bite I had was like someone personally made that dish for me with love. This is not lite fare, this is for those brave enough to embrace delectable fare that may leave your heart working just a little harder. Between the soft shell crab, the pretzel that honestly brought me to a state of taste bud nirvana, the scallops, the lamb, the wild boar, the drinks, i was so blown away and over-stuffed that I had to go home and elevate my feet, unbutton my pants and pay homage to the chefs that work their magic. Thank you Longman & Eagle for one of the best meals I have ever had . Must give props to Justin and Stephanie, both waiters that were so supremely knowledgeable that my dining partner and I basically took their hands and allowed them to guide us through the exceptional experience that we had. Kudos!!!!!!
