Delivery is not a good option for Fogo 2 Go, but the food is incredible. I once had to wait 2 hours for delivery, but the ownership was very customer service friendly and offered me more than enough free food to make up for it. Brad and Daniela are great! I would recommend the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and Bocci Balls! Both were amazing. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza was the best I had ever had. The chicken is real tangy and juicy and all the ingredients are fresh. Not to mention, the crust is hand-made. The Bocci Balls are meatballs wrapped in dough. They come with a marinara dipping sauce and are quite filling as an appetizer. BYOB too, plenty of seating. About a 20 minute wait for food. Not bad at all. THANKS BRAD & DANIELA!!!
