AMAZING! I wish I was able to afford to eat here every day! The bar and the upstairs are gorgeous! The decor is so beautiful, they make dining here a pleasurable experience. I ordered the ginger martini which I would not recommend. The ginger was too overwhelming. The appetizers and the service were amazing!!! The dish I ordered was really good. It was the pork with noodles. This was definitely the favorite at the table. I would highly recommend the banana dessert. It was a fried wonton with mashed bananas inside and chocolate drizzled on the outside!
