Just meh... This is my opinion of the deep dish pizza with veggie toppings. They take reservations only on weekdays, which is probably the best time to visit. I hear that it gets very crowded in the weekends. We got the mozzarella sticks which was a tad too salty for my palate. But the cheese was stringy and delicious. I loved tomato sauce and the cheese in the deep dish but there was something off. We got an assortment of veggie toppings (olives, peppers, jalapeos, tomato, basil and spinach). The crust wasn't bad either but something was off, and the whole thing together did not taste sumptuous.. just ok.
