Excellent spot. Food is best I've ever had at a craft brewery. Beer is great also. The waitstaff was great.....they even split up the bill for our large group....without anyone asking! That was a huge positive. This is not a sports bar....they have 2 TVs, but usually they aren't even on.....which is fine with me.
