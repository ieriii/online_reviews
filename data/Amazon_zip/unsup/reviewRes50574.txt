So good. The coffee was pretty good for restaurant coffee, and I'm sort of a coffee snob. I got the crab cakes benedict and it was delicious! The egg was cooked perfectly for a benedict - when I stabbed it to death, the yolk ran everywhere and made the whole experience just awesome. The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL. Truly a great place to spend a morning. I also tried the biscuits and gravy and sheesh, oh man, hallelujah, it was insane. So much gravy. SO MUCH GRAVY.
