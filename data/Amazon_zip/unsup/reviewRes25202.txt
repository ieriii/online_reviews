I went on the recommendation of a couple of friends that had gone to this place and were they right! I loved Mercat. I went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't crowded at all. We started off with a white sangria, mojito, and the seasonal sangria. The drinks were ok but the food was what really blew me away. 1) Serrano ham and fig salad: I liked it but it was slightly salty. 2) Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds with a creamy cheese sauce: I loved the combo of the sweet, salty, and creamy. I've had the bacon wrapped dates at Twist and Avec and I think Mercat has the best ones hands down (although Avec's is pretty rockin' because of the chorizo). 3) Tocino con cidra (pork belly with a cider glaze): this was my FAVORITE dish of the night. I've had bbq'ed pork belly before but the cider glaze at this place was awesome 4) Short ribs + diver scallops: the scallops and short ribs were so tender. This dish was my dining partner's favorite but it was a little salty for me 5) Australian sea bass: the fish was super fresh 6) Butternut squash dumplings: I thought this dish was ok. I didn't like how creamy and running the filling was 7) Arroz con morels: this was a pretty good risotto-style dish. I didn't think it had quite the texture of risotto because it was a bit too mushy for me but i can't tell whether this was really a risotto 8) Milk chocolate croquettes: at first I was hesitant but this dessert won me over. I LOVED the soft creamy banana marshmallow. This was my second favorite dish of the night. I would definitely go back to Mercat to try other dishes.
