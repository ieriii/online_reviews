Native New Yorker visiting Chicago... Went there for brunch (or dunch??) Sunday at 2 with some friends. It's supposedly one of the best brunch places in Chicago. They seated the 7 of us in a 4 people table, which was fine, since we were all close friends. Our waiter took awhile to get our food but he was super friendly. The food was delicious. I got the steak skillet with scrambled eggs which were so good! The steak skillet also had different veggies in it. YUMMY. It also came with a side of 2 pancakes which was impossible to finish on top of the food I got. The fresh squeezed oj was really good. I would probably try new places next time in chi town but this place was good and definitely hit the spot.
