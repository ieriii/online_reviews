Very extensive beer list, many from Belgium, and the ones I had tasted very authentic. The Rochefort 6 was good, but served a bit too cold for my taste, while the Chimay White was excellent. Very good mussels, and French fries (they should actually be called Belgian fries) much better than in most places outside of Belgium. The shortcake with fresh berries was an excellent dessert. Went there on a Monday night, and it was busy but not crazy. The only reason why I will not become a regular is because this place is WAY up north.
