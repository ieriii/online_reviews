I booked a "deluxe room with king bed" through http://hotels.com, for about $145/night, but they gave me a corner suite on the 38th floor with some amazing views of not only Michigan Avenue but also of the rooms and people inside them at the Affinia across the street. the living room area had a big LCD tv, a zebra-printed chair, a big leather sleeper sofa, coffee/tea maker station, and a huge desk. the bedroom was okay. the bed itself was super comfy, and they have zebra-print robes in the closet! as someone mentioned before, the water pressure in the shower was weaaaaak! so much for trying to soothe those sore muscles from all that walking (ahem.. shopping). but as a girl, i appreciated that they had an ionic hair dryer and not those mini conair ones that hotels usually have. the complimentary business center and wireless internet is a real plus (free printing too!just don't abuse it so it stays free for everyone). you don't see many higher-end hotels that offer free internet these days. i decided to have breakfast at the Skylounge on the day that i checked out. they only offer a buffet priced at $17.99 or so, but i decided to give it a try. to be honest, i was not blown away by the view or the food, but i was impressed by the attentiveness of my server. the space is probably best used as a lounge, like it is at nights. if you have a room in the higher floors, i would suggest skipping the Skylounge. 4 solid stars for the Avenue! i took a star off because i felt the front desk could be a little more organized and that the staff could be friendlier.
