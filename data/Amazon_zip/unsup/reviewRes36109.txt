I must say that the food at Sun Wah is pretty good. I enjoyed the duck they have and typical Chinese style BBQ menu. If you want an excellent Peking Duck meal, this place is a must try. The meal can easily feed 3-4 people. Like most restaurants in the area, it is BYOB. It does get pretty packed because of positive reviews and the buzz. Best to probably arrive early if you want to get a seat. My only problem with Sun Wah is the service. The few times I've been there, it is worst than any other restaurant service I've ever had, where we had to wait forever. No other place would I tolerate a 2 - 2.5 hour meal waiting around. If you are willing to put with subpar service, this place is worth eating at.
