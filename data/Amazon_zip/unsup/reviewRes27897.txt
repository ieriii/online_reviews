While the service may not be very friendly, the pizza is pretty darn good. I was here for the first time about five years ago, and loved it. I came here today with my parents, and had only one complaint outside of service. It wasn't that big of a deal, but the pizza was lacking in sauce. Instead of slathering sauce in between the ingredients, they simply drizzle it on the top. This is good because the crust stays nice and crispy. It was a quick fix, though. We asked for some extra sauce, and the pizza was perfect. Oh, and the best part is the "caramelized cheese" on the crust. I am not sure how they do it, but they come so close to burning it, and stop just in time to make it deliciously savory! Yummy.
