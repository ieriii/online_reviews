I love a good Brazilian steakhouse! Endless possiblities & endless quantities of meat on a stick, green for GO please! My favorite is the house special with its perfect fat to meat ratio. You also must try the grilled pineapple, though not always available (think just for dinner, maybe.)  What truly sets this place apart from the other churrasarias is the great selection at the salad bar. Love their cheesy parmesan & mushroom risotto, smoked salmon, fresh veggies (including asparagus spears that are abnormally gi-normous)!  Sides brought to the table include deep fried polenta fries, garlic mashed potatoes, and my ultimate favorite...cheesy brazilian bread. (Here's the recipe by the way if anyone's interested... http://www.yumsugar.com/ ) So wear your fat pants & head over with an appetite!
