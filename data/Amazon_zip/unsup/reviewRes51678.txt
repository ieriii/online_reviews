minus one star cause as much as i luv this place i dont particularly like smelling like it until after my next shower fantastic food here...laaaaaaaarge serving sizes burritos...tostadas are very tasty and u gotta have some rice water egh not so keen on the dining atmosphere...crowded...not as clean as i like my eateries...and really noisy but the service is good and the cooks are fast and its wonderful
