Ahhh Chicago Tourist. I was once in your shoes. I'm only in Chicago for (insert amount of time), and I've heard about Chicago having good pizza. Tonight, we're getting deep dish. I envy you. You get to try Pequod's Pizza for the first time. I remember the first day I had it on a rainy day in June after driving and moving all day. That day began my quest (shared by many other Chicagoans) to find the best the city has to offer. I set the bar too high this first day, and have spent every pizza experience at some other place wishing I went with my gut feeling to order Pequods. It is the best pizza I have ever had, and I love it. I can't say the word Pequods as a suggestion. Once the word is uttered, it is happening. I am sure I have spent $1000's at Pequods. I have no regrets. Sean is the manager and is almost always there. He is customer service embodied. In all of my experiences, I have had a few negative delivery experiences, and Sean has made up for them without blinking an eye. Also it has THE best lunch special in the city. For less than $6 (not including tip...don't be cheap) you get the personal deep dish pizza and a beer or soda. You must do this. So go forth Chicago newcomers, and enjoy.
