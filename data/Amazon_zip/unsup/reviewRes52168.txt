You know you've hit Chicago when you are in Gino's East. From the excellent Deep Dish pizza to the large beer selection, it's hard to mess up ordering here. The best advice is to come hungry, because you'll need it to sustain you through an appetizer, the pizza, and the accompanying beer. I hit his place with my gf on a random Monday night during a snow storm, so it was a bit empty. The service was quick and with a smile, but when you are from out of town, you don't care about the service, the beer or anything else. You care about the Pizza. It was absolutely FANTASTIC and every day since I've left the windy city, I've wanted it for dinner. I can only imagine that in a few months, I'll need to make a return trip just to whet my appetite once again. HIGHLY Recommend!
