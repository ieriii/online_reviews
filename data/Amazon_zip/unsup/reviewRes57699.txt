I've never had a bad meal here either, but it's the most over-rated restaurant I've ever eaten at. The prices are great and the food is good, but like I said, it certainly isn't great.  On one occassion, I had the enchilada plate and it was very good, and about $6, which is hardly worth complaining about. Then, I gave them the burrito test. Not that great. But nonetheless, it is cheap.
