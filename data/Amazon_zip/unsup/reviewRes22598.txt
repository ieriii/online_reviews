How do you spell a total mess in Chinese????  Good food, ok service BUT a totally filthy restaurant!  Really?  All the rave reviews and hype -- the walls have not been painted in years, the carpets not cleaned in decades and....well... Need I say more?  Filthy restaurant. Can't believe the City of Chicago passes their inspections......I will never return.
