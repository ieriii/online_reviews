This review is specifically for the dessert tasting. I took my friend here last night, a special treat for her birthday. The atmosphere here is pretty serious and the whole experience is very coordinated. The waiters actually poured our water in unison. We ordered a pomegranite old fashioned and cappuccino to drink. The old fashioned rocked the house - wow. If you come to Tru, you must order this drink. Onto the dessert orgy....after a delicious amuse bouche of a frozen tortoni/ice cream concoction and mini madeline cookies (still warm), we proceeded through 3 delicious dessert courses. Two cake plates, fruit desserts, and chocolate. The dishes were too complicated that I don't recall specifically all of the components. The dessert cart was wheeled over and we sampled everything: lemon gelee, homemade marshmallow, several types of chocolates, and a meringue cookie. We thought we were all done but oh no, the waiter brought out two exploding chocolate/carmel truffles. (PS they really do explode in your mouth) A wonderful evening, delicious food and excellent service. The dessert tasting is $40 per person - a fantastic value.
