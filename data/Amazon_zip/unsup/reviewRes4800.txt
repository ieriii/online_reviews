Just came back from a trip to Chicago two days ago and already miss the amazing food at The Purple Pig. Was definitely one of the highlights to my Chicago trip with my family. Every dish we shared was absolutely incredible. The milk-braised pork shoulder is a MUST-HAVE. It was seriously, to DIE for good! Another standout dish from all the amazing dishes we had was the roasted corn. Sounded so simply, yet amazing flavour packed into such a small dish and could not stop eating it! Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive, making our Purple Pig experience even better. If you still have room for dessert, the Sicilian Iris is seriously GOOD! It takes a bit of a wait for them to make, but definitely worth it! Also, the whole concept of sharing all the foods is a great way to try a ton of different dishes and flavours for still an amazing price! The three of us had 10 different dishes and wine for about $100. It doesn't get better then that! Can't wait to go back to Chicago just to eat at The Purple Pig again :)
