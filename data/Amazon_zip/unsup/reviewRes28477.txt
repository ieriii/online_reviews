I've never been truly impressed by the food at Rick Bayless's restaurants. With that said, overall Frontera is good and I can see why people like it. It is definitely 100 times better than his Los Angeles restaurant "Red O". Frontera is Red O's older sister that is cool because she doesn't try too hard to fit in the with popular kids.  The wait staff is excellent. The Toppolo Margarita is one of the best I've ever had (although not surprised at the quality of the drinks because that was the one good thing at Red O). Mole sauce was a step better than the mole sauce at Red O, although I still wasn't that impressed. Pork dish was really good. I always end up liking the sides that accompany my dish better than the actual main ingredient. The beans were just as amazing as Red O and the mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth. We ordered two desserts - the flan and the bunuelos. The flan was amazing but the bunuelos....wtf are these things....they are tasteless chips. The bunuelos at Frontera are disgusting - that is one thing that Red O got right.
