I went here for brunch alone so no review on the full menu yet. The first thing that stood out was the server was a bit too relaxed for my state of hunger. She brought us banana break after we'd been there for probably 20 min and then the food took a while to come out. However, I did really like my meal. I had the breakfast burrito (and I'm a big breakfast burrito fan) and it was very well done. All the runny ingredients were separate so the burrito itself was quite intact. My friend had the baked brie and it was super mushy, she said she wouldn't get that again. So, overall I liked it, they have a pretty big brunch menu but the service was slow. I plan on going back to try out the rest of the menu.
