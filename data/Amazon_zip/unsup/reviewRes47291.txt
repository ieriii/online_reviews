As an avid people watcher and social bug, the crowd that fills a place is key. If they were to film a documentary on the gentrification of Chicago neighborhoods, Lockdown would be the first scene. The eclectic crowd at this place is something I've only dreamed about. Most places brag about having folks from every walk of life, but the patrons of Lockdown deliver it PEACEFULLY. Hipsters, Michigan Wolverines fans, Stylish Boriquas, avid UFC watchers and old school Ukie Village residents all converse freely with each other, leaving egos and preconceived bitterness at home. In a city full of clicky spots and trendy cliches, it's refreshing to go to Lockdown and truly have a good time just being engulfed in this place's positive energy. The burgers are creative and delicious. The "Electric Chair" required me to run home and change my drawers after a taste-related orgasmic accident. Most other stuff is hit or miss, but still tasty and WAY better than most bar food. A really great beer list compliments everything they throw at you. The daily specials keep 'em coming from all over the city. Get here quick because this place fills up fast, especially the great patio in the back. 4 stars because the service is taxed. It's not the servers themselves, it's time to hire more! Probably because this place is exploding in front of our eyes. Last time I was here was Do Division Fest weekend and they had FOUR servers on Saturday. As great as these guys handled everything with a super positive and accommodating attitude, you need to set them up for success. All in all, great place - destined for continually increasing success.
