Looking through the reviews of this place has irritated me. I think it's important that people realize that this is a small neighborhood restaurant residing in the third largest city in the country. Yes, the space is small. Yes, the wait can be long. Yes, the room can be loud. And yes, the kitchen puts out some of the best food in the city, thus insuring the small room remains packed and loud with a line out the door. The Olive Garden probably has a quiet table available right now where you can sit and talk privately as you wait for the rest of your party to arrive. Mia Francesca is a gem, and in the decade I've been going there, I've never had a bad meal, or a negative experience.
