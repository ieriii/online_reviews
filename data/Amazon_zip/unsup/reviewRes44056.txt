When done properly, fresh, innovative spins on familiar classics are fantastic. Take, for example, Exhibit A: http://www.youtube.com/w Now wipe the saliva off your chin. Videographer : Mariah Carey :: Wakamono : Sushi. This review has been on my list to complete for months now. The highlights from my first visit: Kani Chung Roll with fresh crab meat hand picked out? Fantastic, and beautifully prepared. The Emerald Roll of yellowtail, asparagus, cucumber, avocado - again, great, and points for presentation. Finally, Wakamono Roll: lightly torch-seared tuna & salmon over shrimp tempura, unagi, spicy sauce, daikon sprouts. As their signature roll, I was a little disappointed because it wasn't anything unique, but it too was delicious. Overall the fish was very fresh, the place was hopping, and we BYOB'ed like mad with a ton of wine. The corkage fee is $5/750mL, a small price to pay for cheap imbibing en masse. On my second visit two girlfriends and I had some time to kill beforehand while we waited, so we had some drinks in Wang's bar in the left room. The Lychee Martini is beautiful and apparently a great drink. I settled for a Kirin Light. For appetizers, we split a Crisp Shiitake Ravioli with Pork & Shrimp and some Edamame. The ravioli were savory, but definitely more like fried dumplings than "crisp" ravioli. As for the sushi, we ordered the Peter Parker Spider Roll, a Dragon Roll, and a Salad Roll...all of which were great. Don't be put off by the high price per roll, as each are pretty large in size. My personal favorite: the Salad Roll. Though it had no fish, it still tasted fantastic - tomato, avocado, spinach and brown rice in a fresh ginger sauce that was perfectly savory. Music was fun but not intrusive, and it was a full house on a Sunday night (we waited for half an hour for our table). But when a restaurant executes and presents dishes well, it's understandably popular, just as this trendy Lakeview locale is.
