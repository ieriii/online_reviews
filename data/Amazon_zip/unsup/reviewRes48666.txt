The Publican is great. Its name is fun to say. Pub pub publicannnnn. So yes, I got the selection of three different kinds of pork which was delicious. Well 2 out of the 3 were good that is good enough for me. Plus there were cute little pickles all over my plate. Pickles are great, but tiny ones are apparently even better. My boyfriend ordered the chicken which was DELICIOUS. He even thought it was better than Lula's chicken--strong words indeed. The fries that came with the chicken were fantastic too. The butterscotch pudding dessert with raspberries was fantastic as well. I was reading some of the other reviews and people seem to be all over the place. The food was a little hit or miss but the service, beer list (I don't even like to drink that much, but found a beer that I really enjoyed), and general ambiance make this a great place.  Also, it should be noted that i generally DO NOT like sitting in a close proximity to people I don't know...however they pulled it off quite nicely. I enjoyed ogling people's food and the loudness of the restaurant just made it seem lively. lastly Christine is the PERFECT server. She is the blond with the two full tattoo sleeves. Wonderfully knowledgeable and helpful without being annoying or dull; attentive without being overbearing. Really I was shocked because I feel like most servers drop the ball somewhere--but not her. all in all a lovely experience!
