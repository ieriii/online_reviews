I was at the Knickerbocker for my wedding and I can't sing enough praises of the staff. Each and every person we came in contact with was polite and helpful at every turn. I couldn't have asked for a better evening. All of my guest were in awe of the beautiful space, delicious food, and 5 star service. As were hubby and I. The champagne parade was a big hit. We loved it! My husband was concerned that having our reception at such a luxe location would make him and his family/friends feel uncomfortable or out of place. I assured him otherwise and after 5 minutes of arriving at the cocktail hour he realized there was nothing to worry about. Upon arriving we were greeted by a waiter and he had champagne in our hands almost instantly. Since there were only about 10 minutes left in the cocktail hour the waiters went out of their way to pick bride and groom out of the crowd so that we could get a taste of the delicous appetizers. Mm-mmmm the mini beef wellington...who knew such a small piece could be so flavorful. The only 'hiccup' occured when we got to Parlor G where the bridesmaids were scheduled to get hair and make-up only to find that many of the outlets in the room weren't working. This was definitely a problem with the hair dryers, curling irons, etc that needed to be plugged in. But about 5 minutes after placing a call to the front desk a maintenance staffer was at the room with extension cords and a power strip to get us by. Also the internet access is like something out of the '90s...why not just charge it to the room? All in all I will definitely recommend the Knickerbocker to visiting guests or locals who want to get away. We can't wait to return for our anniversary.
