Pretty tough to only give the Purple Pig 3 stars. I suppose the grade is a value decision. I spent a lot of money. I had a great time, but there are other things I could have done with the loot. Tips: - It was really crowded. I suppose that is a good sign usually. But not for a date. Pretty difficult to be romantic when you are surrounded by tourists. - They offer half bottles of wine. That was cool. - The bone marrow spread was awesome. Not something that you have everyday, but it was well worth it. - All the portions were pretty tiny.
