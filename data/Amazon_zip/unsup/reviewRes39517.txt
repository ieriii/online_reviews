Open 10 a.m. to 5 a.m. every day? This place is CRAZZZEEE. Went here this past weekend with regulars...thank GOD, or else we wouldn't know what to do as the waitstaff is so bossy, they put Kelis to shame. It's like they sing "I'm the boss...boss...to themselves in Korean"--I don't blame them as this place is BOSSY. Strolled in at around 9 p.m. and waited for about 20 minutes. They initially tried to seat us at the tables where you sit cross legged, but being that Coco is 6'4" and meaty...he wasn't built to fit under the table with the rest of us. He also has never been able to sit Indian Style in his life...which is quite hilarious and very endearing... We were moved to a table with 4 chairs, which our companions indicated would not be large enough for a party of four. I was a bit confused by this statement, but now I understand as they give you copious amounts of side plates which are all fantastic, in addition to fantastic spicy soup and the actual meat itself. You would really need to sit at a table that could seat 8, for a foursome. Only having been to Cho Sun Ok for Korean BBQ, I have never experienced charcoal table-side grilling before.  I realized that I much prefer the charcoal as it lightly chars the meat and seals in the moist flavor of the marinade. We opted for the Chap Chae and 2 orders of the marinated beef short-rib and the bulgogi which were both good, but the standout was the kalbi. Coming back next time on the Kalbi and the Daegi Kalbi. The Chap Chae was good, but I prefer the noodles at Jin Ju, but the interactive experience here at SSGS. Everything was superb and the light OB pairs very well with the meaty bits.
