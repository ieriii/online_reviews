I stayed at the Drake this week for a conference at the Navy Pier. This hotel was very elegant and not overly priced. It is located on the north end of Michigan Avenue and convenient to the water. I was upgraded into a corner room and had a view of Lake Michigan. Couldn't have been a more amazing room. Large with four windows overlooking the lake. There was a chandelier above the bed and it seems like it would be a romantic place (I was there for a work conference, not very romantic). I was within walking distance of everything.  The only complaint I have is the price for overnight parking, but I know that is an issue anywhere in downtown Chicago. $50/night for the car made me want to puke!  Definitely recommend The Drake for work or play. Try and not have a car in the city as you don't need one and it will cost you an arm and a leg...
