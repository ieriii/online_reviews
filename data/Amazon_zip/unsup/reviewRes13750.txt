Glenn's Dinner is a pretty middle of the road experience. The food is decent, but not great. However, it is slightly overpriced. After eating here, you walk away feeling like you would have been more satisfied if your bill had been a third or half as much. The catfish po'boy would be better if they served it on a harder baguette style bun instead of a French roll -- which falls apart immediately because of the tarter sauce they added to the po'boy. That in itself is a good indication that you are not getting an authentic New Orleans' style po'boy. The slaw was too runny, and sweet, for my taste. The food was decent, but, as I said, overpriced. The outside patio is a little loud due to the heavy traffic on Montrose and the proximity to the brown line. Good, friendly service. Not likely to go back.
