Outside of the fact that you can grow a beard in the time it takes to get a table here - it still sucks. I am not a vegetarian, but I generally like vegetarian and vegan cuisine if the dish is dynamic/prepared well. Don't expect said preparation here. I am often coerced into eating at vegetarian restaurants due to my friend's eating habits, and this is generally well and good. However, the idea of eating poorly made fake versions of food that I could consume at any number of other restaurants for a fraction of the price isn't appealing enough to get me back here. I am not here to bash on meat substitutes or a meat free style of living - hats off to those of you who've made this choice , but I'd rather eat a bag of beaks than eat here ever again. If you want to eat at an omnivore/vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurant with a lot of unique options for everyone - try The Pick Me Up Cafe (just around the corner on Clark St.).
