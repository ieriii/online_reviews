My boyfriend and I are HUGE sushi fans. I crave fresh raw fish all the time- maki or sashimi, whatever. We were immediately sat which was great. However, I am still not used to the city style seating, i.e. sitting right on top of the other people next to you. I felt like I couldn't hear my boyfriend and the couples on either side of us were talking very loud. It was not very private...But, okay no problem. The menu is HUGE! I almost had to get out of a piece of paper to write down all the items that I was interested in just to narrow it down. I kept forgetting the names! I love thai, but really just wanted a whole maki celebration. So we ordered miso soup- very salty! as a small appetizer. Then we just dove into the sushi- we ordered the Summer Time roll, Spider roll, Dragon roll and spicy tuna roll. All were excellent. Very big, hearty rolls- nothing dinky about them. Fun to eat. Fresh tasting fish. I wish the avocado had more flavor in some of the rolls. The soft shell crab was delicious. I took off one star for: slow service (we wanted something else but weren't even checked on), extremely close proximity to other customers, and prices were a little high. However, their rolls are made very well- looks great, taste great and I will definitely be back. I would love to try other appetizers, desert maybe, and some thai!
