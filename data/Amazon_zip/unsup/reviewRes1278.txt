Line or no line, I still love Hot Doug's. This is the first stop I drag any of my out of town guests. I still can't believe how creative someone can get with a sausage. I brought Doug some hot dog paraphernalia to put his hot dog shrine. It was a really bonding moment.  I worry that I spend too much time thinking about about Hot Doug. My companion scolded me for being obsessed over him. I just can't help it. Here are a few questions that I often ask myself... What does Hot Doug like to do in his spare time? What are his favorite TV shows? Where does he like to go to get some tasty eats? How in the heck does he come up with these concoctions? What is his favorite season? Does he have any pets? Perhaps a hot dog dog? What is his favorite style of swimming? Will Hot Doug be my friend? If so does he want to come over to Humboldt Park and play badminton?  Ugh, what is wrong with me? I am so weird and I have way too much time on my hands.
