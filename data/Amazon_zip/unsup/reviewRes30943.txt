I definitely loved this place and it was my first time. I loved the decor and atmosphere surroundings. Service was excellent which is very hard to get at some places nowadays. Food was great! I loved the garlic noodles but I will definitely try with blue crab next time. Rock N Roll shrimp was amazing! For dessert I recommend getting the "ridiculous" fried ice cream!
