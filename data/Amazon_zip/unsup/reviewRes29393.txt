Simply put, Opart Thai is AMAZING. My husband and I keep saying that we want to try other restaurants in the area, but more often than not, we find ourselves walking into Opart. Their Tom Yum Pla soup is so delicious - when I order it other places, I always have food envy because I crave Opart's. Great for a quick meal to pick up on your way home from a long day at work as well as a date night with some wine (BYOB, always a plus!)
