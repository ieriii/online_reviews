I came here almost a year ago but haven't written the review. Okay, so we took bus after bus after the train to get here. We didn't rent a car, b/c I wanted to take public transportation everywhere to get a better experience of Chicago. I'm so glad I did b/c you wouldn't be able to see alot of things if you rented a car! Okay, so on to my review of the best hot dog I've ever had in my life.... We arrive at this old skool drive-in car hop diner and most of the cars are parked in the car hop areas. People are orderering, car hop waitresses are delivering... so cute!!! We walked to the walk-up window to order. I ordered the Superdawg, which comes with crinkle cut fries (were totally awesome) and he had the Whoopsidawg with fries and a malted milk shake. The superdawg was a classic Chicago Style hotdog with the steamed poppyseed bun and all the fixins. But something about their dogs are just so much more damn delicious than everywhere else! Okay, I was a little jealous of the whoopsidawg over mine. You know, a friend of mine has this rule to not try someone else's food until she's totally done with hers b/c if she likes the other dish more, she will not enjoy any of her food, knowing that there's another dish better than her own. So anyway, I took a bite of the Whoopsidawg and I fell in love! My hot dog was mlind blowingly good too, but.... his was absolutely sensational! Ok, I'm not a crazy hot dog fanatic anymore (they're awful for you) but I would definitely travel across the country to come here again. And let me add in that the chocolate malted milk shake is unlike ANY MALTED MILKSHAKE I've ever had!! What do they do to it to make it so damn good? I came here b/c it was featured on the Food Network once and it is also one of those top 1000 places in the world to visit before you die. And this place has been here since 1948 and looks almost the same as back then (with some renovation). I didn't care that it was so far from downtown Chicago...
