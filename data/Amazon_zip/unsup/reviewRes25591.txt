I came here with my BF to use the Groupon I bought online. Our reservation was for 7:30 but we got there 30 mins early and was seated immediately. We sat at a table in the middle but it seemed like it was suppose to be a table for 4. We could hear the entire conversation of the couple next to use, cus they were NEXT to us. There was absolutely no space. So not romantic. So we asked to be moved to another table in the corner. This request was quickly accommodated. The atmosphere is romantic, but it was a little too dark for me because I could barely read the menu. Food wise we had the cheese & chocolate fondue special. The cheese was very salty. I thought the apple and cheese was surprisingly the best. I could taste the liquor they put in it. Not that I wanted too. The chocolate was fondue was fun when we were able to roast marshmallows on the flame. The chocolate itself was too bitter for my taste and I dont think all the items complimented it. Melons & grapes? ew. The service was great. Sucks that they only have a one bathroom stall and it is hard to navigate to get there. Worth the $25 i spent using my groupon. Nice experience, but I probably wont go back for the food. It is definitely a gimmick.
