Went there for a large party and the room and service were great. Our server could not have been more accomodating or helpful. The hostess staff were the worst, however. I love when you walk up to the first person who is the face of the restaurant and none of the three women are remotely helpful or concerned. Glad our server made up for them.The apps were great as was the white wine (Albarino). The paella was just ok. The place has a fun atmosphere and good crowd.
