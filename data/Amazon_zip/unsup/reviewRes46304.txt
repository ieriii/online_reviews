Went here for lunch with my boss. The location is great, right down the street from our office, and the place looks nice. It was also immediate seating at noon, which is really cool. It probably helps that the place is huge. Our server did a nice job, but he was too chatty for my taste. The portions here are HUGE. I got a club sandwich. It was too fat to fit my mouth around. The tomatoes were almost pink rather than red, The bacon didn't have much flavor, and the turkey had a dry texture, which means they don't use the best ingredients. So as a foodie, I would say I could pass on this place. As a city girl who works down the street, it's convenient for lunch.
