Very nice hotel! Friendly people, an extremely comfortable bed and yes, the pillows were awesome! Supposedly they have free internet in the lobby???I wasn't there for business, so I didn't need it. Very nice work out room. Awesome restaurants nearby (check out the Armenian one and the bakery on Illinois near navy pier). Great price, 75/night! Concierge was very helpful and the coffee in the room was very good! No complaints, we will be back!
