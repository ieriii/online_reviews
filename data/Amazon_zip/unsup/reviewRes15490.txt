It's almost impossible to get a table on Fridays or Saturdays but if you try be ready to wait 2-3 hours. The bar gets full really fast and the waiting area is not comfortable. Nonetheless, if you do wait or happen to get lucky on a Sunday at 4pm then you're in for a treat. We started our experience with the chicken wings which comes with the best potato salad ever. We all thought that it should have been the meal. The IPA was awesome. The chicken sandwhich was ok, I don't know that I would order it again. The mashed potatoes was great. The service was great too.
