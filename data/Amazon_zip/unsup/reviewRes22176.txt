My favorite place in Greek town for many reasons, but one of them has to be the fact that when I've gone, my server has been attentive, helpful and hilarious. Try to call/make reservations, because it can be about a 40-45 minute wait without one. This restaurant is truly family focused and run. The layout is really cute but ginormous! It looks great for groups, but it doesn't feel too big that you feel like your table is being swallowed by a huge whale. The menu offers some great traditional Greek dishes, but I love that you can get 3-4 of the appetizer plates to split between 2-3 people so that you can try many things at once. Their wine list always has something to try, but they do offer a full bar. I'm still not brave enough to try oozo or however you spell it. I have to call out Eleni as she was our server this past Saturday. Hilarious lady, but she better remember my rain check...we're supposed to go Greek dancing down the block. Haha! Opa indeed! *And on a completely unrelated footnote: If you're even THINKING about going to Pegasus instead of Greek Isles....STOP! Just walk the extra 1/4 of a block down to Greek Isles.
