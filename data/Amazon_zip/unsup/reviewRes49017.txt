My husband and I went here about a week ago, really excellent food, however, not the most ideal date night spot. It was great to be taken care of by the wait staff, but at times we felt like we couldn't have a conversation because there were so many waiters/bussers etc. at our table at all times. My biggest issue was our busser kept coming to our table to clean it asking "more food coming"? So that he could bring us more plates. I felt that they should have been communicating with the waiter, as it really did interrupt our conversation at least once every 5 minutes. Food was undeniably good however, the frites with egg cooked in beef lard were unbelieveable, as was the Potee. I would highly reccommend for a casual dinner with friends...too loud for an intimate date.
