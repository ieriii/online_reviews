Italy, it is not. However, if you're wearing jeans and a hoodie, planning to start drinking immediately after dinner, and want some tasty pasta, go. Go with confidence. PBowl is attached to The Other Side, which is convenient since patrons can order off either menu, and sit in either space (choose your adventure: pub or restaurant!).  That said, I've eaten in excess of 25 meals here. And every time I go for the gnocchi aurora. I dream about their gnocchi aurora. Yeah, it's frozen bricks of gnocchi that were not made by someone's grandmother in the back, but sometimes that's what I feel like eating. I also love their macaroni and cheese, with the bread crumb topping,... add chicken and broccoli and you have yourself a cheesy feast. The rigatoni bolognese is good too. I haven't tried anything else. I'm a creature of habit, and I return time and time again for the gnocchi aurora.  Unless you're doing shots with your noodles, dinner for two will run you about $15. The service is quick and it's on a major artery through Lincoln Park. AND THEY DELIVER. You can't go wrong with PBowl (unless you're proposing marriage, or want sushi, or a burrito).
