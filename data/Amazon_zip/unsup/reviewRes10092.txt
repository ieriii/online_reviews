This is bar none our favorite restaurant in the city. Best to take old friends, new friends, family and out of town guests. Everyone will be wowed and say the same thing...."this tastes just like we're in Italy."  Our favorite dishes include: -prosciutto di parma: truly the freshest mozzerella you've ever had! -frittura di calamari: its the perfect calamari, not rubbery at all! -ravioli "piccolo sogno"- thin homemade ravioli that just melts in your mouth. -stracci di farro- our favorite dish, amazing homemade pasta with asparagus and truffle oil. My husband loves the many seafood dishes that he has tried as well. Wine is reasonably priced and the patio is truly a slice of heaven.
