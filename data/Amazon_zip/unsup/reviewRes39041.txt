This weekend I ordered food for 50 people from LaVilla for my daughter's baptism. The service was impeccable! Initially when I ordered, I was told the best options to go with to feed my large family and what was going to be the best way to save a few $$. When I arrived to pick up the food it was all ready and was paid for and loaded into my car within 5 minutes. I received numerous compliments on everything I ordered. I will order from them again! Thanks LaVilla!
