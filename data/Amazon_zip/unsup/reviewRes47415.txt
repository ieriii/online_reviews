I had to edit my review. I gave the Lockdown 4 stars before, but after this weekend I have to knock it down to two. Want to know why? Where do I begin.... I bought a Groupon NOW on Friday that had to be used by 4PM. I called to make an order to pick up and was told I couldn't use it for takeout. It said that NOWHERE on Groupon, nowhere on the actual Groupon, and when I asked the man on the phone about it he just said "that's just what we do". O you turn away business? Good strategy. Needless to say I pretty much thought "F that and F this place" and we didn't eat there. The next night we were out at the dog beach with my boyfriend, his father, and his sister when we decided we were hungry and should grab food. Since it was already 8:30 and we were about to leave, we called to order takeout from the Lockdown. We were told it would be ready in 25 minutes. 25 minutes later...we arrived. My boyfriend went in to get the food while we sat outside in the car waiting. 10 minutes later he came back and said he was told it would be awhile and he would meet us at home (just 4 blocks away). That was annoying. After another 20 minutes our food was ready. They told my boyfriend to sit at the bar and have a drink while waiting, and he did. You think they offered to buy him a beer for the RIDICULOUSLY under-estimated time? Nope. Nothing. AND he had to walk home with all of the food! He also said that the girl who took our order was drunk and every worker in there was pretty much drinking and taking shots. If you want to take shots and get drunk at work, please don't take my order. There were MULTIPLE mistakes with our orders, including burgers overdone, toppings that we did not ask for, and missing toppings that we did ask for. Will we be back? Maybe...if we get desperate. This place has really good potential if they were more professional. I hope the owner gets a clue and gets his staff into shape.
