3 starts means "A-OK," and that's honestly what this place is. I would say I'm a fan, but I didn't like their pricing, so really they need 3.5 stars which isn't an option, so I'm going 3. :] I've been to this restaurant twice now, and the the food is EXCELLENT -- it really is, but it's EXPENSIVE!!! I felt that much of it was overpriced and the portions weren't as large as I'm used to seeing at Indian places which would maybe justify the pricing more. The Butter Chicken ($14.95) was very good but undoubtedly very bad for you. The sauce was (as you would imagine) amazing, but the portion was much smaller than I expected for the price. The Chicken Palak ($14.95) was very spicy. I LOVE spicy, but to the point that it drowns out all of the other flavors present in the dish, and I felt this dish did that for me. Too spicy to taste the flavor underneath. Chicken Tikka Masala ($14.95) was pretty good, but again - small portion. Mango Lassi ($4.95) was just not worth the money. $5.50 for a side of rice and $3.50 for ONE PIECE of Naan. (To me, that's steep.) The lamb and vegetable samosas are tasty, but on the dry side. Would I say go here? Sure, if saving money isn't something you're concerned about. It tastes great, but you can get the same food cheaper on Devon. The food will not disappoint you, so if you have the means, you could give this place a shot.
