We've been here twice in the past 4 months for dinner with friends. Mastro's is hands-down the best steakhouse in the city. The service is impeccable, wine list is fabulous (and its served at the right temperature!), food is the best you'll experience at a steakhouse and the butter cake dessert will leave you dreaming of it often. We've been to probably 15 other steakhouses in Chicago multiple times over the past 6 years and this is truly the best.
