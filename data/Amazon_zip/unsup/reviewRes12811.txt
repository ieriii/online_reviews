It was a beatiful Thursday afternoon. After searching for a place to eat dinner outside, my fellow yelper and I decided on Cafe 28. We were excited, finally some nice weather in Chicago! Fast forward to 5pm and there is practically a hurricane outside. Not willing to let the rain get us down, we still head over to Cafe 28 and were not disappointed. We got a liter of sangria which was delicious and not a bad price either. We scarfed down the free bread and butter. Now, some places get mad if you eat too much free bread and pass up an appetizer. Not Cafe 28. They re-stocked our bread and butter as soon as it was getting low. I got the salmon which was amazing. The service was quick and friendly. Overall great meal and ambience. I will definitlely be back, but will hopefully be sitting outside!
