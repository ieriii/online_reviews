It was time to treat one of my best friends to a dinner and thought she'd like to explore the hinter lands of Andersonville.....as least in her opinion *wink*. Anteprima gets high marks from many folks and now I know why. From an extensive wine list to a very authentic menu of Italian dishes, this is a great date place or something to do when you want to feel a little special when you are eating. Reservations were made at 6:30pm on a Thursday, but within an hour the place was packed, so keep that in mind....also use http://Opentable.com if you want to make those reservations quickly. Following a tradition of my mother, we ordered wine and decided to catch up, conversing for over 30 minutes and enjoying our wine with the waiter never rushing us. This is my favorite way to dine....taking your time and enjoying both who you are with as well as the food and drink. Then the ordering commenced. Appetizers were the grilled octopus and the antipasto plate. Yummy!  Entrees were a pasta dish that had spicy lamb and dandelion greens - spicy is an understatement, but still very good. The other entre was braised pork with polenta and also as good. We shared both plates...as friends should and enjoyed it all. Dessert was an interesting experience for me as I had both a drink and dessert that were both derived from lemons. The drink was a lemoncello which is vodka, basil, and lemons made at the restaurant and the dessert was a lemon panna cotta which was a first for me and very good. So if you ever want to check out a darling little neighborhood establishment then come up my way and enjoy what Andersonville has to offer.
