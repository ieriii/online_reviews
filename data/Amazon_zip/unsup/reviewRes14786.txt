Logan Square became infinitely cooler when Revolution moved in. The decor is great, solid wood, awesome light fixtures, a giant glass window peering into the brewery. During the summer the front windows peel all the way back with nice barrel cocktail tables. As far as gastropubs go, this is one of the best I've been to. They obviously get a star for brewing their own beer and darn good beer at that - try the flight! As for the food, well lucky for me (or them) I ate here prior to taking the vegetarian plunge.  As you've probably already read, their bacon fat popcorn is not to be missed. It's tasty and just dripping in fat.  I tried the blue cheese mussels which were by far the best mussels I've ever had. The cheese made for a decadent creamy broth - yes, i ordered extra bread. Sweet potato cakes were fine, pizza was tasty, the men in my party enjoyed the pork sandwiches & burgers. This place is not to be missed and with so many vegetarian options I'm set. I'm glancing at the menu now and the Beluga Lentils, Quinoa, Sauted brussels sprouts, turnip, parsnip, roasted carrot ginger sauce, almonds - is making my mouth water. A Vegetarian Revolution update coming soon...
