Dear Chicago Diner, I miss you so much. I would really like a Reuben and some Mac n cheese. I wish you had a location in NYC. I will be visiting you soon because you are my favorite restaurant in the whole Country. Great service, great atmosphere, great prices, top notch quality, friendly staff and above all else. Great food!
