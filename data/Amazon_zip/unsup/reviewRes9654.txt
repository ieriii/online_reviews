Sprout was an interesting experience that I will not soon forget. I went with a friend for my birthday this last weekend. When the reservations were made, the host asked if it was a special occassion, which it was -- MY BIRTHDAY! The host then said that they would do something special for me since it was my birthday and that ended up being the waitress saying to us after the bill was paid, "oh and by the way, happy birthday" So that was a little disappointing. The service itself was fine. Not great and not terrible. They initially placed us at a table smack dab in the middle of the room, which we felt a little uncomfortable about considering there were dozens of open tables strewn throughout the restaurant that were a bit more secluded. So we asked to be moved to one of those other tables and BAM! it was a sudden and HUGE inconvenience. Our waitress was pleasant enough but like I said, nothing special or out of the ordinary.  The food was very interesting. To start, I ordered the shrimp... I was surprised to find that there was a total of 2 shrimp (even tho when I called to ask about the menu and so on, I was assured the portions were large)...I don't consider 2 shrimp a large portion by any standards. The flavor, however, was delightful. For the second course, I ordered the steak. The steak was cooked to perfection and the seasoning along with the glaze and sauce was delicious! I was very pleased with my steak selection. The only completely disapointing food course was the dessert. I ordered the chocolate which included chocolate, peanuts, bananas, maple and a coffee ice cream. There was a lot going on on that plate and it wasn't good all together or separately. I had to send back the dessert. The ambiance was nice and my overall time spent there was fantastic...not sure if it was the restaurant or my company...I suspect primarily my company. If I was voting for food alone, I would vote 4 stars but with all of the other stuff, I had to go with 3...
