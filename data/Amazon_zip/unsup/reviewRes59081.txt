OK, the first thing I have to say about Yolk is YUM! I have been here for breakfast several times and everything I've had has been great. First of all, you must try one of their cinnamon rolls warmed up for your pre-breakfast. (share it with someone - they're huge!) You'll thank me if you do. Then, I suggest ordering one of their egg dishes as opposed to the pancakey, waffley syrupy dishes. I've found that they named the restaurant Yolk for a reason. One bonus about Yolk is that they have those great International Delights mini coffee creamers at your table in lots of different flavors. There usually is an over-abundance of the Irish Creme flavor, however, so you may have to steal your favorite flavor from someone else's table.I agree that the service is not always the most attentive, but the waitstaff is typically friendly and the good food outweighs what is lacking in service.
