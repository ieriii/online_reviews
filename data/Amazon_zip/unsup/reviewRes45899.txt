This was my second time eating at Grand Lux Caf, and once again, the place did not disappoint. We came here on a weeknight so fortunately there was no wait. In terms of dcor, their stated goal was to combine the "luxury of European cafes with the sensibilities of an all-American restaurant." I'm not sure if they succeeded (I've never been to a luxury European caf) but the place definitely looked great. Service wise the staff was friendly, the server took time to explain the menu, and even took photos for us. (I know, highly touristy, but hey, we looked dashing.) The food, as usual, was excellent. I had the chicken royale (which I highly recommend), and my friend had the chicken parmesan. Portions were large (photos!), with three, different sides, a welcome change from most places where they only offer you two. Pricing was reasonable, a little more than Cheesecake Factory, but less than some of the other places on Michigan Ave. All in all, a great dining experience and I'll definitely look forward to my next visit.
