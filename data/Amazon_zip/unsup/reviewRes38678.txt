The service here is horrible! We were soo excited to eat here bc of the awesome reviews...I am sitting at the table still in the restaurant and it has been over an hr since we gave 'preordered' our pizzas. Our waitress was not friendly whatsoever! After asking her if our pizza is ready after waiting 40+ minutes, she said it's not ready wo even going to check on it. 20+ min later she comes up to us and tells us they had forgot to make 2 of our 3 pizzas. Ugh...ok...so she brings out the one pizza that was made and it was cold. Cold. We told her and she asked if we want it heated up. Omg...are u freakin serious??? U have got to be kidding me...they r making our pizzas 'as fast as possible'...it's been over 30 minutes already. Sooo frustrating...
