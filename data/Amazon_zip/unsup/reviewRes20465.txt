I love this place, the food is soo good. I highly recommend the white dragon. Its BYOB, go early, if you might be waiting a while for a table but its totally worth it. I've been there a few times and each time I've had a great experience. I order take out from there all the time and its so yummy and easy because while everyone is waiting an hour for a table I just walk up to the counter and get my food, pay and im on my way. :D
