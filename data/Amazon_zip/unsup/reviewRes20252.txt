Solid and consistent. The food does tend to be a bit on the heavy side so I like to eat here in the winter. Last night, on a scorching evening, they had a lovely cold potato and leek soup which was perfect for the day. The Gage is very popular and very loud. A reservation is an excellent idea. If you don't have one, their great beer offering will keep you occupied.
