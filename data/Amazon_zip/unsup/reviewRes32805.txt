I will echo most of the other reviews on here - this has been on my list for awhile and it lived up to all the hype! Great atmosphere, our server was awesome, and food was delish! We had all sushi rolls and 2 desserts, and ate every last bite. Even convinced one of our table who hasn't been sold yet on sushi how delicious it can be! Thanks Sunda for a great girls night out! :)
