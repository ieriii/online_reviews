I remember discovering Doug's probably around my freshman or sophomore year of high school when he was on Roscoe just east of Western. When there was a fire and he wasn't going to re-open I was so sad, because Demon Dog had already closed and this had become my hot dog place. I rarely get anything extravagant, but that's because I'm so picky and honestly, I just want a polish & fries. It's cheap. It's good. Doug is so friendly. I love this place, though it can be a pain when I get a craving and forget it's a Friday afternoon and there's going to be a line. The duck fat fries are delicious. I worked for Whole Foods, and every now and then someone would go, so if you're ordering a decent amount, order ahead! I can't tell you how many times I see people walk in/walk right out while I'm stuck in line.  Also, don't forget to tip! It's not just the cooks, but also the guy or girl who are bringing you the food!
