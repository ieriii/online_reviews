Service was impeccable and I can taste the perfect steak as I think of it now. Have you ever had steak that was melt-in-your-mouth flakey? Ruth's Chris can deliver that experience and they do it well. Salad was good, sides tasted better than they looked. Busy busy busy downtown location, I'm not rushing to go back. Although, now that I think of it, Ruth's Chris was the first time my steak has stayed hot throughout my ENTIRE meal, thanks to their scorching plates!
