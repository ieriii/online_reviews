Carne Asada Burrito. No Cheese or Guac. With an extra side of pico de gallo and green hot sauce. (Enter higher level)Seriously, this is the end game. For me at least. I love this Burrito more than any single food item in the city of Chicago. The steak is just as it should be. It's medium, juicy and bursts with natural flavor. The pico de gallo is so fresh it could've been picked right out of their back garden. Everything comes together in spectacular fashion.If you haven't tried the carne asada burrito at Garcias, well...
