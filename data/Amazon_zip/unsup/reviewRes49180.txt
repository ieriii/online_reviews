Sick wine selection - like, analysis paralysis to the max. Total wino heaven. Love the lofty open feel, like you're in a winery - but kinda loud and crazy when it's packed. Did not love the burger and fries (what do you expect at a wine place, I know). It was okay, but not sure if the chef should be let near salt. Would definitely grab a glass here on a quieter night and chill out again though.
