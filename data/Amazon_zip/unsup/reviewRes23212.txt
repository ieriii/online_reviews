Excellent, authentic Sichuan food. We insist that they don't hold back the spices for us. Just wish the waiting queue was shorter at this place- we often go at odd hours to beat the lines. I wish that they spell 'Sichuan' the right way- there is no such thing as 'Sze Chuan'. It's a gringo misnomer.
