san francisco has bourbon and branch, nyc has milk and honey, and chicago has the violet hour. i was there last night and it was great. the drinks were fantastic and the lady server was very enthusiastic about the drinks and great at recommending what to have. and her trick with the orange peel? fabulous! the bathrooms have hooks, the place is dark and mysterious, and the fried pickles are actually quite delish. i had a champagne drink with rum and then a black/blueberry gin thing, which was fantastic and gave me these (takes pointer fingers and points to the taste buds at the back side of my jaw). the service was a little slow, but it's not like i was in a rush. and when i was leaving the bouncer guy said he would be out to help me find a cab in a minute and he never came out, which was a bummer. but all in all it was a super fun place. since i was there on a monday i voted for that to be the best night.
