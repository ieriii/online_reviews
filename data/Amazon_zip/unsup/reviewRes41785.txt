My favorite Argyle eatery... I alternate between 47 (beef pho), 92 (chicken curry - best broth ever), and whatever the numbers are for the seared duck w/egg noodles and catfish congee. They recently expanded their already colossal menu, and some prices have gone up. But they're still cheap for big, yummy bowls of soup. And on the bright side of the menu change, I no longer have to order my spring rolls with no pork - shrimp only now has it's own number (and letter, actually), hooray! If you're in a hurry, ask for your check as soon as the food comes. They won't bring it to you unless you ask for it, and good luck flagging them down during peak hours when the line's out the door. Waitstaff have always been pleasant over the years, even when busy.
