Best food in Chinatown! As soon as we sat down we got hot tea and spicy cabbage. We ordered the potstickers and steamed buns as a app. So tasty, the potstickers came with 2 dipping sauces. We couldn't get enough. For the entrees we ordered the dry chili prawns and the house special chicken. Food came very fast and was perfect. The bill was $35-$40 which is cheap! We will be back
