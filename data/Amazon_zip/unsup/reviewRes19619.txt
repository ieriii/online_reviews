Went after the Venetian Night Fireworks. Kitchen was open late which is very important for anyone who finds themselves hungry after a concert. Ordered the Fried Chicken Livers with spicy mustard. Decadently delicious. The Carmelized Lobster appetizer came with quinona which i was not crazy about, but the lobster was perfetto. The beef in the Pot au Feu melted in my mouth. I also tried the Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Brie. Genius. Very impressive space and menu. Will most certainly be back.
