i totally wimped out and got a burrito when i came here. mistake. my friend got something totally tradition and SO MUCH better. the oatmeal shake was life changing, however. actually-i am being a little dramatic. it tastes a lot like horchata, so if you like that, you will love this. this is much thicker and cinnamony.  the fried plantains were disappointing, though. the oil that they were fried in tasted really old. blegh!  the entire dinner lasted a reallllly long time because no one would bring us the bill. i find that to be really annoying and worthy of a star deduction. the food gets a 4 star review, the experience gets a 3.
