On my first visit to Gilt Bar, I thought it was kind of weird and maybe even lame that the "lounge" is just a slightly elevated area in the back. However, after sitting there a few times, I absolutely love the idea and the space. While difficult to describe, the decor at Gilt Bar always keeps me captivated. Something about this place makes me feel like I'm in an entirely different time and place. Interesting cocktails and a strong beer/wine list offer something for everyone. The pork meatballs are outstanding and the mussels are even better (particularly the fresh-baked bread that comes with them). The service can be slow at times, but for some reason it doesn't bother me here. Easily one of my favorite new spots in the city.
