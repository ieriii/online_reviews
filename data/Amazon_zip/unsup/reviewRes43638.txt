I went to Kinzie Chop House for dinner on a Wednesday night. The dining room was pretty empty, which is never a good sign. The restaurant is celebrating their 20th anniversary this year, and it shows in the ambiance and decor (i.e. it's looking a little old). Our waiter did a nice job of running through the different types of steaks, but overall the service was not good. The worst offense was that the waiter forgot to place our appetizer order! It also took us forever to get our dessert and our check. Considering it was a weekday and the place was practically empty...2.5 hours for our meal was way too long. On the plus side, I had the 12 oz. Filet with the Dolce Gorgonzola cheese and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. For our sides we got the mashed potatoes and asparagus. Both were solid but not spectacular. For dessert, I had the creme brulee which was very good. Summarizing, I would say Kinzie Chop House is a pretty typical Chicago steak joint. The food was good but the menu was pretty unimaginative. Combined with the bad, slow service and the dated decor I think you can find plenty of other better steak restaurants.
