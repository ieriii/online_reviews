I'm catching up on my Yelp reviews and remembering the best of my Chicago eating experiences. Publican brought turkey hearts, sweet breads, pigs ear, and fresh oysters into my normal dishes. I had always been a fan of oysters but had given up on getting good ones this far in from the ocean, but was proven very wrong. Though known for its pork dishes, I always seem to relish the wrong things here. The fact is that the chef and menu are just incredible. Its a perfect place to eat big and take risks. The ambiance can be fun if you are with the right crowd. Shared seating in the center and closed in booths around the edge give it a very social feeling. The lighting and use of wood are very modern and maybe even a bit sharp. Service is always friendly and a bit hectic. I've never seen the place slow. I've also missed out on brunch, which is rumored to be delicious.
