I quit going to Bin36 for dinner a year ago and stopped going to have wine 6 months ago. The food and table service are as bad as people have already stated on Yelp. The clincher was when I brought 6 colleagues and the server was asked 3 times for a glass of wine. he kept forgetting. When I explained it to the floor manager (who was since asked to leave his job), he said "hey it happens." I was less happy when the poor service started happening at the bar too. I have been there so many times I am sure that it's just a bad place. A couple of the bar tenders are fine, but most seem pissed that they are there and are anxious to be offended. I saw one chastise a customer for reminding him he ordered another glass. And then I started seeing call girls at the bar with older guys from time to time, and didn't want to go anymore. This place is almost like a dive bar trying to masquerade as a classy one. The Bucktown location is much, much better. The guy who was the best manager at the downtown location is over there. All told, Bin36 is good for breakfast though (part of the hotel), so It is worth one star. Avoid this place for anything else.
