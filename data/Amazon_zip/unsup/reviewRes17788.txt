Well, I was highly disappointed with Carnivale. We went last night for their Taste of Chile, only to find there were no Chilean dishes on the menu! I am Chilean and was excited at the chance to have some food that reminds me of home since there is only one Chilean restaurant in Chicago, but when I asked the waiter, he made up some BS answer about how their food is a mix of all Latin American countries so nothing is from "one" place. Then told me they had Chilean wine, yeah so do like 90 percent of the restaurants in the city. The food we did have was okay, pretty pricey though. Ended up with $200 for 4 people. Service not great. Forgot an item we had ordered and brought it out when we were already done eating and took 20 minutes to come take our order in the first place. All in all, besides the cool decor, this place was nothing special.
