Mercat starts with a bang and ends with a whimper.  After urging from the waitress, we decided to go with the tasting menu at about 58$ per person. Everyone at the table has to order the tasting menu. So. We eat. The first course consisted of a salad: cured meat wrapped around a spinach salad tossed in a light vinaigrette, complete with walnuts and blue cheese. This was a hit. Completely delicious and the flavor was just right. The cheese plate was also good. Paired well with slices of apple, except I noticed the slices were bruised.  Next, came the shrimp boiling in a bowl of sizzling spicy butter. While the spices complemented the seafood well, the shrimps themselves were about mediocre in freshness. Along with this course came the butternut squash ravioli. Two. In a large bowl. And it was lacking flavor. And honestly, nothing smells more like gimick than the cheesey flavored foam on top. If Anthony Bourdain complained about this kind of douchy behavior on Top Chef in 2000 and late, fast forward to 2009, who still uses this technique/shat?  Next, we were served sliced beef medallions/sirloin/jerky cut by a kindergartner. Every piece was jagged, uneven, and we were served horribly burnt end pieces that were doused in salt. The prawns were also a definite miss. Freshness was not on the menu. The last item we were served was a bowl of baked cabbage/broccoli. Except that it was thrown into a vat of salt and retrieved to be served on my dinner plate.  Honestly, we were off to a great start. How did it end so, so terribly wrong? It's definitely you, not me.
