When I walked in the door here, I felt instantly comfortable. We went on a Friday night, so the place was packed. But, there was no cover and we quickly found two seats at the bar with a good view of the stage. The band sounded good and musicians from the crowd took turns jumping in and out of the mix. You can't help but feel good in this room - I recommend it for anyone looking for a chill place to start or end an evening.
