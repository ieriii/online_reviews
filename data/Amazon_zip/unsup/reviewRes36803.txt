Extremely long wait for brunch on a Sunday which resulted in a huge disappointment. Service was mediocre at best. Extensive breakfast menu which seemd promising, not so for lunch entrees. My entree was tasteless and over cooked; friend's was prepared incorrectly. Servers gave you plenty of attitude when you asked for butter or syrup which they sometimes charge extra for. Frankly, don't waste your time. There are better options available.
