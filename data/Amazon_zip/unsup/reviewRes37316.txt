If you haven't been to Fox & Obel Market in Chicago you need to. It's Chicago's premier market for artisan foods and ingredients. Their chocolate section alone probably has 30 different chocolates. They have a big selection of imported pasta's, both local and imported craft coffee's, more cheese than you can imagine and it just keeps on going. It's weird, the place isn't really that big, but it's evident that they thought through every item they carry.  The market also houses a cafe and bistro. When Alisha and I were there we stopped by the cafe and picked up some coffee and a brioche danish. The coffee was good (and both have pretty discerning taste when it comes to coffee) but the brioche danish was insanely good, and I don't even like sweets much.   Like I said, you need to check this place out, and do it soon. It has been reported recently by Crain's that Fox & Obel may be at risk of foreclosure. It would be a sad day if they do close, but make sure you visit them while you still have the chance
