Best hot dogs ever. No real comparison at this point and I'm not really a hot dog person. The menu changes consistently and is posted on the wall (by the time you get to the menu everything looks good), the options keep you interested even if you've been to Hot Doug's before. The duck fat fries weren't bad, but for me, they underwhelmed. That being said, the hot dogs more than made up for the fries. As most everyone else has already pointed out, Doug works the counter and is friendly as can be. Doug's got a great sense of humor, quirky, down-to earth and will offer suggestions based on whatever info you give him (though you really can't go wrong). Best hot dogs, ever.The only downside is the wait and that it's crowded. We waited for around an hour and a half, which for some is ridiculous for any food, let alone hot dogs. For us, we'll be back, probably with a good book to read in line and we'll probably order more than one dog per person next time.
