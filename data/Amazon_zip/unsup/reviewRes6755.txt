Seeing as most BBQ is from the Southern area of the US, I wasn't sure where to find good BBQ in Chicago. Searching on Yelp brought Chicago Q up, and boy am I glad it did. I love how instead of bread and butter you're started off with some excellent chips and bread & butter pickles that are excellent. I then decided to have an Orange Blossom martini which was outstanding. I ordered the half slab of the St Louis ribs (more meat & fat than Baby Back) and it was outstanding. The ribs are served dry rub with a selection of sauces on the side. I like almost all of them. The original was sweet & tangy, the mustard was my fave with a nice kick to it, and the spicy was much like the original with some heat to it. The vinegar based one was just a little too runny for my taste. I also had a side of the mac & cheese which let me down. I can tell they were using cheddar which unfortunately doesn't melt too well and as it cools forms a mealy type texture. Still, the service was great, the price is nice, the decor is classy & relaxed, and it's just a great place to go. Looking forward to many more meals here.
