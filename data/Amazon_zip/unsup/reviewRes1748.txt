Hadn't been to Hot Doug's in about 2 years, so I knew I was do for a fixing of encased meat. I thought I had picked the perfect summer day, but buyer beware...if there's a Cubs game and Doug has been on a vacay for a while, there WILL be a LONG wait. I thought the line would move which it did after about an hour. As always the wait was well worth the delicious reward. I got to chat it up with Doug (I was after all wearing my I heart hot dogs t-shirt), got some tasty cream soda, a corner table in the back and the eating frenzy with the BF began. Luckily I kept my senses in control and focused on the duck fat fries and foie gras dog with truffle aioli (the first time in my 3 visits its been on the menu). Delicious. The spicy beef sausage with coca cola bbq sauce and bits of cheddar cheese on top was also divine.
