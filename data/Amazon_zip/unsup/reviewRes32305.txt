Sunda, please open a southern California location. My boyfriend had been raving about Sunda ever since he went in February so I was excited to give it a try. However, my Sunda experience started out rocky. We had reservations and still had to wait awhile (prob. 10 minutes or so) lucky their food won me over in the end. Sunda, word to the wise, switch you amuse-bouche back to the pork chips ASAP. People loved them on yelp and new amuse starts off the meal on a very poor flavorless note. I think the waiter said it was crab something? I was starting to think my Sunda experience wasn't going to be a good one! Sunda saved themselves with the following in order of how much I loved them! 1) Sunda Signature Sushi, shrimp tempura, avocado, wasabi. I think this may be my favorite thing I have ever eaten. I could eat at least 3 orders of this myself. ' 2) Roasted Duck Hash Salad, great flavors, highly recommended. Nice bug hunks of moist glazed duck in a wonderful sauce topped with an egg. 3) Rock Shrimp Tempura. I feel this is a really trendy dish at the moment, available with slight variation in many Asian fusion restaurants at the moment. I haven't met one I didn't like. This one wasn't my favorite I have ever had, but I would totally order it again, so clearly it was still good! 4) Rainbow Roll: My boyfriend warned me not to get sushi because everything else was so amazing at Sunda, but I didn't listen. It wasn't that the sushi was bad, because it was good! The sushi rice was wonderful and the fish was nice and fresh, but with all the amazing food at Sunda, don't waste your time with the basics. Finally we finished with the Ridiculous (carrot cake and vanilla ice cream fried). My boyfriend felt this was the best desert he has ever had. I thought it was very tasting, but not the best I have ever had. I wish more carrot cake flavor came through.
