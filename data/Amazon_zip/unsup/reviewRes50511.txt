We went there for Sunday Brunch. The food was decent, but not anything I'd be dying to have again. To be fair though, I am not exactly a Southern/Creole food connoisseur so I can not speak to the authenticity of it. We started off with the Crawfish Fritters (simply because they were out of the Crab Cakes), it was pretty decent, but nothing too special. For my entree, I had the Andouille Sausage & Sweet Potato Biscuits. The sausage felt like it was over-cooked as the casing was extremely tough and the meat just felt rubbery. The biscuits were pretty good though. Overall, the entree had a good mix of salty and sweet. The service was excellent. Very attentive and responsive and extremely friendly. I'd want to try other places before going back to this place.
