Couldn't get a reservation on a Friday night 2 weeks ago until 9:30pm. Although I tend to get cranky while extremely hungry, I was able to survive on some wine at the bar while my husband and I waited. Inside the bar is super intimate, but outside the deck is just beautiful. I couldn't stop looking at the landscaping as well as eating the bread and olive oil. Our proscuitto pizza was totally covered in proscuitto and I can't remember the pasta I ordered but it was also tasty. It's a great place to go at the end of a long week, look good, and enjoy the company with a group or significant other.
