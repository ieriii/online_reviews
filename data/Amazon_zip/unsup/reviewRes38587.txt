This place has a wide variety of beers from around the world, and some super-obscure beers, too. i ordered with some friends a beer that came in it's own weird-ass glass, like a chemistry decanter with a wooden frame built up around it. i don't even remember if the beer was good........anyways, it has a great atmosphere in the back room allowing a good sized groop to get loud and drunk. i think they also serve food, but since i don't read the other reviews below me, ( i don't want to be influenced) I'm not sure.
