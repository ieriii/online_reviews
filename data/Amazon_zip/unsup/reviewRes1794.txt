What else is there to say about Hot Doug's other than SO GOOD?! I don't eat meat, so I always just get two veggie corn dogs,(mostly because I have no idea what to get on the veggie dog and don't want to hold up the line or accidentally order ketchup and be frowned upon by everyone in Chicago), a drink, and sometimes I'll share some fries if I'm there with a friend. It's always SO good, and their soda's always seem to taste better than anywhere else. I wish I had one of the corn dogs right now, actually. I've come when the line was around the corner and completely down the block in 30 degree weather (Always worth the wait!), to three people in line ahead of me. So it's sort of a gamble, but even when it is busy, the line goes fast, and the employees do a good job making sure people don't steal tables without getting their food first! I just wish it was closer/easier to get to, and had wider hours, but it doesn't even matter, It's so good. Definitely check out Hot Doug's if you haven't yet, just make sure to check the website first to make sure they are randomly taking a day/week off for something!
