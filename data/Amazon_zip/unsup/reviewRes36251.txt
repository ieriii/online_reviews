When planning our Australia trip, my BFATT (boyfriend at the time) and I had the following conversation Me "I wish they have Yelp in Australia" He "You don't have to plan all those details, remember how good the place across the street was in Chicago?" Me "You really think we happened upon Meli? I yelped it!" Ok, the point is that Meli was good and Yelp was, once again, right. Even tho it was not exactly small, it had an intimate feel. The peach colored paint made you feel that the sun was always streaming into the restaurant, any time of the day and definitely a plus for a brunch place! In our short trip, we ate there twice, had the portobello benedict, corned beef sandwich, French toast with fresh berries and just simple eggs, potatoes and toast. All were good and they served the toast with homemade marmalade, a definite plus. BFATT commented how all the servers were attractive females with cute accent, and I would agree. The service was very friendly also.
