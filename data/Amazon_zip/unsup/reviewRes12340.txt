My dinner companion and I were trying to go somewhere else but when we got there the place had moved. We tried to find this other place but ended up at Cafe 28 instead. We were promptly seated outside, a cozy little space. It had a romantic atmosphere, except for one table who decided it was smart to bring their toddler to the place late on a weekend night!  I ordered a Mojito Martini. It was good, if not a bit too tart. For dinner, I chose an appetizer, a green tamale dish. It was more like a cornbread texture but tasted good, nonetheless. If I had been more hungry there were several things that I would have ordered so I think I will go back to try those. Close to home and a nice atmosphere.
