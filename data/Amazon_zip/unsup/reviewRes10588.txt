If you hate waiting, get there on a Monday at 5:00pm. There were probably a dozen patrons there when we walked in, but not an empty seat to be found by the time we left at 7. A good friend recommended this place to me. I said "Hey, I want good food and good beer for my birthday." She directed me here. Great choice. They have a hefeweissen that is to DIE for. With Franziskaner being my favorite "drinking" beer, I always try a wheat beer at a microbrewery such as this. My usual reaction is "I'd rather have a Franz". This beer, however, proved to me why it earned itself a Gold medal this year. It was incredible. All of the flavors blended perfectly, and while it had some weight to it, it was far from heavy. Perfect. The four of us ordered a medium red pizza with sausage and fresh basil, and a small white pizza with bacon, spinach, and fresh garlic. These pizzas came out fast, hot, fresh, and smelling like God himself. It had a nice thin crispy crust, perfectly melted cheese, fresh ingredients perfectly portioned, and wins for best pie in the city in my book. I'll be sad when that leftover piece of bacon goodness leaves my fridge. Service was actually great. Fantastic even. Our waitress was perfect. Friendly, efficient, fast.... everything that everyone else says doesn't happen here. Overall, this was a perfect meal, perfect beer, perfect price. For about 80 bucks, 4 of us were fed, 3 of us were drunk, and all 4 of us left very happy.
