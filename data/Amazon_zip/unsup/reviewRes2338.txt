Well, I saw Hot Doug's on the travel channel like two years ago and thought "Hm, looks tasty, if I'm ever there I'll check it out.". I just moved here (Chicago area) about a month ago and decided to go. It was AMAZING!!!!!!!! The best sausage, maybe, anything that I have ever tasted. I'm going back again on Friday!
