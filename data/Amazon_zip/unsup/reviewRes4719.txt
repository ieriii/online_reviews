The food, tapas style, was very, very good, and the portions were reasonable -- two dishes ordered per person -- minus one the waitress told us near the end of the meal that they did not have. A little salty, and that will be fine for those who like and don't have to limit intake. The restaurant offers a number of unusual European beers and ales, draft and bottled. The waitstaff was very experienced, very pleasant; no rushing, not too much asking how we were doing. Just right. The desserts went over very well, too.
