Was in Chicago for some company meetings so all the out-of-towners headed here one night. While we waited for a couple of stragglers to get in from O'Hare we ordered up some crab cakes, calamari, shrimp cocktail, and popcorn shrimp. Everything was well cooked, but I couldn't stop eating the cheesy rolls and crispy flat breads from the bread basket. "More bread please!!" I got the Blue Crab stuffed Virginia Flounder with a Stone Crab claw as my side. My main was delicious. The outer flounder was perfectly cooked and juicy and the crab stuffing was a great compliment. The Stone Crab claw, however, was a bit bland for me. By the satisfied smiles and the lack of conversation, I'd say everyone else was enjoying their food as well. They also have a limited selection sushi menu, which none of us were brave enough to try. Maybe our mistake. We'll give it a go next time. ;-) Food: 4 stars Service: 4 stars Price: huh? (my boss picked up the tab) =D
