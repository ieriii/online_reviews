I haven't been to many Korean BBQ in my day, but last night's dinner was pretty awesome. I couldn't believe how many side dishes we got with our BBQ. It was a bit slow on a Tuesday night at 10:30pm, so the service was good. Got my water refilled a lot because the food is pretty salty. I like salty. I can only give this place 4 stars mainly because I was recently in LA and my friend Richard took me to the best place Korean BBQ place in his opinion. They serve a massive amount of onions with vinegar and a little wasabi. I think that's what San Soo Gab San was missing. Plus it wasn't BYOB.
