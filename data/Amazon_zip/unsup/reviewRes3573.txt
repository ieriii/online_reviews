Crisp is a bright, funky little place with excellent customer service and very polite staff. Being BYOB is always a plus in my book too! So, why the reason for the so-so review you might ask? I blame myself mostly. While, I could have tried various new and exciting items such as the "Buddha Bowl" or their renown chicken wings in "Seoul Sassy" sauce, I opted for less adventurous option, the chicken burrito. Why? Well I was starving and it was familiar. The chicken burrito was "meh." While it did have a unique peanut-esque type of flavor to it, it was overall dry and I was not very impressed. My boyfriend ordered the steak burrito and displayed the same level of enthusiasm towards it as I did my own dish. That and the communal table can be a pain in the rear. It really can ruin a dining experience when you sit literally next to two loud-mouthed white collar men yelling about "corporate" and one accidentally pulling off part of his shirt while removing his outerwear and exposing bodily hair to the unsuspecting viewer. That being said, I would be more than willing to try Crisp again and will certainly try something more unique and I am sure more palette-friendly. If the place weren't too small I would also recommend going with 4 or so people in order to reserve a communal table for only your group and thus hopefully avoid being seated next to customers who may make you lose most of your appetite. However, the size of Crisp may make dining-in with a group very tricky and not necessarily recommended.
