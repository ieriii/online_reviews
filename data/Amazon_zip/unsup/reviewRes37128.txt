What has happened to this store? I'm willing to pay 50% more for yogurt rather than have to stop at Dominck's on the way home from F&O. I'm even willing to pick through the usual moldy raspberries and cherry tomatoes, wilted lettuce, etc. in their hopeless produce department. But how about checking their juice sell-buy dates every now and then? Today I bought a quart of fresh-squeezed orange juice. While looking all over the bottle for a price tag (there was none, and no sign), I failed to notice that the sell-buy date was June 5. Needless to say this $6 orange juice was fermented. I'm so used to their rotten produce that I blamed myself for not paying closer attention! It's a mystery why a store with such high-quality fish and meat and cheese has the worst produce department in town.
