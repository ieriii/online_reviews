probably a 3.75 for food but a 2.5ish for menu options and service. the food was indeed above average in quality and portion size was huge, though it was also expensive, but i liked the BYO aspect. however, they really only had one salad on the menu which was tucked away in the corner like "don't order me, i am just a house salad" i thought my entree of meatball and sausage w pasta was well balanced, but da wife had the pollo arrabiatta which consisted of 4 huge pieces of chicken and a tiny side of pasta. i understand italian menus with the different courses and that, but to me, why give some 4 times the protein they need and 1/4 of the pasta they would need. why not make the dish half pasta and half protein? and the service was slow
