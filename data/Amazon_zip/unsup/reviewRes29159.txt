I wanted to give them 4 stars, I really did, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I have been to Pasta Bowl a couple times. I have to say that the macaroni and cheese and the fettucini alfredo are both delicious, but the spaghetti and meatballs that I had a couple of days ago was blah and the garlic bread was barely cooked. The marinara sauce was a little watery and the meatballs didn't have much flavor. The food is inexpensive for Italian food and the atmosphere is bar-like, so if that's what you're looking for, this is the place. I also like that if not everyone in your group wants Italian, you can order from the Otherside menu, as well.
