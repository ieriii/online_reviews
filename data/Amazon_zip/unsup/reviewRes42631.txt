Pizza made right means only one thing... Pizza from my hometown Sao Paulo!! And that's what i got after more than 5 years in the states!! I know, i know you Chicagoans are proud of your deep dish pizza, but that's nothing compared to a good Calabresa made "No Capricho" with a little Coxinha as an app with some Tubaina (guarana brasilia is not real guarana. it's a cheap version that we call tubaina, but it's pretty good anyways). I order from fogo at least 3 times a month since i've discovered this place by accident and so far the only thing that i didn't like was the pao de queijo (hint: never use pre made pao de queijo, they get way better when you do the thing from scratch). If you never had pizza from my city go there and order a calabresa no capricho so you can see why us paulistas are so proud of our pizza!!
