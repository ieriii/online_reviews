The Green Mill!!! What a swank joint! I have been here twice, and both times loved it...great jazz, great vibe, great interior. I love the long bar, the wood details...it truly is a classy spot. I love jazz, and the music I've heard here has been really grade-A. I also love how late it stays open (but I'm from Boston where everything closes at 1AM...which sucks hardcore let me tell you)...but anyway. If you want good music, good drinks, and a good time hit up the Green Mill. I also heard Al Capone used to come here as a regular in his heyday...and it still feels like that inside, like a trip back to the 1920's...go!!!
