Garcia's from the outside is not at all what comes across inside. Granted, there are a million Mexican restaurants in Chicago and this certainly isn't comparable to many of the upscale, fusion-like, swanky places in the city but for good, solid food at reasonable prices - it is your best bet, especially for this neighborhood. The restaurant itself is ginormous, tables are nicely spread out. The size and ceiling height makes it loud and I wouldn't recommend this for a romantic date spot, it's just not that type of place. For families or gathering with a couple friends, it's perfect. The complimentary chips and salsa are delightful. I tend to be a bit of a salsa snob and I always judge a restaurant by the quality and freshness or lack of freshness of the salsa. Garcia's passed my test! The burritos are massive and though I didn't have one, they looked delicious and the people at my table who ordered them were more than impressed with both the size and flavors. I had a combination platter with chile relleno and enchilladas. Loved the enchilladas, will skip the chile relleno next time. The egg batter was a bit overwhelming and the charred taste that I love about chile rellenos was missing here. The margaritas were excellent. It only took one to put me in a margarita drinking day kinda mood that exceeded way past lunch time. The strength was just enough to give me the grand idea of picking up more margarita mixing madness from the Jewel down the street....so yes, I would say it wasn't strong in a bad way - strong in a very, very good way!
