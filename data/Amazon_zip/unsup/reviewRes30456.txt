Love the Frontera! Been going since my college pal (who hails from San Anton) bought me lunch and told me it was the best Mexican in the US. This was in 92, and I think Frontera had just opened the year before. Having grown in up in Az, I thought I knew Mexican cuisine, but I soon discovered that what I had grown up with was Tex-Mex. First mole was exquisite. Have been trying to make it back at last once a year, even in lean times (like this year). The food, after 15 years is still the best. And yes, it's worth a long wait. Can't wait to try Xoco.
