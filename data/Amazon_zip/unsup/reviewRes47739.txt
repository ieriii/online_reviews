First of all I'd definitely say a 4.5 for food. All of the meats were excellent, especially the seared ahi tuna and the tempura style mahi mahi. The "harvest table" aka "fancy salad bar" also had an excellent selection including a large selection of cheeses.  My complaint about this place is the customer service. When I called to make the reservation, I got a very friendly hostess who asked if this was for a special occasion. I said it was for my girlfriend's birthday, and when we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess wished her a happy birthday. So far so good... they then seat us in this secluded area towards the back of the restaurant. I'm thinking that's a good thing so that way its quiet. This actually was bad, because the chefs with the meat barely came back to serve us. I had to request twice for the chef with the seared ahi tuna to come back to our table.  Also, the way we were sitting, my girlfriend had her back to this door that was about 5 feet behind her. I was facing her, and thus facing this door. I didn't think anything about it, until halfway through our meal, when a customer opens the door. I then hear what sounds like a hand dryer go off, and then the door opens, and I am looking right into a bathroom, and we can clearly hear the toilet still flushing. This was extremely unacceptable considering that they knew it was for my girlfriend's birthday.  I would go back again only because of the food, but I will request to sit in the main part of the restaurant, no where near the freaking bathroom. It damn near ruined our evening.
