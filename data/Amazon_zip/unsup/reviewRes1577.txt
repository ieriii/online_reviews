It took me four years to try Hot Doug's. Why? There was something about gourmet encased meats that didn't appeal to me. Well, I was SO wrong! This place was absolutely delicious. My mouth is still watering just writing about it. My cousin was visiting from Pennsylvania and numerous friends suggested that I take him to Hot Doug's. We drove over on a Saturday at noon (surprisingly, street parking was easy) and the line was around the block -- a good sign that this place was something special. Once we got to the front of the line, about 45 minutes later, we were greeted by Doug himself. He couldn't have been nicer; greeted everyone coming in and thanked everyone leaving. We noticed that Hot Doug's was cash only and so we only had enough for two dogs. We chose the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut and the Hot Sauce Chicken Sausage with "Buffalo" Mustard and Smoked Moody Blue Cheese. Doug asked us if we wanted anything else. We told him we were satisfied with the two dogs and then he said if cash wasn't an issue, would we like to have fries and drinks? We were shocked (and a little embarrassed) but he happily gave us their famous Duck Fat Fries and two drinks free of charge! What a guy! After we placed our order, we sat down at one of the tables inside and chowed down. This was one of the best lunches I have ever had. So much flavor. Just the right size. Fresh ingredients. Great hospitality. I can't wait to go back and try another dog! Thanks Doug!
