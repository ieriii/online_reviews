I enjoyed the 70's decor. The Music and the interior will make you want to do the hustle while you wait for some good food. I got a Mushroom and swiss burger it came with really tasty homemade chips. I really liked the burger because you can order the temperature and it came out medium well. Also the waiter told another table that they invented the salad bar. I dont think i quite believe that. There must have been restaurants before 1971 that put lettuce and fixings out for people to pick themselves. Besides that it was a great find! Try this place for lunch if your in the area.
