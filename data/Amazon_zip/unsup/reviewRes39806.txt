I used to be a regular here b/c they have above average Korean BBQ in the Chicago area. It's the closest the city has to offer but no where near as good as NYC's Korean restaurants. The Galbi and Bulgogi are good but I recently decided to boycott this establishment because I can no longer tolerate their terrible service. Their service has always suffered with their long waiting times and lack of respect from the waitresses. The food is good but not worth the stress of wondering if we'll be pissed off by their rudeness and incompetence by the end of the night. The only positive I can give is that they're open late night, but don't let that lead you to think their service is any better at odd hours.
