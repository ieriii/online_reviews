Hello, pork lovers, look at your menu, now back to your server, now back at your menu, now back to your server. Sadly, you can't order everything on the menu, but if you ask your server for recommendations and order one of the three sizes of wine out of the amazing selection, you could be enjoying cheese, swine and wine. Sit outside under the heated tent (although not too close to the drafty sides- BRRRR), or inside (although it can get very crowded), where are you? You're enjoying Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic (NOM). What's in your hand, back to your Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes (NOM and VEGETABLES). You've got it, it's Prosciutto di San Daniele and Sopressata (MMMMM PORKY MEAT). Look again, the pork is now a selection of three cheeses- Le Chevre Noir, Camembert and Delice de Bourgogne. Anything is possible when you order wine you don't like and send it back for replacement wine- no problem. I'm on a pig.
