Yet # one hundred-something, on my list of places I've missed reviewing for ages, but wonder if I should bother reviewing. Been here plenty of times, and you can't really go wrong with this place. And despite that the wait to eat it here can be annoying at times, unless you get here early. Great microbrews(I've always been partial to Dysfunctionale and Golden Arm), and great pizza. From New Haven(plain on Piece's menu) style, onto regular red pizza. They even have a barbeque pizza that isn't bad, with Smoke Daddy sauce. Though I've never had any of their appetizers, desserts, or a karaoke night, I'm sure that'll come at some point. And which will be a fair time to see if it deserves the 5th star, though I already think of it as 4.5 anyway.
