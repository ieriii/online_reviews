I would give more stars but a tiny glass of the cheapest wine is still $8.00 So you are stuck drinking beer if you don't want to walk out with $100 bill for brunch. I'm getting the mimosa with breakfast tomorrow from all the great reviews! Damn the cash. We had the seat by the door too. It was horrible to be trampled on with all the people crowding all around me. But I have to find a diner since Augies on Clark shut down. The food here is just divine. Not an every day sort of diner if you are looking for that old time real diner experience. Service was so slow, at the end of our meal no one came to take our money. I should've walked out since I was sitting in the doorway already! So to be polite we got up and went to the back bar to finally get our bill so others could be seated. So I will continue to do that whenever I go here. So everything about this place sucks now that I see what I wrote, but the food is so good you just can't stop going. I love it. I hate it. Kinda like abusive relationships. They slap you around, but you love them and keep going back! Well at least that's how my hubby operates. I smack him and he keeps coming back for more! lol Oh and I don't even need to talk about the food. It's all palette perfection as you have all said already, and a menu is available on-line. Then check the chalkboard menu for the dailies. And yes, when you are a newbie they give a very long speech about the foods and the restaurant itself. I guess that is called good service, but it just works against them when it's rockin--busy. They gotta find a way to shorten the stay there. It's very hard to eat when 50 people are all lined up staring at you to hurry up and finish. So I'd get the bill asap after you order. So you can let others enjoy the delicacies.
