I know this place is run by the Cheesecake Factory, and while the food is similar, the atmosphere is far superior. With a large dining room, and great seating off of Michigan Avenue, a romantic dinner with dessert can run 1/2 the price of other places that offer a similar setting. One of the few great values off Michigan.
