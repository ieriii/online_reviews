I stayed here for a month... a very long month. I stayed here for business for a month and was pretty disappointed. THE BAD The TV's were awful. They are the old tube kind, big and bulky. It reminded me of the kind you see in a motel. I brought my ps3 and could not hook it up because it was blocked. The Internet was way too slow, I tried to download a TV show fro iTunes and it literally took my 36 hours. There are no ice machines No in room coffee makers (they do offer complimentary coffee in the lobby until 9:30 but every time i tried to get some it was EMPTY! and if you try going closer to 9:30 the hot water for tea will not be hot) Terrible water pressure in the shower The bottom sheet on the bed kept coming off so I would wake up with my head on the mattress. THE GOOD Great Location.
