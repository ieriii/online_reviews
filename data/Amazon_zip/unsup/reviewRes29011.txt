Like Rick Bayless needs my plug... I've eaten here maybe six times over the past dozen or so years, dinners, brunches (people who fear Frontera will be too expensive might want to try brunch--it can be pretty reasonable), and most recently, lunch. This time, after calling at 10 am and failing to be granted a reservation, we walked right in and were seated without a wait, which was a nice surprise. The room is inviting with its lively paintings, costumes and giant carvings; the server was gracious; and the food was muy fabuloso. We had the house ceviche, queso fundido de pollo, enchiladas mole de poblano, and tamal en mole amarillo. I think I'm in love with mole amarillo (less so in love with the ricotta-filled tamal--just a tad sweeter than I was expecting)--complex, earthy, and great on the grilled squash that was tucked beneath the tamal. I really love that Rick Bayless cares about gardens and that some home-grown produce makes it into the dishes. It's a guarantee that you're not going to get a bland, mealy hothouse tomato in August (which has happened to me at many other restaurants, including a couple of expensive ones). The margaritas are excellent (I favor the mescal), and this time I ordered their michelada. It was light, refreshing and huge, and the chipotle salt on the rim adds a nice level of heat. One tiny suggestion I think they should take--buy some straws that are as deep as the glass. I kept having to fish mine out of my drink. It was expensive, but a treat.
