Love Crisp! That Seoul Sassy sauce is the best! I love their fried mushrooms, and I don't like mushrooms. Onions rings are great, too. The spicy sauce that they come with is so good! I make sure to ask for extra sauces. The chicken wings are delicious, but the tenders are even better because I think they are easier to eat.
