The food at Mia is very affordable and, generally, very good. It's not the food that made my last experience so awful--it was the service. The waiter did not know the menu, lost our dinner order and never really apologized for the long delay in getting our food. There are other places to go in Lakeview where food and prices are equally as compelling and the service is just better. If you have bad service, you should alert the manager. Service quality has been falling dramatically over the past year or so.
