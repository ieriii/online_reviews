Brought out of town guests here to have a sit down meal the other weekend (usually, Simply It is my go to lunch restaurant, so I know it's a great choice). Everyone had a wonderful time. I'm not sure whether it's the superb food or the wonderful service (probably both) but the dining room was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time.Everyone who I brought had a great meal, and my out of town guests insisted that they want to come back here next time they visit Chicago.A+!
