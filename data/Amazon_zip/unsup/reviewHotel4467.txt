So, if your not wanting to stay in a chain Hotel with cookie cutter options then this might be your place. Elegant and clean with a location inside the Loop. From the airport take the Blue line and get off at the Monroe stop. $2.25 and 30 minutes later your 2 blocks away.... The rooms are VERY small so get an Executive Floor room and enjoy more room and on the 23rd floor everyday you get breakfast and a bar at night with free munchies. NO WIFI......... ethernet....WTF No flat screen TV. but Showtime is free.... Great GYM for $10 a day.... Parking is $30 a day .... Sweet lounge/bar but pricey...... Overall we had a blast and only paid $95 a night with priceline so it was well worth the price.... Chicago rocks........
