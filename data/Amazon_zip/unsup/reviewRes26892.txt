Atmosphere: Casual and hip. Good space between tables. I was a bit underwhelmed with the popcorn. Stale. It was seasoned beautifully but it had gone stale. Disappointing. Decided on the 10 course Experience. Definite highs and the occasional low. Almost every course was excellent. The corn bisque was the most surprising. On paper, it sorta made me cringe. It was probably one of my favorite courses. The wagyu tartare and sweetbread schnitzel were definite highlights of the night as well. The dish i found most disappointing was the jidori chicken. Undercooked in the center. It was a tough, translucent glob. I did take a small cut off the a side that was cooked through. Maybe i was already turned off, i just didnt like it. Service: Eh. Our waitperson seemed to rely heavily on the servers and bussers. I asked a busser if we could order more drinks. He said "yes" and nothing happened. I dont think he spoke much english. After 30mins, i asked one of our plate servers if we could order more drinks. She went and found our MIA waitperson. After that, she was a lot more attentive. I didnt point out my undercooked chicken just because a 10 course tasting is about 3hrs and our server was just not there for me to point it out. Cocktails were inconsistent as well. My husband and I ordered the same drink. They tasted drastically different. Off night? Perhaps.
