This place is flat out amazing. I consider myself to be a bit of a connoisseur of southern soul food and this place is the real deal. For starters we had the pork belly and it was, literally, 'melt in your mouth.' I could have just had a couple plates of that for dinner. My wife had the shrimp and grits which was done perfectly. The shrimp were obviously fresh and not rubbery or 'fishy' tasting. The grits also had the proper amount of butter. It was decadent and wonderful. I had the pulled pork which was fantastic. Understand that this is North Carolina style which means it's going to have a sharp vinegary taste to it and cole slaw is *not* a side, it's a topping. This was very fresh pork and you could tell it had been slow cooked properly. It came with a side of fried okra, which is usually hit-or-miss for me. Here it was absolutely a hit. The waiter even brought me out a nice side sauce for it which made it out-of-sight. Others in our group had the "Sweat Tea infused pork chop" and they were very happy. The chop was cooked to perfection and I'm thinking I may try that again. Also, I'd encourage you to take a look at the drink menu. I had a tasty concoction called a Sazerac Rye which was outstanding but I would not suggest drinking more than one if you have to drive or walk any substantial distance as they are as potent as they are potable. My wife had the non-alcoholic Ginger Sweet Tea and it too was very good. I'd better wrap this up as I'm running out of positive adjectives to use. This place is awesome and I plan to go back very soon. Hopefully to investigate their extensive brunch menu.
