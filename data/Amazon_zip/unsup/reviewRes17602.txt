I had my first experience with Indian food here! Loved it! I went with a friend and she did the ordering for the table. I don't remember the names of whast we had but the food was fabulous! I tried anything and everything that came to the table. The aroma inside is wonderful and the place was really busy when we were there. I will definitely go back again!
