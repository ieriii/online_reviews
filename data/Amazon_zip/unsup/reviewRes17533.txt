Adding to the rave of the violet hour is another 5 star review. I really enjoyed this classy place on a weeknight when I knew it wasn't going to be craAZY and I could enjoy it. Ordered the wings which were pretty good. What got me was the drinks. Worth every penny. I hate/love the decor. Its unique and cozy but so hard to read the menu.
