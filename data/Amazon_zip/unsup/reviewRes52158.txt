While Gino's East is not MY favorite for Chicago deep dish, it is very good and is my boyfriend's favorite :) We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated at 7:30 PM on a Friday night. Not too bad if you ask me... Quick service. Knew we would be waiting awhile for our Deep Dish but you can easily distract yourself by writing on the walls ;) The sauce is a sweeter sauce than most pizzas I have had. The crust has a very distinctive corn taste and is nice and crunchy. Not as much cheese as Giordano's but still very delicious and filling.
