My boyfriend and I met two other friends at this restaurant per their suggestion. What a fantastic find! Their drinks were great and their ice teas were fantastic - they serve unsweetened tea to you in a beaker with a small cup of syrup that you add yourself depending on how strong you want the flavoring. For appetizers we shared the pork, fried green tomatoes and the crab cake--all amazing. And for dinner my boyfriend got the fried chicken special and it was out of this world. Melted off the chicken practically and was perfectly seasoned. I had the catfish and grits and might consider getting it for a takeout dish in the future--totally scraped the plate clean. One of our friends is vegan and they have multiple items for her to choose from, which was very good. The server was very nice, the atmosphere was very relaxed and comfortable but still elegant - prices were very reasonable for what we ordered and all in all it was a fantastic experience. Can't wait to go back!
