I'll try anything once...and this is one of those places. I won't be spending another Saturday afternoon waiting in line for something that doesn't taste like a piece of heaven. Way over hyped. This is a place for people who have never actually tasted gourmet. -Flavors are not actually inside the sausages, but put on top of the dog...real creative...i.e.cherry sausage, think comstock cherry pie filling on top of a dried out Italian wiener. -Line to get in almost 2 hours. -Only one cashier, Doug who seems unmotivated to make things move along better -Four people making the dogs in the back....I have an idea, 3 guys cooking, two taking orders=20 minute wait... -Not worth the price $8 a dog so that you can eat unusual things like elk, venison, rattlesnake...try your local butcher, they can get you the same types of meat. -Only takes cash, makes you wonder if they pay all of their taxes -The cheese was good, but cold cubed cheese made the dogs feel cold when you got them -Sausages were all dry...Who ever heard of a pork sausage that was dry? -Sausages were small Since I can't give 0 stars, the 1 star is for the hype.
