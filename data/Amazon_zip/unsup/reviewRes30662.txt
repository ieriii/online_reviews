My husband took me here for my 30th Birthday dinner and I have been thinking about our meal there ever since! I loved the atmosphere in the downstairs bar while we were waiting for our table! I loved the live piano music and 2 singers. The room was so lively and fun. Although, the crowd seemed much older than us. (However, I made a mental note that when I am about 45 or 50 this might be a good hangout for me! ) There were lots of martinis being drank all around! I like that some of them come out smoking with dry ice. Fun effect! We sat in the upstairs dining room which seemed to have less atmosphere than the downstairs one but was still very nice. We were seated next to what appeared to be a bachelor party but really didn't mind. However, a manager at the restaurant noticed and insisted on putting us at a nicer table. The service was over the top great all night. The food was outstanding. Dont even get me started on the bread basket. The best I have had! Ah. I would go back just for that. haha. But then the steaks. Ahhh! They come out sizzling and both my husband and I agreed they were some of the best we have ever had. I got a Filet and my husband got a bone in Kansas City Strip. We also got a few sides. Some potatoes and the Mac and Cheese. Both great. For my birthday desert they brought me out a ridiculously huge and delicious slice of chocolate cake. I was stuffed but found room for it!!! Overall, GREAT! I hope to be back someday!
