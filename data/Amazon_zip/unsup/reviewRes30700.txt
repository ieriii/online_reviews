I would give this place another try. My husband had the 24oz T bone and I got the $99 Tomahawk steak. We had the onion soup and the gnochhi. The Onion soup was hearty and wasn't bad. The gnochhi was soooo good. The place was too dark. So dark that the servers carried flash lights. The reason why I have an issue with the lighting was because when i came home to see my steak, i wish i would have seen what i saw when i was there and i would have said something. The Tamahawk was descibed to me as the American sytle of Kobe beef. Although the meat did have the marblization I expected it to have it also had more chunks of fat in the middle of it than I would have paid for a $99 steak., Maybe I just got the one bad apple.  We did request to switch servers too. Bill greeted us and did a marvolus job. He was super informative, well spoken, and a great attitude. The reason why we switch was because we felt like our original server tried to talk my husband down on when to order since i ordered such an expensive steak. She told me he didn't need the 48oz tbone you need the 24oz and only get the half order of gnocchi.
