Le Colonial is the latest in a series of sub-par Asian restaurants I've tried since coming to Chicago. Perhaps it's my roots on the West Coast, or the extensive time I've spend in Asia, but I've had more misses than hits in this category recently. Le Colonial bills itself as a French-Vietnamese restaurant harking back to the French-Indonesian period around the turn of the century. They got the ambience right, but that was about it. The service tended toward the snooty, and the food was just average. Most of the dishes were exact duplicates, or slight adaptations of what you'd find at street corners in Vietnam, or hole-in-the-wall eateries on the West Coast. But the good thing about street food is that you get it piping hot off the grill and you can try lots of tasty little bites. The food here was overwrought and nearly cold by the time it got to our table, and the flavor profiles varied from bland to over-salted. We also tried a few of their "famous" house cocktails and were equally underwhelmed.  Oh--and it costs about five-times as much as the tasty hole in the wall joints. I really wanted to like this place, but just couldn't bring myself to wright a positive review.
