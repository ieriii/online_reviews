It's the sweet potato fries and goat cheese fondue that keep me coming back. This was a great addition to the Rogers Park/Edgewater area. Perfect representation of the eclectic vibe that sweeps through this north side hood. Like the home of a former hippie, they've replaced the patchouli and amber incense with organic meal options and live music. Plates dressed with the flair of top chef and food that begs for 4 stars. There's a small, chic bar area to the left when you enter (drinks are not cheap), the dining room a little further in (very cute but very impersonal on a full night - you may be elbow to elbow with a stranger) and a performance space in the back, complete with stage. When there is room to spread out, which is usually, this is the perfect setting for a romantic date or for just a chill, comfortable dinner with friends during the week. Free parking, patio seating and pluggers for cool bands sitting in a stand by the bathrooms - they make for great art on an empty apartment wall - just grab a frame from the dollar store and go crazy! Again, try the sweet potato fries with the goat cheese fondue. You can thank me later.
