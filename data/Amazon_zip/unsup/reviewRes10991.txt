Went there for a birthday party with a group of 12 on a Tuesday night. My natural time is to run between 15-30 mins late, so I don't know how seating went, but everyone has plenty of room to cause a ruckus in the elevated area we sat at. Got an artichoke heart white pizza (did my friends fail to mention it would be loaded in garlic? why, yes they did. I'm almost vampiric when it comes to that stuff) and a goat cheese green pepper pizza (om nom nom.) Here's an oddity: they called the birthday girl with rules about what was allowed and what wasn't. I didn't get the whole gist of it, but something along the lines of "we close at 10:30, your butts better be in the cold paying the valet 10 mins beforehand. Also, over the course of 2 hours, we saw 4 same sex couples. Is that weird? It seemed to be more than I'm used to seeing. Or maybe I am a conservative tight ass who hasn't noticed a general change in the population. Whatevs. I'm told that a party of 2 on a saturday night can expect to wait 2.5 hrs. Aw Hell no. The pizza was good, but i wouldn't wait 2.5 hours for it (call up eduardo's instead) They had lots of TVs so I bet it would be fun to come here during say March Madness or for a football game, but you'd probably have to wait ungodly long.
