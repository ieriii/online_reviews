This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants in the city (and I don't even live in the neighborhood). When you go in, even for your first time, they make you feel like family. The food is great, the staff are amazing, the wine list is long, the atmosphere is relaxed yet intimate, and the portions are gigantic. Seriously, you could easily share a main with someone else and still not finish it, especially if you order the lasagna. And with the lighting and ambiance of this trattoria, it's the perfect setting for a cozy date night meal for two. The prices might at first appear to be a bit on the steep side, but the food is delicious and abundant, which really creates a pretty good value for you dollar. The thing that completely blew me away about Sapori Trattoria though was that after our first dining experience there, we received a hand written note of thanks for coming in and trying their food. Who does that? It was so thoughtful, and the perfect extra touch to what was already a fantastic meal.
