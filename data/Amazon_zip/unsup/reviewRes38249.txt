This place sucks donkey balls unless you like really crowded bars, noisy restaurants, shitty service and terrible food. I dined here last month with a date. Not only did I not like my date, I REALLY didn't like Hopleaf. We were there for the food so I cannot comment on the beer selection. I'm not into beer anyway, so it likely would not improve the star rating. We were seating at a cramped tell in a very, very loud dining room. Our server acted bothered every time she visited our table. I ordered the steak frites. DISGUSTING. I could not believe how gross the beef was. I wouldn't serve that dustrag looking cut of meat to my dog. It was so tough that the flimsy steak knife almost broke in two and stabbed another diner. The frites were fine, average at best. There are far better restaurants and bars in the area.
