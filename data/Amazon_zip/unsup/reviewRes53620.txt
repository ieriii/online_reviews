Our meal at Schwa was a masterpiece, with mouthwatering courses, perfect service, and yes, a crazy atmosphere. I flew in from Miami to meet one son from Milwaukee and another from LA for a gustatory week and it was indeed, the high point, even considering our meal at Alinea and Topolobompo. I did call 200 times to get the reservation and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Michael and his brother, Seth and the rest of the crew made us feel like beloved family and gave us a memory we'll never forget and hope to repeat. It takes culinary genius to create the dishes and warm and open hearts to give us such a superlative experience. Get your dialing finger ready! You'll be glad you did.
