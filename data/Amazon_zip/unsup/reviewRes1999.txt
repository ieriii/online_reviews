Now I haven't been to every restaurant on the planet, but even so I can say with no uncertainty that Hot Doug's is one of the very best restaurants in the entire world. There's nothing else to say, really. except I wish they were open for dinner too... alas, I shouldn't complain because I know just how lucky I am to live in the same city as this landmark in the first place. Do you eat meat? y/n? if you answered yes, then it is your duty and great privilege to eat at Hot Doug's. p.s.: Thank you, Doug, you're the man.
