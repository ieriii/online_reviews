I go to school nearby and I came to know through a friend that the food here is supposed to be really good. So I already had high expectations. The first time I went there was actually a terrible experience. Obviously, 'cuz I went here on a Friday night with a bunch of friends. If I had written a review based on my experience that night, I'd have given it 1 star. But I knew yelp doesn't lie and decided to give it another try. This time for lunch on a weekday. I really enjoyed the ambience and the wine selections. I had the burrata (the mozzarella was to die for!!), beet salad with candied walnuts and the pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil. I liked both the taste and the presentation of these dishes. I loved Davanti the second time around and now I'll go there only at times I know for sure that its not going to be crowded.
