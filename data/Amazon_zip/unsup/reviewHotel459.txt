Came here for a bachelorette party and it more than met our needs. The rooms were well sized, especially in order to accommodate our entire party. The biggest bonus areas for this hotel is the cocktail hour and breakfast served in the morning. Though they give cards for both these times, in our experience none of the bartenders checked for them before serving the beverages, meaning we could get back in line again and again for a new, fun cocktail. Fabulous! The breakfast was similar. It had a great amount of choice, from hot eggs, bacon, pancakes and potatoes, to cereal, breads, muffins, oatmeal and then made-to-order omelettes, as well as biscuits and gravy. Though, it's important to take note that the made-to-order line can get extremely long, especially on weekends and later in the mornings. If you don't want to wait, go early on stay during weekdays.  Only complaint here is the noise that can be heard from inside the hotel room. Because the entire hotel is set up around a large atrium, any activity in the lobby, or any hallway can be heard from inside the rooms. For a light sleeper, this can cause some issues, so sleepers beware. Otherwise, this hotel was a great deal for all of the perks they offer and somewhere I'd definitely stay again, especially for a girl's night or weekend.
