The upstairs is another world.  It feels like Vietnam when the French controlled it (at least in my imagination).  The food, decor and service are all outstanding !  Their menu is exotic....in a good way.  I love the minty flavors in their fresh spring rolls.   I usually order the shrimp on sugar-cane appetizer.  Their fish menu items are so great !   OK, the bill can be a shocker....it is expensive.  But there's no place like it.
