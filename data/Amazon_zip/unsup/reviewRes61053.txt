Have been coming to Wishbone for brunch since I moved to the neighborhood a few years ago. Great food and quick service. Definitely recommend their southern specialties like the jambalaya omelet paired with home fries and the warm corn muffins. We almost always take our out of town guests here and they love it...my sister and brother in-law insisted that we go two days straight after their first visit. Family friendly with lots of strollers in the early morning (before 10).
