I really love this place! Food is absolutely delicious (get the huevos rancheros) and the service is great.  I was happy to see that there was a bit of wait for a table this morning because the first couple times I was here the place was fairly empty.  My only complaint would be that the coffee wasn't very strong today. I was so excited on my first visit because they brewed Metropolis coffee and it was STRONG- just like I like it. Today it was weak and not very good. I really hope this changes because I definitely pick my breakfast/brunch spots partially based on the coffee offered. Other than that, everything was perfect. I'm looking forward to stopping by to try their dinner menu one day soon.
