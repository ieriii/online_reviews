Went here last night for a bite to eat with an old friend. He recently moved to this area and we were looking for a good place to try. I am always trying to incorporate new restaurants into my social life because I am a little obsessed with telling the yelp-world all about it! The salsa was spicy and the chips were tasty. I did find myself needing to put the salsa on the rest of the food because it wasn't spicy enough. We had guacamole, I had fish tacos, and Rob had the steak tacos. We were both satisfied with the food, but agreed that there could have been more spicy zing to the flavor. The margaritas, on the other hand, were not lacking in any way.  Tasty, not too sugary, good sized, and STRONG. Just like we like 'em!! The service was a little rushed, we felt a little hurried to decide what we wanted to eat, but our waitress was very nice. The prices were good and there was a lot to choose from on the menu. I will have to go back and try my other favorite: fajitas! Definitely on my list for reliable places to go if I ever get the urge to return to a restaurant I have eaten at before! The urge to try more new places is just so strong!
