Absolutely fantastic hazelnut cupcakes, but a bit on the expensive side considering it takes about three bites to eat the whole thing. Macaroons were great also. However, the seating area next to the bakery feels like courthouse -- rather spare and utilitarian. Even though they have helpfully added stickers to the tables that say, "This is not a library, you can talk here," people still tend to give death stares to people who do talk.
