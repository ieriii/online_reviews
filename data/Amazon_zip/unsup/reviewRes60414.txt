This used to be my favorite Pizza stop in Chicago. Working in the city, I recommend this Giordano's to everyone. Until now.The pizza is still fantastic, our server was nice. Not much personality, but nice. Management is horrible and an embarrassment to any organization. A friend from England had offered to buy lunch and after dinner he presented a traveller's check to the server. All seemed fine. She returned asking for identification. He gave it to her and she returned later saying that they were unable to take the check. We asked for the manager and we asked him why he would not take it. He smeared the reverse of the check which showed it to be valid and his answer was "We can not take it because you are not from Illinois." That was the only reason he would not take it. We tried to verify with him that Giordano's is not tourist friendly. He walked away. If I had not offered another form of payment, I wonder what he would have done.This is the shoddiest customer service I have come across is Chicago. I will certainly not recommend this establishment to any of my future clients or anyone who reads this.Go to Lou's.
