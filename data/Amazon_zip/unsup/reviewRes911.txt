A true Chicago icon. I've been here a handful of times. Each experience has been roughly the same: Wait in line for an hour. Order cheesy fries and a hot dog or two. Pay in CASH only. Take a deep breath and pray that the weird sausages that you ordered will be delicious. Bite in! I would have to say that I've loved about half the specialty dogs that I've gotten and been nauseated by an equal number. The foie gras dog was great. Their regular hot dogs are great. I've had a bunch other that I adored. Then there were some of the game-y ones. I'm a midwesterner that has eaten her fair share of game. There are also only two items of food that I've ever eaten in my life that I really despise: my mother's ham and parsley casserole, and shitake mushrooms. (I say this to demonstrate that I am a good eater and usually can find a way to like everything that I shove in my mouth). However, I think it was a goat sausage that I had once here, with an incredibly stinky brie or similar cheese, and a hot-pink prickly pear jelly that just about made both me and my dining companion gag. It was terrifying! Stinky cheese, super sweet jam, extremely gamey goat... Not my cup of tea. This has happened a few other times; I try to be adventurous and end up regretting it. Which makes me a little less encouraged about spending an hour waiting in line to come here the next time.
