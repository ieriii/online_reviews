Wow, this pizza is thick! One piece is a meal in itself. The slices all look the same since they are covered in sauce or cheese, so you have to ask what they have ready. The pie is filled with heavenly goodness and isn't that expensive. Hoever, the place does lack atmosphere, it's more like a cafeteria than an Italian restaurant.
