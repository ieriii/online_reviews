The original Superdawg location cannot be beat. Wheeling is much closer to my house, and I'll drive right past to go to the original instead. While some feel like you have to take out a 2nd mortgage for a hot dog and fries, it is so worth it. My parents have been taking me here since I was a youngin for a Chicago style dog. I think I've worked my way through everything on the menu in my almost 28 years, and haven't been disappointed with anything! I can't wait for summertime, when it will be perfectly acceptable to roll in at 1am for a hot dog smothered in neon relish... Yeah, I know it's still perfectly acceptable in the winter, but so much nicer when its not 12 degrees outside!
