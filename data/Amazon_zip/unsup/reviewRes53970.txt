I work around the corner from this place and had to try it for lunch. I ordered the steak sandwich, and it was well worth the wait. I ordered in, and sat at their bar stools that line the wall at one end of the place. The seating is what it is. I'd only recommend it if its just you, or one other friend. I really see this place taking of as a great take-out place for the area, and hope their outdoor seating gets well used in the evenings for the dine in dinner crowd. Some umbrellas or a canopy and BYOB proudly displayed would get that ball rolling.
