Stayed here for business. Convenient location. I was on an upper floor. If you're very sensitive to sound, make sure you request a quiet room or don't be surprised by the frequent rumbling sounds of the Metra. The bed was much softer than I'd thought a Starwood hotel would be. Normal horde of Bliss products. The bathroom was huge.
