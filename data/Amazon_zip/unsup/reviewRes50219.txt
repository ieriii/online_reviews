$20 for brunch which consisted of orange juice and an omelette. Was it good? Sure it was. Was it amazing? No it wasn't.  I have to say - Big Jones just isn't for me. I will say that the decor and atmosphere here are great. It's a good room to be in. It's just expensive for what it is.  I want my southern food experience to be fun one. This is the kind of place where you would be embarrassed if you scratched your knife on your plate.
