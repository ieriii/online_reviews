UAU! (Portuguese for Wow that is) I think I had an entire cow, lamb & chicken touchdown on my plate by the end of the night. At $40-50 a person, you should! Their salad bar has a great selection including everything from freshly rolled sushi, palm of hearts, to a strawberry dressing. Be sure to grab an extra plate to dollop all the chimichurri sauce possible on. From there, flip your coin to call over the servers and the carnage marry-go-round has been activated. Eat your meats after spooning the herb sauce on to the meat: Let it sit for a few minutes (yes it is very difficult and painful to wait) and marinate the meat cuts to perfection. My table's favorite cuts were the leg of lamb, ribeye & garlic shrimp. My mouth is salivating thinking about it and I thought I wouldn't eat meat for 3 days. With a mojito, can't get any better than this.  Oh wait: The "gaucho" dressed servers are super sexy (and for the guys you'll find women who serve shots and look as if they just came out of Carnival). Personally, I want a pair of their boots. This place could not be better (other than bringing the price down--use coupons found online 2x1 weekday only) and is a vegan/vegetarian's worst nightmare----and a carnivores gastronomical delight!
