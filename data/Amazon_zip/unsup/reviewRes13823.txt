"Ooh, calamari for only five dollars? Score!" No. No no no. A thousand times no. Clearly I should have known better.  What was described on the menu board as "big pieces of calamari with a zesty tomato sauce" was in fact a handful of tiny, limp, rubbery grey rings the size of my pinky finger, hidden inside a giant cup of tomato sauce. Now, it didn't actually taste terrible, but this was nowhere near a quality calamari dish (trust me, I'm a connoisseur). It was like a game of Bobbing for Squid Rings or the deep-sea trawling industry in miniature--dip in the fork, feel around for anything more solid than a tomato chunk, pull up the fork, and hope to come up with something like a calamari ring. I think that I got around ten or twelve of them in thirty or forty dives. So stick with the sandwiches, which are still great, and for heaven's sake eschew the calamari and the empanadas. I am inclined to drop them to three stars for the awful veggie empanada and the calamari misadventure, AND because they were out of ice (yes, ice!) and could not make any shakes. But those two sandwiches (lechon and veggie) were damn good, and the service is still top-notch. So I'm officially registering this one as 3.5 stars.
