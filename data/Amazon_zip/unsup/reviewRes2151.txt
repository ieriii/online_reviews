Great hot dogs.. The duck fat fries were a bit of a let down. They were ok.. but not as spectactular as I expected.  However the Line.. OMG the line. 2.5 hours on a friday early afternoon. I think they have it setup where they will have a line. The eating area is small. and they don't wait on people until a table is free. I think they make a line on purpose. Just to keep the hype. The dogs are worth the wait. However... they could make it smaller by setting things up a bit better.
