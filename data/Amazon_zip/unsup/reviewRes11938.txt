My friends Linda and Scott told me I HAD to try the sauceless pizza with clam and fresh garlic. I'm not gonna lie, my initial thought was, "Ummm...weird." Luckily, we were there with a huge group of people, so I was able to just get a try of their odd pizza concoction while still having access to plenty of other kinds of pizza and nice tall beers. Note - by "plenty of other pizza", I actually meant "monstrous table-sized pizzas". Portion sizes here are nothing to worry about. There WILL be leftovers if you get a medium, much less a large. So when said monstrous table-sized pizzas showed up, I decided to be adventurous and try the weird clam pizza. Let me say, very publicly, that Linda and Scott are awesome and so is clam & garlic pizza is lovely - the clam is chopped up small so the texture isn't weird, and the flavor is lovely. I'm a convert. Kudos to my buds and to Piece for taking me there!
