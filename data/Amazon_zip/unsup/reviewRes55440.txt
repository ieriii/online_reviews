I had a feeling that we were in for a great night before we even entered.We found a great legal parking space on Southport right by TCF bank. We walked across the street & were greeted by very attentive staff.The inside was not what I expected, then I am not sure of what I expected from the Top Chef's place.The lamb with white beans, anchovies and sausages was sensational.The wait staff suggested a wonderful wine.But my favorite thing of the night was the corn dessert was it was unexpectedly delicious. We are defineately coming back
