I love love love Pequods! Great pan pizza in fact thats all I order from there. Trust me if you order an appetizer you may regret it because you won't have as much room for the awesome pizza. Although reheated Pequods leftovers are always great. I go to both locations and I must say that the Morton Grove location is much less crowded and has a more rustic than urban feel to it. I am currently a vegetarian, but when I did eat meat my favorite topping was pepperoni. I also recommend the blend of onion, mushroom, and black olive soooo good. Overall yummy filling and comforting food.
