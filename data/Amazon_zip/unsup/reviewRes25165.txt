Knew nothing about this place coming in, other than the concierge at the Hilton recommended it. I have found my hang-out for the week! Apparently they serve all three meals - but am planning on popping in for snacks and wine when I need a break from my workshop this week. Tonight I had the olives to start - good, nothing too unusual, but great with the first glass of the white wine flight. Main dish was halibut topped with truffle dust, served over smashed fava beans and chorizo cubes. The halibut was a little overcooked but the flavor helped it along. But my favorite dish was the sliced cauliflower with cream and marcona almonds, again topped with truffles. OMG. Service is friendly, the music is flamenco fun, looks like a nightclub and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Can't wait to go back and try more!
