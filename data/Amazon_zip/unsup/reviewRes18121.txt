XOCO defies everything you ever thought about stand-up/lunch food Mexican eating. The third and most achievable installment of the Rick Bayless saga, this place serves some pretty legitimate tortas, guac, and limeade. Everything is well thought out and perfectly cooked every time you eat there. I've been there half a dozen times now, and the quality and service has been consistent. I literally crave the milanesa and pepito. The cheese on that milanesa is amazing, so is the salsa it comes with. This place can get to be a madhouse, but somehow, everything sort of keeps moving along like a little factory. There's one employee that sorta just walks around and keeps everything in check. They tell you when you can sit down, bring you your food, etc. It all works really pretty well considering the demand and the size of the restaurant. That's not to say you're not going to wait, but at least you're not waiting to eat a cold sandwich and not get a seat. It's all timed out, and the food is nice and warm when you get it. I really enjoy XOCO because it's another gourmet $10 and under place. The city needs more of those because the demand is there (Hot Doug's, Kuma's, Smoque, Goddess & Grocer, etc). It's cool that Rick Bayless invents his own rules for what Mexican street food is, and that he actually studied food in Mexico for like 7 years. That's just awesome. I'll be back again soon for a milanesa and some chips/guac on the side.
