Not too sure what's gone on here since the last time I went, but the level of service has severely dropped. The last time I was here, the waiter was giving us suggestions even though we've dined here a couple of times. Our waiter on this occasion asked us if we had dined here before, and then just left us after we said we had. He was no where to be seen for the next 25 minutes. Didn't even ask if we needed another drink while we looked at the menu (we had a drink from the bar). At the end of it all, we didn't even wind up ordering any food. Judging by how long it took for us to even see our waiter again after seating us, we figured we'd be late to get back to work. I found out the waiter we had the first couple of times coming to the Purple Pig had left. Maybe the new wave of staff they have aren't as invested as the original staff since Purple Pig has become such a hit. I'll have to go back again when I'm not in much of a rush.
