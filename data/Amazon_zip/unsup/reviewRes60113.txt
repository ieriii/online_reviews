This Sunday was my fourth time having brunch at big jones and all four times the food has been fantastic. Service has always been great too except for this time around. Our waiter, a very young great looking blonde was neither friendly nor attentive. Not only with us but with the the folks sitting next to us. He just seemed to be so bothered by everyone and made us feel like we were asking him to climb Everest every time we needed something. The worst was we asked for more coffee for the third time and he made a very loud sounding "UHGH!" We will returh but will NOT be sitting in his section.
