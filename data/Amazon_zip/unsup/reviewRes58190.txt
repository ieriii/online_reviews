But he has nothing on!The Emperor has no clothes, folks. My crap review is going to do nothing to dilute the totals for Mr. Doug Sohn. He is clearly a true mensch, and deserves the Encased Meats Medal of Honor if there were one. He works his butt off and for that I respect him. But there are a few things worth noting:Love for HD is 50% tourists. He's listed in all the guides so tourists make the pilgrimage. This means dauntingly long lines. Hours plus. Just to get a freaking hot dog. Any other decent business owner would just hire more people. Increase capacity. We're not talking about product that cannot be made in higher numbers, or more quickly, by moving to a lager location or hiring additional staff. These sausages are NOT made by Doug or his staff. They are merely grilled or boiled by him. This is really not complicated restaurant work. The lines are the product of a SADISTIC and EGOMANIACAL restauranteur. Anyone else would just increase hours, have someone else man the front desk. Doug just needs to be the center of attention. He doesn't care if people stand in line for an hour ... it's all about HIM. There are at least 4 other places in Chicago making hot dogs and related encased meats that are just as good if not better than HD. If you want to stand in line for an hour for bragging rights or god knows what, that's fine with me. But don't pretend it's (a) for a unique experience or (b) for any reason other than to be a tourist in your own city. Making people stand in line for an hour for food that takes mere minutes to make is just wrong. And it really isn't all that good. Oh, but the tourists think so ... As Chicagoans we need to stick up for our city more. If I visited another city, waited in line an hour for a mediocre food experience, I'd look down at that city. This doesn't happen in NYC. Or LA, or Mexico City, Rome, Paris, etc. So overrated, so arrogant, so annoying.
