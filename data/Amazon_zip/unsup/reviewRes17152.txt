India House Is divine! Their buffet is the freshest & tastiest I've ever had (and Indian food is my fav so I've had ALOT) There is a good variety & it's very veg friendly as well. Nice, clean atmosphere, service is always great & very friendly. I have to go to India house once a week or I go into withdrawal, it's just that good- everyone I have brought there has gotten hooked as well!
