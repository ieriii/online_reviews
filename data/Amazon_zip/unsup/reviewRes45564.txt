A great spot for food or drinks! I was pleased to discover Wilde upon my return to the area. After hearing that they had excellent Mac-n-Cheese (one of my all-time loves), I had to check it out for myself. Upon arriving, I immediately fell in love the with decor and the general feeling in the place. While a bit busy and occasionally loud, it felt...familiar. It was a nice mix of people as well as dining vs. drinking. I definitely didn't feel like I was ordering from the kitchen at some bar! The Mac-n-Cheese was definitely some of the best I've ever had. I get it pretty much every time I go there in some fashion, whether sharing it with someone or hogging it all for myself! If you're a beer fan, Wilde has a good selection. It's not one of these exhaustive lists, but a great mix of local, national and international beers that sure to please your palate. I may have a new favorite spot :)
