We used the word, "Wow," quite often last night during dinner at Mia Francesca - as in, "Wow, this wine is awesome!" and "Wow this prociutto is fantastic!" and "Oh my God, this linguine is so good. I could just eat the noodles alone!" This place has some of the best tasting pasta I've had in Chicago. I've always been a big fan of Sappori Trattoria, which is great in its own right, but I have to give the edge to Mia Francesca on just how fresh everything tasted from the mozzarella to the tomatoes in the linguine! We also had a GREAT red wine there - Ajello. It's about $45 for the bottle meaning it's probably about $20 or so if you were to find it at Binny's. It was an excellent wine with the Linguine dishes and the Rigatoni dishes we had! The only knock is that our server took their time to first get to our table to greet us and offer an appetizer and/or drink, but after then the service was friendly and efficient. If you're looking for great food at a good price and good atmosphere without being too stuffy and pretentious, this is a GREAT place to eat!
