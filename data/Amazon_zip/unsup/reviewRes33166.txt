I can see why people wait to eat brunch at Yolk. They serve solid food in large portions that will more than satisfy your hunger... but it only does that. I had known about Yolk for years. It looked cute from the outside and I knew it was a popular brunch spot, but in all of my trips to Chicago and my time living there, I never got a chance to go until my last visit in September. They offer a wide variety of omelettes, pancakes, waffles, etc. Whatever you want for brunch, Yolk most likely has it. I decided on the bacon waffle. It was good, but I was hoping for more bacon in it. A LOT more. The bits of bacon are so small and scattered that I could barely taste it. It just tasted like a regular waffle with a very faint taste of pork fat. You'd probably be better off getting a regular waffle, a side of bacon, and just shoving both in your mouth at the same time. My friends got omelettes, which were huge, packed with ingredients, and flavorful. If I were to return to Yolk, I'd probably get one of those. But for now, I think I shall stick to M. Henry and its amazing fried egg sandwich and its truly out of this world bread pudding for my future Chicago brunches!
