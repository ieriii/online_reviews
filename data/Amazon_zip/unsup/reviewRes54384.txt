This pizza is absolutely the best deep dish in Chicago. The carmelized crust is the bomb. Sometimes it is sausage, onion and mushroom, other times it is canadian bacon and pineapple. Everytime, it is mouth watering delicious. Delivery can take a long time, so if you are able to pick it up yourself, you can get your slice of heaven much quicker, but if not, it is well worth the wait.
