Was in town and my cousin insisted we go to Giordanos if we wanted real Chicago pizza. I'm so glad we went. We were starving when we got there after walking several country miles around town. We ordered the combination appetizer - mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini sticks and fried mushrooms - you can see the theme here breaded and deep-fried, all good, served with marinara sauce and ranch. Mushrooms and mozzarella sticks were my favorite the zucchini was a bit mushy, but still ok. We decided to "the special" deep-dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onion and green pepper. We added spinach on one half and pepperoni on the other half. With a pizza this thick it took 40 minutes to bake but the results are divine and our waitress warned us ahead of time. The cheese is ooey-gooey, stringy delicious. The toppings are plentiful and the sauce is great! The crust was cripsy, which was surprising given all the cheese and toppings. Only downside was the service, our waitress admitted that she forgot about us, not once but twice. So our glasses were often empty. At one point she just left the water pitcher on the table, however that didn't get my cousin his beer refills.
