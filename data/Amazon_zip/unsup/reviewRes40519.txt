If you wanna spend $10+ on sub-par pho, go for it. The broth lacks meaty flavor, richness, and depth. Their "big" bowls of pho is an illusion because most of that bowl is filled with the not-so-good broth and lacking in noodles and meat. This place isn't absolutely terrible, but if you want actual deliciously authentic pho (that's also much cheaper) walk further down Argyle to find many better alternatives.
