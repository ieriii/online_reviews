Graham Elliott is a terrific restaurant with playful yet innovative food and a terrific dining room. I have been to the restaurant several times and always find that I am excited by some of the new taste sensations/combinations that I am presented with. I took a customer there for dinner last night - he was in from out of town and is a complete foodie. As soon as we sat down I asked for a couple glasses of ice wine and foie gras lollipops (not on the menu, but make sure you ask!). He was so excited when they arrived (he didn't believe me when I told him they were coated in pop rocks) that he took out his iPhone and posted a picture of Facebook! I had beet salad w/horseradish foam and picked pear - lovely light combination of bitter, sweet, and sour. My guest had gingerbread sweetbreads - sounds odd but is truly delicious - light, sweet, and very intriguing. Deconstructed beef stroganoff - wonderful rare beef with rich mushroom spread and yummy, just slightly crispy spaetzle - perfect for a 10 degree evening. The wait staff is pleasant and well informed. Always with good wine recommendations, terrific knowledge of an admittedly challenging menu, and classy but not stuffy service. The room is lively but not obnoxiously loud - this is a restaurant for grown-ups, not the post collegiate set. It's a fun restaurant with a unique menu of innovative comfort food (and beyond) that always keeps me excited with the new possibilities. I will come back here again and again.
