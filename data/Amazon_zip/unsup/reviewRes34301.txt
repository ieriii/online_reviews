Has excellent dishes and we love the food but HATE the slow service. Even with a reservation we waited 10 minutes to get a table. We waited so long for the waiter to come to our table that we had to ask someone to get him so he can take our order. Finally to top it all off, for dessert we ordered creme brulee that tasted like Jalapeno peppers...I think the strawberries on the creme brulee were cut with a knife used for jalapenos :)) We told the waiter but got no apologies!!!
