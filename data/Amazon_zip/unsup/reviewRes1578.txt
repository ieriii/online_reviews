Man oh man! Talk about duck on duck on duck action! The Foie Gras and Sauternes duck sausage hot dog was totally worth the hour and a half wait. The duck fat fries were okay...I was expecting something more flavorful but was left a little underwhelmed. Service was friendly and not rushed. People move out pretty quickly considering the capacity of the joint. Definitely something to have on your Chicago to-do list!
