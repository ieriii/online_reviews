Easily one of the most unique experiences in Chicago. It's important to use the term experience over meal, because my time at Sprout proved to be so much more. It was a night of surprise and discovery, but most importantly, reminded me how dinner can be more than a meal, but a shared experience. Waiting between courses, I found the ambiance to be soothing, yet invigorating as the table speculated of what was to come--first time I've heard 'Let Go' since Garden State. This excitement was something I had not felt, or shared with others at a restaurant for a long time. I'm accustomed to the excitement of waiting for a favorite dish, but I can't remember the last time I've seen something completely original, and without warning. After forking my hand once, I realized just how difficult it was to focus on my plate, because I wanted to know so badly what was being consumed across from me. Everyone was staring at everyone else's plates, in great anticipation of a rotation. The octopus, a result of one of the most original processes I've heard--and I fear to recite due to a crude butchering--was immediately reordered after devouring. I wanted to do the same with the foie gras, and really, everything else. Seeing the quail accompanied with a foie gras hollandaise--mind blowing. Plan on going often, as the menu changes seasonally. It's a great gateway restaurant to turn regular folk into foodie fanatics, or to please your most hardcore friends.
