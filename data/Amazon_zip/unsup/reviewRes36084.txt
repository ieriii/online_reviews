OMG! This place is situated in the heart of Greektown and it's always packed with people and flavor. I saw them recently on Check Please and new that this would be the perfect place for me and my friend Tina D. When we got there it was a 1/2 hour wait, so we walked to the corner to a bar/restaurant and enjoyed a glass of Bloody Mary. Getting back to Meli's, everything is so delicious and so fresh. From the lattes we started out with, to the fresh carrot and ginger juice (YUM). Then we ordered the no meat farmstand skillet. OMG! If you enjoy your veggies as much as I do, this is the dish. It was delicious. Let's not forget our amazing server she knew the menu inside and out and she gave us great recommendations. Meli's is opened only for lunch and dinner. It's worth the drive and wait. So please come and visit them, they will not disappoint.
