One of my favorite restaurants anywhere. The meat is incredibly well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. The sides brought to your table are delicious and difficult to stop eating, especially the sauteed bananas. There is a salad bar I'm told but I haven't been able to tear myself away from my bacon-wrapped filets long enough to check it out. The service is excellent and extremely attentive. The beer selection is nothing special but they do have one Brazilian beer (maybe called Xingu?) that I'd recommend checking out.
