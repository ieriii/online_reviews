Yolk was another restaurant that I had wanted to try for a long time. Unfortunately, it was a major letdown during a recent Sunday brunch. It receives one star primarily because of health safety concerns. As a pescatarian, I don't eat bacon. Why did pieces of bacon (undercooked fat and cooked portions) appear in my plain BELGIAN WAFFLE (substituted in the TWO EGG $5.99 combo for about $3 extra)? This problem did not happen just once. It happened a second time when I requested a redo of my entire order. The other problem with the initial order was that the RED DICED POTATOES were burnt. They were just less burnt on the second attempt. I looked at the plate of a lone diner seated next to us, and her potatoes looked burnt as well. If a restaurant can't make the time to clean waffle irons properly, then they should dedicate irons solely to specific types of waffles to help prevent cross contamination. The waiter was understanding, yet it was a challenge to flag him down in the huge and very loud dining room. He offered to supply me with a couple of pancakes. I should have refused. A serious case of the "lead in stomach" effect happened soon after. Those were the heaviest pancakes that I had eaten in a long time. I felt a bit queasy in the bathroom, along with a burgeoning headache, after eating half. Also, my friend felt queasy after eating her pancakes, then noticed that one of her bacon pieces looked severely overcooked. It looked like a black, corroded strip of meat. It was replaced, but by then we were more than ready to give up on the experience. We were comped the waffle on the bill and the eggs were cooked correctly, but we have no intention of ever returning. I like to eat more than eggs for brunch.
