We had a few family members in Chicago for the weekend, so we booked a room at the River Hotel because of the location. It's close to Wacker Drive and the room was contemporary albeit on the small side. Went out to meet a few people for dinner and we came back finding out that the AC was not working. We alerted the staff at the lobby and realized that the maintenance guy had left for the day. How can the hotel not have a maintenance person 24 hours a day? Needless to say, we were shocked to hear about it. We did not pay more than $150 and get a room that is as warm as an oven. When the staff learnt about our story, they unempathetically asked us to open the windows instead!!! Mind you, that does not make any sense considering the weather outside was about 90 F. They then offered to move us to another location away from the river but we refused because we chose the location for a reason and it is an unnecessary inconvenience to us at our expense. It was not our fault to begin with. After that they offered us a crappy fan which finally worked when we gave it a few knocks. It was a warm and miserable night for our family who came all the way to Chicago expecting something wonderful from this hotel. The next morning, we mentioned about it at the front desk again and all they could do was apologized. Not a single time did they compensate us in a form of a lower rate for putting us through this. After all, we did not sign up for a room which has AC problems. After much complains, the staff finally offer us a free upgrade if we come back the next time. That is not acceptable. What is the use of a free upgrade if the AC is not going to work?? Well, we won't be coming back anyways. He can keep his offer. You shouldn't come here either.
