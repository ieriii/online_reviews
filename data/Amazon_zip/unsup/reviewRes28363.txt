I'm not sure if this was the worst deep-dish pizza I've ever had or the worst pizza I've ever had. I'm leaning towards the latter. The crust tastes like burnt cardboard, the sauce tastes like trash water, and the pizza falls apart in your hands. Honestly, I don't think I have the words to explain how bad the crust is. I will dedicate the rest of my life to telling everyone not to eat here.
