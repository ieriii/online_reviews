Okay, so yeah, Wakamono is one of those trendy, pretentious-looking joints where the decor is sleek, the music is hip, and the waitstaff are cute (but perhaps lacking in actual waiting skills). But as far as aesthetics go, they really have fashioned this place into a beautifully adorned sushi lounge. Now there is a side bar area that takes you back to those opium-filled dens in Saigon, only there was a disappointingly absent amount of opium in said bar. As for the food, this is really some good sushi. I don't know what the nay-sayers are harping on. I mean, the fish here is of very high quality. You really can't run a sushi restaurant on this main drag of Broadway and be shelling out tainted flounder-- too many people would know in a short period of time that the best sushi place in Boystown sells rotten goods. I'm sure some rolls are better than others, but so far the Emerald Roll is my fave. I think it was salmon, avocado, tempura crunchy goodness, and wasabi mayo on top. Not exactly healthy, but thank God they've learned to adapt to Americans' desires for rich, hyper-caloric food everywhere we go. One appetizer dish that you will probably glaze over on the menu, but is fantastic, is the shitake mushroom, gluten, and tree fungus plate. I know, doesn't that sound appetizing? Well, it may sound like they're selling a pile of crap, and when it comes out, it does kind of resemble a mound of dog doo, but trust me, this is some tasty fung. Anyone who loves mushrooms will have to love this. Last time we ordered a second plate it was so good. So in conclusion, leave your snobbish east and west coast perceptions of what is cool and good at the door. This place isn't trying too hard, it's just trying to not be like every other sushi bar that resembles the interior of a 19th century Japanese bath house. The food is divine, and I think we can all deal with a $5 corkage fee, no?
