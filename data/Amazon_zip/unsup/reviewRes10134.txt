I had a great Restaurant week experience here with my partner in culinary crime Robyn T. I have loved every restaurant that has been in this space so was looking forward to trying Piccolo Songo for the first time. First of all - I LOOOVVEE what they've done with he place. The new decor/feel is really warm and plush and great for dining- not at all what i expected really. I was amazed by the transformation. Our service was absolutely impeccable- I am terrible at remembering names, but our young female server was great...she had amazing pronunciation and a real sense of tempered enthusiasm for the food..she also was the epitome of non intrusive service- something which I yap about on this very site all the time. The food was just wonderful- We both enjoyed the Boar Sausage for our first course and I had a wonderful pasta dish for my 2nd- Dessert was gelato for me, but I should have got the panna cotta- because it was unlike any panna cotta i've ever had-- Robyn was nice enough to let me have a few bites of it and I have to say I wouldnt have been so nice- it was amazing. The wine list was reasonable- no complaints here and I enjoyed my Syrah. I'll save the 5th star for when I can go back for a non restaurant week meal, but this is definitely on my list.
