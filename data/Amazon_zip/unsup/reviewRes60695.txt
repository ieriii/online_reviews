Grand Lux is AMAZINGI've never been there for an actual meal, because it is somewhat pricey, but their desserts are fabulous. big portions make up for the big prices, and most of the desserts can be easily shared between two people, they are very heavy and rich. The decor of this place is beautiful, very classy. You can watch the chefs at work if you like, and that in itself is pretty nice. All in all it is a beautiful classy roomy place, yet it is somewhat comfortable too. They don't have a dress code so you can go in dressed up, or in jeans and a t-shirt (as several of my friends were when we went) If you go, make sure to request the round room, it looks right out over Michigan Avenue, very pretty and romantic. As far a recomendations, I got the apple crisp, which was fantastic, served warm with ice cream. Also I tried my friend's molten chocolate cake. Also fantastic, especially if you are a chocolate loverAll in all the place is great, a tad pricey, but you get what you pay for. : - )
