Yes there's a good chance that there would be a 20-40 min wait for a table. Great for for you, your in one of the best spots to grab breakfast or brunch. I try to get here at least a couple of times during the spring/summer time every year. Of course it has that hip trendy Wicker Park feel, but I'm here for the awesome food. I've got friends that are die-hard regulars, that live in the area. Throughout the years I've tried the Breakfast Burrito which is huge and tasty. The Chocolate Tower French Toast which is knock your socks off Chocolate heaven. My all time favorite is the Red Velvet Pancakes which are hands down one of the best Pancakes in the city. They serve them as a single(Keep in mind). They do a great job hiring there servers because they're always super friendly, cool, laid back staff. If you go you must try the Blackberry mimosa's they are amazing. If your tired of your regular old Saturday/Sunday breakfast spot come try The Bongo Room, it's super bomb in my book.  Check there website before you go they change the menu all the time.
