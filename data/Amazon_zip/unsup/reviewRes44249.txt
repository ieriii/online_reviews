I have a feeling I'm going to get really fat by going here. The hazelnut & vegan peanut butter cupcakes were really good as was the coffee! I cannot wait to try more of the goodies in here! My favorite part was the vibe...it reminded me of all the amazing patisseries in Brooklyn that I always wish Chicago had more of.
