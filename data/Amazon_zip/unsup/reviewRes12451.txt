Great thin crust pizza! Went here for a birthday party yesterday. The party was in a pit in the front of the restaurant that could fit about 25 people comfortably. It's great because it's your own space yet you still feel part of the restaurant. I don't think there was an additional charge for using that area for a party either. Score! They have a bunch of different beers that they brew on site. And the pizza is super tasty. I tried 4 different pizzas and they were all amazing! Piece out!
