Yum Yum Yum! I have officially tried all 3 (Topo, Xoco, and now Frontera Grill) and I would vote this the best of the 3 though Xoco is close after. Food and drinks are delicious, but I can't give it a 5 because of how long you have to wait and the fact that it is a bit overpriced. I felt a little ridiculous waiting in line at 4:50 to get in at 5:00, but we figured we have to try it sometime! We were about 20th in line and we were told we could sit at 5:50. I wasn't super excited about that, but we were able to hang out by the bar and drink some delicious margaritas so it ended up being OK. The food is very good. We got the Queso Fundido clasico which was excellent. I ordered the carnitas atun which was excellent as well. It came with this really good coleslaw and black beans. I would DEFINITELY get that again, and there were a number of items on the menu that had me drooling, so I will have to venture back. Do note that they said they DO now take reservations, however they book out months in advance. I think we will go that route when we go next.
