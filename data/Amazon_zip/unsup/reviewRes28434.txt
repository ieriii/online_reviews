This place is awesome and cheap. It might even be better than Girodano's....there I said it. It doesn't get much better then this place. Believe me...I know my pizza. Parking isn't too bad if you go on a weeknight. I've never been on the weekend so not sure about the parking then. The staff was pretty nice too. They let us order our pizza and while we waited go to the bar next door and drink. My kind of place.
