DELICIOUS burgers! That's not the only reason for 4 stars though.  1 - Love the atmosphere. Casual/cozy sort of place in the middle of Lincoln Park; it was crowded but not annoyingly so. We waited about 20 minutes on a Saturday night at 7pm. 2 - Friendly staff. Bartender said he could make a French martini and then (even though he said he was out of cognac which I think was his way of saying chambord...) had to make a cosmo; and didn't charge us for a drink because he felt bad. Host/wait staff prompt and not overbearing. 3 - Menu is great. I had a cheezeburger with bbq sauce, fried onions, etc, and some soup to start. Salad bar is fantastic for those of us who don't feel the need to consume a ginormous 1500-calorie meal in a matter of moments (that wasn't me), and also includes something called chocolate chip frosting which was unexpected! 4 - I don't know, the music was really fun. I think they played that one song that I like a lot and I seem to recall dancing a bit as I devoured my burger. Great place!
