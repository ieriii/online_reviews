It's a Travelodge, so I didn't really expect anything better than what I got. The price was reasonable, and the location is hard to beat. It's a quick walk to the Metra and El stations, and it is across the street from Grant Park. There is also free wireless internet, and two restaurants attached. The biggest issue I had was with the hotel staff. They were very rude when me and my friends needed separate receipts, and would sit on the phone talking to friends instead of helping people who were waiting. The room itself was ok- not too bad, but nothing special. The temperature was very hard to keep comfortable, and there was a big gap between the floor and the bottom of the door.
