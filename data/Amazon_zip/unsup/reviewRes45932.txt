HUGE AMOUNTS OF FOOD!! but do you really need this much food? I think the portions are enough for you to eat, be full, take a nap from the food coma, and have the 2nd half as another meal. The servers even warn you about this when you go the first time and wonder if there is going to be enough food coming out. This place can get really crowded but due to the sheer size the wait is not forever. Their food is similar to the cheesecake factory and so is the look. Apparently CF owns them...hrm. Generic thick fries, huge burgers, salads that are probably not healthy, desserts that you can split among 3 people, etc. The place is nicely decorated for the size and has a great location (would bring little kids, family members, tourists) but nothing stands out. The service can go from horrible to super fast.
