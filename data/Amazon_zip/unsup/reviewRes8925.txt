If you are looking for the BEST pizza in Chicago, look no further. Spacca Napoli is amazing! I am a pizza lover and ex New Yorker who has been searching for something along the lines of Di Faras, Grimaldis, Joes, Johns, Patsys, Lombardis, etc in Chicago and the only pizza hat I have found that not only meets, but exceeds all of those is Sapacca Napoli. IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE 6 STARS I WOULD!! Everything about this place is PERFECT.  - The service is outstanding (I got there before it opened today and waited on the street benches until it opened and someone came out to bring me water while I waited before the place was even open). Then once we sat down the waitstaff couldn't have been more helpful and personable. After finishing our meal, we were sitting and just digesting and relaxing and instead of how most restaurants want to rush you out, the owner came out with two glasses of moscato for us to enjoy while we were sitting! - The food is unbelievable (the crust is uber thin yet deliciously doughy at the same time). In terms of what to order, the pizzas with red sauce are really good, but the ones without sauce are not to be missed. Definitely order one with prosciutto and arugula, and the one with sausage and rabini (but we subbed arugula for the rabini) because they are both fantastic. I can't say enough good things about this place. I plan to make this a weekly (if not more) visit. GO HERE - it's worth it!
