We originally scoped out Zed451 as a potential wedding venue, but with our numbers and the way that the rooms are laid out, we opted not to. So instead, we held our 40-person rehearsal dinner here! The food is DELICIOUS. Our guests couldn't stop raving about the food (especially the Asian-style glazed pork belly), and everyone said it was a fantastic choice. Plenty of options for carnivores and herbivores alike, too! The hybrid of serve-yourself-salad-bar + be-served-skewers-of-meat was perfect for the first meeting of our families and closest friends -- you could mingle and chat over the salad bar, but there was still the elegance and formality of being served. We had a private (Clark) room to ourselves, and it fit 40 perfectly, with extra space for mingling. The staff was very attentive -- at times, it felt like the parade of meat skewers would never end! YUM. Also, the cheesy biscuits are SO GOOD. Finally, Zed451 gave us complimentary use of their two 14-pax shuttles, so we were able to get people to our next venue for drinks and the older folks back to their hotels!
