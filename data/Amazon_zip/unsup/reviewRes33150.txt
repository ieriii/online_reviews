LOVE this place!! Truly some of the best falafel in the city. They stuff the pita with such wonderful toppings I find myself not being able to eat it fast enough! So satisying!! I have always wanted to try so many other things that look just delicious but I cannot get past the falafel! And... it's Cheap!!
