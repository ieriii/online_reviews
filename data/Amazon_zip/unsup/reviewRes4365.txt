Great jazz, and a great club. If you haven't been to the Green Mill, you probably need to get there soon. I usually enjoy Alan Gresik's Swing Shift Orchestra on Thursday nights. You won't find a more eclectic collection of interesting jazz arrangements from the 1920s-1930s anywhere on the planet. A tip: get there before 8:15pm if you want a table. The band hits at 9pm sharp! Have a martini or two, and tip your waitresses...chances are, they're roller derby girls.
