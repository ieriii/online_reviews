I brought my friend, a die-hard Bongo Room fan, here for brunch after a photo shoot last month. Armed with so many great reviews, I promised him the risk of trying something new would be well worth it. I guess we should have stuck with what we knew. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special. I admit I only had scrambled eggs, but that's my test for a breakfast place. If the eggs are awesome I'll try other stuff. I can't remember what my friend got, but I do remember that his response to "how is it?" was "meh." So, sorry Yolk, you're not for me. From the looks of your other reviews I don't think you have to worry about going out of business, though.
