Agree this place is a good spot for late nite tacos...3am order carne asada tacos and they were enough for keep me going :) ,the only thing that would make it better will be if it has more seating space..the service is excellent and helpfull, would recomment to catch a bite while been drinking on a latenight...or just relax.
