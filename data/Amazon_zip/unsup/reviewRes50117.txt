I have been here a lot since my first post so I wanted to update. I was there earlier and when I walked in, I asked if there was a TV with the Michigan game on. The hostess so no problem she'd find one or turn one. She took my friend and I upstairs where we sat at a table that had a huge table right above it. Great view for the game, and very nice of them to have so many different games going on for people. In my several visits I have tasted and drank several different things. ALL GOOD!! My favorite food here is steak nachos. They are so delicious. My second favorite is actually two things that are tied, the cookie with ice cream and the breakfast lasagna. Their food is just so good and always cooked to perfection. The staff is so nice. I have had several different waitresses and waiters and everyone is very friendly and helpful. My friend and I also met one of the owners one time at brunch and he was very nice. This place is very chill and down to earth. One of my favorite things is the DJ on Friday/Saturday night. They have great music. I love going for drinks in a pretty chill atmosphere with really good music. Lastly AWESOME drinks. Margaritas, Wild Berry Shandy, Mimosas....seriously all good!!
