Mia Francesca is one of my favorite Italian spots in the city. While the menu always changes some, there are always some staples that always make an appearance. My personal favorite is the Pollo Romana, and the Pollo Limone if its on the menu.  This place is usually packed and can sometimes require you to use a louder voice in conversation. However, the service is always on point.  I also recommend dessert here as its always a good ending to a fine dinner.  The prices aren't too hateful, and the wine list isn't too bad. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for good Italian in the city.
