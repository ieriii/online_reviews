I loved this place. My boyfriend and I went on a random Monday night, and it was surprisingly hoppin' for the worst night of the week. I ordered the Ropa Vieja, which is a food I am obsessed with, and it didn't disappoint. It was served with delicious fried plantains. My boyfriend got this amazing, rich chicken dish in a cream sauce, and a salad, and a mango margarita, and they were all great. The service was prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere was relazed and cozy, yet fun and a little more upscale than your average neighborhood joint. Great place to take a date, have a girls' night, or take your parents if they come to visit. Highly recommended. Only drawback: it's sort of randomly located - not really near anything notable, but if that's not an issue for you, you'll love it.
