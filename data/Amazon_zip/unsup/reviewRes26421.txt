I never know if I should say "Pa-quod's" or "Pee-quod's" so if you know, send a message my way! Thank you kindly. I have this bad habit of slurring the words quickly so people don't know how I actually pronounce it. I had high expectations for this place heading in. Having visited Burt's Place in Morton Grove, I was expecting something similar considering the story between the two. I did get something similar but in appearance only. The burnt crust was still there which was amazing but the rest of the pizza was missing something. For deep dish pizza, Pequod's definitely satisfied my craving but it doesn't even compare to what Lou Malnati's serves up. It's worth a visit if you've had it on your list.
