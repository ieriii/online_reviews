Really? This isn't 5 stars across the board? Whoever didn't give it 5 stars is plainly picking at a nit, or simply doesn't get it. Or doing the "hey, check me out! I know more than Michelin and everyone else!" Seriously ... if you're coming to Yelp to convince yourself to go, don't go. You will be disappointed. I take it back. There might be a question, and that is: is it worth the $$$$? I won't bury the lede ... yes! It ain't cheap, but if you want a meal that you will flat-out be talking about years from now, this is the place. Was every single bite and meal the greatest thing I ever had? No. But I remember each and every single bite like it was yesterday. So does my wife. I look at our menu with fond recollections. Seriously, save $15/week for a year (skip pizza night every other week, really), and the have a night that you will remember. And isn't that the best thing about food, the memories? Anything that sticks with you after the moment is a win.
