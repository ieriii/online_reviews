I can't say enough about this place, I have NEVER had a bad meal there...the menu is very broad with many dishes I haven't seen at other Mexican Restaurants, the prices are just great and the place has an awesome neighborhood feel to it, like what going to a restarant used to be like (Nuevo Leon has been around since like 1962, so that would explain it I guess). I'm lucky I don't live near it, or I wouldn't even be able to fit through the doors anymore as I would surely dine there A LOT. Go to Nuevo Leon if you're in, going to or need an excuse to go to Pilsen.....Lastly, free parking is available in their lot, which is just east of the restaurant on the next North/South Street....
