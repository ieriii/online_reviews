To avoid crowds and be greeted with a look of consternation, come here at 5pm for dinner BEFORE a Cubs game. Yeah, I know they are just opening and not real glad to see you. But after that initial chill, the staff found their bearings and then everything really picked up. Start with the appetizer combo platter and a round of competent Mojitos. As others have noted - they do a good version of the traditional Ropa Viejos (braised shredded beef with tomatoes and peppers) but to me there is something ordinary about that dish. I reluctantly ordered the almond crusted halibut - which I absolutely loved!  We'll probably wait until next spring to go back - when the Cubs are playing again and Halibut is back in season (it may still be for another couple of weeks...)
