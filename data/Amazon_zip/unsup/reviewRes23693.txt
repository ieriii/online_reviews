We kinda barged in at 930 pm last night and were hesitantly sent to a booth cuz they close at 10pm. I felt bad, but was too hungry to try to find other food accommodations. To give myself credit I finished by 955 no joke, scarfed my soup+crepe+apricot iced tea down in 25 minutes. Well less, cuz it was served up around 945 so 10 minutes really  the highlights:  A.) Tasty crepe ROMA (capers, portebello mushroom, tomatoes, basil and cheesy goodness) served with pineapple slice/watermelon-nice touch B.) free soup for the poor!--vegetable puree C.) hot sauce D.) Very good prices $8.50 a crepe--really reasonable Highly recommended
