This place was okay.... but I have to say for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, they don't really have competent servers who know the dishes. My friend and I came here because we were craving authentic Vietnamese dishes. She ordered the BunBo and asked for two different meats to be put into the dish instead of just one. The servers brought out two bowls one meat in each! In true Vietnamese restaurants, you're usually able to substitute or add what you need and they'll usually know how to accommodate. This place did not. My dish was the pork with egg and rice. it was very salty for my taste. All I could taste was the fish sauce... very unappetizing. Although the Grampa of the restaurant was a cute old man who kept thanking me and telling me to come back, I don't know if I will. This restaurant is more trendy than authentic.
