We dined at Graham Elliot on Friday, March 26. The food was amazing. The chef must be a genius. The food flavors, textures and presentations were superb. The carrot cake dessert was one of the best desserts I've eaten at any restaurant. My only complaint was the portion size of all menu items. Definitely try this restaurant. LBO
