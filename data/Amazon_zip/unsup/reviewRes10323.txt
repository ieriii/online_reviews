I really, really, really wanted to love Piece. I went here for dinner with friends on a Friday night at 7:30, which I guess was my first mistake. The wait was a whopping 1 hour and 40 minutes and the bar so packed I thought I was at Mad River's dance floor at 2 am. We left for a drink, came back, and unfortunately were seated at what I'm guessing is the worst table- next to the hostess stand with people constantly banging into our chairs. Next to us, patrons who didn't want to wait for a table set their take-out pizza boxes inches away and ate the toppings off with their hands in front of us (?) yuck. I realize it's a popular place and they are trying to pack in more tables, but this one shouldn't exist. Our server was slow but it was a busy night, and she did agree to exchange my beer when I didn't like what I ordered. She made some recommendations for us- one of our pizzas was a hit and one was a major flop that didn't even come with cheese? All of the pizzas are make your own and it would have been nice to have a few predetermined options so you know what you order will be good. I can see how this place would be really great on a weeknight or during the day on a weekend. I want to like it, so I'll probably return then.
