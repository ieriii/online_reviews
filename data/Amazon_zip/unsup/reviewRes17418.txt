Violet Hour serves the proletarian need to sell pretentiousness to those who fear inadequacy. I'm upset that somebody referred to me as a 'mixologist's' bar. I believe a mixologist taxes good liquor and combines elements to subtly complement or bring out flavors in that liquor. At Violet Hour you'll find sub-par liquor (Wild Turkey?!) blended with overpowering, usually very sweet, flavors to cover up the cheap booze. The dcor is fair, though it will become obvious how ill-planned if you order food and don't want to sit with it in your lap. It's also hilarious to see the staff putting on airs and struggling to cover up tats, while reassuring themselves their current gig doesn't conflict with their own ideas of selling out.  So if you're a thirty-something who's concerned they may not have achieved the status they should have, stop into Violet Hour for a booster shot.
