Why is it that when it comes to ethnic fare, the Midwest magically turns it into the most bland thing possible? Fortunately, there's Lao Sze Chuan, the exception to the rule. Been here a few times, excellent food, excellent flavors. Also, a work colleague who's Chinese-American and grew up in Chicago, tells me this is the best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, and he is totally right. One star off for ambiance. It's nothing fancy.
