My boyfriend and I wanted to treat ourselves and decided to go out for dinner last Tuesday. We dared something new and stopped by the Wishbone. The host lead us to our table ("Here is your table"), and we sat down. Looking around the place wasn't terrible busy: A few tables, two waiters, bartenders and busboys huddling around. Menu looked good... And this is where my review ends, because after being ignored for more than 10 minutes - literally IGNORED!!! Both of us tried to make eye contact to maybe catch a chance for a glass of water. But the waiters just proceed their business carrying maybe two plates at a time. I was totally done when a third staff girl came along and carried ONE glass of wine to the table next to us. I have to say: I have never done this, but after being treated with such disrespect, we got up and left... no one haven't seemed to notice...
