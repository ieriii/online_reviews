If I could add another half a star I would. Everything was fantastic. The food was incredible. We started with the seasonal cheese app. This was delicious. There was an apricot side with the cheeses and bread. The beer selection was fantastic. I had the Gueuze bottle. It was perfect body and sour to match my sear tuna steak. wow. My roommates black truffle hash with duck egg became my next entree for my next visit. The scallops were delicious and the base was citrusy but not too bold. I ended with the Matilda and the chocolate cake. Wow. I dont even like dessert normally. But I wanted like ten of these. Im excited to see it become established and comfortable. I loved it.
