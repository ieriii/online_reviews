Great Location Outdated Design. I am an IHG fan and have stayed at several locations all with fabulous service and great design however, this location was a bit disappointing in terms of an interior design aspect. It felt a bit outdated from a design atheistic in addition to poor lighting. This location can definitely use a renovation! The location, Magnificent Mile, is awesome; in the middle of all things Chicago! As far as future trips are concerned I'd more than likely book else where since I'm big on the comfort level and visual appeal of interior decor.
