This place has such a great old school Italian feel, and absolutely amazing service! The food was so good, we ordered grilled calamari and it had great flavor and texture, also had the branzino they fillet just for you and it was sooooooo amazing. The dessert was great as well, they were nice enough to whip up something off the menu that I had a taste for, affogato! So yummy:)
