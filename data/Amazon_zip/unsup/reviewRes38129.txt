This place serves rabbit and other wild game. Aside from being a unique shaped bar I really didn't care for this very popular place. it was packed even on a Sunday Night and is a Chicago legend as I have heard of this place numerous times. The food is weird and expensive, but the beer choices are out of this world. i say saty for the drinks and avoid the food. Bar food is never really that great no matter how much they try to prep up the menu with exotic stuff.
