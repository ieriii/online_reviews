My favorite bar, with the best beer selection. I want to give this place 5 stars, but I can't. I'll get to those reasons later. So the crowd here is unique. It is a chicago bar that isn't full of hipsters, trixie's, or the stereotypical yuppies (though half of them are certainly yuppie). Belgian brews are among the best in the world, and the selection at this bar is excellent. Prices are appropriate for each beer. Tons on tap, and even more in bottle form. Food is good, though I've only dined here twice.  this place gets CROWDED, so be prepared to wait when you order a beer. one lady mentioned that she was disappointed that the back area is for food orders, but neglected to mention that the upstairs is pretty sweet, offers a second bar (only bottles, but a big selection), and is less crowded. The upstairs opens around 8pm, often a little earlier. the reasons I dont give it 5 stars. this place does get very crowded, and there isn't much turn over, so you gotta find your spot and stick with it, even if it's just a section on the wall. Also, while the menu does it's best to describe many beers, I've occasionally come across a beer that, despite it's intriguing description, did not jive well with my taste buds. By this I mean that many of the descriptions sounds similar (eg. "hoppy" "malty", etc.), all are positive (they wouldn't serve beer no one likes), but the tastes run the gamut. also, this place isn't too close to the train, the Clark bus is torture, and driving after a few of these brews isn't a good idea! ps. what's with all the Thor beards, does everyone at this bar think that they're a viking? clinging to swede ancestry?
