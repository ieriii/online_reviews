This place rocks as far as the limoncello martini, limoncello tartufo, chocolate tartufo, pork chop specials, ziti pasta, oh! their shrimp asparagus risotto and salmon. Very popular with the families and my tot is always greeted warmly. Love the place! Sometimes the service can be lacking but we ended up getting something comped by our waitress. Overall, for a place close to home and pretty good pasta and pizza, we go there.
