Was disappointed with RJs after reading such good reviews.. but I'll give it a break as so many people can't be wrong, maybe I ordered the wrong food! When we walked in we were barely noticed by the hostess' and not greeted in friendly manner. we noticed the youngish one (probably 19 or 20) did not smile once at anyone she obviously hates her job and would have preferred to be elsewhere. Our server was great, friendly and informative. Was excited for the main course after starting with delicious chicken wings. I ordered a wrap which was very bland, I taught the dressing would have been in the wrap but nothing so it was a let down... fries were ok kinda soggy.. wish i got a burger like my gf who enjoyed her juicy looking burger! The shakes are lovely too.
