I've been to Piccolo Sogno a number of times for business dinners and always found it top-notch. The other day I took my wife and baby, wondering how kid friendly it would be. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, and they even found a spot for us on the patio, which normally requires reservations on nice days. The pizza and risotto are to die for--you basically can't go wrong with Piccolo's menu.
