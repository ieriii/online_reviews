HOT DOUG's GAVE ME FOOD POISONING.Went to Hot Doug's with two friends. We all got different Dogs/Sausages and shared a basket of the Duck Fat fries. My friend called me the next night to see if I was sick. I missed her call because I was in the bathroom vomiting. All three of us got sick. I will not be returning.
