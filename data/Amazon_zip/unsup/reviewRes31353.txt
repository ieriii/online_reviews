I spent my early mornings last summer running past this establishment, and I was thrilled when the new restaurant started to build out. As soon as the new sign went up, I was officially excited. Mastro's. STEAK. I looked at the site, and was devastated when I read that I had to wait until November for its opening. Good grief! I had to wait that long!?! I was able to drag one of my closest friends, under the guise that I wanted to treat him for his birthday. As soon as I walked into the restaurant, there was no question which one of us was more excited to be there. I was so happy, I even gave my buddy the good chair when we were seated. You will read about people who said they needed a flashlight because the dining room is dark. The guy in the good chair said he saw people who used them. We were fine, though. The ambiance screams sophisticated steakhouse. We ordered wine instead of the signature martini. Some people need to work on Wednesday morning. The wine was well suited to our meal. Bill was our server, and he treated us like guests at his own dining table.  We ordered the sea bass and the 18 oz strip. Our sides were the lobster mashed potatoes and sauted asparagus. Little did anyone know that I had the menu picked out in October. Lobster mashed potatoes? They are as good as everyone says.  Asparagus was great as well. I can cook, but I can't make that sea bass, it was at least two inches thick and perfect. Now, the strip... it wasn't quite to the temperature ordered, but it was quite good, nonetheless. (Why yes, I took a bite.) Cooked, it didn't look like a pound of meat. They brought my friend cake for his birthday, it was a thoughtful touch.  We walked out loving our experience. This is a place I wouldn't hesitate to bring a client.
