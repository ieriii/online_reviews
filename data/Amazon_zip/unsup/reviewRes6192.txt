Had dinner there the other night and it was really a nice experience. We sat at the bar and had our food, as we were able to walk in, on a Saturday night at 6, and order right away--there was a 90-minute wait (a solid 90, too) for a table. And it was great. This is a chain, but is one of the upscale "Lettuce Entertain You" chains that doesn't feel like a chain at all. The menu is diverse and exciting, the people were really nice (kudos to a bartender who gets stuck serving and is nice about it), and the atmosphere was outstanding, a true night on the town. We started with the pretzel appetizer, a special for the night, and it was great, very soft and tasty. Then we had a chopped salad, which was standard, maybe a bit above, but big for the price and very fresh. For dinner I had the Saturday special, the fillet mignon Wellington, which was really tender and really tasty, and my nephew had a steak sandwich, which he raved about. So a typical River North Saturday spot in some ways--big waits, big dent on the wallet--but overall, nothing but great things to say about the place. An excellent choice!
