This is my second visit to Longman and Eagle in over a year and it lived up to my expectations. The menu was inventive and well-executed. Standouts for me were a side of buffalo sweetbreads and an extremely satisfying order of sweet corn churros for dessert. Dinner included a cocktail at the bar and a beer with my meal. Here too, they didn't disappoint. I was delighted to find Monk's Cafe Sour Ale - one of my favorite beers - on the menu. My one qualm is a slightly over-attentive staff. One of my dinner companions had his glass snatched away with a last half sip of Manhattan left. Normally we wouldn't notice, but the Manhattan tasty enough to cry over. Maybe next year I'll come back for the burger.
