There's no shortage of terrific Mexican food in my neighborhood, thank god. Garcia's is conveniently located *both* in Lincoln Square and on Western (I know, it's spooky). Sometimes I park outside the Bad Times PayLess Shoes and run in; most recently I went with some friends from out of town for actual real person service-- which didn't disappoint. The vegetarian fajitas (full of actual vegetables, spinach, broccoli and potatoes (?)-- fantabulous) and broccoli and spinach burrito are super and gigantic-- If you can finish either in one sitting... well, you're an American. I usually love a burrito suiza, but the sauce on this puppy-sized puppy was kind of lacking and the cheeses kind of gummy. My cheese-loving dining companions had no complaints, but I'd probably downgrade next time. Ooh- and they bring you a big bucket of diet coke if you order the large. Go for it, it's your special day.
