I wanted to like this place - it's Italian and close to my place and the atmosphere looked really great! However, after my experience there, it is very unlikely I will go back. The atmosphere was good but that is where to good ended. I didn't give the place 1 Star because one person in our party really liked their risotto, but everyone else was disappointed by their dishes. Bland was the overall comment - this coupled with the awkward interactions with the staff and waiting an inordinate amount of time for our food made for a disappointing evening. Oh well - there are plenty of other great Italian places in the neighborhood so one less option isn't the end of the world.
