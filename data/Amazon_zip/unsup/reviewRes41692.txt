I wasn't very eager to try this place after hearing some bad reviews from my friends. However, I was pleasantly surpirised! The food was darn tasty and left me feeling very nostalgic for my time spent in Vietnam. This isn't my favorite restaurant on Argyle, but it'll do! To be fair, I only had pho, spring rolls and coffee. Some people sitting next to me ordered food that definitely did not look like anything authentic I saw in Asia.
