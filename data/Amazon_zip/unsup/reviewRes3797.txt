I crave this chicken like crack! The sassy and BBQ sauces are some of the best I have ever had and their chicken is always perfect. The beef bowls are not bad either. It is not the cheapest chicken in town, so if that is what you are looking for don't go here. If you are looking for flavor this is the place. Call your order in ahead to avoid the wait that can get a little long a peak hours.
