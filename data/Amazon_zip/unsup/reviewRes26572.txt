This place is cute, really cute... one of the "nicest" BYOB places I've been to in Chicago. It was totally packed when I came here on a Friday night with a group of 6. The food was really good - I shared some sort of chicken curry and a veggie dish that were both tasty.  Unfortunately, one of my friends ordered a noodle dish and discovered a giant string in the noodles (after unsuccessfully trying to eat it!) We were pretty disgusted until the owner came out and showed us that it was a string that had been used to hold the uncooked noodles in the package, so it wasn't unsanitary. He was super apologetic and gave us free fried bananas for dessert which were AMAZING. So all was forgiven and we'd definitely head back.
