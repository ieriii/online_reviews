So, Ray from work says "Have you tried Crisp yet? Great Wings! You got to go!" So I look up this place on line and order 5 spicy wings and and a Baby Buddha Bowl (cause you gotta eat your veggies you know). The place was full, which means people love it, and I picked up my order from a really really cute little blond girl. The wings were huge and had a great spicy Buffalo sauce. Baby Buddha Bowl came with rice, lots of veggies, with an egg on top. I forget the name of the sauce included with it and I'm too lazy to look it up, but also it was a great compliment to the dish. I went back the next day to smile at the blonde girl and also to get the Big Buddha Bowl with Tofu. I like this place and Hi-five to Ray for suggesting it.
