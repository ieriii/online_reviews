What started out as a three star review for the food, Sun Wah was quickly downgraded to one star after "speaking" with the owner about our overcooked squid. For a party of ten, we ordered several dishes to eat family style and one of them was squid. First look caused some concern, as some pieces were white and others were purple, which none of us had ever seen before. Then after taking a bite, or trying to take a bite of the rubbery squid, our whole table was commenting how bad it was. We mentioned this to our server, and he said he would have to speak with the owner. She came over, said absolutely nothing to us and tried to cut a piece of the squid. After she was unable to do so, she took the plate from the table and left without a word. We weren't sure if she was going to replace or take it off the bill, so we sat and waited for her to come back and say something to us. After about ten minutes passed, another server came by and asked us if we needed anything. We asked about the squid, and he told us it was coming out. So more waiting, then our first server came by and still no squid. When we asked him, he told us that they were just going to take the squid off the bill. This terrible communication and mediocre food really disappointed me. The rest of the dishes were okay, but not worth a return. Stick with the real Chinatown on the south side.
