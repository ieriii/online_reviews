Came to this place based on the high rating from the Yelpers.  The atmosphere - is off the charts! Its has a great high energy vibe that makes you feel part of the Chicago night life. Being from SoCal - I just loved that aspect of it. We sat at the bar because it was SUPER crowded (even for a Thursday winter night) - glad we did because we had fun interacting with our cutie pie Bartender - Quaid. We ordered the beets/goat cheese and pistachio because there were many reviews on Yelp that RAVED about this.... let me save you - HALT don't DO THIS - unless you've never ever had this combination before ... otherwise, its nothing special. I often make salads that include beets & goat cheese - so I was like scratching my head and expecting it to be an amazing mouth watering experience... I can make this one in 5 minutes at home. (You're welcome!) I told Quaid that the beets were really "pedestrian" and he nodded without hesitation said, let me order you something else you'll like better - he ordered us the roasted cauliflower w/ parsley appetizer and it was GOOD! We also ordered: - Butternut Squash Arancini/Sage pesto - Coppa Panini - Wild Striped sea bass - blood orange & celery leaf These were all excellent. And then we come to desserts.... Oh Yeah! Quaid, who reminded me of someone out of an episode of Sex N the City - because he has such a easy going, sweet, cute personality w/out being over the top about it... but I'm a faithfully married woman (but I'm not dead)... anyhow, I digress - sorry... Quaid wasn't the dessert - but he did give us a sampling of the soft serve ice creams - both the pistachio and the toasted cinnamon... then we ordered the Lemon Panna Cotta which I HIGHLY recommend. Glad I was able to experience the tastings of the Purple Pig! Some good eats for sure - if you see Quaid - give him a hello for me! :)
