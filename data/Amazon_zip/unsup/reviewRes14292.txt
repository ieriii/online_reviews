Food was good. Shrimp po-boy was awesome, and the tartar sauce was good (I feared the worst). But the potato cake was terrible -- floppy, soggy, but also burnt on the outside. The mac and cheese was good, but not great -- pretty sure that was fake cheese ... or was it cheddar? The omelet was good too. But the service was terrible. Maybe they were understaffed, not sure ... we think that our server was just not very good at her job. At least they had a high chair.
