I have been driving by this place for ages. Everytime I say to myself, "Self: you have to remember to stop at Glenn's Diner". There are so many places I want to try that I can never remember and end up going to the old stand by neighborhood joints. Not this time. I remembered! I wish my mind was not like a rusted seive and I had gone there sooner. The place features exotic fish selections, sandwiches, omlettes all day and cereals too. It's pretty casual inside and has a nice feel to it. And a full bar and a wine list. A they guy Glenn is in there making sure everybodys' happy---props for that. We had breakfast and the omlette was fresh, huge and delicious. The staff was attentive and we got seated very quicly although the place isn't big (and it was weekend brunch hours). This place is a neighborhood gem (right across form the new and improved Montrose Brown line stop). I will definietly be back for dinner.
