I think this place needs to be renamed to piece of heaven. The pizza was absolutely divine. First let me say the pizzeria brewery feel of this place makes it like a Chuck E Cheese for adults. Its loud and busy and if you take a second to listen youll realize the noise level but it doesnt bother you while youre there if anything you find yourself raising your voice to fit in. We started with the goat cheese appetizer and 2 golden arms. The golden arms were a delicious brew. The goat cheese was pretty good but a little too tomato saucy there didnt seem to be a lot of cheese in it. We got the New Haven style pizza which has no mozzarella just a little parmesan and garlic on it. We got spinach, fresh tomatoes, and pepperoni and each slice was an explosion of flavor. We got a small and it was too much for 2 of us so the proportions are very generous. The pizza is worth a trip to Wicker Park, I cant wait to go back to this area again!
