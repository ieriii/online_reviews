me gusta comida de mexicana. muy delicioso. :) that was my poooor attempt at spanish even after 4 yrs of spanish in HS. anywho, loved the food. tasted fresh and favorful! but i loved the margaritas even more esp since I went on tuesday or thursday which is their 1/2 off margarita night! it's a MUST HAVE!!! the wait staff were nice and chatting. i feel a bit bad now cause after a few margaritas, i admit i was a bit loopy so i started speaking to them in my broken spanish :( but they were all accommodating and friendly.
