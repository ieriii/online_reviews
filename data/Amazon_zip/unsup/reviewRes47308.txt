MY VISIT WAS THE WORST BAR EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE Literally: We walked in on a Monday. The place was empty. We were in a large group of 7 people and maybe three times they irately asked us to remind them exactly how many people were in our group although I had no idea why this was important. We got yelled at for not sitting at just one table because it would somehow mess up the "flow" in the bar, I'll remind you that WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE BAR. About $50 into our tab, we were notified that all of our drinks had to be on the same tab. Apparently ringing up a total of 7 customers that night was asking too much. After agreeing with our prick bartender to settle up, the guy left us completely unattended in the bar for 15 minutes. The urge to leave without paying was overwhelming. We ran up a $115 tab and somehow managed to pay all of it in cash but consequently some people in our group were forced to contribute way more than what they had ordered. The bartender could have set himself up nicely for a decent tip from us, but he was such a careless asshole that we stiffed him and I have no shame in admitting that, as covering just the tab alone was an enormous inconvenience for us. On the way out, one of my friends made it clear to the bartender that we had stiffed him and that we had a terrible experience there. I really cannot understand why this place has so many amazing reviews but I guess we were there on an off night (a Monday) and didn't try the food some people here are raving about. Why a jailhouse themed metal bar would serve food or why people would like eating in that type if environment is completely beyond me. I have never had such a negative bar experience that didn't stem from an externality like perhaps the people at a bar. I can't attest to the type of crowd that goes to this place because like I said, the place was empty.
