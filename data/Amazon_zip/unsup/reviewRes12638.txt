This was my first Brazilian steakhouse experience and I loved it! I came here on a Friday night and it was packed! Luckily, I had made reservations and my husband and I were seated quickly. Our waitress was great and was on top of things. The salad bar is delicious and definitely puts other salad bars to shame.As soon as we flipped the cards over, 3 different people came at the same time with different cuts of meat. They were all perfectly seasoned and delicious. Everything was just really great. I will coming back here for sure!
