I have gone to Crisp and handful of times and love it. Their chicken wings are amazing as well as their rice bowls. But my all time favorite is there Seoul Sensation Burrito! I get it every time! Also, surprisingly their fries are good too! Also, I should mention that I am Korean and I very much enjoy the twist that Crisp adds to Korean cuisine! I highly recommend Crisp. It is absolutely delicious.
