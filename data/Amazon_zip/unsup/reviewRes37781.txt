OMG! Terrific pizza! Pizza that is unlike any you are likely to have had before and really, really filling. Great reasonably priced selection of beers (pizza without beer is like California without sunshine), terrific atmosphere and great service. When we were planning our visit to Chicago, everyone told us to eat Chicago pizza and almost everyone had a favorite pizza place to recommend. The one place recommended again and again was Giordano's. It was a wonderful recommendation! The star of this restaurant is the stuffed pizza which is loaded with goodies ranging from the cheeses to the pepperoni to mushrooms and the green peppers. Altogether a great pizza. But this pizza is very rich and very filling. My wife and I split a small pizza and took one-third of it back to our hotel. This is yet another of the places I had the chance to visit in Chcago that I wish could go to in my own neighborhood.
