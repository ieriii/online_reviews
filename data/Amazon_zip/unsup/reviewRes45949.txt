I love to hate on mass-market middle America. Rachel Ray, Guy Fieri, TGI-Fridays, focus group approved, family friendly restaurant concepts are all on my culinary shit list. But now I'm a hypocrite, because for some crazy reason, I actually really liked this place. Yes, I know it's the Cheesecake Factory's 'upscale' big brother. But for the price point, quantity of chow, and quality of execution, I have a hard time faulting Grand Lux for anything, other than being a major league sell-out (but who isn't nowadays). First of all, the food was actually really good. Our chicken summer rolls, which were an abomination of thousands of years of beautiful Vietnamese culinary tradition, actually were quite tasty, fresh, and crunchy. My Carolina style pulled pork sandwich was about as authentic as a Milli Vanilli record, but fuck-it, actually tasted pretty good. And at $12, it was a ridiculous bargain. These guys must run drugs out the back door, because I don't know how they're turning a profit. And the service. Given it's the midwest, but people were nice. So godamn, frustratingly, resentfully, perplexedly, fucking nice. Whether it be the hostess, the busboy, or our waiter, they were all so annoyingly pleasant. No eye-rolls when I asked for a salad instead of fries. No sighs or tight-lipped smiles when my dining partner asked for a vegetable soup instead of her fries. No indignation when I asked for an iced-coffee (not on the menu). Just willing cooperation, pleasant demeanor, and nearly flawless service.  Giving a glowing endorsement of this place pains me unbelievably. But in this case, credit is due for what it's worth.
