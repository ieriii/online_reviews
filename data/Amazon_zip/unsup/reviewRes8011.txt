The best Brazilian churrascaria in Chicago. Be sure to ask for the Gaucho that is serving Picanha a Brazilian cut of sirloin with a nice salted garlic flavor. Also be sure to order a Caiparoska or a Caipirinha. Finish the meal with an order of the creme de papaya. After the Brazilian Soccer team played the US national team in Chicago in the summer of 2007 I sat a table away from many of the Brazilian soccer team stars. I knew that if they chose to visit Fogo that it must be the most authentic Brazilian food in Chicago.
