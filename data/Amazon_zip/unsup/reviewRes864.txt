get a load of the weenies here at hot doug's. man, i haven't had a hot dog in over two years. and i miss them, i really do. i used to eat at crif dog's and grey's papaya in manhattan all of the time, and ever since i became vegetarian, hot dog's are a lunch that i truly regret not being able to eat every now and then. so when my brother suggested going to hot doug's after he picked me up at o'hare, i was pleased as hell to see that they have a meatless dog on the menu. he assured me after waiting on line for almost an hour that the food inside would be worth it, and he was right. i got a the veggie dog chicago style and it tasted fantastic. i'm not sure if it was because the bun was so loaded with extras that i couldn't really tell it was a meatless hot dog, but who cares. it tasted amazing. the fries were good too. they also sell Tab in a can here. in case you felt like drinking a Tab in the can. or, right here is fine.* my parents had fries made in duck fat. i was repulsed by this, but they scarfed that shit down like nobody's business so i guess it's safe to say it tasted good. it was pretty inexpensive, it tasted divine, and they had really cool decor. i am proud to say that my brother's band had an 45" EP hanging on the wall along with a picture fo sid vicious eating a hot dog. that made me a proud little sister. *did anyone get my European Vacation reference?
