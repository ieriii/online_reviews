Superdawg's the best because its an authentic classic and there is nothing else like it. And I am not just talking about just the atmosphere and decor, the hot dogs, fries, pickled tomatoes, and seriously grilled onions that come tightly packed in a box where they all stay warm are unique and tasty, they do not taste like other dogs. The place is more than just a drive in restaurant, its a time machine. On the warm nights the hot rods come out, cars you have not seen on the streets in 30 years, when most of us were just little pups.  Going there can bring you back to a time you may have long forgotten. We should appreciate it while we still have it and before its gone. All the old places are disappearing these days in a flood of national chain restaurants. Superdawg has an 8 month business and 12 month of expenses. If the owners only cared about profits, this place would already be gone.  Yeah, the hot dogs with fries might be a be a buck more than somewhere else (still under $5), but its worth it to keep this slice of living museum of when gas was 30 cent per gallon alive in our area. I can take my kids here and tell them there was a time when . . .
