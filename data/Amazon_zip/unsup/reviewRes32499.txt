For a VERY vegan friendly restaurant? FABULOUS. Pretty much any sandwich, the pumpkin ravioli, mexican hot chocolate, avocadonnaise burger, sweet potato fries, mac'n'cheez, and chocolate cake are ALL to DIE FOR - it's just simple diner food that is actually vegan, very creative, and high quality. I did go for brunch once and was slightly disappointed w/ the biscuit and gravy - came out a little dry and the 'sausage' on top just wasn't good - but extra points for free parking in the alley next door :)
