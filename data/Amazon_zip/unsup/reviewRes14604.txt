(FYI: This review is based on what I experienced as I went out to dinner with my in-laws for Mother's Day 2012). We had reservations for 5:30 p.m. on 5/12/12 and were running a bit late as traffic from the suburbs to the city was making for a slow commute. Called just to inform them we were coming but would be a few minutes late and was rudely dealt with by the women that answered the phone. In the end, it didn't make a difference as we were seated almost immediately when we arrived. It seemed as if they may have crammed few more tables into the dining area because people were sitting almost on top of each other, and the waiters, waitresses and busboys hardly had any room to maneuver. Getting up to go to the bathroom was like dancing ballet with all the spins and shuffles you had to do between tables. Our complimentary bread was burned on the bottom, but the inside was still pretty flavorful. We also got some cheesy bread that was pretty decent. I chose the veal saltimbocca, which I'd had before at another restaurant; the previous dish surpassed Sabatino's effort. The veal was pounded thin and uniformly cooked, but the whole dish just tasted like salt and butter. I had vegetables as my side; it was simply a plate of green beans. I am not a big fan of green beans but I was surprised with how good these were (with a little bit of salt and pepper added). We skipped dessert because we finished the night at home. The north dining room decor left something to be desired: Plastic grapes and white Christmas lights hanging from lattice framing in front of the cheesy "Italian Scenery" imagery painted on the walls. Our waitress did a good job considering how loud, crowded and busy things were. I'd be willing to try Sabatino's again, definitely on a different night of the week and not on a celebratory holiday when they are completely slammed.
