Ok, if this wasn't a brewery it would be 5 stars but I shouldn't be walking out of a brewery talking about the food - I should leave talking about the beer right? I've worked my way through the beer selection and, sure, it's decent. I'm typically not one for IPAs and I've had 2 that I like there, but beyond that, nothing has really left an impression. The food is awesome though. Carolina-style BBQ pulled pork was great. Had a pizza with gorgonzola, pistachios, duck confit and tomato sauce. The bacon-fat popcorn was as good as it sounds. I'll be back for sure - but for the food
