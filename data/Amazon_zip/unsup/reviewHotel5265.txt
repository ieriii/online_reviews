The two stars are for the truly beautiful room. The missing stars are for the fact that everything else is extra--a LOT extra. Examples: overnight valet? That's 51$. Sending out a pair of socks for washing? 11$. Want internet? That will be 15$ per day. Using the fitness room? 10$/day. Like a cup of coffee in the morning? It will be charged to your room.To top it all off, this huge hotel seems to have a customer service staff of no more than 4 people at any one time. As a result, it is extremely impersonal (but, I'm sure, very lucrative for the owners.) In summary, if you like being treated like a giant wallet instead of a valued customer, try the Fairmont--it's super pretty!
