I just tried Wildfire out for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It was a sunday evening and we were freezing from having spent an hour outside in the cold walking around at the zoo. We warmed up with a nice bottle of malbec and I had the peppercorn crusted filet (Medium). The filet was cooked to perfection and the redskin mashed potatoes were delicious. I was completely full from having eaten a smore and drank a large cocoa at the zoo in addition to my meal but I managed to split dessert with my girlfriend which were miniature keylime pie slices. Yes, I was glutunous and I paid for it later. Food wise, it was a great place to eat. As for atmosphere, it lacks any identity. There are large black & white photos of old movie stars and musicians which give it a somewhat generic feel. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch but with the River North location it tends to bring a very touristy crowd. The price is not exactly cheap so I expected the clientale to dress a little better. I'm not saying everyone needs to be decked out but I think people walking around in sweatpants and football jerseys steals a little class from the place. I can't fault Wildfire for having patrons who dress badly but I can at least be the voice of the fashion police and try to persuade a few people to have some class and dress it up a little. Jeans and a nice shirt will do. If you want to wear pajamas order delivery at home or go to McDonalds.
