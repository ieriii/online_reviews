I used to go to Spoon Thai down the street for all my Thai needs. However, Spoon seems to be slacking these days (you can check out my re-review for them if you want), so we have recently started branching out to other local Thai places. Since Opart is just a few doors down, it seemed pretty logical to give them a try. The atmosphere of Opart is definitely superior to Spoon, in my opinion. Opart is much larger and thus can hold a lot more people. However, even when it's full, you can still actually hold a conversation in Opart - it isn't overly loud. The seating at Opart is also more comfortable. The service is great at Opart as well. On the times that we've been there, the servers have always been on the top of their game. I haven't had a single instance of being without water (which is useful for their spicy dishes), and they have been quick to take our orders, remove our plates, and bring us the bill. The food also comes out at the same time for the entire group. Although that seems like a strange thing to be complimenting them on, Spoon has been having some big problems with that, which is actually one of the main reasons we started branching out in the first place. So how about the food itself? I'm not going to go and say that it is really much better at Opart. To me, it seemed pretty much equal. But as you can see from my profile pic, I'm a white guy. I'll be the first to admit that my usual "go-to" Thai dishes include fried rice, Pad Thai, and the vegetable dishes. So don't take my review seriously if you are the kind of person who orders REAL Thai food, like all that stuff on the menu that I can't pronounce. So all in all, if the food is just as good (and the same price), and the atmosphere and service are better at Opart, I see no reason to stop going there. I'll probably still get occasional take out orders from Spoon, but Opart, welcome to my short list of Thai places.
