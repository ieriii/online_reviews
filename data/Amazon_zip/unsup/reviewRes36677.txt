My long-awaited first visit to Meli surprisingly exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere is so quaint and warm-- and since we arrived right before lunch on a Friday, my two cousins and I were given a coveted window seat after only a five-minute wait. Everything we ordered was unbelievably fresh, flavorful, bountiful, and delicious-- from the homemade jams to the fresh-squeezed juices to the skillets and omelettes (the smoked sausage and spicy flamenco varieties rule!). We were so stuffed at the end of our meal that it proved quite difficult to move. I would definitely recommend Meli for brunch-- but I'd hate it if I had to wait 30 minutes for a seat. It'd be worth it, for sure . . . but I'd probably faint from hunger and anticipation.
