There has been so much hype around this restaurant that expectations were a bit high. The guacamole was good but NOT the best I have ever had. The duck though cooked perfectly was missing depth in flavor and the "tamale" on the side was awful. The carne asada was one of the best I have ever had. The 3 1/2 hour wait and unfriendly front of the house was a negative start. . I would eat here again though I don't think I would ever wait 3 1/2 hours.
