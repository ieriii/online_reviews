I'm not a vegan and I absolutely loved this place. Sometimes it can be a little slow on the seating but only because it's a little place. And it's well worth going out of your way to visit. The vegan meat (seitan) is better than the real thing and the desserts have all been truly great. We have had the chocolate mousse cake and their cookies many times.  I've had the reuben, black bean burger, and the shawarma and all were outstanding. This is a "must eat at" for everyone.
