This is the place...whats crazy is I live walking distance from Indie but have searched far and wide and ate sushi everywhere in this fair town...but Indie delivers a happiness that I can only begin to deliver to you in words...The creativity of the rolls are never ending in addition to many amazing regular rolls on the menu they always have a special roll of the day or week...and they will customize at your request as well...my two favorites rolls on the menu are the metallica and the las vegas roll both out of this world...to top off the already mind blowing sushi is the thai food...The Indie signature curry dish with beef is amazing...the beef is like a juicy beef roast any middle american mom would be proud to call her own- except much different in the flavoring of-course-juicy hearty and complex all at the same time! as if this was not enough the lunch special is grand under 7 dollars for soup appetizer and entree...one last thing and this is huge! You must get the crab rangoon they are the best I have ever had! worthy of a 6th star! oh and BYOB yeah you know me!
