And he's done it again. If there are two things Billy Dec knows how to do well, it's throwing a party and opening a restaurant. Makes me wonder what kind of food Billy's getting into back on the homestead at his very own Rockit Ranch! But I digress-- so I finally made plans to check out Sunda for lunch knowing how tough it is to get a dinner reservation right now (actually, for the next couple of months). Upon entering, the modern yet incandescent interior conjured up NoMI-- and no surprise, considering New York design aesthete Tony Chi decorated both. His firm belief in the 'invisible design' philosophy is wholly evident at Sunda as everything ebbs and flows with a gentle energy... almost making it look easy, yet so smart. Looking over the menu, I was very pleased with the extensive lunch options. Some of us make lunch the largest meal of the day and appreciate a dinner-sized menu! I started with miso soup (perfect-- mild but still flavorful) and moved on to the Southeastern Chop Chop chicken salad. I love chopped salads and this one hit the green spot-- a huge portion with napa, mango, peanut, mixed with a slightly sweet jalapeo dressing. My colleague chose Sunda's signature dish-- crispy, pan-fried then soy-glazed rice topped with spicy tuna and jalepeo. Judging by the smiles and swoons, this crispy rice is worthy of all the hype. We also tried a roll on special-- the Summer Roll-- and deemed this our favorite. Escolar, tuna, avocado, cilantro and a zippy sauce distinguished it from a typical summer roll-- light, fresh, just lovely! Our service was attentive and we felt free to linger a while longer. A lunch designed with summer wanderlust in mind... ahhhh. Between the delicious, artfully-plated food, zen decor and aim-to-please staff, I predict Sunda will become a tenacious rockstar in the realm of Asian Fusion.
