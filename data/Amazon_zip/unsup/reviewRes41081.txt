I gotta say I was super impressed with Bon Soiree. My friends, in researching where they could take their chef friend out for his birthday without applying for the loan necessary for Alinea or Tru.  We went on $30 prix fixe 3 course Tuesday. I got the 5 course tasting menu for $50 cause it was my damn birthday and I'm old and feeling entitled. The menu seems like something that changes often enough that it's not worth mentioning any particular dishes but I was very pleasantly surprised with my grilled cobia dish (with leeks two ways). Ordinarily I don't much care for fish if its ever known the touch of heat but this bad boy really did the trick.  2 more things to mention- the portion sizes for the 5 course tasting menu were the same as the regular menu sizes which translates into a metric assload of food- not a bad thing but not particularly necessary. And the desserts, while beautiful and delicious were not quite up to the incredibly high standard the rest of the meal had set.
