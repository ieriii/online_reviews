A fantastic place for Dinner with the family or on a date. I have grown up with this place all my life and It never gets old. I can't remember when I have gone there and had a bad meal... NEVER! I have grown up with some of the staff there and they treat me like family. I highly recommend La Villa for carry-out, a night out, or even a family party. Thanks for some great memories!
