I'm a Superdawg guy. Not only am I a sucker for the whole experience, I truly prefer the hot dogs to others in town, including Gene and Jude's and Portillo's. The prices are admittedly high, but after dozens and dozens of visits, I've never been unhappy with my hot dog. I like many of their other menu items, but I can't pass up the Superdawg when I visit. I really like their fries and tend to take my time eating my way to the dog. I'm a big fan of the Black Cow, too. My girlfriend, a Californian, got her first exposure to Chicago Style dogs here, and marveled at the use of green tomatoes (although I had to explain that not all Chicago dogs used green tomatoes) and was quite cute trying to figure out how to eat the crazy thing with the big pickle on top. So yes, Superdawg is a fun, good Chicago original. All should go at least once. About the only negative things I can say about Superdawg is that the parking lot is often packed with frighteningly massive SUVs and their Midway Airport location kinda sucks, at least compared to the real deal.
