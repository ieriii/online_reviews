Indie is solid and a reliable place for dinner. A byob Asian fusion joint with a private ambiance. It's cozy and reasonably priced. I have enjoyed the Tom kha Kai soup, a handful of different rolls, noodles, rice dishes and curry. I love coming here with a group & sharing some appetizers family style. I look forward to my next visit.
