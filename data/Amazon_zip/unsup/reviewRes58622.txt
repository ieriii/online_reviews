I wanted to try Fondue for years now... so when groupon put on a deal for Geja's, I quickly bought it. Before booking my reservation, spent hours looking at the menu and reading the other reviews ...just so I can understand how everything works.The place is romantic, really cool spot, guitar playing....perfect atmosphere! You can read all other reviews for more details!Our server Leah was really cool and helpful!Me and my date we ordered the Seafood platter and the cheese and chocolate fondue...+ a bottle of wine.We received 2 small salads with just greens and Italian dressing (seems like the greens were sitting outside for a long time)Next we received the cheese fondue; the melted cheese was really tasty! With it we got a basket of apples, grapes, and small pieces of bread to dip into the cheese. These items were disappointing; I expected a lot better.Next we got the seafood platter which consist of 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 SMALL pieces of lobster and 2 SMALL pieces of scallops plus 8 sauces and veggies to cook! The quantity was very disappointing!Next we got the chocolate fondue which was the highlight of the night! We got marshmallows and various fruits to dip and small pieces of sweet bread!My bill was;1 seafood 51.95$1 chz & choc fondue 22.95$1 bottle of wine 26$Total including tax 111.75$My complains are the following; paying 51.95$ for 6 pieces of fish is unacceptable! Also the fruits used for the fondues tasted weird! It felt like there were shopped up hours/days ago and put in a container with salty water.. I'm guessing for not to get black and present them to the costumers as fresh...? hmm... now I know... the fruits are NOT fresh!Overall it was just ok! cool place to go once every other year....but not worth the money you spend... that's why if I ever come back I will make sure to have a coupon again!
