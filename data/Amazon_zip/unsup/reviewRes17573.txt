finally, a place that lives up to the hype. i want to live inside the Violet Hour. after planning on going for a while, me and a couple of girlfriends went this past saturday. we had to wait about 10 minutes to get in, but it was definitely worth it.  the host was so friendly. the decor and overall ambience were wonderful - very understated and warm. the music selection was great (Flaming Lips, Radiohead, Aretha Franklin) and the volume was perfect. this is not a loud bar to mingle or dance at - it's an intimate chill place to go with people you actually want to talk to. and then came the drinks... i wanted to try all of them. i had the Rangoon Fizz and the Amaretto Fizz and they were both amazing. i will definitely be returning, but i'm afraid the word is already getting out too much - there was a bachelorette party there complete with tiara and glowing necklaces. yikes.
