Maple/Mustard pork sandwich with Caesar salad, not writing home about it, but it hit the spot. Was given the infamous "we're out of iced tea for the season" message by my server, who completely blew my mind all over the place. Iced tea season? Please tell me that they are making iced tea out of hand picked West Lake Longjing and will accept only the youngest of leaves, because otherwise, I can't understand how iced tea could possibly go out of season.
