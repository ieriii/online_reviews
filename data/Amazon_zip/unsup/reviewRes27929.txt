I don't care how good a place is. With very few exceptions, there is NO restaurant worth waiting more than an hour to sit down at, especially when you're packed in like sardines with throngs of suburban Chicago tourists who would probably benefit everyone more if flattened on Clybourn than eating pizza on a Friday night. Well, that was rude of me. But true, damn. And I just went in to TAKE OUT my pizza. These people need a damn pick-up window or something. So I dove in among the unwashed masses to get my pizza, paid up, waited about five minutes before the bartenders realized they still owed me change then held my breath and entered the fray once more until I burst out into the cold night air. I have never welcomed subzero temperatures more. Once we got our pizza home, I...was disappointed. Really not worth risking my life going in there. I've heard some people complain that the crust tastes burnt. I'm not in that camp; I actually like the cheese cooked onto the crust. It adds a nice flavor to the top of the pizza. But the crust-to-toppings ratio -- even the crust-to-cheese ratio! -- was all wonky. It actually took some elbow grease getting a knife through the pizza to the plate to cut myself a bite. The pepperoni and sausage were both delicious, but I ended up carving about a quarter-inch of the crust off the bottom and eating a strange, doughy cheese and toppings melange... All in all? Too much work for a lazy Friday-night dinner!
