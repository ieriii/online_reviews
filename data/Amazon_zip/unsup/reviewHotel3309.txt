Nice room design with great views, but don't let the Hard Rock name fool ya... I was with a group of friends in one of the suites having a wonderful, but completely respectable/respectful gathering after skating at Millennium Park. We must have had grandma with her hearing aid still in, sleeping next door, because security was at the door beginning at 10 pm, until everyone was kicked out at 11:15. I was so embarrassed. It wasn't a rowdy party, just a group of friends and some wine in the suite that our hosts upgraded to. If 10 pm is "lights out" at the Hard Rock Hotel in downtown Chicago- They should reconsider rebranding as the Smooth Jazz Hotel. Boo!
