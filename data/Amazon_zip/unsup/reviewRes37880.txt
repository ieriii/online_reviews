Pizza was excellent, and the bruschetta was really good as well. Wait was 45 minutes as I expected, so I pre-ordered. Even after being seated we waited another 30 minutes for the pizza to arrive at the table which was annoying but worth the wait. I would recommend to any family or friends coming to Chicago to eat here.
