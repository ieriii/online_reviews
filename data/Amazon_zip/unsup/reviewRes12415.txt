The food is amazing. Recently I had ceviche that was to die for, and several foo-foo-y drinks that were all tasty. In the past I've had halibut and an amazing appetizer with a variety of mussels and seafood...finishing it all off with a chocolate martini. Delish. So why 3 stars? Well, I am completely disgusted that when I went there a few weeks ago for a friends birthday AND we had reservations, we were not seated until about an hour after our reservation time, and in the meantime, the restaurant was seating walk-ins off the street. Yes, the walk-ins had been there longer than we had, but what's the point of having a reservation if it doesn't mean anything? Either you take reservations and you honor them, or you don't take reservations at all. Until I hear that Cafe 28 has figured this out, I won't be back. Sorry yummy ceviche ... I hope we meet again someday.
