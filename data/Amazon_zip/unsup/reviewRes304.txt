Plus: Cool experience. Calm minimalist design, a little bare for me but nice all in all Killer, innovative dishes -- obviously Love how they prep the dishes the same even if one's red meat and one's seafood. Great to be able to share the experience... Minus: Over-salted sometimes! What thah... I was hungry after 12 courses...and I'm not big... Some staff have an attitude like you should bow down for the privilege to eat here. Whatever. It was a great meal, but there's no need for pomp.
