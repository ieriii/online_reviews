This place is great for a cheap, delicious meal. The vegetarian burrito, and chile relleno are favorites. The steak sandwiches are also quite good. I don't get the entrees too often because they are so huge, but they are very good too. The service is ok, usually friendly, but it's fast paced, and they encourage a quick turnover. Last time I was there, it was super busy, and I noticed that the hostess and the cashier guy were texting the whole time. It made me feel bad for all the people working their asses off while those guys just sat on their phones. Bummer.
