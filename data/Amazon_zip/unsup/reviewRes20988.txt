Really a 3.5 Had dinner here with some family, atmosphere is cool and the menu is unique. I don't think there are too many places in Chicago with Elk on the menu. The service was good, but while I was waiting I asked for a glass of Cabernet and when I paid my tab it was $16! It was a generous sized glass of wine and quite tasty, but I didn't ask for a $16 glass of wine and that is what makes me want to rate The Gage 3.5
