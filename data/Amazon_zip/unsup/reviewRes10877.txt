The only reason I won't give this place 5 stars is because we had to wait over an hour. We asked the guy how far down on the list we were and he said we were next. We waited about another 15-20 minutes while he sat multiple other parties...we were getting a bit irritated! They brew delicious beers. I tried the Worryin' Ale and Swingin' something. I liked the Worryin Ale best!! For dinner, we started with the caprese salad. What's there not to love about tomato, mozzarella, roasted red pepper and salad drizzled with balsamic vinggar...nothing! We got a white pizza with spinach, mushrooms and onions. I love how thin the crust is and the freshness of the ingredients. We ordered a small which had 8 pieces...definitely enough to feed 3 people!
