I love the Cubana sandwich. Pick one up with some chips and guac. The Caldos are fantastic as well. But don't be surprised at how expensive it is. You are paying for quality in addition to the Bayless name. And if you value your time, call in your order for take out because the lines are usually out the door at peak times. If you forget to call ahead, it's still well worth the wait.
