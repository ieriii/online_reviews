Besides seeing a LARGE Mirror fall on someones head. I had an ok time.... It was super shocking to see a mirror that was about 10 feet + leaning on a wall, at one point and young man was dancing and and the mirror fell forward and laid him out. Like a cartoon flat, when I realized they it had glass over the frame I completely freaked out. Kinda ended the night. Let's rewind to 2 hours earlier. No line, apparently we walked in on an 18+ over night (womp womp), but we stood on the 21+ side. We were having drinks and dancing and were actually having a decent time. There was a Bar back...Latino Guy....his name was marvin, mario? something He got really aggressive with my gf because apparently she was in his way, when I told him there was a better way to talk to people he yelled at me. I asked the bartender his name and the bartender said "Don't worry that guy is on his way out he won't be working here for long." I HOPE NOT.
