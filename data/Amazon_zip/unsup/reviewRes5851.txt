My husband and I stopped in for dinner one night and I am sooooo glad we did! A lot of our friends recommended it and it didn't disappoint.  We started with the fried calamari and it was super crunchy and delicious. It came with ranch (who knew that would be so good!) and cocktail sauce. We usually just have it with red sauce so this was a nice change.  I went with the filet trio, well done, with mushrooms, peppercorn, and baked potato toppings. It came SUPER bloody, but no problem. They took it back and gave me a new one within minutes. The baked potato one was my favorite. I got fries with it and they were just ok...a bit too well done for my liking. I honestly don't even remember what my husband ordered but he loved it and ate every bite. We ordered carrot cake to share and it was delicious. Sometimes the frosting it a bit too much but this was perfect.  We will be back for sure. The service was good, the place was nice and clean, and we didn't spend a fortune for dinner.
