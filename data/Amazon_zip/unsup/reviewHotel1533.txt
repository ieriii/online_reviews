I stayed here on my recent trip to Chicago based on the recommendations on several yelpers when I asked for a modestly priced boutique-style hotel in a good location. Things that I liked: * Check in took like 4 seconds. I hate it when the person checking you into the hotel spends like 5 minutes pecking at their computer and making faces to try and check me in. This was the way it's supposed to be.  * Large room. Lots of space to spread out and a large window bringing in lots of natural light. * Location. I had several meetings around Chicago, and because the weather was nice, I was able to comfortably walk to just about everywhere from here. Things that could have been better: * No one serviced my room during the day until it was too late and I was back to my room late in the day. No biggie, for me, but a bit surprising. * I had to ask 3 times to get a smaller pillow. They set me up with these gigantic pillows (who sleeps on those?) and I requested a smaller one for my 2nd night but it was like pulling teeth to get it. * They tried to overcharge me when I checked out. Probably an honest mistake, but if I hadn't looked at my bill, it would have set me back an extra 50 bucks.
