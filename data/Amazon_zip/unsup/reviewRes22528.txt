I have been going here ever since I could remember.... Although the prices are a little high it's totally worth it. I would pay $20.00 for a hot dog with everything on it. BEST fries, BEST hot dogs. I hear everything else on the menu is also great, but everytime I press that button to order , "Hot Dog" just comes out of my mouth, delicious! and they're open late night which is great for a night after partying mmmmhhh superdawg!
