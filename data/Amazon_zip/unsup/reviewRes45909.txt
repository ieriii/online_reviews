I just went to Grand Lux with some friends and extended family. It was my besties 21st birthday! Wooo!!! Goodbye Bouncer, hello bartender.. LMAO! Anyway, we had to wait 2 hours for a table. You cannot make reservations for this establishment. I wish you could because the downstairs lobby gets crowded and if you are standing , it seems like you are a nuisance by getting in the way of the waitstaff. Now, on to the food.. We had a big order because we had 13 people to our table... Our waiter was awesome as we were indecisive as to what to get.. He want clockwise around the table.. I had the pasta fresca.. it was a vegetarian option.. I love meat but, I did not miss it at all with this dish.. It was light and had just enough flavor.. The deserts do take 30-minutes to cook so, you should order them with your entree... I also ordered the red velvet cake.. OMG!!! I was a freaking huge slice for the price... I just had to look at it for a minute and then dug in. I still ended up taking half of it home... Ooo...! I almost forgot about the apps. We had calamari, asian short rib tacos (how they managed to mess three cultures into one and make it tasty?? hm, i'm still wondering), and duck postickers (I know what you are thinking... yea, it tastes like chicken... lol!)
