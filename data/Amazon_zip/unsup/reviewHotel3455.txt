My girl's and I stayed here recently, we had a LivingSocial deal, so we thought what the hell, my friend was visiting from STL and we went to the Kanye West and Jay-Z concert (which by the way was AWSOME). Anywho, the hotel room was small, like hotel tonight app suggested (which again is another AWSOME app), I know shameless plug number 2. Back to the matter at hand, the tv is on the left side of the wall, and the beds face forward, so in order to watch tv you have to lay on your side, which is annoying. On the up side, you do get 2 complimentary drink coupons to be used at the bar, which was AWSOME also. I would stay again, if I got another LivingSocial deal or groupon deal. The doorman are great as well.
