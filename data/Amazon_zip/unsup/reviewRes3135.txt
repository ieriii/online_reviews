You forgot my fries, Crisp. Yes, the radish kimchi is freaking delicious, but unfortunately one other awesome korean place in chicago has gotten me used to eating kimchi with my fries. And last night, my fries were still probably sitting on the prep table at Crisp as I was walking away with my bag of wings and a cup of kimchi... Ahh, my small order of fries, sitting there, all lonely, w a lil tear in its eye... They were promised a delicious bath in kimchi later that night, kinda like a food version of that famous Flashdance scene.. you know which one I'm talking about... Happy lil fries gettin kimchi poured on em. Hot. Your chicken rocks my socks, though.
