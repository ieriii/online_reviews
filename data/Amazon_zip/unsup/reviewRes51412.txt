I am a connoisseur of great burritos and Garcia's has the best. And the biggest. I can't attest to know about anything else there, nor do I care, but the steak burrito is consistently amazing. As for the change in decor which seems to taint so many other reviews on here, it is completely peripheral to the quality, which is the same now as it always has been. I'm not sure what the decor would have to do with the way the food is prepared anyway? Oh, and the red sauce is the best salsa in town. Some say the green is their favorite. Either way, you have a nice choice.
