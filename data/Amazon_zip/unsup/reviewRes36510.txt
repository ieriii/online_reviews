Okay, so I'm giving this place 4 stars because of a few things. 1. The atmosphere is very relaxing and still classy in a down-to-earth way 2. There are many different sushi rolls to choose from 3. They offer Thai food and great Thai crab rangoon 4. It's inexpensive All of these were reasons I enjoyed this place. The caterpillar roll, which had slices of avocado covering the roll was delicious (although if you don't like eel, I'm sure you could ask for something else).  I do agree with another reviewer that this is not the place to go if you want extremely fresh raw sushi, but nonetheless I adore this place.  Granted, maybe I liked this place because my expectations were so low before going in and it really took me by surprise.  All in all, I'm sure I'l be back, if at least to try the Thai :)
