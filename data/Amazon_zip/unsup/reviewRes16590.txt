Went here on a recommendation from someone who's been here longer than I, which is I guess a given as you literally cannot tell that you're walking past it. I think it was supposed to make me feel like I was traveling into the Prohibition era, although a comment from my date made me think that it was more like traveling into a pretentious LA establishment. I kid, I kid! I didn't quite get the flavor I was looking for, but the drink was interesting and at least of a decent size, and it was definitely a singular experience. I have to admit I preferred the mojito I had at the Blue Line joint down the street, which probably makes me a philistine, but still, I can't really say too much against this place, and if I were you I'd take a date here at least once. I won't be a return customer, but that's fine, they obviously have more than enough patrons. Oh, I do have to give credit for their wait system. You give them your number, they call you when you're up! So why do those chain restaurants bother spending money on those limited-range buzzers, exactly? Bonus points for not keeping us prisoner during our wait.
