Anytime I encounter an Asian restaurant dabbling in Japanese and Thai, I'm suspicious. I think, there's no way it can all be done right. But all those glowing reviews, from trusted friends no less? Let's take a chance, baby! A girl friend and I perused the menu before calling in an order for takeout. Between the curries, noodle dishes, maki, fried rice, spring rolls, fried tofu and much more, there's really something to please every palate, every craving. We went with an order of cashew chicken, Pad Thai and a spicy tuna roll. We were quoted a 15-minute wait and when we arrived, our food was professionally packaged (who likes drippy sauces all over your order?). And, some extra fortune cookies were doled out upon request, with a smile. So, the food - simply wonderful! I'd rate the Pad Thai as an A-, the cashew chicken as a B and the spicy tuna roll as a B+. Solid eatin' all around, and for super reasonable prices. $5 for a fresh spicy tuna roll? I believe they're more expensive (and much less edible) at Jewel. I should mention that I'm extremely picky when it comes to Pad Thai and Indie's finally quelled my craving for the good stuff. Yay!
