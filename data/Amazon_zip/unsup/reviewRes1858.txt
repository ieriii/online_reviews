-Oh my god! -Duck fat fries are only made on Fri and Sat. I personally ended up liking the regular ones better. My friend and I ordered 4 sausages are char-grilled as suggested by Doug who is super friendly and helpful. -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris....that is the most amazing sausage I have EVER tasted in my entire life. -Tequila and Black Bean Chicken Sausage with Mango Salsa and Asadero Cheese...fabulous. -Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds...actually tastes better as you get to the end of it than the start of it. I little too sweet for me at first. -Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Beer-Washed Truckle Cheese....I happen to love Elk so I was very happy. I will gladly wait in line for an hour AGAIN, anytime (well maybe not in the rain). Just bring a friend to chat with that you haven't talked to in a while and time will fly. Besides, I had nothing else to do and I'm from Florida. Disney has trained me well (and for much less of a reward than amazing sausage).
