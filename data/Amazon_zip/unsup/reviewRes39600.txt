Went here for for an early unplanned Friday dinner and no regrets about it! I'm not a big whiskey fan so I couldn't fully appreciate their drink menu, but the food was great and the service was better. It's probably not a place I would frequent because the food is a bit eclectic for regular visits, but every once in a while it's definitely worth an experience.
