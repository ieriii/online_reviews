Just don't ... unless, it your desire to pig out quickly. too much, too fast and too costly for what you get. I heard about this from a couple of friends and they raved about the quantity of meat - that should have been my first clue. The wait staff is extremely attentive to bringing more and more - they go the extra mile to do a good job. And the meat is fine; its just that a dining experience should be more than getting too much to eat as quick as possible. It just felt wrong.
