Being out of town visitors, we knew we had to try one of Rick Bayless' establishments. We had just arrived in town, it was Thursday afternoon, about 2pm, so we decided XOCO would be a good start. Even though it was mid-afternoon, the line was still pretty significant. Which was a good thing; it gave us time to really ponder the menu and figure out what to have. Husband decided to have one of the sandwiches; I settled for soup. Unfortunately, both items were incredibly salty. We're not exactly the healthiest eaters, so we were left wondering if we just got an exceptionally bad deal? The saving grace were the churros, which we tried based on other Yelpers' feedback. Because of those churros, I will never order another churro at another sporting event ever again.
