Went there. Floored by the pricing. Especially as, working in the grocery business (not a competitor of F & O), I recognized a lot of the brands, sources and knew what the wholesale prices were for the products. A lot of the grocery items are sourced from an everyday wholesaler who specializes in products that have most of their cost in the "artisan" packaging than in the contents, and are marked up considerably. Read the ingredient labels with a heavy dose of reality. The wines can all be sourced by anyone in the business from a very limited cadre of suppliers, again, ordinary wholesalers, seriously marked up. Just a pickpocket experience, except no finesse about it, just a fist stuck in my pocket dragging out all of my cash.Cafe was a bore. Same old same old for a lot of money. Bakery, same. I talked with some friends who told me that there is never anything new at the bakery. Local bakeries, with actual bakers in back, change up the selection...not Fox & Obel. Nothing special for any holiday. They have a set selection that a bunch of minimum wage robots churn out daily, at premium (that would be extortionate) prices.Floors look dingy and dirty. Shelves are dusty. Staff is miniscule. Go to visit and point, but I think you would find better prices, and a wider selection, at Treasure Island. If you don't care about pricing, but want a better selection, try Whole Foods.Store overall looks like it's in the process of being remodeled and apparently has looked that way since it opened. Did they run out of money?The bathrooms seem to be very clean and well-supplied; faint praise indeed, but there you go.
