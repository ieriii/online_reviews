Whenever I come here, I am looking forward to the menu changes. They are always changing it up. Tonight I had a lamb dish, something I was not expecting at a restaurant that serves Southern style cuisine. What really threw me for a loop was hoe the dish was presented. It was a real food porn production this time around. The pieces of lamb were placed in spots throughout the plate. The sauces were streaked across the plate. The salsify was strategically placed by each piece of lamb. I've been there a number of times, but I've never seen food porn at Big Jones before.  The wine by the glass menu usually has an interesting choice or two. Tonight I discovered a malbec from the Loire region of France. It tasted nothing like the better known Argentine or Cahors versions, and actually tasted kind of like a Grenache. Anybody who shows some creativity with the wine list scores points in my book. Along with the bread pudding dessert (yes, more food porn), I drank a glass of the Rare Wine Co.'s Charleston Sercial madeira. More bonus points for restaurants that serve madeira, and more points for restaurants that understand that madeira never goes bad. I love port, but I know that most restaurants keep open bottles around well after their shelf life. Big Jones has really stepped up their game in the past year. They have been good with discounts while the economy has been bad. We had the $10 coupon that they let us keep reusing throughout last year. As I mentioned before, the food porn presentations were cool in part because they were not expected. This place has really grown on us.
