I recently got married and had my reception at the Wolf Point Ballroom at Holiday Inn Merchandise Mart Plaza. First of all, the views are of downtown Chicago are breathtaking. I'm not being biased but I really think the views from the ballroom are the best in the city. You get views of both branches of the Chicago river. It's beautiful during the day and even more amazing at night. Our guests complimented us all night long about the view. It's pretty incredible. Next the food is really delicious! We got married on a Friday and had the celebration buffet package. The package itself is pretty reasonable and the food was delicious. We had Caesar salad, prime rib, chicken, mashed potatoes, fruit, and grilled vegetables. Everything was super delicious. The prime rib and the chicken were juicy and very tasty. The cake, which we got through the package from Alliance bakery was very moist and delicious. We got compliments on the food/cake from our guests as well :D Last but definitely not least, the Event Coordinator, Barbara Martin is just fabulous. She is organized, responds promptly and is very nice to work with. She was one of the reasons we booked the venue. We knew with Barbara that we would be in good hands. Throughout the planning process we had great communication and she was extremely helpful getting things in order the day of the wedding. The Holiday Inn was recently remodeled with the newly added Wolf Point room. I think the secret is now getting out on how great it is. The prices are very reasonable for a downtown venue. I think choosing the Holiday Inn as our venue was the best decision we made in our planning process
