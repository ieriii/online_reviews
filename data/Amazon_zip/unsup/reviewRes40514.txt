There is SOOO much better in this neighborhood! On a street literally lined with vietnamese shops, this big boy on the corner is the only one people bother to stop in. It is always packed, even though it costs more and has lower quality food than most every other place. I guess I shouldn't complain, it leaves all my favorite places with open seats. But, really, everything i have had (and seen) is very average. It's not terrible; just bland and average compared to it's smaller neighbors (hello le's pho, pho 888, new saigon, etc). If you are looking for the place with big crowds and a wait to get seated - this is definitely the place for you. If you wan't to be seated quickly, have amazing authentic food and have a bill half the size - look elsewhere.
