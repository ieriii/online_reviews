Definitely worthy of a special occasion! Salad bar is SO FRESH, their cheese bread is sooo good (they'll bring you fresh ones if the ones you haven't eaten yet get cold. Just ask!), service is very attentive and so nice, meat was great (although I wish I could remember the names so I know which ones I liked the most...). Also, their Arnold Palmers are probably the best i've had (I pretty much get that everywhere I dine out), which i'm going to attribute to their "Brazilian Lemonade". So good! Papaya frosty dessert was pretty good as well (their house specialty). I will be back for a special occasion!
