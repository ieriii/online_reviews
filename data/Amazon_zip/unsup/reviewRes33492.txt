I was in town for Lollapalooza this past weekend and I'm a big breakfast fan. My sister-in-law suggested I try the Bongo Room on Wabash, so I did. It was okay. But then, I heard my hotel concierge direct a number of folks to Yolk - so I went yesterday morning. Verdict - two big thumbs up. Owner Taki graciously greets you when you walk in the door and you immediately notice the big spacious feel of the place with tall ceilings and modernist decor. I sat at the counter and noticed the gentleman next to me was pounding a massive veggie omelette. I love when establishments serve big portions - it's the American way.  I usually prefer one-page menus - but Yolk has so many mouth-watering options that I found myself deciding amongst three or four different choices. Fritatta? Cinnamon french toast? Omelette? I made a last-second, gametime decision of the Countryside Skillet, which was a delicious combo of meat, potato and veggies covered with eggs and the most scrumptious gravy you've ever tasted. I would never even think to add gravy to this dish - but I found myself practically licking the last bits of gravy out of the bowl. You also get a side of pancakes - and I highly recommend the chocolate/strawberry cakes (especially if you possess a sweet tooth as unsatiable as mine). Another little twist is the fresh-squeezed strawberry/orange juice - trust me. Service by Curtis was terrific (and there's also beautiful eye candy in the form of Clare) and the locals who crowd the counter are exceptionally warm and social. I accidentally left my credit card at Yolk and ran back an hour later. Taki pulled my credit card out of his pocket as I walked in before I even said a word. That's service. If you live anywhere near the South Loop and find yourself hungry one morning - go to Yolk and thank me later.
