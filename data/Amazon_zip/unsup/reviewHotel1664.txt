Sometimes ya just need a staycation. That's what brought us here and we loved it. Loved: *the modern fun decor *the price *the layout of the lobby creates lots of cool seating areas *aveda bath goodies *a nice selection of complimentary items(incase you forget your fashion tape) *comfy bed *helpful staff *only about a half mile walk from the train station But seriously what is up with the crazy slow elevators?
