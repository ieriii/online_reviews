I'd heard great things about Meli Cafe but I'd also heard that it is not good for groups. So it was with great trepidation that I decided to host my husband's birthday brunch here. We were a party of 20 so I called to let them know in advance. The manager Alina, was kind enough to reserve one section of the restaurant for us. As you know, the problem with large groups is that someone invariably cancels or arrives late. They were extremely accommodating and seated us as people arrived. THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. We had wraps, paninis, omelets, scrambles, vegan scrambles, crepes, juices, smoothies; basically all their popular dishes. Not one person complained about the food. In fact there was silence at the table as well devoured our dishes. They gave us some of their in-house honey butter and marmalade on the side. It was polished off in 45 seconds! We're definitely going there again. I haven't met a single person who has a bad thing to say about Meli Cafe.
