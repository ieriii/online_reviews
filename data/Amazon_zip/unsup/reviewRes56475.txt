It was SO GOOD! I did have to wait out in the rain to get in for a reservation, but it was worth it. I could have licked the plate, it was so good! We had champagne margaritas (it was a good combination, I promise) a starter, mains, and dessert. Our waitress was fantastic and Jimmy Kimmel (no joke) was seated within chip throwing distance. It was a little pricey, but worth it for a great food splurge. I'll be back as soon as my piggy bank recovers!
