I love absolutely everything about this bar. The ambiance, music & drinks are perfect. It has a totally different feel from any other Chicago bar I have ever been to. It's great for a romantic date or just having relaxing drinks with a group of friends. The only thing I would say is get there early or go on a week night because the line gets long & it doesn't move.
