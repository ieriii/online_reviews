I was in town on business and FOGO DE CHAO is by far the BEST Brazilian Steakhouse I've been too. I've been to Brazilians Steakhouses in San Diego and Las Vegas...but none of them compare to FDC. Not only was the food great, but the service was exceptional! The service staff was constantly checking on us, whether they were refilling our drinks, replacing our dirty plates with clean ones, or bringing us "refills" on the cheesebread, garlic mashed potatoes, crispy polenta, or plantain bananas. The cheesebread was always warm - I honestly wanted to bring some home!!! Other things we especially liked - bottom sirloin (skirt steak), filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the lamb chops. I'm from San Diego and realized that visiting the FDC in Beverly Hills will be worth the trip =).
