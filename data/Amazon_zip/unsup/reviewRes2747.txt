This is one of the very special place. I went here for dinner with my best friend to celebrate her acceptance to Med school at UIC. This place is upscale downtown resturant with great sense of richness in flavor, taste and ambiance. I really like the theramasu here. Honestly I liked all the dishes I ate here. It feels like its systematically designed restaurant since every details has taken into consideration like we were given enough time for making choice, the suggestions by server was really helpful, the light music. I think this place has very special because after dinner we went to just walk in downtown and it was cold and we still do some dancing on way back to car it was sooo much fun.. The only problem with such places is to get reservation. I was flying to chicago and my schedule was very tentive so can not visit this place again. But I will visit it again. Also they are very limited in veg choices. And parking as you all know is big time in Chicago downtown..  Also places like these are really very very expensive.
