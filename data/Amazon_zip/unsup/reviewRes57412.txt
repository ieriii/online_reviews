It was between the Mayan Palace and Tango Sur, I have never been to Tango Sur, but having picked the Mayan Palace did not leave me wishing I had picked otherwise. I usually frequent El Mariachi on the corner of Broadway and Sheridan, and the Mayan Palace was on par, if not better. The place is a bit cozy but even on a Friday night, it was not a bad wait to get a table.Upon being seated, they started us with the standard chips and salsa. We ordered a couple margaritas, one banana and one pineapple, to try something different, we then moved to a pitcher of regular blended margaritas. All were great!For food we started with guacamole, although it was good, the limited space in the joint must prevent them from preparing the guacamole tableside. Entrees I can recall being ordered were the diablo skirt steak and a steak burrito. Both were good, but I think I would explore their many other options next time.All in all, I give the Mayan Palace a 4 out of 5, a 5 being for an experience where I could not think of any room for improvement. I could not imagine anyone being disappointed with the Mayan Palace experience.
