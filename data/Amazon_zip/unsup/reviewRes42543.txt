Easily one of my favorite places to grab food in the city. The pizza is always good (sometimes a little soggy though) but the chicken is the star. That sauce they douse it with is pure deliciousness and the charred pita is the perfect way to soak up all the chickeny goodness at the end.Rice and beans are tasty too. The price is right on point for the amount of food you get and the dude who owns the place is a friendly guy.
