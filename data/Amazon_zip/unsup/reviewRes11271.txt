I love thin crust pizza, and I hate the stuffed slop that people adore in Chicago. So for the thin crust alone I love Piece. Then add to that a good selection of gourmet toppings, and the 8 or so different homebrews always on tap. Piece beer is award-winning! They rotate often, so you can sample a lot of different beers. It wasn't until my last visit that I saw they also have other brands of beer, such as Three Floyds, but don't bother. My favorite is the Worryin' Ale. But be careful if you want to get a pizza with different toppings on each half. Prices are per topping, regardless half or whole pizza, and are pricier for more "premium" toppings. Not a big deal really, but I got goat cheese once, the most expensive topping they have, and had it only put on half, which wasn't worth it.
