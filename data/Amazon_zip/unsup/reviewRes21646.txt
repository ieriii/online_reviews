I finally made it to Xoco and I have to say that the experience was underwhelming. Sure, the jamon torta was tasty, but it was overpriced for what it was and the confusion about ordering and being seated was kind of irritating. Also, I had to wait almost 20 minutes for the room-temperature-by-the-time-it-got-to-me torta. If I go again, I'll order takeout.
