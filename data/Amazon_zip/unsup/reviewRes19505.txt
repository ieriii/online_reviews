Sweet Jesus, I have never wanted to cry tears of joy while eating a sandwich. AMAZING. For our 5 year anniversary lunch, my future wifey and I decided to treat ourselves to Mr. Bayless' newest creation.  When we turned the corner, we were pleasantly surprised that the line wasn't out the door, but that didn't mean that there wasn't a line. We waited in line for about 30 minutes or so to order our food. The entire time, a hostess was giving us an update on how much longer it should be until we could order. Outstanding. I thought the looks on people's faces that they had to sit at a table where others were sitting was hilarious. God forbid any of us have to sit next to someone we don't know! The horror! The seating was limited and cramped, but I don't think I noticed sitting very close to a stranger, nor did I hear anything the strangers were talking about as my food (and Lindsay) was far more interesting and wonderful than sitting close! I ordered the Milanesa, and wifey got one of the veggie sandwiches. We grabbed a Bohemia, some chips and guacamole, and chowed down. Every last bit was just incredible. I want to try everything on the menu, so we will be back!! Maybe next time, I can rub elbows with Rick.....
