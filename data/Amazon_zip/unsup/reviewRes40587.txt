I finally dragged my lazy arse down to Longman and Eagle last night after moving to Logan Square in May, and despite the bitter cold, all in all, the place was definitely worth it. Of course, by the time we popped in around 9:30 on a Saturday night, the wait to get a table was an hour and a half, but we were content to cram into our corner of the bar to sip on some tasty cocktails. Their bourbon and whiskey selection is, of course, mind-blowingly extensive, and though I abstained this night, I dare say it might be worth a sipple at my next visit. We were there more for drinking than for dinner, but a few Harvest Sidecars in and a little food seemed fitting. As a group we sampled from the small plates menu: frog legs, veal sweetbread, and meatballs in creamy polenta were had and I don't think anybody was disappointed in the slightest. Those meatballs alone will be the death of me. I thought pricing was fair, and it was actually less than I was anticipating for our cocktails and small plates. Best of all, even though the house was packed, the busy bartenders were incredibly attentive, perfectly friendly, and in pleasant moods, which is always an unexpected delight. I'll definitely be back, prepared to eat my weight in those meatballs.
