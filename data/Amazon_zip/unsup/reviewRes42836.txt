I ordered the think crust pizza, and thought it was Horrible. Pizza Crust was uncooked, and felt the quality of the cheese was poor.  My top favorite thin crust is PATS in LINCOLN PARK not the one in south loop. I am a pizza connoisseur, and believe me I know good thin crust pizza. The extra star is for the staff, very friendly, and clean place.
