Good food at great prices. We got the chicken shawerma, falafel, and kofta sandwiches along with some veggies from the salad bar and two drinks. All for $20. Wow! The food was pretty good. Service was slow because of the people standing in front of me who took forever to place an order. To the couple with a little child sitting outside: what planet do you come from? Why would you tear up your pita in to little pieces and put them on the chair for birds? If you are compassionate for the birds, get a bird house on your property. Other people, like us, who are sitting outside have to deal with birds flying all over us because of your stupid acts.
