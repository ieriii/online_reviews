This is a great restaurant, my wife suggested we go here after attending a concert at the Aragon. The manager was incredibly friendly and accomodating. Nice selection of food and a variety of local and international beers (although the castel beer on the menu is advertised as South African it is NOT the famous Castle Lager and is in fact an Ethiopian brew). Highly recommended!
