Here is exactly what I would like to get at Artopolis: jabonopita - a delicious little filo pie stuffed with ham, herbs/spices and cheese frappe - iced blended nescafe with milk and sugar They also have great sandwiches made with amazing bread (that they sell separately), good salads and yummy desserts (especially loukoumathes). Writing all these reviews for Chicago restaurants is making me ache inside... Why don't I live there anymore?!
