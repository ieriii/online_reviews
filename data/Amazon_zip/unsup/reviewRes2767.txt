Wow! We came here to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary last night. We had the grand tasting option at the Chef's table. The experience and the food were first class. The timing of the entrees was perfect down to a second. We were never without something in front of us, even if it was only getting a refill on the wine or extra bread.  The Chef's table comes with a private valet who catered to our every whim. Prior to the dinner, we received a full tour of the restaurant, met most of the staff, and we were even given a brief history of the stemware and china used. The Chef and Pastry Chef introduced themselves and chatted with us. Tru really made us feel like royalty. The service really is exceptional! The meal takes about 4 hours from start to finish. You even get a keepsake at the end! The Valet took our picture when we first came in, and then we received a keepsake menu with our names and picture on it. Looking at the list of food, we were astonished at how much we ate! Be very prepared to leave very very satiated.
