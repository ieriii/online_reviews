Was there on their first Saturday. They had some of the opening issues that many have already referenced. For us, my meal came out much earlier than my wife's. But they gave us a free drink or two to make up for the snafu and was greatly appreciated. Will be interesting to see if the opening crowds stick with the place or they'll wait 2-3 months before coming back.  As much as I want to see the place thrive, I've got some concerns. Think their desire for higher end fare could backfire as the higher prices may not work for the location. Also, some of the space design seems awkward. There's like a bullpen, an open area without seats or tables, for guests waiting for tables. And a few booths in the back seem to not have tables. Those are all areas of lost revenue. As someone else said, not a lot of room for a few people who just want to have a couple of beers.  Will be back but hoping that this place can make it until then.
