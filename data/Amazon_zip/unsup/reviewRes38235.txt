Pretty great spot and I was surprised how crowded the place got. I was also surprised how big it actually was as it's not really apparent from the outside. Definitely try the mussels if you can handle shellfish. Good beer selection, but I'm not from the neighborhood so I can't say it stood out enough to make me come back. If you're strickly looking for a bar anywhere in the city with a killer beer selection, check out The Map Room.
