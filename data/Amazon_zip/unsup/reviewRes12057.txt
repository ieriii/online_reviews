I can't believe I have waited this long to review Cafe 28. I have been eating here since it opened 15 years ago. Last night I ate here out on the patio what a wonderful dinner. The food is always top notch the service impeccable and the ambiance great. Pork Chops (my Mother's go to dish) are out of this world. Scallops are one of my favorites. Always try one of the specials. They are not afraid to put a little heat on a dish. I will be back soon.
