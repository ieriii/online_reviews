I came for a vacation in the city and let me tell you wonderful place to stay at kimpton really trains there staff to go above and beyond the call of duty check in smooth and the front desk agent made us feel very welcomed she informed us that we missed there wine happy hour so she gave us passes to have wine at one of the two bars awesome. I also received a $10 credit for the mini bar for signing up to there email program winning(lol). I recommend the Hotel Allegro to all my yelp friends.
