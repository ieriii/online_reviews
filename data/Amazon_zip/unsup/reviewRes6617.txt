What I love about this place is the creativity. While I didnt love all the dishes (pork belly was just a slab of meat and not tender) I appreciate the thoughts that went into most of the dishes. Its been a long time since I've been here and I want to go back to try out some more dishes. But overall, I really like this place. The decor and environment are also very charming.
