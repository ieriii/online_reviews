Um, what can I say? I loved it! Ate here last month while in town for work. My aunt was very excited about trying this place. Ordered the Pork Belly Vermicelli Caldo and was impressed at how large the portion was! I could not eat it all but I think it's because I made a separate meal of just guac and chips. I should have just stopped there it was so good, fresh and homemade. The soup had a nice portion of meat and vegetables and wasn't too spicy. I also tried the housemade Aztec Hot Chocolate. The spices make for a nice flavor and the chocolate was so smooth! My only beef about the place is that the seating is limited; we were sat behind the restroom at the "bar" on stools. Not my favorite type of seating to eat. Not too much space for the bussers to get around, my bag kept getting knocked off the back of the chair. I cannot wait to try another dish!
