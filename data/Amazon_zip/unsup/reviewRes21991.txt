All I had was a burrito delivered to me while I was in town visiting and now I consider myself a changed man. My food arrived rather quickly, probably around 20 minutes and didn't skimp on anything. My burrito was almost overflowing with ingredients which tasted new and fresh, not microwaved. My taste buds and stomach were happy as I sent myself into a food coma. If you're in the area, I recommend this restaurant. I can't wait to come back and visit.
