After reading all the reviews on here, I decided to order Crisp to go for myself and the boyfriend. We ordered a half chicken of the Seoul Sassy, a half chicken of the Crisp BBQ, and a small buddha bowl with beef. The wings were just as amazing as everyone has said. My favorite was the Seoul Sassy. I didn't realize that a half chicken order was literally a half of a chicken. (I thought it was half an order of wings...guess I should read the menu more clearly next time!) So I definitely will be ordering just the wings next time. But the flavors were definitely delicious! I also enjoyed the small buddha bowl. I looove the bean sprouts that are included in the bowl. They're my favorite thing to eat at Korean restaurants. The beef had a delicious flavor as well. Although this isn't exactly truly authentic Korean food, it definitely still works if I have a craving for Korean food and don't want to go too far from home.
