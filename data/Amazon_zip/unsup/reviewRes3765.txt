All around a great place. The location is a little small, and they're closed on Mondays, and it seems like half the city is sometimes, but they're food more than makes up for any slight inconvenience this might cause. I've had the Wings and the Strips, both with the Seoul Sassy sauce (dumb name, great taste). The Wings were definitely better than the strips. The skin was able to hold in more of the flavor, but for those who don't like to fight with their food, I certainly understand getting the strips. I also rock a side of brown rice, which rounds out the flavor nicely.
