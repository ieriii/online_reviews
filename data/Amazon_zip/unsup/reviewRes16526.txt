Before ever stepping foot in Carnivale, I was very skeptical about the place considering its dinner prices. First let me set up the scene: I was there with a group of 14+ friends for a birthday dinner. We first talked in the large lobby/bar area as we finished off a few drinks. The beers were a bit pricey, but the bartender was very nice and there was plenty of room in the area to mingle. Next, we were all seated at one large table. We were first told that they would not be able to accommodate our request of one table for the entire party, but they made it happen, so that was a pleasant surprise. Appetizers were eventually ordered and served. Personally, I only had the guacamole. I'm not a huge guac fan, but it was good... not sure if it was worth the $13 we ended up paying for it though. Finally, we we got to the dinner. I originally didn't want to pay all that much, but some how I ended up ordering one of the most expensive dishes on the menu (apparently I have no self-control - the steaks were just too tempting). I choose the Churrasco - a Nicaraguan style wood grilled beef tenderloin topped with chimichurri and a beet salsa all atop a goat cheese puree. At $32, I had high hopes for this dish... and it exceeded them. My plate was completely clean by the time our waitress removed it from the table. Everything on that plate was delicious. And really, that's all I wanted out of my Carnivale experience. Mission accomplished.
