I loved (past tense) this place. Not now. The breakfast berries were old and wrinkled. The stuffed french toast tasted like bad fruit cheese compote. And when we - I took a visiting friend from DC - spoke to the owner, he was rude and not at all the professional his mother Nana is. I'm looking for soomething else. You should too.
