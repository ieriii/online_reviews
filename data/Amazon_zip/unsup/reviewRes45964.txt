I adore this restaurant and hadn't been in a couple of years. Was shopping in the area so decided to go in for dinner last night. I forgot how nice the decor is, everything is huge and extravagant looking, very lovely, but lights could be un-dimmed a bit, it's nice to be able to see your date, and your food! Also the floor in the dining area is super slippery... so watch your step! Our waitress was great, very friendly and sweet. She did stalk our table a bit, walking by and smiling at us constantly and checking in to make sure everything was alright. I do prefer that to a server who disappears for 20 minutes at a time, but it was a bit over the top. She was very accomodating though which was nice. I ordered a glass of reisling which was delicious, and my date and I split 2 appetizers - the crispy duck triangles and the ahi cevice, both were really good. My date decided the duck triangles were his new fave appetizer in Chicago - they were really tasty! For a main entree I ordered the Manhatten salad, with jumbo shrimp and chicken. I was a bit disappointed with it. The salad said it had potatoes, beans, beets and lots of veggies. I'll take their word for it since I could barely see any of this - they were chopped up into teeny tiny pieces! I prefer chunks that I can actually taste rather than food I have work at keeping on my fork. Would not order that again. My date got the miso salmon which was fantastic. The portions are huge and the menu is really extensive. We didn't get dessert this time, but I've had the carrot cake and it is basically heaven. Prices are low, vibe is fun, great place. :-)
