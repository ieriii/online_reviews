BYOB! BYOB! BYOB! BYOB! We of course assumed there would be a liquor store next door or right down the street. Really, there is no liquor store close by to purchase alcohol. So make sure you come with a bottle. We got lucky because they had a few bottles of beer and wine left in the back from customers that couldn't drink all the booze they brought, so guess what? We got those bottles! Otherwise you can pay them to make a booze run for you. Let me first say YUMMY! We started with the dumplings which I thought were fantastic! Now my actual entree was Coconut and Mango Beef - and it came IN A PINEAPPLE! It was AWESOME! The presentation alone won me over! I got a ton of food (which I could hardly finish) but I LOVED it! There were a lot of delish things on the menu (such as the pumpkin shrimp, Ginger Mahi-Mahi , and the ribs). Next time I'll try something new, but I gotta say, for a first timer, you can't go wrong with the entree served in a pineapple! How awesome is that!?
