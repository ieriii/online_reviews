A fun place to go and great place to bring visitors for a nostalgic and unique fast food joint. This trip I had the polish sausage with special sauce (a mild bbq, lightly applied) and grilled onions. It was great. I'm luke warm on the superdog hot dog itself-not a fan of the pickled green tomatoes, but I love the char grilled polish sausage. The burgers are very good too.
