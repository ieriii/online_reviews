Best pork of my life! This place has an incredibly fun and diverse wine list, with some some obscure varietals from France and Spain to Greece and beyond! Amazing service at the bar (which is where we decided to dine.) A wonderful opportunity to people watch, as well. I would suggest budgeting AT LEAST two hours to include wait time. Chorizo stuffed fried olives are proof of a higher power that loves us, and wants us to be flabby. Cheese and meat sampler plates are a must.
