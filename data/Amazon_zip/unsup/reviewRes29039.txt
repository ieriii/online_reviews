I had a hankering for a pizzeria with a pan pizza with caramelized cheese all the way to the edges of the pan, fresh toppings, a great beer list and a friendly atmosphere. I had heard of Pequod's and their infamous pizza so I made the trek down to Webster Ave. to indulge. I ordered a Belgium-style beer and they informed my that I get a free pint glass with it that evening. Nice. I don't remember the beer (I think from Goose Island or New Belgium) but it was cold and refreshing. After 2 or 3 (probably 4) pints of beer the pizza arrived, (pan pizzas always take between 20-30 minutes no matter where you). The whiff of the pizza as it was laid down in front of me was magical. Caramelized cheese, browned and crispy crust, toppings arranged perfectly and the server even dished out the first slice on my plate too. I also forgot to mention that the people watching in Pequod's, although small and cozy, can be quite interesting and fun too. Cold Beer, Caramelized Pizza, Great Servers and An Inviting Atmosphere, Pequod's is a great Chicago Pizzeria.
