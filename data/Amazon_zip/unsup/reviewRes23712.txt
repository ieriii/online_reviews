The one thing I always forget about this place is that it is cash only. I think I forget because I am just so excited to get some deliscious patacones or a refreshing palmito salad with hearts of palm and radishes.. I also enjoy the costa rican sandwich. Take out, dine in or delivery to most of the city. There is no where else that delivers both to my home and work.
