Been here twice. The first time, it blew my mind--or maybe it was the several caipirinhas I downed during dinner. A fan of meat, I am in fully in favor of frequent table visits by gauchos bearing spits of searing-hot animal flesh. The salad bar looked rather well-appointed--but a passing glance on the way to the ladies' room was the closest I got. Service was also excellent. Our rather large group was seated fairly quickly, cocktails were in constant supply, and we didn't wait long for meats of our choice to sail by and deposit servings at our table. Second time, I was disappointed. This go-round, I spent more time at the salad bar, as the quality of the meat was just not quite what I remembered. My selections were all lukewarm and not fresh-tasting, and the gauchos definitely could have used a little pep in their step. The salad offerings tasted as good as they looked, though, and I am a sucker for plantains (though I think these are actually just roasted regular bananas--but I'll take them). Would I go again? Maybe (if someone else was picking up the check!), but with so many other great spots around, I could easily pass it up.
