The place it is under construction ( see the unfinished bar in the first room ) and when you see the people smoking at the tables in an empty restaurant with no servers , where the strange owner it's the bartender , the server and the bussboy you don't know if the place it is open for business anymore. You can find so many restaurants in Chicago better than this but not so many worst then this one.
