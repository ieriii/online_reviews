5 Star Deep Dish! We've had it delivered in a timely fashion. We've picked it up ourselves at the time they promised it would be ready. We've placed our order and waited eternity for a mouth-watering pie to be handed to us in a cardboard box in the shop. It has always been absolutely amazing, and comparatively inexpensive. The crust isn't as buttery at Gino's, which makes the boyfriend happy. It doesn't taste like it came out of a can, which makes me happy. They even allow 1/2 and 1/2 deep dish pizza, which makes us both happy! And they give you some free pop when you order a deep dish pizza? Even better! Every time my boyfriend visited me while I was living in Chicago, we ordered this at least once. Yes... I AM NOT ASHAMED. Totally worth it! Note: I cannot comment on any sides or In-Restaurant dining experiences. We only ever ordered pizzas. Also, I miss this place so much! Denver is a deep dish desert.
