I was here for the opening party and they definitely did a great job at picking a spot. There is a ton of space with it being far from maxed out. There's not much I can say now that I haven't said before about rev. This was a fun party and I'm trying not to let that factor into this. I will say that the brewery does make things exciting for Rev now. It'll be interesting coming back here when there isn't a ton of people, but the tap room area set up is real good and should be great when it's fully finished.
