This is the best Chinese food I've ever had (never been to China, sadly). Their Ma Po tofu is one of my top 10 favorite dishes ever. The garlic peapod leaves are delicious- kind of a cross between peapods and bean sprouts. Try them if you haven't. I've had many other dishes here, and they've all been fantastic. You don't *always* have to wait for ridiculous amounts of time like at some other popular restaurants, but be warned that if you come during peak hours on a Friday or Saturday there will most likely be a 45-min wait. There's nowhere to wait inside the restaurant, so be prepared to put your name down and then amble around Chinatown for a while. It's well worth it to eat at Lao.
