Colorful, exciting, tasty. Probably the best caipirinhas in town, and mojitos too for that matter. Service is a little slow. The location is HUGE which takes away from any warm feeling the vibrantly colored walls give off. Their food is authentic and prices are a little high. Great for a group of people. I wouldn't go on a date there.
