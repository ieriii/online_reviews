Located in Bucktown, its one of the best BYOB places I've been to (so far) in Chicago. Every Saturday, they hold an "underground" event--an invite only 5 course tasting menu (menu attached below). I got there a bit earlier than my friends and decided to pick up a bottle of wine. The server quickly gave me directions to the nearest store with their recommendation. (tip: skip the 7-11 and go to the Food Smart). As Ask the server, they know what pairs with the dishes of the evening. Shin, the chef, first amused us with foie gras with a blueberry sauce. It's a big deal for Chicago who recently made foie gras legal after a prohibition stint. The chef had just returned from an "eating tour" in Japan so a lot of the meal was Asian-inspired. I loved the Fennel and Edamame salad--delicate and crunchy--great for a warm summer night. The course climaxed with a a couple juicy Kobe Beef cubes that melted in my mouth. Next time I go, I'm going to try to catch the early seating and sit in their back patio. Tips:  * The place only serves 20 or so seats, so make sure you make your reservation.  * On Sundays, the five- and seven-course tasting menus are discounted.
