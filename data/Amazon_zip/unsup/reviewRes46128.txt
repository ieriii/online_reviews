I know this is a chain restaurant, but i like that it's big, easy to get a table (even if it looks crowded downstairs), nice atmosphere, view & good food. not too far from Navy Pier. i would take my out of town guests here. Opens at 10am on Sats. Recently came here for BRUNCH.. What to order:  Brioche French toast (so yummy) Deluxe breakfast sandwich(my favorite!) pastrami ham and eggs (man's breakfast) Beignets Drink: hawaiian cooler smoothie was refreshing! HUGE food portions, good for sharing.
