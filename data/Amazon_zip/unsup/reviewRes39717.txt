On a recent trip to Chicago, my husband and I stopped by Longman and Eagle for early evening drinks and apps before dinner elsewhere. We were impressed with the cool space, interesting craft beers, and thoughtful menu. (Slightly distracted staff, but other than that, all was good.) We had local brews and the steak tartare. Very impressive. We look forward to returning to Chicago and coming for a full meal.
