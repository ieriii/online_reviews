I once went here twice in one weekend (for dinner and then brunch). That is how good it is! I've been in small groups/large groups, on weeknights/weekends, mornings/evenings and I'm fairly certain I've covered all four seasons. Cafe 28 never disappoints! The indoor ambiance is great for all occasions and in the summer there is an adorable patio out back.  For brunch I'm partial to the Southwestern Eggs Benedict or the Ropa Vieja Sandwich if you are leaning more towards a lunch option. I've had a variety of things off the dinner menu and they are all totally and completely satisfying - Ropa Vieja, Honey Jalapeo Pork Chops and Pistachio Crusted Chicken are some of my faves. For a dinner appetizer, the Papas Rellenas are a must! And, I would be doing everyone a disservice if I failed to mention the mojitos - get at least one!
