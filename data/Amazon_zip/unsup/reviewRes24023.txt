I am way on the plus side of the reviews for this place with four stars for the Andersonville Icosium after tonight's dinner. We went with a big group of 12 people - not necessarily a big group for a lot of restaurants - but Icosium Kafe is tiny. We were well taken care of with attentive service - could have been faster with the water refills - but we were definitely taking advantage of the BYO with ample beer and wine. What's not to love about BYO places!? The food was excellent. I added merguez (sausage) to my Marrakech crepe which bumped up the price from $8.50 (w/o meat) to $11.50 with the sausage. That's not necessarily cheap for a crepe, but it's definitely a meal. And, the soup that comes with all of the savory crepes was outstanding. I would like a little more presentation, maybe some fresh veggies with the crepe, but the sprinkled almonds were nice for a bit more crunch and flavor. We sampled from the dessert (sweet) crepes: banana nutella and vanilla ice cream, raspberry crepe, and limone (lemon) - all excellent and all come with ice cream. As for the concerns over the behaviour of the owner relayed in other reviews - we missed all that - no "owner" as far as we could identify.
