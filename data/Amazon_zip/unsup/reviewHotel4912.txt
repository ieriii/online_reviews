Not very impressed...The rooms are extremely tiny and poorly designed. Couldn't open the closet all the way because the TV stand was in the way. The bathroom was super small and did not have a built in fan. The entire place had a upscale/elegant look to it (which I understand due to its age), but with closer inspection the construction was poor. The trim and paint was chipping and uneven, the carpeting and wallpaper was old and needed updating. The walls were very thin and you could hear EVERYTHING going on in the rooms next to you and in the hallway. The worst part of the stay was the service of the staff, which wasn't bad but I expected a lot more from this supposedly high end Chicago hotel. The staff wasn't rude or anything but seemed to have no emotions at all. A smile and hello goes a long way. A positive was the lake view my room had, facing Lake Michigan. Usually when I stay downtown the room is facing a brick wall or another window.
