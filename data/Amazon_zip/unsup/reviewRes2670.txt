i've been pretty lucky the handful of times i've gone to this place i was in and out pretty fast. it's been about 3 years since i've been there. but reading some of these reviews, i feel enraged that these fools actually waited more than one hour, or two and i read one fool waited 3 hours! that's just insane! i am not one to wait, wait, and wait outside in the elements for a bloody hot dog. i mean that is just ridiculous! one order taker (doug) and 3-4 people making sausage sandwiches. please figure out a way to move along your patrons! how rude and deeply sadistic doug must be to make y'all wait.
