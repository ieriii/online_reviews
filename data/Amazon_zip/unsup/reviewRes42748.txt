If Sunderya shouts "Finger licking good!", then it is that good and very affordable (believe me she's the original pizza monster). Whenever I want to treat her I buy the large deep dish for carry out. Their pizza has become such regular entity in my monthly diet, like bread and milk we buy at our local market, that I did not even bother to write my fancy review about it. I never tried anything except their pizza, but why should I, when the pizza is all just finger looking good.
