The last stop on the Restaurant Week 2010 tour was a last-minute decision to stop at the Gage on our way back from Michigan. The mrs. had checked them out on Tuesday and was impressed, so I figured what the hell. She said they had fine pork, and that's enough to make me stop the car. Very efficient front of house service. We were seated quickly and without any issues. Very pleasant staff and a relaxed vibe in the place. Throughout the meal the waiter kept our drinks refilled and checked in on us at appropriate intervals. For first course we both went with the Black Bean soup. It was good, not great. I don't know if it was due to being the last day of RW or what, but I didn't really find much if any of the duck confit mentioned on the menu in the soup. But the soup was good enough that I wasn't particularly upset. For second course I went with the Grilled Duroc Pork Chop and she had the Baked Semolina Dumpling. These were both very good. The pork was tender, flavorful, with the sauce giving it just a little extra boost on the bottom end. Her dumpling with the fontina and and nutmeg filling was light yet significant.  For dessert we had the cheesecake stuffed donuts with coffee anglaise. A fun dessert, not too heavy so that you want to go and fall asleep right in the middle of the Millennium Park ice rink, but filling enough so you don't feel like you have just eaten a big bowl of air.  Obviously it is hard to gauge a place based on something like this unless there are either notable highs or lows in the experience. Whereas this was just good. I would definitely be interested in coming back here in the future when downtown, and the brunch selections seemed interesting. Definitely worth popping into if you're back from admiring The Bean.
