First off, it's pricey, but don't know of any fondue place that isn't. My BF and I got a recommendation for this place when we were being tourists on the "Mag Mile". I love this place. It's below street level and it's dark with lots of dark wood and classical spanish guitar playing. Kind of romantic. We both ordered from the premier menu, almost all of which runs about $50/person. But we were tourists after all, we wanted to splurge. We order from the deluxe menus that also include cheese fondue appetizers. We then ordered the deluxe seafood and a chicken with more seafood. One note, I would not order the deluxe vegetable dinner as our dinners came with plenty of vegetables. They also offer 9 different sauces to dip all your gooey goodness into. YUMMY IN OUR TUMMIES!!! After all this, we somehow still ordered the flaming chocolate fondue dessert. It had fruit, pound cake, and marshmallows. I don't know that we really had the room, but we made room. OMG!!!! But I think we were also there for 3 hours. Definitely not cheap at $50 per person for dinner and another almost $25 for dessrt (for two) But when back in Chicago I would make time to come back. Plus we showed up a little early for our reservation which gave us a chance to walk around the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Some really cool architecture around there.
