OPEN LATE NIGHT!! this is a big plus and the food is quick and tasty and no BS. I will definately go back. Has a true korean feel. And very private as you can sit at a table and they have it sectioned off so it feels like you have a private booth, where no one else can see you. Feels like a bit of asia in chicago.
