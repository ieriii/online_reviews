What can be said about Hopleaf that hasn't been covered in the previous 82 reviews? I can say this: you know when you go to a bar, and you're hanging out with a good friend, the bar is a little crowded and kinda smoky...you look across the room and your heart stops, you can't believe what you are seeing...you turn to your friend and say: I WANT THAT. Well, that's how I met my boyfriend at The Hidden Cove. But that's another story for another time. The point is, that's also how I found my favorite beer: Tripel Karmelite. And I found it at Hopleaf, so I will always love Hopleaf, crowded, slow-serviced, wonderful, smoky, confusing and delicious as it may be. If you are wiling to give it a try (when you have a whole, and I mean whole, evening free) you just might find something you will love for the rest of your life.
