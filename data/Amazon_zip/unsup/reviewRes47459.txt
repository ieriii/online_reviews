Back to my usual of absolutely loving this place...Pj, Sol, Jillian & Michelle rocks...the burgers are amazing (fav Buffalo Bill & the Possession of Shrooms burgers)...I still don't like Linda, as her serving skills nor attitude has changed...I never want to be served by her. But the above lot are amazing folks...request them upon entering my 2nd home. :)
