The good:First, this is a good bar, with an excellent and fair-priced whiskey selection and a decent assortment of not-often-seen beers on draft. Second, all members of the staff, from the door guy to the servers are friendly and helpful. Third, the attention to detail, from the bathrooms to the candle holders is superb. Fourth, the kitchen is open very late - a surprising rarity in Chicago, and the music is played at a reasonable volume.The bad:A restaurant in Logan Square that very few L.S. residents can afford to eat at? I'm willing to pay for good ingredients, and it's fine to have expensive items on the menu, but why not take Lula's cue and offer a sub-$10 sandwich or soup? You really want me to pay $15 for a very small portion of cauliflower and lentils? I'm very protective of our neighborhood, and as a restaurant, Longman & Eagle is not good for Logan Square. As others have mentioned, an awful place to bring a vegetarian, and expect to wait in cramped quarters if you come between 7-10. The lodging is not open yet, but I suspect it will mostly be for out-of-town bands playing at venues booked by the Empty Bottle (same owners as L&E) and young people that don't mind sleeping above a loud bar. Come here with a fat wallet and a small appetite, or come after 11PM and enjoy the excellent bar.
