Partner and I visited on a Friday Groupon in hand. I arrived first so I adjourned to the bar for a cocktail whilst waiting. I thoroughly enjoyed their signature drink, a mojitoesque concoction of rum, cane sugar and muddled mint. Very refreshing and set the tone for dinner. The salad bar is, indeed, a cornucopia of lighter pre-meat fare. I seriously doubt anyone could find it lacking. On to the meat...there's lots of it, when one thinks there's been enough meat for one diner, yet more appears. This goes on for as long as one sits with what looks like an inconspicuous green coaster situated next to the plate. The meat is very good; Partner and I ate chicken, pork, lamb, and beef. While some selections were better than others, none were off putting. I liked their selection of wines by the glass and their regular wine list isn't too shabby either. I do wish I had planned my dining a little and organized my selections a little. I was drinking some white wine with beef and lamb and some red with checken and pork. The service was friendly and very attentive. Texas de Brazil is a gastronomical Disney World. It's dining as entertainment. The Gauchos glide around the room and present their fare in a graceful choreography. The wine cellar attendant is cirque du soleil lite on her flying trapeze in quest of bottle in the several story wine cellar. It won't become a part of our regular dining but it is someplace we'll remember for entertaining family/friends from out of town.
