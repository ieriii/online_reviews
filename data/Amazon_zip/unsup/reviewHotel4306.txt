I booked a room for my mom as a surprise so she could come downtown and enjoy the night not worrying about taking the train home to the suburbs. The Palmer House is old, but the rooms were still very nice. There was a White Sox convention in town which I thought would pose an issue with noise/crowdedness but actually it was no problem at all. I met her at the hotel with my brother and checked out the hotel room. It was a pretty small room (double beds) but the dcor was really nice. I liked the colors and the peacock themed decorations. The paint on the doors was thick which showed its true age but all in all I think the room wasn't bad.  The one issue was the elevators didn't work too well. We had to walk from the pool floor on 7 to their room on 15 using the stairs because we waited and waited for elevators and they never came. My mom and bro enjoyed some time in the hot tub and relaxed. The Palmer House is in a great location - centrally located downtown and near anything you could need in the city.
