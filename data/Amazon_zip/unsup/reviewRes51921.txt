Traveled from LA to Chicago for vacation, after a long day of doing the whole tourist thing my part definitely wanted to chow down. After a short conversation with a horse carriage rider, he GREATLY recommended Gino's East. After a short little walk we were there, great atmosphere, and immediately felt welcomed by the staff as soon as we walked through the door. For the food (and drinks), I had a nice and hefty tasting Jack and Coke, we ordered a supreme deep dish, and the waitress considerately told us about the cooking times, 35 minutes for supposedly life-changing deep dish? I'm in. Now for the moment of truth, food on the table, cheese flowing, aroma filling the air, and salivating mouth anticipating the first bite.. It didn't disappoint. Really tasty, and flavorful.. and enjoyed every bite. If you're in Chicago, definitely try this place out.. they make Chicago live up to their deep dish title.
