This place is great! We ordered six different items off the menu. The pot roast and orecchiette with spicy sausage were my favorites. This restaurant also has a great combination of casual atmosphere with high end food. They have a nice wine and drink selection and the service was impressive. It gets busy during the weekend so you may want to make a reservation.
