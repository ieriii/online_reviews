I've been to here twice now, once for drinks-into-dinner and now for brunch. It was not as crowded as I expected, but that could have been due to the early spring snowstorm... Service from the time you walk is very high. They always make me feel special and prioritized. The menu is not the typical Chicago brunch. I had eggs poached in red wine, with prosciutto.If you've been there for dinner and tried their ham trio, it's the one from Iowa, not the amazing Spanish one. The coffee was very good and non-stop. The only thing I would ding them...towards the end when it was clear to me (I sat facing the door) that they wanted our table to leave. They were not packed and I believe brunch should be savored. Hence the good, not outstanding. Update: Mirrors have been added, but they are in the stalls (!!!) AND there's no light in there. Did anyone think to ask a woman, before installing them?
