Everyone raaaaves about Crisp. Maybe the hype set my expectations too high, because though Crisp is good, I wouldn't drool over it. The fried chicken was quite tasty. I liked the classic flavor the best. The crispiness and fried....ness (?) is just right. But, I must say, I do like the chicken wings from our local Korean market better! They make them fried and then coated in honey and sesame.. and that's all I could think of while eating at Crisp! Crisp chicken is tasty, but it doesn't scream Korean-flavors. We also go the Bad Buddha bi bim bop, which wasn't that good. The veggies were all American veggies, like cucumbers and corn. I kept expecting to have pickled veggies and more seaweed. The thing I really liked about Crisp were the communal seating and stacks of chopsticks & sauces. It's always fun to eat Asian-low-key-restaurant style. Overall, Crisp is pretty good. I think it definitely caters to the American taste buds and eases a newbie's way into a Korean meal. Lastly, it just occurred to me... majority of Koreans are Christians. And the bi bim bops here are called "Buddha Bowls". What is the cultural relationship to Buddhism? Plus, they're served with a bulgogi, chicken or tofu. Now I feel kinda bad having eaten meat affiliated with Buddha -___-
