This place is exceptional, a true Chicago landmark, I had not been in the property for two year - or since the renovation was completed. It has been restored to one of the finest properties in the entire world. The outside remains the same, but when you get into the lobby it is fantastic. Especially when decorated for Christmas. We are using the family picture shot in front of the tree for our card this year, and it was almost non-stop picture taking from everyone who walked by the tree. After we checked in (more on that in a minute) we had to go have a drink in the lobby. The bar is cozy and is in/out of the restaurant, and there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit in the lobby itself. It was awesome just to take in the view and enjoy a drink....we almost stayed for another but had to head out for dinner. With the location of the property (State Street in the theatre district/a block from Millennium Park) this is a MUST STAY while in Chicago. As for the room, the general manager Dean Lane really took care of my family. He put us in the best room I have ever stayed in (The Daley Suite) right on the parade route/State Street, and had a bottle of wine and cookies and milk for the kids in the room. Nicest gesture of the year based on all the nights I have spent in hotel rooms this year. Even without this special treatment I would stay here every time downtown!!!!!
