I've been here a couple times to grab things for dinner parties, etc. I'm just not sure what the hype is all about. For the amount they charge, everything should be great. Some of the cookies/ cupcakes I've had were pretty good. But not great. A few of the treats were either bland or dry. Not good. The bakery is overpriced. I would have given it 2 (maybe 3) stars but... We just ordered a cake for a friend's Birthday party. Birthday person gets what they want. The cake was expensive. It's cake. Not gold. Again, what the birthday person wants...  But - the name on the cake was misspelled! It was spelled correctly on the ticket attached to the box... This tells me a couple things - the person writing the icing did not check the ticket. The person handing over the cake did not check the cake. When we said something, we were told we'd have to talk to the manager (not there)... The customer service received was less than ideal, border line rude, and the initial offer to make us happy was insulting (essentially offered to take sales tax off). Not cool, people, not cool.
