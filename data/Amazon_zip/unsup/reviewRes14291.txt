eh...I thought it was okay. Cuban sandwich was pretty good, not the best. Congri was blegh, but my aunt makes the best I've ever had so I guess it's not a fair comparison. I grew up in Florida and there's a couple places to speak of: Tropical Cafe in West Palm b/c the croquetas are incredible, and the Black Bean Deli in Orlando which is a crazy good sandwich. For that matter, why the hell are two croquetas $2.50!? That's insane! For two and half bucks you should get about 6. I felt ripped off -- they weren't even oversized to make up for the lack of quantity. Ya know, I've been wanting to go to 90 miles for awhile, and I wanted this to be the awesome Cuban place in town. (sigh)...Sadly I am let down. Sorry, 90 Miles, give me more croquetas next time, and I'll bump the rating a star.
