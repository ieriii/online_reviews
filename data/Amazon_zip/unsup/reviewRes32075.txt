First, I have to say that I LOVE Ethiopian food. I lived in East Africa for awhile so I'm also very familiar with high quality Ethiopian food, and Demera definitely has great quality food. They have lots of vegetarian and meat options. We had a group of four so we ordered one vegetarian mesob and one mixed meat and veg. We were able to have 8 of the 9 veg options on the mesob this way (we opted for two orders of shiro b/c that's a must!). All the food was great. The injera (Ethiopian bread) was also really good and nice and sturdy for picking up all the mixes. I have to say as a general note to anyone who has never eaten Ethiopian food before: you will eat with your hands! You use the injera to pick up with various food. Don't ask for utensils -- seriously, just give it a try. It's not that hard. My only reason for giving Demera four stars and not five is that we went for lunch and they didn't have a lunch menu option, which meant the meal was quite expensive. In general, Ethiopian food is quite pricey in big U.S. cities so don't let that stop you from coming here.
