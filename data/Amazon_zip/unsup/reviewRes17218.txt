The most consistently delicious Indian food in the city! I've had spotty experiences on Devon, so when my south Indian in-laws were coming to town, I asked some foodie friends to recommend a nice, clean, family friendly restaurant with good food. India House was the unanimous pick. I'm so glad I trusted their judgement. My in-laws were very impressed by the atmosphere and the food. My mother-in-law likes things very spicy and they made her vegetarian dish according to her specifications. The rest of us are meat eaters and had a variety of chicken and lamb dishes. All were excellent. Definitely a good place to go with people visiting from out of town or for a special occasion.
