There is a lot of hype about Hot Doug's out there and I don't like be led into an opinion by those around me. To negate this public perception I decided to turn my visit into a grueling affair, forcing Doug's to gain my appreciation only by overshadowing a terrible experience getting in. Naturally, Chicago offers this opportunity. I waited for close to an hour and a half outside of Doug's in the atmospheric physics paradox that is a 30 degree rain shower complemented by a steady 40 mph horizontal wind. After entering, I was thoroughly miserable and perfectly primed for discarding the restaurant as "not worth the wait."    The cashier was too friendly and upbeat to possibly understand the state his thawing customers are in when they enter but he assured me I would leave sated, warm, and happy. This man knew his customers as well as Hot Doug's knows encased meats!   I had a Chicago style classic as well as the weekend only duck fat fries and a rattlesnake dog and everything was fantastic! The fully loaded Chicago style was spot on and surprisingly competitively priced (I expect inflated prices at these cult institutions). The chardonnay & jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with chili garlic mayo and smoked gouda had just the right amount of heat and a unique gaminess to make it something truly special and worth the $8 price point. I also tried a bite of a companion's foie gras and duck sausage which was delicious but too rich to eat alone. The only thing that didn't live up to the hype were the duck fat fries. They were great hand-cut fries that stand above most others but didn't have the decadence that I expected.   Thank goodness the weather is changing because although it is totally worth it I still won't look forward to a frigid waiting line...
