just had the spicy falafel sandwich here for the first time in about a year and it is just passable. i think i might agree with the recent reviewer who remembers the falafel being tastier. or maybe it was never that great. when i lived closer i used to eat here more and frequently ordered the lamb shawarma / yellow rice and that was always pretty good. but i must say... hidden gem here is the lentil soup!! they used to stock lychee fruit juice in a can? didn't see it there on last visit. -1 star.
