I had the pleasure to eat at the Ritz-Carlton last Sunday for their annual bridal luncheon and fashion show...it was fabulous to say the least. The service was exceptional, very elegant atmosphere and the food was great. I had saute of rock shrimp served with parmesan gnocchi, yukon gold potato & black truffle emulsion and roasted four story hill famr chicken served with braised kale and cippolini onions, wild mushrooms & red wine chicken jus.
