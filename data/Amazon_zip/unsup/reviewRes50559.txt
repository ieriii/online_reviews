Stumbled upon this place here a few months ago with my family who were in town visiting for New Years. Saturday morning New Year's Day and this joint was hopping but we still managed to get a seat immediately where we had expected at least a 30 minute wait. I had the Shrimp and Grits with Corn Muffin. SPECTACULAR. Moderately indulgent since it has bits of bacon and bacon fat in it, but still reasonable and you don't feel like a fat slob after finishing it. The complimentary Black-eyed peas for New Years was a nice touch. Family had the Crunchy French Toast and the B & G I believe. I sampled both and thought both were good, but I think I would have like to seen more (and bigger) corn flakes on the toast...My mom didn't complain either and she is the biggest food snob you will ever meet. (Congrats to you on that one Wishbone!) Overall great experience, great wait staff, and I have already been back just for the Shrimp & Grits.
