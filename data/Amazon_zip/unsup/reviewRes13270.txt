3.5 Stars- great beers and food, cool ambiance. I'm trying to venture to more neighborhoods, so I spent Saturday night in Logan Square. We arrived at Revolution around 7:30 and the place was packed. First the wait was an hour, then 1 hour and 45 minutes. Luckily, we found a seat at the bar where we ordered drinks and the arugula pizza to share. The beers are very good. I tasted the Bottom up Wit, Gold Cross, and IPA- all were very good. As the wait got longer we ordered more appetizers and beer. We had the warm pretzel. It was awesome and came with the best horseradish mustard. We also ordered the lettuce wraps. They were excellent, full of flavor, and good for you! We spent at least 2 hours at the bar. Our table was ready as we were ready to move on; however, we had a great time eating finger food and drinking at the bar. The menu had many burgers, sandwiches, and salads that sounded delicious.  I can't give 4 stars because service was good but not great. I would definitely like to go back for more food and a chance to sit at a table.
