Simply the best food in a mile radius. My family often needs quick, good, economical food. We always go to Simply IT because we never leave without great food made from the freshest ingredients. The owners are always onsite and extremely friendly. The amount of food you receive for the value is extraordinary and the favors are wonderful. And don't forget a smoothy with Bubble Tea or their ginger tea.
