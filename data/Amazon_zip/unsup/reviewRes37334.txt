Finally made it to Hopleaf last night after hearing great things about it forever. The place was crowded (Sunday, around 5:30) and the nice tattooed/pierced man at the door directed us to the back to put our name in. There was a bit of a wait and I was thrilled to see a spot open at the bar. I randomly chose a beer (Dogfish Head something) and it was delish. We were seated pretty quickly and we knew what we wanted when the waitress came up. I ordered the CB&J, and BF got the mussels. I asked the waitress for a beer suggestion and I was very happy with her choice. We ordered an extra side of the Stilton Mac & Cheese, which they brought out a bit before they brought everything else out...it was very good, but the CB&J was un-flipping-believably good, along with the homeade chips...a very nice combo with the Mac & Cheese. BF enjoyed the mussels, and the frites (with aioli for dipping) were excellent. Service was *relaxed*...our waitress being VERY low-key, but efficient just the same. Overall, it was a great experience and I look forward to returning and trying something else off the menu...so many things look SO good.
