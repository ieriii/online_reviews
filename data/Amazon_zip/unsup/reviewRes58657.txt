I've been to Nana's twice now, the first day they opened and this past Thursday. The first time the service was a little slow but I did understand that it was their first day and they were all feeling a little over-whelmed with the HUGE turn out they had. The wait was a little long but I've waited this long if not longer at most of MY favoriterestaurants!. I tried the pancakes with strawberries and I must say they were deeeelicious! The servings are not huge but I do feel they are just the right size for you to leave satisfied.  I went with a few people so I also got to try a little bit of the crepes with mixed fruit and they were very good, I also tried the home fries....mmmm, they were cooked just right!  Their applewood-smoked bacon was cooked just how I asked...extra crispy, and It was just a perfect side to my delicious pancakes!Unfortunately, I didn't ask my waitress for her name but she made sure that I always had a full cup of that delicious Metropolis coffee along with the yummiest glass of fresh squeezed O.J.When I left that first day I knew I would be back and I did...the service was much better and I just couldn't wait to have another cup of that coffee....very good!This time I tried the chilaquiles and wow, I was pleasantly surprised with how good they were, not your typical breakfast or lunch item but I can't wait to go back and have them again...I think they are my new favorite!So, my first visit would have been 4 stars since I would have taken one away for the small wait but my second visit would have been 6 stars for their delicious coffee, great food, the great service and reasonable prices...so to even it out I give them 5 stars!   5 stars for Nana!
