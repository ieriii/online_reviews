Alliance is my bakery of choice in Chicago for a quick sweet snack or ready-made cakes. The carrot cake and Red Velvet are unmatched, the croissants are unbelievable, and their other assorted cookies and treats have never treated me wrong. Their fondant artist is STELLAR, the custom cakes are beautiful, classic yet modern... anyone needing a wedding cake in Chicago should give these guys a shot. Intelligensia coffee and free wifi are also added bonuses.
