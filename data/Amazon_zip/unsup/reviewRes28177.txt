As my girlfriend said before we even got our entrees, "I'm already giving it five stars." This place was fantastic. Low-key, laid-back. The staff was super-friendly and you get an insane amount of food for a little price. Before we even ordered, the waitress gave us chips with two kinds of salsas, a cup of pickled carrots and jalapeos and cups of chicken soup. The soup was great. The entrees -- especially the mole -- was great. The green salsa she brought to accompany our meals was great. Even the corn tortillas were great. I would make a special trip to Pilsen just to go here. Oh, and did I mention all that food was $20. Yeah. Seriously.
