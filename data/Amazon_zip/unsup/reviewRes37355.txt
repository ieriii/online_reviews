What can I really add to over 200 reviews? From that number alone, you should know to expect to wait for a table if you plan to eat. Or come early, grab a bar stool and enjoy the mind-boggling selection of awesome beer. Lindeman's Framboise on tap, a delicious porter (my fave) and beer hoppy enough to satisfy my husband makes this an excellent place for any beer lover! PS - they have a room upstairs that you can use for private events. The lovely Andy snagged it for one of our book club meetings and it was perfect.
