Ate here twice on 4th of July weekend in 2009.  You can do the "dining experience" on the more formal side of the restaurant or pop in for a quick, informal lunch. We did both. It is one of the more memorable places I've ever eaten. It's an "old-fashioned" seafood house. I enjoyed the decor because having grown up on near the coast, it was familiar to me.  We did the whole "dining experience" in the evening. Our waiter was great. The wine, sherry and port list was amazing. We used it to the fullest and complimented each part of meal with it. Our server was knowledgeable and helped us along the way. I had the Walleye and I will NEVER forget it and have longed for it since. The next day we on the bar side of the restaurant. I had some kind of beer on tap...wish I could remember it because it was one of the best pilsners I've ever had. It complimented the SUPERB crab cake I had for lunch.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and hope your experience is as good as mine were. It is more on the costly side, not a cheap place but the food was well worth the cost.
