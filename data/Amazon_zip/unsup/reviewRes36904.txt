i wish i could separate this into two categories: SUSHI: 4-5 stars. always interesting and delicious, though i've had it in house only, never delivered. great service. THAI FOOD: 1-2 stars. the rama chicken was 2 pieces of broccoli and a pound of chicken covered in pure peanut butter. no flavor. my husband got a curry in which they apparently forgot to chop the ingredients- piece of fatty pot roast the size of your fist and half a potato! we were quite disappointed, especially since the sushi is so good. if we hadn't had it delivered we would have sent it back. *also we had a coupon for free crab rangoon, and what we got were 4 of the tiniest appetizers we've ever seen! if we had known that coupon meant super-small portion we'd have just bought it outright.
