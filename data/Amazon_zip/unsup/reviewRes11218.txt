Overhyped.  The pizza really isn't that great. Forget about the red sauce pizza. It's downright disturbing. Way too sweet and the crust is a weird mix between crunchy (which is good) and rubbery (which is bad). Think hard rubber and you've got this crust. I will give an extra star simply for the fantastic servers, which I repeatedly have gotten. They are extremely friendly and consistently don't miss a beat with refills.
