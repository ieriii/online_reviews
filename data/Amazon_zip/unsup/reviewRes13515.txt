Oh my God I love this place. I'm actually kind of ticked that it got on TV, because now it is even more packed than before, but thankfully they take reservations. Glenn's has quite possibly the biggest, baddest bloody mary I've ever seen. The regular sized bloody is delicious, and in a totally manageable size, but the big guy...the big guy comes with shrimp! Who puts shrimp on a bloody mary? Well, Glenn's does. They have great diner coffee, solid breakfast, and a huge selection of non-seafood items, but the star of the show is the big chalkboard full of fresh catch. If you've a hankering for seafood this should be your jam. Service is always great, and you can get any kind of cereal imaginable at all hours of the day.
