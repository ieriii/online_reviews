Delcious.... I am not a huge sushi person, I mean I like the basic rolls, but I get scared to try other "different" rolls. My friend had her birthday dinner here, and it was amazing, I tried so many different things and loved them all. Also, the fact that it is a byob is amazing, we had a bottle of wine for each of us. The service was great, and the price of the food was the cheapest I have had a in long time. Reservations def a must for a Friday or Saturday, gets super crowded.
