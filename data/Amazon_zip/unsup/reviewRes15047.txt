Sabatino's is to Italian what the old Berghoff's was to German: great food, great service, ambiance out the wazoo. I had a wonderful homemade egg noodle dish with a thick, mushroom-filled sauce which I happily did extra cardio for the next day (had to, I had the leftovers for lunch two hours later). Every entree comes with a soup and salad. The minestrone was quite good, the salad was nothing to write home about. Before all this they served two kinds of bread, both warm from the oven and delicious. If you want good, old-fashioned Italian comfort food, check this place out. Oh and they parked our car for us, for free!
