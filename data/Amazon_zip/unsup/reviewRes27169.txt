I still contend that this is a poor man's Burt's, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially since I am a pizza snob. The key differences between this location and the Morton Grove original are that the inside has been renovated in the last 20 years, the location is in a pretty happening part of town, and it is not located on block from Burt, who is the non Malnati godfather of Chicago Pizza. A combination of these three factors makes this location much more crowded than the original, and the burnt crust great pizza might have something to do with it as well.  It was Friday night and we had a party of 6, so it took about 40 mins to get a table, which is fine, since it gets super crowded. I think they do reservations but require a credit card or something, which makes sense. Dinner is always interesting eating with some people you don't know too well, especially when a couple of them want to order for the whole table. I was fine with it since my dietary needs were taken care of, but when one of them tried to order thin crust, we had to quietly explain what city we were in and things got back to normal. An added plus was one of the people does not eat crust, meaning I got double the burnt goodness!
