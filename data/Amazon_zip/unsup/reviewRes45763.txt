We were trying to decide where to go for a Sunday brunch and really couldn't face a long wait. We decided to try Wilde because it is huge! We were seated immediately in comfy arm chairs by a roaring fire. I had a breakfast sandwich with proper (Irish) bacon, egg and tomato, my friend had the pecan waffle, we also had cocktails. The food was great, the service was super friendly, the only downside was that it was a little pricey.
