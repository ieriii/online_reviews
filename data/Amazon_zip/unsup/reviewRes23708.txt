The interior looks very Mediterranean. They seem to just let the plants grow wild in there. Hanging allover the tables, over my food, in my eye. Took a lot for me not to snap one of the stems off. The table we were sat at wasn't very inviting and needed a good hose down from underneath (it was glass). Benches were kind of uncomfortable too. The waiter we had was nice. Nothing else to be said there. The soup that came with my crepe was pureed mushrooms which tasted like hot bland ass pureed mushrooms, with water. Flavor was not in attendance, very truant indeed. I had a savory crepe that I built myself with chicken, tomatoes, feta cheese, mixed greens, olive tapenade, basil, and a vinaigrette. It was wonderful. Just wonderful I tells ya! Made up for that broth from the Matrix after they take the pill. I shared a dessert crepe with my dining mate. The Crepe Amar with Belgian dark chocolate and strawberries. It was a nice presentation topped with whipped cream and a little umbrella usually reserved for tropical drinks. To my utter disbelief. . .         it wasn't all that great. WTH? I thought that was going to top my meal off with a great bang. It was more like a mild pop. I'd go back for the savory crepes which are very yummy, but refuse the soup and not mess with the dessert crepes. Why waste food
