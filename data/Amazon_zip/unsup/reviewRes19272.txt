I don't like this as much as i want to, I love baylesses show ,i cook his recipes all the time and his other places are great but the menu somehow doesn't reel me in.  the pork torta is my favorite, it has the spiciest salsa ive ever gotten at a restaurant. really good but painfull.  I wish they would serve some tacos though, i would probably go there twice as much for lunch. tortas are not my thing and they take a little too long to make for a fast lunch
