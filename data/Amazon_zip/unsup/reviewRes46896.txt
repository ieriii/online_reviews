I've been here for brunch and then again for dessert. Each time was nothing special but not bad either. As with any place in Chicago the wait for brunch was really long. I think that's exacerbated by the fact that the kitchen takes forever. From the time we ordered it took a little over 45 minutes for us to get our food. The food was good but nothing amazing like M Henry.  The time I was there for dessert was weird. It was a big group of people that trickled in slowly. At first they didn't want to give us a big table (which I understand) but as the group got bigger they decided that we should in fact have the big table. Their dessert selection wasn't too big and there was nothing that I was dying to try. I had gelato in some weird flavors which again was good but nothing amazing.  The decor is nice but a little cramped. If I went again I'd go during off hours to avoid the long wait and tons of people.
