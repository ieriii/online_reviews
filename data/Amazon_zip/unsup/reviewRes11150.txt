So, I have decided to step up my workout regimen. Mainly because of places like the Bongo Room. It is a broken record for me to state AGAIN how much I love breakfast but this place was AWESOME. There is a bit of a wait but it is well worth it. I even ventured out of my pancake comfort zone and had apple pancakes. They were delicious without any type of topping.  So, head to the Bongo Room you will not be disappointed.
