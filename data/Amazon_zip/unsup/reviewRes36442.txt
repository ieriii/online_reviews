My new favorite restaurant. Dear God, it's good. Their Crab Rangoon is unbelievable. Perfect every time!!!! The first few times I went here, I got their sushi. So fresh, So Good. I finally tried their Thai food only because my friend got their red chicken curry. And then I was at a loss for words. Basically, you can't go wrong here. It's all so good, it makes me want to weep. Weep madly and laugh wildly all at the same time. Too bad they don't serve crazy pills.
