The food was good. We got tortas and the bread was so crusty it cut my mouth pretty badly.  Also, there was a bone in mine. I mentioned it to my husband and he said, "Chickens have bones." Yes, yes they do. But my sandwich should not. Flavors were good, but not particularly inspirational or anything.
