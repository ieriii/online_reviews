Came here because i heard there was a separate vegan menu. Got there and instantly loved the place. Saw the vegan menu and was a little skeptical because it appeared to just be sides and salads from the regular menu. I was very pleasantly surprised when I got my dishes- the food was incredible and my friend's non-vegan food was the same. I have never had such amazingly flavored brussels sprouts in my life! I would definitely go back and recommend it to any diner- vegan or not. I also loved the ambiance and the open kitchen layout- such a good find!
