To be perfectly honest, I've only had 2 menu items here, depending on whether I've dropped in for breakfast or lunch. But I've devoured each of those items 4 times, so if you've arrived at the correct deduction, yes, Meli Cafe is just incredible. Favorites: Coffee by Lavazza: delicious, piping hot and served in real mugs. Love that. Stuffed Strawberry French Toast: Two slices of honey-sweetened Challah bread dipped in vanilla bean custard and stuffed with sweet Mascarpone cheese and fresh strawberries. Um, ridiculous. Chipotle Chicken Wrap: Grilled chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, and Pepper Jack cheese tossed in chipotle dressing and served in a thin flat bread. Huge, so you can save half for dinner. Also, this cute cafe squeezes out a wide array of juice (try the Mango, Orange, Kiwi with honey). I haven't tried the smoothies but by the looks of the menu, they've conceived some creative combinations.
