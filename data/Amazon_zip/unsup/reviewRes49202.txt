This bakery in our neighbohood has fantastic lattes and even better blueberry scones - huge compared to other local bake shops, with lots of powdered sugar. Our dog loves the homemade treats, but then again, she doesn't have the most discriminating palette. Wifi in their attached cafe can be slow at times, but it's a quiet cozy corner. This is a regular stop on the Sunday-morning circuit.
