Hot pot/huo guo is on hand on the weekdays. Chilies pepper most szechuan dishes here. An extensive menu that is hard to narrow down favorites. The spicy lettuce marinated in chili oil and sesame seeds is complimentary and gets a big thumbs up. The cumin lamb or pork ribs are great and the seafood crab or lobster awesome. If you're adventurous - try the jellyfish. Tastes like firm jello/cartilage. Avoid the typical Chinese standards ---although prepared well- and opt for something different. I have not been disappointed. Usually they will tell you what other diners are eating if you inquire.
