I dined in yesterday for my birthday celebration with 6 friends. The minute we walked in, we were told the staff was still setting up our table and it would take a couple of minutes so we waited outside. About five minutes later, we went back inside and were seated in the back room which was perfect ...only to find out shortly after that we had to move b/c this table wasn't for us. That was only the beginning...and already it was off to a terrible start. The server took FOREVER to take our orders...we were all waiting for about 20 minutes b4 he decided to come by and ask what we wanted. I ordered the devil's basket which looked like a good choice but turned out that 3/4 of my bowl was filled with hot chili peppers...(certainly not very filling or a good hearty meal)The description read that the basket would be filled with crab and other sead food delights....and it consisted of about 3 peices of it! When i looked around for our waiter to order something different b/c i wasnt satisfied...he was nowhere to be found....what a SURPRISE!. The only reason im giving this place two stars is b/c my friends secretley asked for a dessert to be brought out since it was my birthday and all.... and the dessert was simply amazing! It was fried vanilla icecream with walnuts! So0o0o delicious. & the waiter even wished me a happy birthday at the end so i guess my dining experiance at sunda was bitter sweet.
