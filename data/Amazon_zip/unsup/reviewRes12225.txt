Overall a 3.5. I wanted to give this place at least four stars, but the food wasnt that outstanding and they ran out of stuff on the menu! Five stars for the company though. I finally got to meet Ms. Selle and her bf and their company definitely made me enjoy this place that much more despite the food. I ordered the cuban roast pork. I asked the waiter if he recommended it and he said yes! (but what else would he say?!). Unfortunately the pork ended up on the dry side. But they gave me three huge slices of it. The portions of the meal were big. They ran out of yuca so I had plantains instead. The plantains were DELICIOUS! I wish I had a plate full of plantains instead! The rice and beans were also very good. The service was very good and the complimentary bread and butter were excellent! They put sugar in the butter!!!! Pure genius!!! Parking was a bit difficult to find but not impossible. I wouldnt mind coming back again but would definitely order a different dish!
