I have yet to have a bad dining experience at this spot, always packed always good! Tried the new Chopped Chicken Chop, with wonderful mashed potato, crisp fresh green beans, and an awesome sweet cabbage preparation, the chicken was juicy and flavorful! Every one was happy with the meal, 5 of us in all... the menu is huge, the food is great!  Clean that floor though, slippery is an understatement, scary is more like it! The service always rocks! P.S. If you have a moment to wait, get a booth with a view!
