Thanks and Thanks again to our great waiter, Ben. For our first time here, and with a broad menu, I wanted to leave the 'surprises' to our very charming waiter. He picked everything for us. He did not disappoint. Honestly, I cannot remember the names of all the dishes because we did not pick them from the menu. These were mostly his favorites or in one case of a panko bread crusted lamb chop over mushroom truffled rice that won't even be on the menu for two more weeks. We will definitely return.  We came late on a Monday night, so no noisy crowd. And the total meal was $96 before tip. For such an excellent meal and experience, not a bad price point.
