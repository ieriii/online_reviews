Bravo...bravo. A pleasant surprise from a modest place. I don't review restaurants often as I'm very busy, but this place has it going on. Thursday night and the place was busy, I think I saw one open table. Any way let me start, the crostini thing with avocado --it was great and real fresh. The waiter, Dan, suggested we try the Stella salad with fresh raspberries and thin sliced apples. That was pretty good but no big deal-- we split it. What was really great were our entrees (the waiter also talked us into them). We had the pumpkin ravioli and the milk and honey ribs special. I loved my ravioli, I think it was served with some kind of burnt squash. My boyfriend's ribs were delicious, I got to try them but he wouldn't give up the rest when I wanted more--men!! Anyway, it was my treat and with a bottle of Pinot everything came to around $100 with tip. Great Italian place.
