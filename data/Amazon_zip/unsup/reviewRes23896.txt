I just checked this place out last night. It was pretty good. I had the Greek crepe with chicken added. The quality of the filling ingredients was excellent. My initial thought was that the crepes were a bit overcooked. The service was pretty good, and the Turkish coffee was alright. I left having spent $19 bucks on dinner and was still hungry, though. Seems unusual, as crepes usually sit on my stomach like a ton of bricks. All and all, I'd try this place again, but my first adventure there was a little mediocre. Three Stars
