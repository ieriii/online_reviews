Jeebus, do I love this place. The menu is absolutely massive, with something for everyone's tastes (though I'm VERY partial to good old number 190 -- chicken with lemongrass, onions, bell peppers, and a metric gripload of chili peppers -- five of my favorite things served over rice). The pho and noodle dishes are quality, as well, and they comp you on a pot of tea if you ask for it. It's not an elegant room by any means. The atmosphere is highly laid-back and casual, with the mostly young staff grooving to hip-hop and dance music on the PA system. Compared to the strait-laced faux-colonial-bordello atmosphere that a lot of Vietnamese places go for, Tank oddly feels a lot more authentic and fun. Bottom line: the place is cool, the food is delicious, and it's in the middle of a fun neighborhood, an easy walk from the Andersonville bar scene or the big music venues down by the Lawerence El stop. There's no reason to not go to this place.
