I travel a lot for business and pleasure, so I am able to stay in a lot of nice hotels. I am really surprised by some of the reviews I've read here because I thought this was a fantastic hotel! Celebrated our anniversary with dinner and a show, got back to the room and the staff had put a nice bottle of french champagne on ice with a nice box of chocolates, plus coupons for free breakfast for two! Very clean room, the staff was friendly, had a nice lunch the next day at Michael Jordan's in the hotel. People, it's Chicago! You're going to pay a lot for parking and amenities. Lots of other hotel options for those of you who don't want to spend much.
