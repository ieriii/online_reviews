I had the Grand Collection tasting menu at Tru last night, and was greatly disappointed. Service was exceedingly slow; we arrived at 8:30, and left shortly after midnight. We waited almost an hour to receive our first course, and the wait for the larger dishes was terribly long. One of our servers apologized for the wait, and they tried to appease us with some truffles at the end, but it was really a drag. The first course-- the Sturgeon "caviar"-- was delicious; the subsequent courses were not very memorable. The Halibut and chicken were cooked to perfection, but there was nothing particularly impressive or interesting about them. The chicken was served on a log; but the log was just...a log. I would have been more impressed, had not Next recently wowed me with their own take on the log-serving dish: the gorgeous and aromatic "autumn scene", where the serving-log in question was cradling smoking apples, leaves, hay. If you're going to have a log, there might as well be fire! Dessert was served on some strange monkey candelabras. It was an attempt to be whimsical, but in the staid atmosphere of Tru, the monkeys just seemed ridiculous. They added nothing to the dish. At this price point, Next, ELideas, Bonsoiree etc beat out Tru, hands down. When the Michelin guide awarded one star to both Tru and Longman & Eagle, I was a little befuddled-- can these paces really be of the same calibre?-- and last night confirmed my doubts. They are not of the same calibre. One is delicious, creative, decadent, satisfying, welcoming, enjoyable, and worth the price. The other isn't.
