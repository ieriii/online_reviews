We first visited Irazu last year based on a recommendation, so my husband and I went. I ordered the Veggie Burrito with mushrooms,spinach and SHRIMP. (The waiter Justin called it the Lagrange Park specia) .He gets the meat burritio add mushrooms, spinach, and avacado. After the first visit we were hooked, we started going a few times a week. The OATMEAL SHAKE with MILK is awesome! Then winter hit and we stop going. Today my husband and I eagerly returned and was thoroughly disappointed. Their customer service has suffered. My husband and I watched as guests who arrived after us got served first, we watched one of the waitstaff take our appetizer to the wrong table, the waitress then brings it back out to us and questioned why we sent the appetizer away..(.I politely told her that it was not brought to our table to begin with.. really you question me? Really? We ordered the usuals...When our food finally arrived i did not see any shrimp and the burrito was cold. I stated that i did not want to wait for another one and asked the waitress to take it off my bill. As i went inside to take money out of the ATM, I listened as one of the managers berated the customer who just returned the burrito (which happened to be me). I turned around and asked if those comments were directed towards me? To bad today was a bust and I had to rate it this low because last year, it was soo wonderful but Oh well guess this is what happens after places become popular.. maybe I will try again next year....
