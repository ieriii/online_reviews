What says Chicago cuisine better than a restaurant that is dedicated to pig? The Purple Pig honors this succulent beast by using all of the parts from the ear, neck, tail, and bones.  This place gets packed fast. We arrived 20 minutes after opening and there was already a 45 minute wait. Luckily for me, we got the best seats in the house - right in front of the preparation area. Many people criticize that the dishes are on the salty side but it's the flavor profile of pork. The portions are small but you can order several dishes while trying different parts of the animal. We went with the pig ears, roasted bone marrow, and parmesan eggplant balls. The pig ears reminded me of a twist on cracklins served with a runny egg and fried greens. Some hot sauce or Tabasco would have finished the dish perfectly. The roasted bone marrow tastes like a gelatinous oil with a roasted flavor. It paired well with the crusty bread, greens, and lemon vinaigrette. The fried eggplant balls were mini bites of traditional eggplant parmesan in tapas form. Not particularly outstanding but a good filler. The Purple Pig brings out true porky goodness with innovation. Mr. Oink does look better in purple.
