I've been here on 2 occasions and have enjoyed the food and drink both times. Their margaritas are boozy and great, and the food is what you'd expect from a reasonable mexican restaurant. I love the options on their combo plates-- I'm always the diner who can't decide between two entrees and end up begging my boyfriend to swap me an enchilada for a tamale. Fortunately for everyone, I can order one flauta, one enchilada, one taco, one tamale, whatever! It's tasty food, quick service, cute waiters, not much else to say!
