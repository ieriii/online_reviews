A very nice alternative to the ridiculously packed Sunday morning brunch spots. Granted we arrived kinda lunch-time and the place may have been stroller-city earlier, but it was a chill place with GREAT, I mean GREAT coffee and many unusual crepe choices. Even building your own is an option. Good value in stroll-worthy Andersonville.
