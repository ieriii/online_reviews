I really wanted to like this hotel-great location, cool-hip vibe (love Ian Schrager), earnest staff (meaning they TRY), and great rates. However, number of problems. First, it's VERY loud-as in very little soundproofing. Second, you can't order a meal at the bar. Well, technically you can, but it's a ridiculously limited menu. When I'm traveling on business by myself, I do NOT want to sit in the dining room and I like the convenience of eating at the hotel if I'm particularly busy. And it's too bad-I would have easily eaten there every night of my four night stay (as I have been known to do at times) if the food was good, but I never got a chance to try it. Third, they charge you 18% service for oatmeal to go in their cafe (really???). Fourth, room service comes in "to-go". That's fine, but don't charge me 18% service for that-at least put it on china. Or just tell me to go downstairs and pick it up. Oh yeah, they charge you 18% there too. I agree with some of the other comments, the staff here is really nice. But some of the management policies are silly. And not sure I could overcome the noise issue. Probably will not stay here again.
