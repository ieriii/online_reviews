After finally checking into our hotel, me and my family were hungry and I was left to decide where we were going to eat for this entire trip. Luckily, it just took a few short minutes to walk from the hotel to The Purple Pig. Since we had not eaten there before our server did a little run through of the menu then got our drink order while giving us some time to decide what to order. She gave us some suggestions based on our food preferences and popular favorites. We ordered: - Fried Deviled Egg - Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette - Fried Pigs Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - JLT with Fried Duck Egg & Lemon Aioli - Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta Smear - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - Sicilian Iris (Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche) - Panino con Nutella (Nutella, Marshmallow Cream & Banana Panini) My favorites were the fried pig ear (I enjoyed the bit of spice and vinegar flavor from the pickled peppers with the crispy pig ear), pork neck bone gravy with ricotta (we asked for more bread to soak up every last but of gravy and creamy ricotta), milk braised pork shoulder (the pork shoulder was so tender), and the Sicilian Iris (it has everything I love in desserts - the melted chocolate chips and creamy ricotta with the fried brioche was heaven. and it wasn't too sweet). The food was amazing and our server was very helpful. We liked everything so much that we picked up some take out to take back to our hotel a couple days later because I was craving the Sicilian Iris for dessert after having dinner somewhere else and my family wanted the fried pig ear.
