Tried Irazu after seeing them featured as restaurant of the month for the Veggie Super Club. Even though I couldn't make the event, I thought I should definitely give the place a try. I can't speak to the restaurant itself, as I have ordered in both times, but boy is the food here great. Both times I've ordered the empanadas, and I have learned that my favorites are the zucchini, spinach and cheese, and plantain. All of the veggie options are tasty, though. I've also tried the delicious potato tacos and the incredible yuca with mojo (garlic oil). Yum. My girlfriend has ordered the veggie burrito with mushrooms both times and loved them and my roommate has enjoyed steak burritos and meat-filled empanadas. The only thing we haven't loved was a blackberry shake, but I think that's a personal thing. My only other complaint is that pricing is a little strange. Some things are super inexpensive (7 empanadas for $12? That's 2 meals! Burritos as big a house for $5? Sweet!) while others are above average for the city ($10 for 3 potato tacos). Really, you should pretty much try this place. It can be very cheap if done right and amazingly good. I mean, I've ordered from them twice in a week. They're doing something right.
