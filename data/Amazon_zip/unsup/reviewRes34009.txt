So this has been on my list of "To Try" for a while now, so I was super excited to go earlier this week. I had been craving a yummy falafel and from reviews, this place ought to hit the spot. In all reality, I would lean towards a 3.5 for Sultan's, but alas, halfies are not allowed on Yelp.  I was surprised to walk in and see a salad bar - I was truly tempted to forego the menu, but I figured we'll save the salad bar for a more indecisive day so that I could sample a little of everything... because they did have everything. Ordered 2 falafel sandwiches and chicken shawarma dinner. We ordered our falafel spicy because that's how it's gotta be done in my life. Our order came out really quickly. The lamb shawarma dinner was pretty good. It comes with cucumber salad and hummus. The salad I could have done without and the hummus was somewhat subdued - still good, but certainly not the best. The last time I ate this particular cuisine was at Sham in CA the two cannot compare. The lamb was enhanced with the basmati rice. I was pleased with the combination. The falafel sammiches were a bit disappointing. The one we ate was not not spicy and the one that I brought for lunch the next day had a bit of a kick, but certainly not what I would describe as "spicy." Not sure what it is that I missed about Sultan's Market. They left me craving a higher end cousin of theirs, Maza.
