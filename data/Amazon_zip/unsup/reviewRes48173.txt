We really enjoyed our meal here. The atmosphere is very open; the communal seating is great for groups, I imagine, but even for couples it's nice. With your proximity to others, you get a great chance to see what others order, and we had a friendly group next to us inquire about our meals. The ribs were amazing. (I also love the fact that there is a place to wash your hands outside of the bathrooms.) One nitpick that I have is about the obnoxious menu. I just found it a pain to read, and I'm not sure if memory serves perfectly here, but I think that the server said something about the portion sizes getting bigger as you go down the list? That's hard, as you try to weigh what sounds tasty against how much you think you can down. Also, for people that like to read about a place's offerings ahead of time (as I do), the website differs from the printed menu in person.
