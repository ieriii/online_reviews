First, I want to say I only ordered for a pick-up and did not eat at the restaurant. But when placing the order by phone, the lady was very nice and helpful, especially when I asked about a menu item that didn't have a description. She offered in finding out what exactly was in it. When I arrived to pick up my order, I was greeted almost right away, considering it was very busy. I think it was the same lady who answered the phone and took my order and she was very nice and friendly at the front desk. Everything was prompt and nicely handled with customer service. For the food, I had stuffed eggplant and my friend has the octupus dinner. It was good. I give it props because it wasn't salty, unlike alot of restaurants. I would go back and eat there.
