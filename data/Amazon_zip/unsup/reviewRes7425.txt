The service was spot on. Excellent customer service. Now the food... someone needs to stand at the door of the kitchen with a jar of seasoning and every plate that comes out needs to be re-seasoned. EVERYTHING was bland. I really wanted to like this place. An upscale BBQ restaurant is a good idea, but the food was not very good.
