It has been a while since I have hung out in the Lakeview Neighbourhood along Broadway... Man the hood has changed. Stopped in at Wilde for dinner and was quite surprised. If memory serves this used to be a Hardware Store. I would never have thought a Poet themed Bar would be a solid idea but this was. Nice departure from the Uber Irish Pub motif that every hood seems to have, some more than one. Warm Woods, Fireplace, two Bars and a friendly attentive wait staff. Burgers were on the mind for an easy late fare. Both were cooked to the temp requested, juicy and delicious. My friend said that she has yet to be disappointed with anything, based on the quality of what we had I see no reason to doubt her. If this hood is going to get back in the rotation for me, Wilde will certainly be visited again.
