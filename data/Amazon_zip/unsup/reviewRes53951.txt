We have been going here since they opened on Clybourn. The food has been pretty good, the price is right and the location is convenient. This evening I ordered via their website and when I showed up to pick-up our dinner they had no record of the order...until they looked at the printer under the cash register. Upon finding the missing order they proclaimed that the their website 'sucks' and I should phone my order and never use the online system and besides they were out of the grouper soup and did not have the chicken tamal that was on our printed order. Basically I was being told that their service failure was my fault for ordering online and ordering two items they were out of...very nice...wtf? They are always out of the grouper soup and should take it off of the menu. The two sides of black beans we received were 85% juice and they also left out the extra side of rice that we ordered. Very disappointed with the service and the quality of food.
