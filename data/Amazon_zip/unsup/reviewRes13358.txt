Does the diner actually need re-inventing? The first line of Glenn's Diner's "story" on their web site states that the restaurant was born to re-envision this unique piece of Americana (my words, not theirs). And re-invent it does. Though I don't know if I can fully get behind the word "diner" being slapped on this new formulation.  The only thing remotely diner about this restuarant are the breakfast choices served all day long. If this were part of a chain, it would surely draw derision for being pre-fab and fake (and pricey and slightly touristy).  But I have to stop being cynical for a second and say that as a stand-alone, it's actually a pretty enjoyable experience. Once my menu sticker shock subsided (diner = cheap, greasy, and fast in my dictionary), I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich that was excellent. But what really separated the dining experience was the potato pancake. Now, I have potato pancake mix running through my blood (according to my doctor, I really need to change that) and the fact that Glenn's even offers this as a possible side was amazing. But this pancake is beyond words good (it tasted like a loaded pancake but I can't find proof that it was anything but potato). And the pickle that came with the sandwich was kosher dillicious. So in the end does it matter that it's not really a diner? Not particularly. It's just taking me a while to wrap my head around the idea of a not-diner. As a former resident of the neighborhood, it's a great addition to the area; but after my visit before the Yelp Holiday Bash 2008, I will say the only real large-scale real Diner (Grill) around North Center still lives on Irving Park and not Montrose.
