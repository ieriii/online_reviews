Great place. Went for brunch, they open at 11 even though their website says 10 AM so remember that. But the food and ambiance were fantastic. We had the grilled romaine salad, the pizza, and a baked egg dish. All delicious. I will definitely be back, especially since there is no wait if you get there early.
