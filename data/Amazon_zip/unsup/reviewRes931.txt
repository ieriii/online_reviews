Doug is basically the coolest guy you'll ever meet. Or should I say (encased) meat? Whenever I go, the line is maybe 10-15 people deep. Then again, I don't go around 3 pm when there is only an hour left and it's the after work rush crowd. I suggest getting to Hot Doug's around 11, 12ish. No big wait. Also, BONUS: The menu is online. If you end up having to wait in the crazy line (which moves fairly fast, really) you can just pull the menu up on your smart phone and pick out what you want. Super easy, and worth the wait. Seriously. ALWAYS GET ONE OF THE SPECIALS! For realsies, the Portuguese Linguica is to die for, the yak sausage is awesome, the Foie dog is amazing, anything Doug does with bacon, pork, garlic, rosemary, and cheese is always an A+. Plus you get a chance to taste meats you might not have had before. Any game of the week is awesome. Rattlesnake, kangaroo, and the buffalo/elk/antelope/venison mix? YEAH SO GOOD.
