This review is based on there lunch Menu. I only dined on pizza and have not tried anything else. The restaurant is in a great location in the University Village/ Little Italy area. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We asked our waitress what her favorite pizza was and ordered a few based of her suggestions. The first pizza we tried, was a Margareta pizza and it by far was a 5 star pizza. The crust was cracker thin and the ingredients were spectacularly fresh. The second pizza was less than stellar. It has an arugula on top of it and it just tasted really bitter. That was more of a three star pizza. For lunch, i felt it was a bit pricey, and basing that on city prices. I would definitely order for a group and split to keep the prices down.
