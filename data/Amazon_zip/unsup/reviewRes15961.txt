Calo Ristorante- One of the Best in Chicago! Lovely Restaurant, as you walk in the door there is a great Bar Area- Dimly Lit, Nice Romantic Setting- Once you are seated Calo brings a basket full of the Best Foccacia Bread in the World to your table- Calo is famous for their Thin Crust Pizza, but they also have a Pan and Stuffed Pizza Sunday through Thursday in Restaurant you can get the best Full Slab of Ribs for $12.95- Pastas are phenominal, they have daily Specials as well- During the week you can be seated without any wait for the most part- Week-Ends are more hectic, They have a parking area right across the street next to the Swedish Bakery- The Menu has been slightly updated and the prices are moderate- Calo is a lovely environment whether you sit at the bar or in a booth- The Staff is great, very Welcoming and Friendly- Calo is located in Andersonville not far from where I live and I have become a Major Fan! Calo Ristorante is definitely worth the Trip! You won't regret it!
