This falls into the bucket of "never go again." The spread looked amazing and the food itself tasted good...at the time. However, I was sick for two days with a horrible bout of food poisoning after dining here. I typically hesitate to blame restaurants for food poisoning but I am certain my illness was a direct result of the restaurant because I had only eaten home-cooked food the prior two days before eating here and had the same stuff when I was back to 100% afterwards. Looking back, I do recall being grossed out that the server who sliced some turkey breast for me proceeded to "sauce" my plate with cranberry sauce and stuck the knife back into his container after touching my dirty plate. I imagine doing that 100 or so times will cross contaminate.* from my visit on 12/18/2011
