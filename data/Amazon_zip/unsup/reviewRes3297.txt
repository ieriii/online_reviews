At the risk of subjecting myself to online harassment... Don't get me wrong, I really loved their wings. We tried the Crisp BBQ sauce, which was fantastic. The wings were fried just right, the meat was tender, I walked away with my face sufficiently covered in sauce, etc. However, we also dabbled in the other half of their menu and went with the Seoul Sensation burrito. The burrito was frankly boring and just downright not tasty at all - I made it through only a couple bites and had to go back to the wings (poor me). The burrito is really missing that kick, that spice, that actual taste that makes you come back for more. The Atomic Sauce that came with it was some sort of ranch dressing-based sauce and just did nothing for it (and for a burrito at a Korean restaurant, I tend to expect a little more out of my sauces). I think these guys have a good thing going with their chicken, and I would stick to that on my next visit. They seem to have a lot going on with their menu - however, when one part of the meal is a complete home run, it's an even bigger letdown when the other part is a complete miss.
