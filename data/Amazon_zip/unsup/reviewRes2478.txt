I guess you could say I was kinda disappointed in hot dougs. I always check out yelp before going anywhere and hot dougs had tons of great reviews. The hot dogs were good but not waiting in line for two hours good. If you have never been and don't mind killing a couple hours you should check it out. They do have tons of gourmet hot dogs that are yummy. I don't think ill be going back anytime soon (unfortunately)
