Big thanks to An for scheduling this perfect Bears halftime chow fest! I have had my first wing people, and I llllllllliked it. If Pterodactyls still existed, I would have been eating their wings at Crisp. "Jumbo" sounds small in comparison to how large these wings are. I can sleep happily tonight, knowing those chickies must have lived a long life to grow that size. I ordered the Seoul Sassy sauce because marketing was designed for people like me and I loved the name. Don't judge. I'm only saying what everyone else knows and won't admit. The sauce is a fantastic blend of ginger, soy, sugar and scallions and I wish I had a side of it to dip other fried things in. The wings were plump, juicy on the inside, crispy crunchy delicious on the outside and gone by the end of halftime. Five were enough to make me feel like I could explode. In fact, I think I cleaned my little birdies better than some of the boys at the table! Since Crisp is a block away from my current apt. and the one I'm moving into next week, I'll be here frequently, hopefully not sitting by myself at the communal tables, guzzling root beer and showing grown men how eating chicken wings is done!
