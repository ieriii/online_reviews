The salad bar is overrated. Pricey too, at least during dinner time (~$11). Despite that knock, I am glad it exists as it's a much healthier option than most restaurants nowadays. You can choose from iceburg lettuce, mixed baby greens and another type of green (romaine possibly? I can't remember). There is also hype around their cream cheese & chocolate chip dip concoction. It is tasty and probably the most original part of the salad bar. There are also various fruits like pineapple, apples, melons, grapefruit, etc. The ranch dressing I put on my plate didn't taste much like anything. I'm more impressed with the salad bar at Fogo De Chao. My dining buddies had the burger that is supposed to be very good as well. They both liked it although it wasn't anything spectacular. They both did not like the chips that are included. They are thinly sliced fried potatoes. It doesn't seem like there is much salt on them if any. The milkshakes are very good and will cost you around $4. We tried the coffee, strawberry and raspberry milkshakes. You can even combine flavors from the list. Very close quarters in this place. Your elbows and chairs will get bumped constantly. Parking blows in this neighborhood as well.
