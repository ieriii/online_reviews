I know every girl says this, but I usually don't write a negative review. For real though, I work in the restaurant industry, and I know how quickly and easily some people can fly off the handle and damage a place's rep. That being said, I truly was very dissapointed in my experience with Alliance.  I pace their window all the time, admiring the artistry that goes into their cakes. I must admit that I usually get my cakes from Bittersweet, as I've had great success with their product. However, I needed a 'shape cake' for a good friends 30th birthday - something Bittersweet doesn't do. So, my second choice, was Alliance. I called them up, spoke to Peter, and made an order for a White Sox jersey-shaped cake with chocolate for the flavor and cappucino moussed for the filling. I go to pick up the cake right before heading to my friends birthday dinner. As they allow me to inspect the cake, I was greeted by an adorable little jersey that, for some reason, was missing my friend's name on it. Something which I had gone over with him several times. No biggie, easy fix, and I get to the party on time. The real rub came when, upon cutting into the cake for our guests, I see a VANILLA cake staring back at me. I ordered chocolate, my friend's favorite. REALLY?? You pride yourself on your artistry, but can't get a cake's simple flavor right? Keep in mind that this was a 10 inch cake at the cost of $220.00. Not a bargain by any means. I called the very next day to complain, natch. My response upon telling them that they got the flavor wrong was, "Oooh...that's not good." Yeah, tell me about it. I was offered 50% off of another cake, which I don't need, or 20% back on the cake in question. So, $40.00 for getting the most essential part of the cake, the flavor, incorrect. Wow. Maybe it's just me, but that's not the way I would do business. Bittersweet, here I stay. Thanks for nothing, Alliance.
