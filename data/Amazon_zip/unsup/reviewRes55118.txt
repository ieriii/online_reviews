Our family goes to this restaurant and orders out 2-3 times a month. I absolutely love the steak selection, the filet is so juicy and tender it melts in your mouth. I am also a big seafood fan and really enjoy the different fish selections Wildfire has to offer. We often order the Halibut or the Cod and really enjoy both. Our favorite dessert is the seasonal blueberry pie, it is sweet and tart all at the same time. We recommend this place to anyone!
