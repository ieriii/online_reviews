I have two of Rick's cookbooks and became a fan watching Top Chef Masters. We visited from Portland OR and Frontera exceeded very high expectations. We didn't have a reservation so we put our name on the waiting list as soon as it opened. Had a couple great margaritas and had a table in an hour. The guacamole was like you get in Mexico, creamy, flavorful and delicious. The chips were outstanding. My son ordered the fish of the day. It was the best I've ever tased and we live in seafood country. I had the pork mole. Terrific as well. We could go back 5 more times and not order everything we wanted to try. Definitely worth the trip.
