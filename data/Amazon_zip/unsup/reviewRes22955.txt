My husband had planned to get the Superdawg before arriving but ended up ordering the other hot dog option- I think it is a polish dog. Excellent is what he thought. He loved the convenience of having the dog cut in half especially when your lap is your table. I had the Supercheesie (?)- it's the chesseburger option. Yummy! Fries come with both meals and we thought they were ok. My husband ordered a Coke and I ordered the shake (to share). I had a chocolate milkshake and enjoyed it, too. Next time i would like to get the cheeseburger and milkshake and skip the fries.  Make sure to arrive to the location on Milwaukee Ave. and be able to turn right into the drive in. The area is a little busy.
