OK.... I'm a beer snob from San Diego. Let me start by saying that every beer we tried held up to the highest micro-brew standards. The pizza needs to cool a bit as it tends to be a little runny. The staff is rock solid and works their tail off. Our server was (Ryan), and seemed to be at 6 places at once. Still he meet all demands serving our table of 5. I would come back just for the beer and service. I knocked off 1 star only because of the pizza.
