I recently tried to go here on a Sat night with 2 friends. There looked to be a decent wait of at least 2 or 3 parties ahead of us, but somehow the lady gave us a table. We figured maybe the other parties were bigger and needed a bigger table... she's knows what she's doing, right? So we sat down. We took off our coats and settled in. We got glasses of water. And menus. We had just decided what to order when the lady comes back and tells us she accidentally seated us before some other people and she asks us to go back in line and wait - are you fuckin serious? That's my fault you can't keep track of who's in line? Well, I guess it was a no-win situation for them. Someone was going to be upset one way or the other. It was us. =( We left. Hungry. Damnit.
