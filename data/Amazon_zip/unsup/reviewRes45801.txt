I've been here before in the past and the food and service has always been pretty decent. This was the reason why I decided to go here for my bday dinner with some of my close girlfriends. The food and service is about 3 stars. I was a little disappointed in the shake beef dish. The waitress told me that there were jalapenos in the dish and it was very spicy. When the dish came out, I didn't see any jalapenos or taste any spice in the dish. The other dishes that we ordered included the jambalaya, salmon, seared ahi tuna salad, scallops. I think my gf's thought the same thing, it was just ok. The reason why I downgraded it to a 2 star is because of the horrible attitude and service we received from the hostess, Amanda. I can understand that it gets busy at times and you have a lot of people coming up to the hostess table, but to put your hand out in a customer's face and sigh extremely loud then say "you're going to have to wait for your turn" in a very rude manner is completely unacceptable. This happened not once, but twice when we went up to check on the status of our table since our buzzer didn't buzz and it was right around the time when they estimated that our table would be ready. I was VERY turned off by this. I used to work as a waitress and know that customers can be demanding at times, but by no means would I act so unprofessional and give the customers an attitude. Yes, just that one employee can ruin it for the whole dining experience. I will not be returning to grand lux cafe for dinner or any other special occasions.
