Great place, definitely some place I'd go back to. There was little that kept me from ordering more drinks: great bar staff, relaxed atmosphere, incredibly unique drink selections and overall a great time. What keeps me from giving this a 5? A little more flexibility on pricing (although not really an issue), our wait in line was killer, and the bouncer was quite a bit of a jerk, he seemed to let either particular girls in first or certain other groups behind us priority, even though we had either a smaller or bigger group than them...ended up waiting almost 2 hours. Certainly was worth it though.
