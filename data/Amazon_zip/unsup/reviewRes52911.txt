We stopped in on a Monday night from a friend's recommendation. The restaurant has some warm and inviting decor. We actually had apps all the way to dessert and it was all good. The owner introduced himself to us and showed us around the place after we ate. 90 Miles is a great spot and worth your time for the experience.
