I dream of Coast rolls Po boy, Sweet Potato, Crunch Make reservations That's my Coast haiku, and it tells it like it is. Coast is my favorite sushi bar in Chicago (sorry Japonais, you have your fans too) because it is delicious, BYOB, and has a really cool atmosphere. It can be hard to get a table though so always call for a reservation (see haiku).
