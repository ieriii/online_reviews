Formaggi + Salumi: Pantaleo, Gorgonzola, and Grana Padano with Calabrese -- delicious, served with toast and chutney Roasted beets + Walnut Butter + Creme Fraiche + Candied Walnuts -- very good, wish there would've been more candied walnuts but great appetizer Pizza della Terra: Foraged mushrooms + Braised leeks + Talleggio + Truffle Oil Pizza della Fattoria: Farmed egg + Pork Belly + Potato + Scallions + Asiago + Bechamel Both pizzas were amazing - one person could easily take down a whole pizza...I know I did. Overall the food and service was great. I'll definitely be back.
