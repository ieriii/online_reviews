I think I plan to make this a go-to place for my future Chicago stay-cations. It's a nice old fashioned historic building with a contemporary interior. You get the old fashioned feel from the narrowness of the building itself, but the rooms (i've stayed in a regular king room and a king suite) are really nice - clean. with down pillows and mattress tops. I wish they had more amenities on top of the basics - more products, like lotion in addition to shampoo and conditioner and bar soap. Some fridge room would be nice. They should also keep a closer eye to detail - my bathroom faucet had a missing piece that looked like it broke off. The bed and the room overall looked clean except for a random blood stain on my sheet. I think every hotel that charges for internet is just ripping you off a little bit. it's almost like charging you for potable water. They do it because they can but they really shouldn't given this day and age where free wifi is not only welcome but a required amenity - charging for it is just like throwing away customer goodwill.  Breakfast in bed was good - but pricey - I guess that's what you should expect from a hotel. But if you're feeling lazy and want to pamper yourself, the food doesn't disappoint. the suite is great because you have a tv in the outer room with a desk and then some private space in the bedroom.  not great for stays longer than 1-2 nights.  the gym on the 25th floor is pretty good - well kept and with water and towels available. some hotel gyms are just horrible but this one is nice. could be brighter. i got the internet rate for about $109/night ($125 with tax).
