we drive by this place all the time and i'm always bugging my bf to take me here. finally, after weeks of nagging he brings me here last weekend. now, i'm a huge fan of the jibarrito at borinquen so i was pleasantly surprised that they had something similar but called guarito. the guarito has marinated steak, lettuce, tomato and swiss cheese all on a flattened, fried plantain. the only difference is that there is no mayo on the guarito. also, they use american cheese instead of swiss on the jibarrito. but all in all, i would say that their guarito was just as good as the jibarrito. the mister ordered the lechon sandwich and it was just alright. the lechon's seasoning was a bit bland and he didn't seem so crazy about it so i don't think he's going to order that again. we also ordered 2 meat empanadas and they were delicious. i especially love the dressing they give you with your order. we'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu.
