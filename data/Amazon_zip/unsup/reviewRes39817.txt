I would give it 5 stars if the service was better. The ladies there are curt and blunt bordering rude but I can get past that because I still enjoyed my meal here. We only go here for the grilling - don't bother if you're not going to cook your own meat at the table because you may as well go to any other korean restaurant. The draw here is that they use real charcoal as opposed to gas. Yes, it gets really smoky but that's where the flavor comes from. Min 2 orders of meat for the use of the grill at your table otherwise they cook it for you in the kitchen. Oh, don't even bother with that little parking lot, you're better off finding street parking.
