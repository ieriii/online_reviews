My first time eating a deep dish pizza. We got the classic one. I was full after the first slice even after the fact that I was super hungry. What I like is that they make you order your pizza before you get seated because no doubt you have to wait! The only thing is that it was so jam packed that there's not much room to wait. The ambiance is nice though once you get seated. We were at the upper level. The crust is too much of a bread for me, soft, not much texture. The cheese however is great. It's an art trying to separate each slice!!!
