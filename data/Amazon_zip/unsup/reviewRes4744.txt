Few friends of mine have already recommended this restaurant for a long time. The food here was good, but the portion was really small. Unlike other "this style" restaurant, they don't give you bread before the meal. So I feel the food here is little bit pricy. Also, the tables are close each other, so you can hear strangers' conversation easily and vice versa. Personally, I prefer to go to other restaurants if I have to spent this amount of money!
