We came on a Sunday night with no reservations, and found that there would be a 45 minute wait if we wanted a table. Even the tables around the bar area were all packed. Luckily there was seating available at the bar, and that was good enough for me and my boyfriend. I started out with the Wildfire Cab, and we waited for our dinner to arrive. Our bartender Jesse was quite attentive refilling my boyfriend's coke and our waters. I got the Porterhouse steak with the broccoli and the bbq sweet potato, and my boyfriend got the skirt steak and fries. Everyone standing near the bar area oohed and ahhed over my Porterhouse, and righteously so because it was delicious! It totally hit the spot, and the spices from the Cab complimented the steak very well. My steak was cooked medium which was spot on. I couldn't help myself and ordered the dessert trio which consisted of a Snickers ice cream cake of some sorts, a cheese cake I believe, and the key lime pie - which was the star, served with a side of fresh berries. My stomach was so stuffed and I could feel it outstretching my coat. The price was very reasonable for a steak joint, and the ambiance felt comfortable and unpretentious. My boyfriend and I agreed that we could definitely come back to this spot. I can't wait to have my leftovers for dinner!
