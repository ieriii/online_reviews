I am a real fan of brining visitors to the Grand Lux. Our friends from overseas always end up loving the food and the space. I wish we could get into the roundish room with the big windows. *shakes fist in air* The portions are HUGE. We almost always end up taking home a doggy bag or two. The service has always been very good. There's a fantastic selection of different meal options. It's a bit daunting for first time visitors, but we've nary had a complaint. The downside to this place is that the wait is always long. We've had large groups and we're never able to make reservations.  I also have an issue with their lack of space for people waiting to be seated. People are sprawled on the stairs, the floors and any other available space. Not so great for the poor parents trying to drag their kids and strollers through the crowd and no one will move for them. Also, the bar area isn't the best for waiting because all the tourists load their shopping bags in all the chairs and get nasty with you if you want to actually sit and order a meal at the bar. This has happened more than once to us, so I'm not just talking out my butt. :)
