Love, love, love this place, it is sooo good. Since I recently moved to the west loop, I have been trying all the local establishments. My husband and I stumbled upon this restaurant only open for breakfast and lunch and we LOVE it. Now when we go for breakfast this is the only place we want to go to. The food is soo fresh, w/out being too sprouty or vegetariny if you know what i mean. They have great frittata's and awesome specials everyday.. Highly recommend this place.
