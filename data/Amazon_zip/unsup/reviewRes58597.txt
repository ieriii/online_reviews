To hell with this place! The dark haired hostess that met us at the door on March 23rd at 11pm was a complete bitch! I'm telling everyone I know to avoid this place. She was rude, unaccommodating, and had a completely shitty attitude. Owner, if you read your reviews, take this one seriously! That one member of your staff is going to be your downfall. I brought a large group to drink and eat. We were clear that we understood that we wouldn't all sit together. We said that any accommodation was fine. She was hung up on the number of guests we were bringing. We said between 10 and 12. She literally yelled at us for not knowing. I said we would be willing to take whatever bar seating shows up and if any DR seating is available she could seat part of our group there. Many of these people were from out of town. The entire fiasco turned into such a clusterfuck with her attitude that we left. We went to Tiny lounge, which was busier. We walked in and the bartender said, How many? I said, between 10-12. If you can accommodate that'd be great, otherwise I understand. She said, No worries, we'll make it work!Yeah, so Bad Apple take a cue from Tiny Lounge and hire people who can handle a rush with a sunny can-do disposition and fire that rigid crone you have working the door. Thanks for nothing!
