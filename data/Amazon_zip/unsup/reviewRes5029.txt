The Purple Pig was a true treat. We randomly stumbled upon it while looking for a good place to have lunch in Chicago before attending the Dave Matthews Caravan this weekend - and found a culinary delight! The Calamari may have been my favorite. Uniquely served chilled with pistachio and hints of lemon. We also enjoyed Chorizo Stuffed Olives and Prosciutto Bread Balls. The olive lovers that i was with especially raved about these. Salty, fried, with a Chorizo kick. Our party of 4 also shared 2 Paninis: Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive Tapenade and Porchetta with Salsa Verde. This Salsa Verde really was a fantastic addition to the Porchetta Panini. We also treated ourselves to a Pork Smear. YUMM! All of this paired with a refreshing Vinho Verde.
