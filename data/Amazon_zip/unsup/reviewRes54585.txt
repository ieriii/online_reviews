This place is amazing! I always go with the lamb meal and I'm never left dissatisfied . The hummus is excellent and the portions are enough to fill you up. For dessert I'd go with a baklava. This place id great for a bite with some friends, with the family, or just a quick bite by yourself. Try it once and you'll come back for more.
