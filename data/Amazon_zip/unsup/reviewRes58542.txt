No take out, no delivery - it'd damage the pizza. If you like this type of specialty pizza - wood burning oven, high quality ingredients, this place is great. And the appetizers are great too - hard to choose, and all so yummy! I'm originally a New Yorker, and am VERY picky about my pizza. I love the pizza here - the toppings are top-notch, and the crust is done perfectly and oh so yummy! As for the restaurant - I have a feeling this place would work equally well for a casual I feel like pizza tonite, lets walk over night as it would for a solo meal, a casual gathering of friends, or a date nite. It definitely seems like it could be whatever you want it to be that occasion.
