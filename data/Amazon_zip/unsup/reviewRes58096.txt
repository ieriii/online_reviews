The food is good, but honestly we can get better food around Chinatown with less expensive prices. I would give this restaurant more stars but their service is bad. During the times we've been there, the servers were rude, impolite and blatantly disrespectful of their customers and when serving or handling our food. One time we ordered a whole steam fish. As tradition, when asked, the server will help to cut up the fish and serve. However, when asked, one server didn't want to do it and he asked this other server. This man totally massacred the fish and later chucked the silverware on the plate and left. He then started laughing with the other server that was too lazy to do it. Honestly, where are your manners and we should have called the manager and asked for a refund or what so ever, but I was entertaining guest from out of town and didn't want them to feel more uncomfortable. Thereafter our other times being there other servers were rude and we feel rushed to sit, eat and leave for the other customers waiting to get in... Therefore, our experience have never been comfortable for us. I think their food is rather on the expensive side as well and best if you try other restaurants not only in this new plaza but the other old plaza.
