This place is a serious carnivorous carnival. Went with a large group, even the non-meat lovers enjoyed the food and adored the experience. A convincing way to tell this place definitely knows its meat is that despite offering so many varieties of meat and cut, each one stands out with distinctive flavouring, texture, and seasoning. If you like meat, this is a great place to go.
