I had a fantastic gluten free meal yesterday night. I called up in advance and was told that they have a lot of gluten free options. Got to dinner and was told my best option was sushi. I eat sushi 4 times a week for lunch, so I asked my waiter to do better. He pointed me to chicken. Again, I asked him to do better. He came back from the kitchen and said that he could do a spinach salad, a mushroom and asparagus appetizer and the shaking beef all gluten free. So I took him up on the app and the beef dish. They were fabulous. He came back 15 minutes later with the duck dish that everyone else ordered and was able to make it gluten free too, which was really nice of him to go out of his way to make that happen. My gluten free shaking beef was so good that the group ordered another! Anyhow, great staff (after my initial sushi and chicken issue), fantastic food, great drinks. Oh - and I had a really good avocado dessert of all things. The only downside - no umbrellas. Although apparently the mai tais come in head-shaped glasses. That counts for something.
