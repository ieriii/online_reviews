I'll keep this simple. Food: ranges from good to really good. Service: horrible. I have gone here for lunch three times recently, and every time I was sorely disappointed by the poor service. Today it took over 45 minutes between sitting down and receiving our appetizer. We had to ask the server 3 times where our appetizer was. Each time he said "just a few more minutes." The resturant wasn't even particularly busy. The drinks alone (Diet Pepsi) took over 10 minutes. They are either understaffed or just have really disorganized service, but I have consistently been disappointed by how slow this place operates.
