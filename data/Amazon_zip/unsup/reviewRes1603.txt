There is parking. The wait is one hour (and a half). The encased meats are worth it. Bring a chair, a flask and a book.  It takes me exactly 1 month to forget the wait and want to make my way back to this fantastic establishment. The uber garlic dog is my personal favorite, but my friend was just as happy w/ her chili cheese hot dog. Whatever your tastes, you'll be back in that damned line. Guaranteed.
