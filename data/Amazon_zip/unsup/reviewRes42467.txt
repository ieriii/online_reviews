Surprisingly the food is delicious, inventive and more affordable than i thought it would be. Love the small plates concept--each one was a hit but we especially loved the brussel sprouts, beet salad and gnocchi. Drinks are also pretty memorable...champagne cocktails go well with the richness of the dishes. The place itself is pretty awesome..cozy, rustic and sleek. Everyone that we've brought here loves the whole experience. side note: i'm usually not a dessert person but THIS IS THE BEST DAMN CARROT CAKE I'VE EVER HAD. WHEN I THINK DESSERT THIS IS WHAT COMES TO MIND!!! THE BEST!!! Please, TRUST MEEEE... Not too sweet, just enough frosting and perfectly-moist texture. GO GILT! Don't be lazy, make reservations.
