My only wish is that fewer people knew about this place, but even with the crowd, I've never had to wait more than an hour. Comparable to many other places in Chicago. And I typically don't mind waiting upstairs with the beer selection they have. Every time I've eaten here, about a dozen times over four years, I've found myself thinking about the food for days. The brisket sandwich, the grilled fig jam, almond butter and cheese sandwich, the seasonal stews, I can't say enough about how exceptional it's all been. The only let down was the steak and fries, which was still average. The service has always been solid. Not overly friendly, but always professional and on the ball. And the beer selection. My god. It's on the level with Map Room and then some. The servers and bartenders are always ready to recommend. Whether drinking with your meal or popping in early afternoon for a drink or two (earlier the better before it gets busy) there's always something you haven't tried yet. There's a ton of great options in Andersonville for good food, but this is always my first.
