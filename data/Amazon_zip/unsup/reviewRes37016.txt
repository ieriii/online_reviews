Awesome beer list, okay menu. Service was good, but kind of slow. We got the ham sandwich which was good, but very rich. My 2 friends and I split the sandwich and I couldn't have had much more. I thought the menu was pretty limited, but I think they had typical Belgium food... Which I guess doesn't intrigue me much. I just wanted a delicious soft pretzel to be on the menu, but it was no where to be found. It's fun to go and try new beers, so I would recommend it for that. I'd eat somewhere else.
