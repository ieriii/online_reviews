We took a group of our clients to the Gage for lunch and had originally anticipated continuing our meeting over lunch. However, the restaurant had terrible acoustics, making it difficult to hear the person next to you let alone across the table. One of the reasons we picked the restaurant was for their gluten free menu. The restaurant was smaller than I expected. I would highly recommend making a reservation. In spite of the crowd the service was very quick and accommodating to the individual in our group with allergies. The food was fantastic. We had a group of seven and everyone within our group was more than satisfied with their meal. I ordered the special, which was a whitefish soup and it was better than I had expected. The Gage had fantastic food and great service. I am looking forward to trying their dinner menu.
