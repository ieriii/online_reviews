I've ordered delivery from Sushi X a few times recently, and have been very pleased. Delivery has been on time or early. I have never dined in, but have driven past there countless times, and it sure is a bit dubious looking from the outside. Might be the black exterior, lack of windows, and understated signage, perhaps. I'm sure the interior is lovely. Based on rave Yelp reviews, I most recently tried the Crab Rangoon Roll. Delicious! There was barely any tempura batter on the outside, but it didn't matter. It was stuffed full of REAL crabmeat. No crappy fake crabstick. Only small complaint from me would be the choice of the Chili Sauce on the side. I don't like that kind of sauce, and don't think it's a good choice for that roll. Soy sauce sufficed. It most certainly is a Mega Roll as they call it. That roll with a Miso Soup would have been an adequate meal. But not knowing that, I also ordered a Sweet Potato Tempura roll, which might be my favorite. Oh, and I ordered the Wasabi Garlic Mashed Potatoes too, which had to wait for lunch the next day thanks to the Mega Roll! Very tasty potatoes. Great flavor and texture The Philly and California are above average as well. I didn't enjoy the Vegetable Tempura. A bit undercooked and too firm for my liking. Winter squash and sweet potato aren't at their best virtually raw. They offer sides of what must be all of their sauces, which is a great idea. 18 of them at last count. The Mango Sauce is wonderful. On a related mango note, the Mango Mousse Cake is awesome, too. Highly recommend Sushi X.
