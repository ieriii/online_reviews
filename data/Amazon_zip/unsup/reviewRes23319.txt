A friend and I stumbled upon Icosium on a Saturday night while looking for something new in Andersonville. We were drawn in by the seemingly North African decor and content looks on the patrons' faces. Since the awning of Icosium reads "Algerian Food", I became skeptical as I perused the menu and discovered that it was comprised almost entirely of crepes. My skepticism grew as I was informed by our waitress that each crepe was $6, and that you have to order two to get a side dish (potatoes or soup). Twelve dollars seemed steep for two crepes, but had already been seated when we figured this out, so we decided to give it a go. I must say that I am so glad we stuck it out. My friend and I split the Algerian Kafe for two, which was served to us in a delightful pot. I ordered two crepes: one with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and avocados, and one with escargot and brie. The side soup was a deliciously African spiced vegetable puree and the crepes were amazing. At the end of our meal, we decided to split a dessert crepe with nutella and raspberries, which was also a knock-out. Long story short, I am so glad to have eaten at such a unique restaurant. I'm giving it four stars only because the price seemed a little steep, and the night we were there their credit card machine was broken, so we had to run across the street to get cash from the ATM. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was lovely. It's intimate size makes it a PERFECT date night destination. I definitely plan on going back.
