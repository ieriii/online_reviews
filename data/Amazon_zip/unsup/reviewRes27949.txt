Not a bad place for a group if you have a reservation. I am a bit biased as I love pizza in general but this pizzeria's pizzas sure have a good crunch (the basic of a good pizza!). I also liked the ease of parking in the area (for free!) Definitely returning to try some other toppings. Good job Pequod!
