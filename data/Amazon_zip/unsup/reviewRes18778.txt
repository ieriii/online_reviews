I love burgers! Nothing is better than a nice juicy beef patty (or patties) surround by a combination of toppings. Bad Apple did a great job satisfying my burger craving. It had a variety of unique and creative burgers on the menu. I tried the Elvis' Last Supper which included peanut butter and bacon....amazing. Never would have thought that peanut butter and meat would taste so good. I liked how the peanut butter on the burger and the ketchup was restaurant made. They also had burgers that included pork belly and other kinds of meat as toppings. I mean whoever thought to put meat on top of meat deserves an award. They also had a huge beer list which is a plus. Definitely coming back!
