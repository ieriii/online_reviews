I could talk about the sweet potato chips and bread and butter pickles they give you complimentary. But you've read the reviews so you know how great they are. I could also talk about the cheddar bacon hush puppies. But again everyone talks about those so you know they are crispy and tasty. What I will recommend over and over again is the "competition style" baby back ribs. It would be easy to look at the price and say "40$ for ribs?". The answer is that they are well worth it (I do recommend splitting them with someone though cause it's a meaty rack). The time that went into the preparation and cooling of these ribs comes through in every bite. As each bite falls off the bone you can clearly see the pink smoke ring that permeates the meat and says 10+ hours of smoke. You can choose from any d the 4 tasty sauces to accompany your ribs. But I likes them dry. The dry rub is fantastic and can stand on it's own. The only other place you can ribs like this is at competition with money at stake. Since I'm writing this review only briefly after my meal it is time for me to embrace my food coma and take a nap. I'll probably dream about the ribs.
