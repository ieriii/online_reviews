I wasnt sure what to expect, since the change from Aigre Doux--but I absolutely loved what we ordered for the table. First, we had to move the time, day of, due to some late plans, and they were very accommodating. The roasted chicken can feed up to 4 people, def no skimping and the fish is so simple, yet fulfilling. From our friendly, waiter to our wonderful food, I would definitely go back.....espcially for the root vegetables and brussell sprouts!
