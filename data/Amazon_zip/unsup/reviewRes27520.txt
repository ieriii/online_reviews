I'll admit it. I am a snooty deep dish/pan pizza gal and i love my lou malnati's but pequod's is so good! i've heard a lot about this place and decided to give it a try. I don't want to say i like it better than lou's because its so different. its light on the stomach and big on flavor. we got a small deep dish, we got two slices each and it was more than enough,the best part was that the bill ended up being 12 bucks before tip! I am definitely coming back for some more delicious deep dish!
