the flour tortillas here are so good, it's sinful, and i'm usually a corn tortilla kinda girl.. the food is great and the price is right. it gets kind of hectic from time to time and you might think your server forgot about you! other than that, the staff is really nice. it's worth a try, you'll probably be back.. and don't forget to get the horchata!
