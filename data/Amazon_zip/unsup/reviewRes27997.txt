I want to give Nuevo Leon three and a half stars, so I'll settle on three. I like this place. I don't love it. I don't hate it. It's not the most authentic place, but it's also not the least tasty. The service is always good. The carrots and jalapenos are the best I've had in Chicago. The queso fundido is like Kraft mixed with diced tomatoes, sadly. They accomodate big groups nicely.
