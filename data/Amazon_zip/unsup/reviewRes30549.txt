Hands down my favorite spot in Chicago! Before you order anything on the food menu, be sure to order a bottle of ROCK SAKE - the best sake in the house! Our server recommended it because it's the highest premium sake on the market and it's from California. It perfectly complimented everything that we ordered, and when we finished the bottle of ROCK SAKE Cloud, we had a few cocktails mixed with it - amazing! The rock shrimp is unlike any appetizer I've ever had, and I have been craving it ever since. The brussel sprout salad is literally the best salad you will ever have, even if you hate brussel sprouts you will be converted! Duck was also a table favorite and you can't go wrong with some pork! While their dinner is always exquisite, don't forget to stop in there for their brunch! Bloody Mary bar with a bottle of ROCK SAKE makes for the perfect Sunday :)
