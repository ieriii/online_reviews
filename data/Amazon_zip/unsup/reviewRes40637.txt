This is for the biggest of the three, correct? About two months ago, I would have given this place an easy three, maybe four stars. The food is, overall, pretty tasty with immense portions and fast, friendly service. The bathroom gets mildly disgusting, but the free chips and salsa kick the hell out of your hunger as soon as you sit down so the bathroom tends not to be such a sticking point. Then I sunk my teeth into the sinfully salty, fatty, cheesy, texture-heaven that is the BARBACOA SUPER BURRITO. Now, I've had it a few times and it's not always the perfect ratio. But when it is... OH BROTHER! SISTER! The top of the burrito heap for SURE. Beware, this is not a meal for the faint-of-gut. Be prepared for some serious wrasslin' to fit the whole thing in, for sure. Let us not speak of the possible aftermath that a burrito of this magnitude is capable of wreaking. I digress. La Pasadita will now receive FIVE stars as recognition of their BARBACOA SUPER BURRITO and its place at the pinnacle in the world of fast-food Mexican. Did you know: Rumor has it that if you can finish ANY -- vegan being the easiest -- variety of the Ultimate burrito while sitting in the dining area, your meal is free.
