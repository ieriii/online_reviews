We had one large 1/2 Cheese and 1/2 veggie deep dish pizza...fed party of 4 w/ample leftovers. Very satisfying. Maybe I'm not a true deep dish pizza fan since I didn't appreciate the pizza as much as the other people in my party did but I'm giving this place a 4 star instead of 3 based also on their experience here and not just mine.
