Steak. Drinks. Men. No this isn't your typical Chicago steak house this is delicious meat-focused Colombian decadence! It seems that Las Tablas is the place to go for bachelor parties and birthday festivities, be forewarned this is not a romantic date night outing. With that in mind have a pitcher of red sangria, some empanadas and one of the fabulous steak combination dinners. Bring your appetite (or take a doggie bag) because there is no such thing as portion control. For $20 you can get a large steak, grilled shrimp, potato, plantain and yucca pieces. I can't imagine after all that you'd still be hungry. You'll leave Las Tablas sated and oh so happy.
