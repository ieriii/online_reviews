I first heard about Sultan's from some friends who'd been living in Chicago for a while. It was truly gratifying to enjoy it for myself after I finally relocated to Chicago from Portland, Maine. The first thing anyone will tell you about Sultan's - if their taste buds are alive, that is - is that the falafel is the BEST in town. Sultan's themselves say as much. It's all true. They serve some generous freakin' portions and dining here is an incredible value considering that I can barely breathe after most visits. Lest I mention that two people can easily share one entree and an appetizer and be more than satisfied? My ladyfriend and I have tried doing the 2 entrees :2 people thing and have found that it's just more food than we can each handle and we're both very capable eaters. How often do you encounter that? 1 entree :2 people suits us well. The food tastes so good that you just want to keep on eating it. Do we have problems? Perhaps, maybe. Are we gluttons? Not at all. Sultan's is top-shelf! Try it out!
