This was one of the cheapest/best meals that I have had in a long time. Here are some tips: Ignore the hanging animals in the window- just walk straight past them. Gross. Get a reservation, this place is super busy on the weekends- and reserve a duck. 1 duck for 3-4 people is perfect. its 33 bucks and well worth it. Start off with the egg rolls- I know it is cliche, but do it anyways. I don't know what made them so tasty but it doesn't matter. Mix the sweet and sour sauce and the hot mustard on the table that dip them in it. While you are waiting for the duck- order some BBQ pork. It was kinda sweet, not dry at all and perfect to snack on while waiting for the duck deliciousness to come out. And you will wait. As with many Asian places- the service is terrible. You will wait forever to get drinks, so do yourself a favor and drink Kirin beer here as they come in extra large bottles. The duck is great- they carve it right at the table, so just be aware of that if you have squeamish friends. They put it all out on a platter and give you fixins/sauces to make sandwiches with. All super tasty. And we had a Mexican guy carving our duck. Mexican guy carving Peking duck is exactly the reason I love Chicago. Then they bring out duck soup. It is really more of a broth, but still good. I didn't expect to finish my bowl but I did. After the soup comes DUCK FRIED RICE. Seriously, the duck fried rice was amazing. Maybe it was all the Kirin beer in me, but it was so good. Definitely a good time and great for big groups. They have a few 10 person tables complete with lazy susans. Spinning that thing provided for a lot of fun.
