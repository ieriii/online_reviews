Went to Carnivale for lunch with the work crew and definitely want to go again for lunch, dinner, or just drinks! I never went here when it was the meatlocker that was Drink, but the two story open factory space is used very well! Carnivale has filled it with vibrant colors everywhere, a wall of wines on the second floor with lights that slowly change color behind them, and plenty of colorful flourishes. I started with the Tortilla Soup- not as complex as Frontera's, but each flavor sings- avocado, lime, cilantro, and chicken. My group shared the Ceviche tasting and I was partial to the Mixto. See Deb H's pictures of the Ceviche! My main course was the Jibarito Sandwich- grilled prime ribeye, arrugla, cheddar cheese, avocado mayo, between fried plantains. The sandwich was good, especially the avo mayo, but the prime ribeye was greasy and a bit fatty. I loved that everything was sandwiched between two fried plantains! Two friends had the Arrachera and I will try this next time: marinated skirt steak, rice and beans, sweet onions, chimichurri. One friend had the Churrasco Salad and said the wood-grilled beef tenderloin was done to perfection! It looked like it too! All in all a fun place I will definitely return to.
