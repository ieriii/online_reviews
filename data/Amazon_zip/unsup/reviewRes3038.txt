This is the first time I tried the place for lunch. The Sassy Sauce was really, really tasty. BUT, the chicken was really dry and very "bony". It appears that they use really small chickens when you order the half or whole chicken. You get more at Boston Market for the money and that is a shame, because of the quality of the sauce. However, having said all of that, I DO recommend the sauce if you can find something on the menu to have other than the half/whole chicken.
