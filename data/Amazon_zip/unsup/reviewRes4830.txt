This starts a weekend of foodie heaven and suicidal wallet in Chicago. The Purple Pig has it all: Trendy hip name that boasts delicious tapa-style food without the tie. Great location on Mag Mile with a private outdoor entrance of sorts where you can drink wine and watch the pretty people. Mysterious and foreign parts-of-pig that you don't dare...but DO dare...to eat. Finally, an extensive wine list to wash all that piggy love down. Milk braised pork shoulder is creamy and delicious. The chicken kebabs I was fine without. Definitely order the Pig's ear with fried egg, not because fried eggs make everything delicious and that warm, golden yolk is last years pork belly, but because it actually does go well together. I had a great meal here with great friends and conversation.
