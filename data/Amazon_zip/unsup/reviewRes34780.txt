wish i had tried this place sooner- living on the west end of wicker park i am always looking for cheap eats that don't require me crossing the hipster highway. chicken shwarma sandwich spicy was excellent- tender pita, moist chicken, chunky cucumber salad, and they had extra hot sauce on the side- a great bite for 4.75. the spinach pie was odd- like a triangular dumpling of a dough somewhat reminiscent of little caesar's crazy bread, but i am not hating on that- the spinach filling was tasty and oniony without being TOO oniony. twas good, just not spanikopita. and the fresh baklava was a dollar. crispy, tender, perfect level of sweetness. the cashier talked of how he had to restrain himself from just rubbing it all over his body. luckily he was cute enough that it wasn't gross. anyway, i will definitely return. want to give that 2 dollar lentil soup a try. and they have a great selection of alternative beverages: aranciata, coconut water, etc. good times.
