The food here is really good and for what this place is its always been a 4-5 star spot. I love the 3$ whiskey shot list.. at almost 40 different Whiskeys to choose from! They also have a large menu of dank beer.. but also some on the super cheap ( 2$ Old Milwaukee )! I have also had the cheese and olive plates and they were both tastey. service was good, nice out door patio. Very close to the Logan blue line.
