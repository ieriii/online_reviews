I enjoyed brunch here so very much. Tried the wild boar sloppy joe, and I'm so glad I did. Their breakfast cocktails are varied and skillfully crafted so I highly recommend challenging your comfort zone. Other great find = their bourbon menu! Many options that are going gangbusters right now, including Johnny Drum. I use their bourbon list to build my own home collection. Prices are really quite fair. I'd love to stay at the inn one day.
