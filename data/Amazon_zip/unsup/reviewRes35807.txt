Last night went to Shaw's for dinner with a few friends. Hands down they have the best crab cake in the city (I would love to hear anyone challenge me on this as I'm always up for trying new places). We also had a dozen oysters which were out of this world. For an entree I had the Alaskan King Crab (the trick is when you order crab or lobster at Shaw's or Joes---ask them to extra CRACK the crab for ya). My friend had the Dover sole (boned) which he thought was fantastic. Oh, my other friend had the New England Clam Chowder and 3 pd lobster. He thought the clam chowder was some of the best since he moved here from New York. For desert we had the key lime pie which I also recommend. Lastly, if you have read any of my other reviews you know I don't really care about ambiance or waitstaff--- I rate strictly on the quality of the food. But just for a little help...Shaw's is a bit more conservative of an atmosphere---perfect for a business or romantic dinner.
