I've been wanting to try Ethiopian food for awhile now. The food was excellent! Spicy, seasoned well, and a lot of vegetarian options. My husband and I shared the vegetarian platter which was more than enough food. We also got the lentil sambussa-So delicious and I love the spicy sauce that comes with it. Will definitely return!
