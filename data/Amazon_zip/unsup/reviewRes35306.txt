Sun Wah has always been a family go to in Argyle before they moved and renovated. The roast duck and clams in black bean sauce were just that good. Ah the bigger, cleaner, and new place makes it a more enjoyable environment compared to other run down restaurants in the neighborhood. Based on one of our gf's recommendation we opted for the Peking Duck Dinner that comes with a whole sliced roasted duck, buns, duck soup, and duck fried rice. Roast duck itself was crispy and fatty, yum! Duck soup was made with the bones from the duck, nothing fancy, but a simple dish to help wash down that roast duck goodness. Duck fried rice pretty decent, lacked some flavor. We had to order extra buns because it was just that good! Put some hoisin sauce on it, slab on some roast duck, pickled carrots and radish you got yourself a delicious sandwich. There were 3 of us and we weren't even close to finishing the roast duck or fried rice. We all really liked it. Not 5 stars because the service could of been better. Had to ask a few different servers for napkins, etc.
