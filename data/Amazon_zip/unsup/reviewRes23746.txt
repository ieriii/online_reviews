All I can say is mmmmmm. Not your average creperie, that's for sure! All of their crepes are prepared right then and there with fresh ingredients. I always get the same thing because I can't seem to change and take the chance of maybe being disappointed.  I get the Chicago Crepe which comes with avocados, muenster cheese, sundried tomatoes (although I always opt out of including these), roasted bell peppers, sunflower seeds, fresh cilantro (my favorite spice/herb), scallions and organic mixed greens. The crepes also come with a yummy diced chicken soup. It's always the perfect size, even though it's stuffed with all those goodies. Their dessert sweet crepes are also a treat, so give that a try!  With the nice location close to the Lincoln Park beach, fruit smoothies and lots of fun middle-eastern-looking lamps, it is a favorite of mine! It's so good they opened a newer location in Andersonville. Shhh don't tell but I like them better than the streetside crepes I have eaten in Paris! :X
