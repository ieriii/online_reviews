I went last night. Food was excellent, had the bone marrown on toast to start off and pork belly and fries. Decent portions for the price. Cook just right. Atmosphere is nice, the crowd is mostly young professionals, lots of attractive people, well it was nice out too. Both my guest and I were very pleased. The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because the we waited for a while even with reservations and our table was still wet. Other than that, it was a satisfying meal. Will make go again soon.
