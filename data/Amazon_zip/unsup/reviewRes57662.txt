I've been going to Nuevo Leon since college days, oh, about 3o years ago! It's different. They've added a very modern west-wing and the small diner-like original east wing, IMHO, is still the best seat in the house.I've had EVERYTHING on the menu, but what I'm sweet on are the Alhambres (a skewer of marinated skirt steak, green peppe I r, and onions) grilled and a few char specks, with steak that is tender, moist and juicy. It comes on a large platter with Spanish rice and beans, some guacamole and a few corn tortilla chips embedded in the refried beans.About the only thing missing here, is seafood.I love, love, love their coffee and have it with my Mexican shish-ka-bob (Alhambres) platter. However, not one of my friends that I have taken to Nuevo Leon agrees with me. Perhaps I simply am reliving my youth by going there, so it's MY idea of home-cooking - Mexican style.Rick Bayless has done an excellent job of educating our palate to Mexican flavors and he puts out a spectacular table of delicious, nutritious, and beatiful dishes. But everyday Mexican is quite bland - much like American comfort food - and Nuevo Leon is like an old-friend or favorite sweater. Comforting and accessible.
