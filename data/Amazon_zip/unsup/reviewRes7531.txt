two words: HUGE PORTIONS. We were visiting Chicago with some friends and was recommended to try this local joint out. It was amazing Italian food. The food came out a bit slow.. but now i know why.. one dish must serve about 2-3 people! All our food was amazing.. even the cheesy dishes weren't too heavy. yum!
