I gave Mia Francesca a second chance last night, and I'm glad I did. I've been there before and left feeling like, "Meh...I've had better." That was due in part to the place being really overcrowded and the waitstaff seeming overwhelmed. I don't know if we came at a better time last night, but the place seemed busy without feeling claustrophobic. (I really think they might have taken out a table which was a great idea.) Everyone was having a great time including the wait staff, and our food seemed better, too. Also, I've recently realized that I have a gluten intolerance. (It's so trendy now!) Who knew that an Italian restaurant would cater to a gluten sensitivity? Not only did our waiter point out items on the regular menu that were gluten-free, he also brought over Mia Francesca's special gluten-free menu. He was super nice about it. I'm not sure I would be as understanding about people's weird food issues, but he was genuinely happy to help. What a great surprise. Mia Francesca is certainly not the most amazing restaurant in town in terms of innovation or fanciness, but they serve good food and provide excellent service. Oh, and the booze is might good, too!
