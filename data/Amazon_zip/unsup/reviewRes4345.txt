As far as mills go, this is not the greenest. But this is arguably the most beautiful and best preserved of Chicago's jazz age attractions. Painted gold frames, velvet curtains, and a brightly lit Schlitz globe provide atmosphere to a room already haunted by the memory of Al Capone. They can throw together a mixed drink with the best of them (I'd recommend some classics like the Manhattan or Tom Collins), though there are some more affordable options like PBR on tap. Some highlights are the late night jazz sets (just because it's open 'til 5 AM), Thursday nights with big band jazz and radio commercial re-enactments, and the Sunday night poetry slam. The quality of poetry is wildly erratic, but when it's on, it's on. The host and labor rights hero, Marc Smith, makes sure it's entertaining even on an off night. On a good night, there's a band that will imaginatively accompany your poem according to your direction (just imagine a poem about a factory...). On a really good night the poetry featured artist will fall victim to unforeseen circumstances and Marc Smith will humbly steal the show. It often gets painfully crowded during featured sets, but I'd also recommend stopping by during quieter hours after work just to soak up the atmosphere.
