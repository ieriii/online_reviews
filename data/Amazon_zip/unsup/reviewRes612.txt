Alinea is easily the best restaurant I have ever enjoyed. The space is wonderful. Quiet with lots of room around the tables. The wait staff listen to you, make suggestions and write nothing down. An amazing show of skill! The food is endlessly engaging and provocative. Although portions are mostly one bite, by the time desert started I was full. The wine pairings were excellent. Sure it is expensive, but it is a true value.
