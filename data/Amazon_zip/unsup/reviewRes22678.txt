So, I'm sure I will be tarred and feathered for my forthcoming review. With that said, I wasn't extremely impressed with this place. My tilapia was just OK. Just so OK that I don't have anything remarkable to say about it. Of course, the number one reason I've heard to patronize Irazu is for their oatmeal shakes. My date and I were a tad confused when the waitress asked if we wanted it made with milk or water. Um, huh, yeah. Anyway, I wasn't blown away by their famous oatmeal shake. It wasn't thick and lacked that knock out punch I was waiting for. Perhaps my expectations were to high. I will say, my date's dinner was very tasty. He let me have a few nibbles of his steak.
