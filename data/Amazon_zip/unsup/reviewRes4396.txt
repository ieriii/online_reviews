Although a Miami native now, by way of Chicago I felt that I had to share a true Chicago gem. A speakeasy from the '20's, it is rumored that behind the bar where liquors bottles are displayed exist two tunnels leading to the street in case the cops raided the place back in the day, Green Mill is a "Must See" for those of you who love great, and I mean great Jazz. The place really gets bumping around midnight so be sure to get there by then to avoid a line and be aware there is a cover but not one that breaks the bank and the music is well worth the cost! Inexpensive drinks are served quickly with a smile and the place is off the beaten path far enough that you'll find mostly locals enjoying themselves. A tiny, dark, old school Jazz bar where the drinks are poured fast and heavy and the music keeps you moving well into the night!
