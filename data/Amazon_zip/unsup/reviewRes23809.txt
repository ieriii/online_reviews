I've been eating here for years and take almost all out of towners here for a reliably great meal. Just wanted to zero in on the Oatmeal Shake. I don't even like oatmeal and the first time someone described this to me i thought, I will never even try that, but alas . . . it is indeed the best thing ever and everyone I take here agrees with me. Coupled with the milanesa sandwich, I'm in heaven.
