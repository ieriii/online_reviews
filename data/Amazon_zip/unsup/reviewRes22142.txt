I rarely eat in the restaurant, but when I do go it's in the summer on the patio. Their delivery has yet to let me down. It's always packaged securely and neatly :) As a creature of habit I always order the potato tacos and a hibiscus tea. From time to time the empanadas and they're gooooooooooooooood.
