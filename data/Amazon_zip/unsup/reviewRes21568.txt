taco salad and margaritas.... delicious- came here sat. with my good friend kristin c for a margarita.... this quickly turned into lets get a pitcher and hang. later on we decided that we should have dinner... I love a taco salad, and although there was lots of meat in it, it was mighty delicious.... and not too bad on the wallet either. thank you mayan palace... solid mexican food! delicious margarita and great service!
