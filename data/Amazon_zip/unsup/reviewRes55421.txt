I went to Sprout with 2 of my girlfriends on Sat night and it was FANTASTIC. I'm an avid Top Chef fan so I had *expectations* --and shockingly, our experience surpassed them! We did the 3 course prix fixe ($60) which is really the way to go as the pricing will end up about the same as if you did it a la carte, and you get the additions between courses of shaved ice / sorbet, a cheese course (which was a delicious take on a croque monsieur) with a wonderfully paired sauv blanc. I had the licorice salad, rabbit pierogis, & the butternut dessert with whiskey gelato. Everything was well prepared, presented, seasoned, and interesting. Different in a GOOD way. We also brought our own bottle of wine and paid a $15 corkage fee -a fantastic option as well. I will *definitely* be coming back to Sprout! The location is a bit odd, but it's well worth the trek. Recommended 100%! Worth the $$$ if you're a foodie!
