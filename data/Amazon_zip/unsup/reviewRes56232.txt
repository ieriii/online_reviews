This place is so good and the service is excellent too. The owner is very friendly and very nice. The Beef soup (Pho) is delicious and the portion is very generous as well. For 10 dollars, you will get a big bowl of beef soup with rice noodle, a cup of lemon ice tea and a fruit dish. Moreover, this place is BYOB too. I will come back again for sure.
