For some reason, I find myself craving Indie Cafe at least once a week, more so than any other restuarant. I LOOOVE the red and green curry, I can't get enough of it, and would eat either one everyday if I could. I've dined at the restaurant once (during lunch) and was pleased to find out about their lunch special including soup, appetizer, and entree for an affordable price. They deliever, which is perfect, but one time they ended up forgetting my sweet potato tempura maki and I had to call back to tell them. I expected something free or a coupon to use later but got nothing. I was a little disappointed but not enough to stop eating here. Try it! Everything I've had (miso soup, egg rolls, pad thai, various veggie makis, red curry, and green curry) has been amazing.
