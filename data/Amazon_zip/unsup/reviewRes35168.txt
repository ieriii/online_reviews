I read about and heard about the duck, so me and some friends went there to try it. I will say the duck is pretty good. I didnt eat a lot of it but it was pretty good. But that was pretty much all that was good. They left and came back with duck soup, it was okay and some duck fried rice, way way way to dry. I ordered some soy sauce chicken, which was nothing special and I was not expecting the bones to be in the chicken. The egg rolls were good. The service could have been better. The dim sung and noodles were also just okay. I dont think I will be going back. I will stick to China town for Chinese food.
