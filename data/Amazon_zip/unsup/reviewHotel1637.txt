Hmm...not so sweet the second time around. I was in town for a wedding and chose to splurge and get a hotel room for two nights. I had multiple offers from friends to stay with them to save $$ but I wanted to do this. Should have stayed w/ friends. Don't get me wrong, I still like this hotel, it just lost its luster from my original experience. I booked my room about a month beforehand on Orbitz and it was still a shit ton of cash-ola. Two nights was $367. Yikes!  Check-in and check-out are a breeze, if you pre-pay.  The room was very clean and the a/c worked lovely.  But the bed was definitely not what I remembered it to be. It was like, lumpy or something.  Maybe it had been used a lot....? (gross.)  I do love the mirrors in the room. You kinda have to see it for yourself. So all in all, it's a nice hotel with the fun perk of wine happy hour. Who doesn't love that??!
