The food is good at XOCO, I understand why people like it, but it is just not for me. Not when there are so many great Mexican joints in the city. I've been here 2X (tried one other time but didn't want to wait an hour in line), I do love the desserts, I will tell you that. And, I have not tried the salads yet or the soups - just had 2 different sandwiches.  1) I don't know how many people have an extra 25 minutes to wait for a sandwich at noon on Tuesday. But I generally don't.  2) The sandwiches are on really, really thick bread and I cannot bite into these giant, crusty sandwiches. I usually end up getting my hands covered in spicy, braised chicken and then I just remove the bun and eat the meat with my fork. But the chicken is good.  3) I am not thrilled with the way everything works. I stand in line to order... but a server brings my food... but I have to get my utensils from a second location... but no one told me to grab my own utensils when I ordered.... and then my pseudo server informs me that they won't get me a fork.... so I have to get up and retrieve my own utensils once my food has arrived. On a positive side, it is fun to see Rick Bayless. The place is super clean. The food is fresh and tasty. It is just not the type of dining experience I am looking for, I'd rather go to one of the other Bayless restaurants.
