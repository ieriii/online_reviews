This place is so unpretentious with a VERY talented and passionate chef and staff. What a gem. This is a place for foodies. The BYOB is a definite plus - it's what brought me here. I love great food but at times the formality can be a bit boring. This place delivers with fantastic food, simple ambiance and passion. You can feel it, you can taste it.  We did the 7 course menu, my vegetarian husband had essentially the same flavors as I did sans the meat, which was great. My favorites were the scallops, lamb and hands down the eggs Benedict dessert. I still think about the dessert..... If you're in Chicago make a reservation ahead of time, it's a great food experience.
