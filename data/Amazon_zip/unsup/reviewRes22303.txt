Horchata milkshake, I don't know why I never thought of it before. I also have no idea why Irazu calls it an Oatmeal shake. But hey, they can call horchata, milk, cinnamon, and ice cream whatever they want as long as they keep making it. The other item I tried was the sweet plantain empanada. Though the shell was expertly cooked, a riper plantain selection would have made a world of difference. This would have allowed for a softer, sweeter center filling. Irazu has potential for 5 star greatness. I have a feeling that if I came back and tried more items, the variety, quality, and lack of corkage fee would win me over for the fifth star.
