Went here for their hotel style brunch. REEEEDICULOUS!! Absolutely amazing. I can't stop thinking about it. They are not messing around when it comes to brunch. Everything you could possibly imagine including: oysters, crab, sushi, lobster pot pie, build your own omelettes, crepes, waffles, a sweet table to die for and much much more. They also have a build your own blood mary bar and three different kinds of mimosas. Worth every penny. Also, definitely still ok to bring someone who's not into seafood as there is a hot bar with most things not fishy plus a carving station.
