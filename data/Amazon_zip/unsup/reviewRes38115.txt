I am not even a big beer fan and I LOVE this place. The mussels are great. They come with homemade shoestring fries and an alioli that is addictive. We got the sausage sampler with the white beans with pancetta (since we just had fries with the mussels) and I am GLAD we did. The white beans were WAY more delicious than I could have expected! I also tried the strawberry and duck confit salad. Delicious too. Mac and cheese? You guessed it, delicious. I love this place.
