Great spot for a first date or just a simple meal. Decent wine list for their cuisine. Service is friendly but rushed...you get the feeling they just want to flip your table and seat the next guest before you have your first bite. Food is basic Italian...nothing remarkable. Just comfort food...I continue to go back for that reason alone.
