Alliance gets 5 stars on the 2 custom cupcakes they made for my birthday. A Hello Kitty Red Velvet and a Cheetah Print Chocolate Marshmallow. My Boyfriend surprised me with these and ever since- I am addicted to gourmet cupcakes. We now drive to alliance at least once a month to pick up Red Velvet and Strawberry Lemon Cupcakes. My step dad also loves their cookies. The designs on my custom cupcakes were so adorable and yummy. Alliance is amazing and far better than Sprinkles. Give them a try!
