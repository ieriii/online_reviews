Are you feeling adventurous, but are you not quite yet at the level of Bear Grylls?!?!? (yes, you know him....he is the 'man' in 'Man VS Wild'....sleep in a camel's skin freshly skinned, drink his own urine to stay hydrated and so on...good stuff. Great TV.) I suggest for the thrills seekers the cow penis pho. Yep. For real. But no worries. Tank knows how to accommodate the rest of us, and offers the most extensive pho options I have seen so far in Chicago. Whatever type of meat you are craving - at least in the beef realm - you'll find it here, and with an impressive list of options you can create the perfect noodly bowl every time. And the word is definitely out. Thursday at 1 = super packed restaurant. I went this time with the sliced beef with meat ball supplement and it was divine. I loved the broth, flavorful and just beefy enough, and the mountain of noodles it came with. Sauces, chop sticks, spoon, silverware and napkins on the table, communal style. You get what you need. Winter paradise. Taro smoothie to tag along, and a trip to the nearby bakery to end the meal.....I think I just need to move to Vietnam.
