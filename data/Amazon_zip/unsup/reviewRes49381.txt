I love this place. The sleek, modern decor always makes me calm after a long day at work. I like to pretend I know a lot about wine but I am really a wine impostor. So the wine flights here make me feel like I am more knowledgeable than I really am. The sexy reds is my favorite. They also offer gift baskets of full bottles for many of the flights. I am also a fan of the food. I have had several of the pizzas and the pepper crusted swordfish is to die for. The desserts here are well worth saving room for. They had a goat cheese 'cheesecake' that made me want to lick the plate.
