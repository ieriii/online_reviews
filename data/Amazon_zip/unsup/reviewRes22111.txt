Fun and historic location. The food ain't bad, either.  Burgers are great, hot dogs are fantastic, but you must try the Whoopskidawg! It is perhaps the most perfect polish sausage sandwich ever created. Perfectly grilled sausage, tangy BBQ sauce and grilled onions on some kind of magical onion bun. Pure heaven. The only downside is the cramped foyer where you order and wait for your food. Of course, you can always stay in your vehicle and let the food come to you! Just go already!
