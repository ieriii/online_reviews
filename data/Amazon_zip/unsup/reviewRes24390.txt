Some reviews are so hard to write without just seeming redundant but I still feel compelled to share my love of Irazu. I can't say I know my authentic Costa Rican but if this isn't it, then that country needs to take a lesson from these guys. Warning it's definitely no longer a "hidden gem" as you may have noticed from the reviews but they will get you in if you want the full experience otherwise there is always delivery.
