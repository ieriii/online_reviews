yum... i'm more of a thin crust kind of girl but ginos just always know how to hit the spot. I went with my BF and a couple of other friends and we loved it so much we went twice in our week long trip. they know how to make a good pizza. everything is good. the salads, all the pizzas... yum. i wish i were in chicago right now!
