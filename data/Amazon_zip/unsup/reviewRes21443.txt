Rick Bayless truly is a culinary genius as people have mentioned before. We LOVED this place! It was unique, fairly priced and something sooo delicious and out of the ordinary, that I cannot wait to go back again. We loved the tortas!!! yum yum yum. I had the goat, yes the GOAT one and it was a Saturday special, it was tender, sweet, absolutely incredible. I want to go back and try all the other tortas because they were THAT Good. Now onto the churros with the rich, chocolate dipping sauce. Not quite like the ones I had in Madrid, but pretty darn good for Chi-town! Mouthwatering, everything was to the nines. I am counting the days until I can come back again. The only downfall was waiting in line but I can't even take off a start considering the food totally makes up for it. There should be a XOCO in the northshore suburbs as it would do very well. So get on it Rick, make your magic happen up here :)
