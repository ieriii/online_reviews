We started off with a few mojitos and sangria, and then warmed up to some yummy appetizers: Grilled Calamari, Plantain w/ Guava Paste and Arepa Rellena.....mmmmmmmmmmm! The calamari was by far some of the best grilled calamari I have laid my tongue on. Iberico has some competition when it comes to squid!!! When my Bandeja Paisa was put in front of me my eyes started to water. I love marinated rib eye, the fried pork reminded me of lechon, the rice, beans and fried egg were the icing on the cake. Man oh man, it was quiet at our table for quite some time, except for a few "mmmmm"s, "oh my God"s and "You want to try this?"s. I couldn't save room for dessert because I couldn't stop eating. Our leftovers made some killer steak and eggs the next morning. Service was attentive, I love the tiny menus, and the FAQs were entertaining as well. Next time, it's more fried pork and perhaps the seafood route. Sorry Tango Sur, but you just got bumped down......
