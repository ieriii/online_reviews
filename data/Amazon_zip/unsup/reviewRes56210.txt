Love this place! It's a great location and I love the atmosphere. I've been going there for years to meet up with friends, for lunch, dinner, coffee or pastries. I'm not sure if they make their own pastries but I went there last week and noticed they had macarons, I bought some not really expecting anything and I was gladly surprised, good job to the person who made them! I have tried macarons all around Chicago and would have never imaged I would find the best at a Greek cafe! Besides that they also have surprinsingly great pizza! As well as great tiropitas, zambonopita etc And feel free to try their Greek pastries with a vissinada ( greek cherry drink) they are very good.I will be going back for years to come.
