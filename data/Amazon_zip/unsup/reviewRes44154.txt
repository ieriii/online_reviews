For a while I was obsessed with Macarons, and Alliance was my go-to spot when I wanted a bit of Macaron delight. But who am I kidding, I still love Macarons and I love that Alliance has a nice selection of inventive flavors for Macarons. I've had cupcakes and quiche from here and they have been consistently good. I wish they'd put more passionfruit cream in their filled passionfruit cupcake, but that's just cuz I'm a sucker for anything passionfruit. So that being said. Me lovey the passion fruit Macarons! My all time favorite here at Alliance. I love the tart and sweetness of it, the little crunch of the meringue shell and the bit of chocolate that complements so very well. The most recent time I visited I tried the balsamic fig Macaron--reminiscent of a fig newton, but so much better and so much more adult. Lime coconut, raspberry, vanilla--my other go-to's when I'm treating myself to Macarons. Friendly service. They seem to love it when my eyes open wide and I say Ooooooh, when they describe one of the pastries/desserts I've asked about. So sad that I don't live very close. But it's always worth a stop when I'm in the area.
