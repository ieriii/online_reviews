One of the great things about living in Chicago as opposed to Clearwater, FL (our previous haunt), is the wide array of delivery available. After getting home from work I wanted Thai style peanut sauce, but didn't want to go out. HA! No problem, enter Opart Thai House. Food was better than average for a dine in Thai place and way above average for anything I've ever had delivered. As others have said, took about an hour to be delivered. Not cheap either. Food + deliver + tip was something like $45. Although, we do have a tendency to over-order when we try a new place. I ordered the chicken satay. Great. A healthy portion, well spiced and lots of hibachi grilled flavor. Also, peanut sauce lovers chicken. Enough for two meals, nice peanut sauce, cashews a plus, very spicy. My wife got the Tom Kha soup. Not her favorite, too fishy. Fish balls (hahahahaha)and crab rangoon - both of which she really liked. The food was good, not amazing. That and the fact that it was pricey keep me from giving it a 5-star review. Will def. eat here again. Best delivery I've ever had.
