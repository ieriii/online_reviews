Reserved 3 rooms this past weekend(5/18/12-5/20/12) for a bachelor party in the city. Rooms themselves were fantastic. Although I received the WORST customer service of my life. I had to call three time during the week to put my friends names on each room so they could check in early. Every time I called they said my name was still on the rooms. I had them change it twice and when my friends got there to check in, my name was STILL on the rooms. I was also told I would get a discounted rate with 2 free breakfasts for EACH room. When my friends checked in, the discounted price was only on one room and it had to changed to all three. I booked these rooms all together and I had the confirmations stating the prices. When we tried to get the 2 free breakfasts on Saturday morning they said it was for only one room. I asked to talk to a manager and expressed what I was told over phone and she told me that was not what was said and basically called me a liar. What happened to the customer always being right? I mean I was trying to scam anyone, just trying to get what I was told I was I supposed to get. Upon checkout, the front desk person tried to charge me for 4 rooms when I only had 3. I thought we were good once I told him I only had 3. Well when I got home and checked my account, I had 4 charges from the Holiday Inn. We spent a good deal of money at this hotel and did not get the service we should have been given. I am very disappointed with this hotel. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn again!!!!! Terrible!
