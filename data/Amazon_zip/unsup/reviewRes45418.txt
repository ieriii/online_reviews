As has already been mentioned, this place is beautiful and the fires in the fireplaces made a dreary day a feel all cozy. The food was good--standard pub fare. I had the Wilde burger--the carmelized onions were AMAZING. So yummy. I thought the service was outstanding. Bryan was our waiter at lunch. He was funny, very attentive (but not too in our faces) and the food came out quickly. I had four refills on my diet coke and didn't have to ask (and it came with a lime--can you ask for more?). The whole staff was friendly and fun. It's a bit pricy for lunch--a lunch menu would make it easier for me to eat there regularly. But I'll be back. UPDATE: I've been back several times since my original review and continue to be really happy with this place. Yesterday, my friends and I went and sat in the library by the fireplace and drank Irish Coffee. It was soooooo delicious. I'm updating my review to five stars because they're consistant and they're good. I love this place.
