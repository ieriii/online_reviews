I should have known better. I mean, I'm a 7th-generation Southerner, yet when some out-of-town friends wanted to come here, something possessed me to order the Southern Fried Chicken. At Grand Lux. In Chicago. In the most touristy 'hood imaginable. I knew it probably wouldn't hold a candle to the real deal that you'd get at a place like Bubba's Cooks Country in Dallas, but I at least expected it to challenge the Popeye's Chicken across the street off Michigan Avenue. No dice--this was just sad. The breading and skin was crispy, but was just "meh" in flavor. The meat of the chicken was rather flavorless and seemed undercooked in places and overcooked in others. Damn! How do you screw that up in both ways! It should be a plus that they gave me five pieces. Yes, FIVE, but damn, son--quality over quantity rules in my book. Can I trade in five bland pieces for three great pieces?? It came with mashed potatoes, and what sort of Southerner serves that up without gravy? None, that's who. Our waiter was a trip, but when I asked if they had gravy back there, he took my tentativeness as shyness and joked with my friends about it. Naw, dude, I'm asking if you have for-real gravy, not if you have au jus or something you're going to try to pass off as gravy. I dunno WTH he brought out, but that mess was not gravy. Don't be trying to fool me with that concoction. I'd have given it three stars for just being so-so, but coming back from the ladies' room, I nearly wiped out. There was grease all over the floor in front of the kitchen, and I flailed like I was tap-dancing on black ice, but somehow magically avoided busting ass right there in full view of everyone. Clean your floors! Anyway, no reason to eat here when there are dozens of restaurants around without mediocre food. Hell, go to Popeye's.
