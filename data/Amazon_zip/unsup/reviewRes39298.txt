Longman & Eagle is a perfect neighborhood gastropub. Everything it does, it does well but the highlights are the craft cocktail and spirit menus and meat dishes. I don't enjoy meat very much but Longman & Eagle's menu always begs that I order it and so far I've always been glad I have. Most recently, I ordered venison sausage -- a small plate, which I ate as my entree -- and it pretty much blew my mind. As great as the food and cocktails were, it was the service that made the meal. I told my server about my specific food allergy early on and rather than just passing my special requests to the kitchen, she seemed like an advocate and the kitchen staff seemed to be thinking about how to make my experience as good as any other. This stood in contrast to many restaurants, which can make me feel like I'm ruining their masterpieces with my bothersome restrictions. I agree with other reviewers that brunch is great. (I had duck hash.) Dinner gave me a chance to try more dishes. It was well worth the long wait for a table (which just allowed more time for cocktails).
