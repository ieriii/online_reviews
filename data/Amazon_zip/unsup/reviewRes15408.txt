We had a blast! Maybe because we went on a Sunday night... there was more than enough room for them to accommodate us. I didn't find it overly pretentious and except for the Host's initial "We aren't even talking to the party of 9 as of yet", we received great service.  I adored the high backed chairs but feel that the overall space was a bit barren compared to the lush opulence I've come to expect from the 20's vibe. The drinks were a bit intense but tasty nevertheless.
