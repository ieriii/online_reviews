Lockdown is awesome! My friend and I were planning on going to Kuma's Corner, but the line was so long we decided to give Lockdown a try. I am so glad we did! We had no wait for burgers just as good as Kumas and great service. I had the "conjugal visit" and I will never think of a turkey burger the same way. It was juicy, fresh, and tasted darn good. I will definitely be going back to try other burgers!
