Despite the fact that I broke 3 of their "House Rules" while having 1.5 drinks at this bar, I still feel obligated to give it a 5 star rating. The wait is long and the drinks are not cheap. Do not bring a loud, rowdy group of friends (this will lead to rule-breaking). Do bring a hot date. Do take a business associate (one with a bit of hipster swag).  The drinks are strong, and the eccentric ingredients that go into them are great conversation starters.  Very knowledgeable and passionate bartenders.  For those that appreciate the art of mixology, I'd say this place is a must-visit.
