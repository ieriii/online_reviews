For a restaurant situated on Michigan Ave, land of every tourist that comes to Chicago - this place was right on for tapas. great menu. great drink selections, great staff. Order the tapas: Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates w/ Almonds were awesome. Spanish Omellette needed some help but everything else was awesome. Spicy Potatoes were great too!
