My dad recommended this place while on a roadtrip - we went with it even though he last ate there about 30 yrs ago... Anyway, got a Veggie deep dish and it was amazing. (this is a joint yelp acct) One of us hates pizza and hates cheese - and yet fell in love with this pizza. The cheese was something else altogether - quality was insane. We split the pizza and it lasted us the rest of the day as we drove from there to South Dakota. Waited outside in the rain for 30 min, but it was SO WORTH IT! Jaleel White signed his pic inside so I meann......gotta be good right?
