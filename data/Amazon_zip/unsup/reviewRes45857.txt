The concierge at the hotel sent us here because "it's a Chicago favorite," which I now have a hard time believing. Neither of us live anywhere with a Grand Lux Cafe, so we had no idea it was a chain, let alone a subsidiary of Cheesecake Factory. So, full disclosure, had we known we wouldn't have eaten here even if you bribed us. I appreciated the waiter's and the chef's willingness to accommodate my dietary requirements (gluten free). I didn't appreciate that every single salad dressing had wheat in it, including the vinaigrettes, which really blows my mind. Why on earth do you need to add wheat to a vinaigrette? What does that accomplish, besides making my one "safe food" at most restaurants remarkably UNsafe. I also didn't appreciate the waiter's attitude when I told him my steak was terribly tough. You know what's unnecessary? Insinuating I don't know anything about steak, therefore am not qualified to tell you that I have to chew my steak 3x as long as I should just to get a bite down without choking. Step off, dude.
