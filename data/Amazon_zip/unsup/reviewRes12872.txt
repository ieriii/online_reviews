Dandy little spot. Nothing really to say that others haven't so I'll just add my 2 cents: Only ever been here for breakfast - I love the chorizo eggs benedict, they're delish.. My service has always been very good and the quality of the food has been pretty consistent as well. Reasonably priced too.
