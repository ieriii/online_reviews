I went here Sunday night and enjoyed myself. The staff is quick to clean the tables after each course, and refill water. I did NOT like how ice wasn't included with the water though. I DID like how trendy and intimate the place was. The food was really good too (not much of a sushi person)... On the pricey side. For dessert we got some type of icecream that i've never had before... it was good. The music was loud, but i could still have a conversation with the person next to me. I would go back! :)
