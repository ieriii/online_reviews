Finally! A good bi-bim-bop that's close to home. They call it a "buddha bowl", but whatever. It had a good amount of flavorful bulgogi and great vegetables and a good hot sauce. Also, the BBQ wings were awesome. Sticky sauce with an interesting flavor on large meaty wings- what's not to love? Cash only, and a bit pricey but worth it.
