This place has absolutely no air conditioning I was Melting just waiting for my carry out order I can't imagine wanting to pay $$ to sit in this disgusting heat with pizza ovens running! I feel absolutely horrible for the staff that has to be here for 8+ hours and it probably contributes to less than perfect service
