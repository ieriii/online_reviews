having grown up with a lot of great veggie options, I expect great veggie food. I heard great things about Chicago Diner, and was looking forward to the experience. the food is good, but not great. service can be slow at times, and its not a place to go if you are in a rush. but overall good veggie meal and great vegan shakes
