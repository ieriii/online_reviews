Oh Mayan Palace... the Mayan Chimmy is my weakness. This place has great food and delicious, strong margaritas. I believe it's family owned and the waitstaff always seems like they're running in 12 different directions at the same time, but they always take very good care of you. Prices are reasonable and I've never been disappointed here. If you want a unique experience, walk through the little door to the left of the bar... it leads to a really nice back patio area that is enclosed during the winter. It gets a little loud back there, but it's a fun, unique dining experience.
