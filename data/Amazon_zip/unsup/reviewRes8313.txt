This place is pretty hyped, so I had pretty high expectations. We had a reservation for 6:30 on a weeknight. By the time we arrived there was a large group of people waiting for their tables, about a 45 minute wait to sit outside but we were able to be seated right when we arrived, we sat inside which was fine with me. The menu is pretty small, with apps, salads and pizzas (both red and white), there are no meat or pasta options. We ordered a bottle of wine, and had absolutely NO help from our young waitress. She seemed "put out" by the fact that we were asking for her suggestions. Um okay??? So we just picked one ourselves. I ordered a grilled calamari salad as an app, it was just ok, nothing special. I picked a red pizza, the white pizzas on the menu looked good... I just have to have red sauce on my pizzas, I always feel like something is missing on a white pizza. I picked the sausage and mushroom (a pretty standard pizza choice for me). It was just good. Since it is a wood-fired style pizza it comes out of the oven charred/burnt on the bottom. Not sure that I love this style, to me the burnt flavor overpowers the pizza, but the crust had a chewy and crunchy thing going on which I did like. The pizza was seriously lacking in the topping department, I was there with 6 people and all of our pizzas barely had any toppings. This was probably the most disappointing part of their pizzas. NOW, back to the service... It continued to be terrible through the meal, we basically had to yell and wave for the waitress in order to get her over to our table.  I will not return to this place, I would rather try other pizza places in the city. Or will go to Pizza DOC, which is a similar style pizza but is better.
