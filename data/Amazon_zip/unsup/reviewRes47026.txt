I really like this place. The food is delicious and the artwork and decor is really nice. My complaint is it's deceptively expensive. I feel like this is a casual eatery and accordingly would be not so expensive, but the bill is always much bigger than I thought. One thing that bothered me recently was when I asked for some pickle slices for my daughter, I was charged $2.50. Am I wrong for being angry about this? I thought maybe a dollar, if at all. Errgh. This little thing has kept me from going back. I'm sure I'm being unreasonable. Someone tell me I'm being unreasonable and I'll go back.
