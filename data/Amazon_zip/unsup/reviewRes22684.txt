My second visit to Greektown in Chicago. Excellent food. Started off with the melitzanosalata, which was eggplant blended with garlic, olive oil, and other spices. Put it on their house bread, it was excellent. I even had a spoonful or two without the bread. For my dinner, I ordered half Vegetarian Moussaka, and half chicken riganati. The moussaka was an eggplant casserole, with potatoes, bechemel sauce, and also olive oil and other herbs and spices. The eggplant was roasted, and it was AMAZING! It complemented the chicken, which was baked with olive oil and herbs and spices. very succulent chicken! complemented the moussaka very well. One of the best parts actually was the baked vegetables that came with the meal. green beans, zucchini, onion and other veggies were drizzled in a tomato sauce. This was a top tier dining experience as well. everytime my water was not filled to the top, the busboy was there to give me a refill. same with my brothers coffee and my mothers wine and soda. I would recommend this place to anyone! they even have valet parking, so that is another plus. Probably one of the best meals I've had in the past 12 months. OPA!
