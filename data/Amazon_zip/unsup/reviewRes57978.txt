Very tasty, fresh food with a good wine selection. The servers are super attentive and make excellent recommendations. The only reason the 5th star is missing is because although I like olive oil and understand that it is an important ingredient in Italian cuisine, M.F. tends to overdo it a tad on most dishes. If you are deficient in your daily intake of mono and polyunsaturated fats for the day, you're in luck.
