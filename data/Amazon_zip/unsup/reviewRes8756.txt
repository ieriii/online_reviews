When I first heard about this place, with its imported ovens and buffalo mozzarella, I thought that it might be a lot of hype, but then I stopped in for a take out of their Margherita pizza! The thin crust, which has the crispness of a water cracker, is a perfect base for the fresh tomatoes and the wonderful mozzarella; none of that heavy tomato pasty spread on a doughy crust here! I went back for another of the same, but also needed a meat pizza for my husband, and the greeter recommended the Prosciutto e Rucola. He absolutely loved it! This, from a man whose usual favorite thin crust is the sliced roast beef from our neighborhood pizzeria! I'm looking forward to stopping in to try some of their other fare; from the feedback from other reviewers, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.
