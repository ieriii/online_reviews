I love this place.. the owner comes to the table and describes what is in each dish. That definitely adds a cool personal touch to the experience! Its also BYOB, which I love, because there is nothing I hate more than wasting money on a whole bottle of wine and ending up not liking it. Everything I've had to eat here is delicious and unique. The only thing I don' tlike about this place is the size.. its kinda small so expect to wait a little bit for a table.
