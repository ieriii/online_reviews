I work right near Artopolis, so I figured I'd try it for lunch. I've been twice now, and I'm inclined to give it a solid "meh." The interior is well finished in dark wood and pleasantly lit, and they have a good variety of lunch-y foods and desserts. Both sandwiches I've had here have been on the expensive side of a lunch for me (~$8 after tax), and came in large portions. In fact, the large portions are part of what's put me off of this place, as I left feeling overfull both times. As a frugal person, I hate wasting food, so over-sized portions that aren't easy to take away bother me. The sandwiches, one vegetarian with tomatoes and mozzarella and olive tapenade, one with mixed lamb/beef meat, veggie ratatouille, and tomato sauce, were both pretty tasty. The two available side dishes, not so much. The pasta salad was overcooked and flavorless, and the potato salad was drenched in some kind of sour-creamy substance that obscured the other flavors.  I also got a piece of almond baklava to go, and it was my favorite of the things I had here, but again, really huge, easily two servings. That's less of a problem for a take away dessert, but I still felt like Artopolis was urging me to overeat.
