This hotel has the most beautiful lobby in all of Chicago. Guaranteed. I know because we visited every darn hotel in downtown Chicago looking for the best lobby to take wedding photos in. This idea was the perfect solution to a middle of July wedding where outside pictures would equal one sweaty bride, groom, and wedding party. The lobby has a beautiful fountain with lots of open windows that lets in lots of natural sunlight. Past the fountain, there is a whole wing that leads to the ballroom areas and it is beautifully decorated with damask carpeting, beautiful chandeliers, and furniture that is equally modern and classic. The moment we saw it, thoughts of the Drake and the Peninsula were out the window. Of course, we didn't just sneak in with 15 people to take pictures in this beautiful space, we stayed here too! We had an amazing suite with breathtaking views of the city. It was probably the nicest hotel room I have ever seen, and was also the perfect space for the getting ready wedding photos.... And of course, the perfect space for our wedding night. I also got to experience the spa and I had an awesome massage and a fabulously relaxing experience in the steam room. It was the perfect stress reliever the morning before the wedding! If I was a total baller and could have a platinum wedding at any hotel in Chicago, this would absolutely be the one. We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of this hotel's amazing space for photos and experience the luxury of this hotel for our wedding night. I am hoping we can make another visit on our anniversary.
