Good agua frescas and hot chocolate, avoid the jamon pressed torta--AT ALL COSTS. I love Rick Bayless, and had a truly great meal with friends around Christmas time at Frontera but that being said I was disappointed by the overhyped sandwiches at XOCO. I had the jamon made of proscuttio, avocado, black beans (couldn't taste them, I think they were just there for color), chipotle mustard and cheddar. The proscuttio was so tough that my teeth would not bite through it. I literally had to take the sandwich apart and cut the meat up (not easy in the crazy basket the sandwiches are served in). An avocado paste might be better that hunks of avocado, because with every bite a hunk of avocado would fall out and once again, I would have to reassemble the sandwich. Overly salty as well. The passion-fruit lime agua fresca was great as was the almondrados (chocolate with almond milk). However 19$? Seriously?
