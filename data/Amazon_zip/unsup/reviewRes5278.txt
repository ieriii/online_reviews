A piggy lover, I was giddy with excitement to finally try Purple Pig after months of lusting after its promise of porky goodness. While the menu does a great job in showcasing the versatility of this fine animal, the flavor profiles of all the dishes, when not overly seasoned (milk-braised pork shoulder was especially salty), are good but forgettable. The necessity for referring to a completely separate and long list of glossary terms to understand all the jargon in the menu is a bit pretentious; it's a good thing the ambiance is casual and service friendly. Definitely a fun place to go to with friends for the novelty of a head-to-tail focused restaurant, but don't expect to be blown away if you're used to eating various pig parts.
