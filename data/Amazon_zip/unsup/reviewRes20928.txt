we came here due to hype, reviews, and recs. it is a rick bayless restaurant. if you look at a picture of him, he looks like an accountant. after re-reading my review, it sounds harsh but that's just my experience. can't see how anyone can give it 5 stars... hmm.. ** this review is for breakfast **  iced coffee -- standard chocolate-espresso -- yummy, could really taste the espresso chips and salsa -- felt like they went to the grocery store, bought a    huge bag to distribute them in trays ham cheese empanada -- i've had many many empanadas better    than this (and from the front of grocery stores!) shame on you rick    bayless.. savory bread pudding -- this was the only thing that was enjoyable in    my book open-faced torta -- was like a slimy overeasy egg w/black bean, salsa,    etc on a small baguette. it was okay. churros -- um, i like costco churros better. i'm being serious!! WHY EVEN OPEN FOR BREAKFAST? you can get rid of the operational cost of 5 HOURS if you just open at 11. just saying...  i'm from california; we have delicious mexican food for a lot less ($$).  if you want better mexican options, come to socal. rick bayless and mexican food... maybe that's like bobby flay and southwestwern food.. and if you know what i think of bobby flay...i'd say, "lucky that you are in the right place at the right time." =p - - - might be that there's not much competition? so yeah...they can charge higher prices too. not impressed in the least.  guess i will have to update the review once i try the tortas for lunch but that won't be for a while since i left the city.
