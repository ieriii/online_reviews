firstly, this place was not professional from the entrance. i saw lot of people hanging around at the entrance, and was a long line just to get to the reception desk to talk to the people (it was not "crowded" but just simply not-efficient). people at the reception were not smiling, and i even felt that they were overwhelmed with what they are doing, which is not professional at all... we sat inside where we can see the outdoor seating view, and had a nice smiling waiter, but he was just handling too much job for himself. he was serving about 15 tables at once (one waiter for all the indoor seats), which is not his fault, but management's. basically, its management and their logistics of running the restaurant is extremely poor, and how the receptionist and their people running around the floor with the overwhelmed faces made me feel like that i was in some kind of high-school festival. this could be acceptable if it was a reasonably priced restaurant, but this place is supposed to be high-end and expensive. the food tasted okay, but not that great, and i would surely recommend Mia Francesca over this restaurant. i have no idea why people would want to go there dressing nicely for the dinner, it is just not worth it.
