I went there last night for the fried chicken special and was treated really well. It's true that the service is thoughtful and friendly, which sets a nice tone and gave me the courage to ask what "popcorn rice" was.  The cornbread was very yummy, and I am not a fan of cornbread normally. Theirs has a kick to it and resembles a muffin-top (like Elaine's idea from Seinfeld, not the overflowing flesh resulting from too-tight pants). Also, I had the spring vegetable creole which was tasty but there could have been more vegetables - both variety and quantity).  Next time I'd like to try brunch, and I was also intrigued by the violet tea on the drink menu. I'll go back.
