Best Pizza in Chicago, hands down. I am a pizza lover, so when I was told about Pequod's two years ago I couldn't wait to put it to the test. If I'm out seeing a movie it is at the Webster Theatre which is right across the street, so a pizza and movie night is perfect for me. I have read that some people think they have too much crust, but I disagree. It's delicious and the way it is served, each piece remains hot. Another thing, Pequod's is so reasonably priced. Worth every penny! They will even hold your leftovers for you until you get out of the movie!
