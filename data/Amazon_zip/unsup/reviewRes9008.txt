Went here last night with my girlfriends and really enjoyed it. We had Mark for our server and he was great. He was really nice, friendly and fast.  We started with some hummus (which was good) and then three of us had the Koubideh plate and another had the Joujeh plate. Everything was really good. The portions are great and everything was cooked well....except the white rice. The white rice that came out was sticky. They went ahead and gave us new rice when it was ready, and then Mark comped dessert b/c of it, without us even asking! I will definitely go again!
