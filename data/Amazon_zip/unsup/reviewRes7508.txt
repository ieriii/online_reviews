Was a little disappointed after all the great reviews. I will say the service was excellent. The atmosphere was very nice. Pricing not too bad. But the most important part... the food... just was okay. I was with a group of five, we ordered a bunch of items and shared. We were all in agreement that everything was just okay. Especially with the main dishes, it seemed like they were sitting out awhile or something before they served us. Nothing was served as warm as it should have been. Probably will not go back. Feel like I could make better bbq type food at home.
