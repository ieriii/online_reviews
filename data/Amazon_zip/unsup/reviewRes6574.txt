there's something wonderful about chicago q. the ambiance of the dining room, the service, and bbq were exceptional. though the bbq is a bit pricey, it was worth it for the experience that we had. i'm a texan, born and raised, so i know a thing or two about good bbq. chicago q has good bbq. the kobe beef brisket was excellent along with the pulled pork. my husband ordered the kobe beef ribs and i ordered the baby back ribs. my ribs were fall off the bone tender. i prefer a little more bite to my ribs rather than it being fork tender. the kobe beef ribs were moist and had a smokey flavor. we also sampled the corn bread which was a little too dry for my taste. but what i enjoyed about chicago q is that they bring to your table their house made potato chips and pickles. both were very good. the pickles were especially tasty.
