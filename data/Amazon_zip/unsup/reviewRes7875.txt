Forget deep dish... Chicago should be known for THIS pizza. Spacca Napoli is a true neighborhood gem and I love that I'm able to walk off (some of) the calories on the way home--but it's worth a cab ride from anywhere in the city! Favorite dishes are the stuffed zucchini blossoms and burrata appetizers (usually specials) and the prosciutto and arugula white pizza! Everything that can be imported from Italy is... so its a great excuse to test out their reasonably-priced wine list. Don't forget to grab a free cannoli on your way out too, though they always seem to be gone by the time I leave!
