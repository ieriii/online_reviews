I LOVE THE MUSSELS AT HOPLEAF! I like coming here late Sunday afternoon with the husband, sitting in the bar at the front (at one of the tables), drinking great beer, and eating/sharing mussels for two with him. Good jazz music in the background, good beer, good food---who cares if it's a bit dark and collegey and the bar has many regulars---I'm with my true love sharing mussels and beer! The back dining room is good too. We went there once with the daughters for dinner (either a Mothers Day or a Fathers Day dinner) once. I liked it too. I had the most delicious enormous diver scallops! It's possible to order saugsages, and other things at Hopleaf, but I don't return for those things. My love affair with the Hopleaf began and continues due to the mussels and the beer selections! The service in the bar area---you get a seat someplace after showing your id to the guy at the door, then you go to the bar & order your beer & get a menu. Then you go back to your table. When you're ready to order food or more beer you go back to the bar and order from the bartender. If you order food, it will be brought to you by someone later. If you want to run a tab, you must leave your credit card with the bartender. The back room has a real wait staff, and you don't have to hand over your credit card.
