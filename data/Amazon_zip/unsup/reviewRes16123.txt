Total disappointment! Out with friends for a pub crawl starter and waited 30min for a waitress to acknowledge us. Finally we ordered drinks and waited another 30min for our drinks. To top it off gratuity was added because we had 6 in our group. While the atmosphere and drinks were tasty I still can't bring myself to give a good review. Had the waitress been more attentive we probably would have stayed and had more drinks.
