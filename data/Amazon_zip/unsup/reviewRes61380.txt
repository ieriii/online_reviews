I like Brazzaz! I have wanted to go for a long time because I went to a NYC restaurant with this style of food many years ago. It was great then and I enjoyed Brazzaz just as much. I was familiar with the concept so I lightly grazed the salad bar. I was saving room for the meat and it just kept coming. Wine by the glass was a good selection to go with all this meat. The service was good to excellent. I felt the lay out of the tables were ok and the food to be fresh. I just got a 1/2 price coupon for this place. It will definitely be used over the summer. I have not been to any of the other Chicago style restaurants with this concept. I found Brazzaz to be more than adequate
