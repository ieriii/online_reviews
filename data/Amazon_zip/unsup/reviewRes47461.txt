Burger lovers paradise! Some I'd the best combination of topping found in the city for a meat lover or burger. My favorite is called "Cruelty to animals!1" it s a burger with bacon, prosciutto, & roasted pork on a pretzel bun. DELICIOUS!! The great part is u can substitute any burger for a grill chicken breast. This comes in handy cause i tend to not eat burgers. Fries r ok, appetizers are very awesome. All around great place to eat a sandwich and grab a beer.
