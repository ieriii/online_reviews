We were going to another restaurant that does not take reservations and had an outrageous wait, I had been to Las Tablas once before so my boyfriend and I decided to go there last Friday night around 8. There was no wait, and several groups leaving, we were seated quickly and because we were so hungry I thought we had lucked out and would get to eat soon. Wow was I wrong. Approximately 20-25 min after being seated and making eye contact with about five waiters, as well as the hostess, one stopped at our table (which was the closest to the bar, by a door that allowed us to be ice cold the entire time, but that's a whole other issue) and asked if anyone had helped us, when I said no he shrugged, then got us a drink menu, disappeared for another ten. Finally put our drink order in, another ten we got them and quick ordered apps before he left again and... Got them 30 min later, when we decided that with the lack of attention already, we should order our food. Good thinking. An hour later, with little concern of our drinks, etc, we finally got our pork loin and rare skirt steak (ordered medium, but I guess it took so long to get it to rare, they didn't want to delay an extra few minutes).  Others who came in after us has entrees etc, we had to stare down our waiter to get more drinks while waiting, and once it was all said and done, had to wait more to get our check. I will say that the food was delicious, and i would understand if it were a packed house, it was not however and I'm positive we will not dine there again due to the service.
