I had a quick work dinner here on a Thursday night. Pretty hopping place even at 8 o'clock. I was confused by the system initially, but I think it makes sense to ensure that everyone has a place to sit if they actually plan to eat in. Basically, they hold up the line until seats are available. This way, no one is left standing with a tray of food. I ordered the Cubana torta. It was fantastic. It was a little salty, but that's what I expected. Next time I think I want to try a churro, they smelled delicious.
