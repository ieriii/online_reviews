My best friend (who lives in Chitown) and I decided to dine here in December of '08. As a woman from CA, it was quite cold but I was warmly greeted by a hostess who quickly offered to take my coat. I then met my friend at the bar for a pre dinner drink. The bartender couldn't have been more charming- very courteous without being fake. We then proceeded to the modern dining area to be seated in the semi back. My friend and I were certainly not the happiest about this- (I still question why you would place two single ladies -who are very pleasant looking, I may add, in the back) but we were actually quickly approached saying we were supposed to be at another table-(Not sure how I feel about this aspect of the dining experience). There is a huge center, which is a family style serving area in the middle- which we were quickly placed at. We then were greeted by a very sweet server, but kind of lacked on actually informing us on the process of how ZED451 worked. (By the way- there was NO mention of prices upfront, so only dine here if you are ready to spend some $$$). Since it's a 'sampling' restaurant, we definitely took advantage and took small bites of the bits that looked interesting. We then sampled meat that was personally brought around by the butchers. All in all, yes we spent a very pretty penny for our dining excursion but I will say we had a good time and very good meal!
