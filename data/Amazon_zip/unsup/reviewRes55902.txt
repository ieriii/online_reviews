I went to India house for my folks party yesterday.. One of the best if not the best indian food in downtown chicago area.. My only complaint is that the martini's were average and they could have more beer options.. Said that, The food was fantastic and so was the orange and mango kulfi.. I will be going back for the buffet soon and will update my review soon.. Go for dinner to India House.. You won't regret it...
