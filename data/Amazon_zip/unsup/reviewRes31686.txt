nice decor bright, lots of windows, corner building, very nice staff, no wait on most weekday mornings. I had the hemp rhubarb pancakes (real good) with a side of eggs. The orange juice is fresh squeezed. Great to have places like this opening up in the neighborhoods you might not expect. I'll be back
