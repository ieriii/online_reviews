This place is legendary. I love the architecture, the neon, the fact that old guys cruise here in their hopped up 49' Mercuries. To address the person who said this is like a Sonic, this place has been here since 1948, so I am not sure what you mean. Sonic is a take on places like this, not the other way around. I spent a semester in grad school researching drive-ins and roadside architecture for a paper.  Superdawg has great dogs, the best I've possibly ever had. The dog itself is bigger than average, and comes with all the typical Chicago fixins like mustard, raw white onions, relish, green tomato, and no friggin' ketchup. This may disappoint some, but that's a Chicago-style hot dog.  The fries are good, but are a bit on the greasy side. They seem like they are fried longer, or with more batter. I am not sure, and I bet someone else could explain this better. Its annoying that they don't take credit cards, but I know they want to keep things simple.  The shakes are good as are the burgers. I especially like that you can order a burger on dark rye bread. Its something a little different. Give Superdawg a try. its a little pricey for fast food, and parking is virtually non-existent, but its a cool place. Try to go at night too when the neon lights are on. That's probably my favorite part.
