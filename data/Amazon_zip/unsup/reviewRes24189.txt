My crepe was very good. Had a lovely atmosphere however, I thought that I was walking into more of a restaurant/cafe than a crepe cafe. If Icosium would have their menu posted outside or a sign that said the only sold crepes, perhaps I would have appreciated Icosium even more. Nevertheless, the do make very good crepes.
