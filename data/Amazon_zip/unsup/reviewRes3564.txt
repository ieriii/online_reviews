Came to Chi Town on a visit to see an life-long friend of mine. He lives in Lakeview and Crisp was easily within walking distance, so upon a recommendation he got from another friend, we decided to try it out.  Like most of the shops/retail spots in Lakeview, its a bit crowded - the decor seemed to be familiar, as if we'd seen all the furniture in pottery barn or some similar store. Regardless, it worked for function less aesthetics (it doesn't detract, but doesn't stand out either). I ordered a bowl - Seoul Steak Bowl - and my buddy ordered a Chi-Town Chicken Bowl. The food was made quickly as they called our names before we could finish selecting drinks, gathering utensils & napkins and finding a seat. The bowls are huge in their portion size, and come with a side sauce that it like a dressing but with spice. When combined, the flavors are rich, spicy and quite delicious. My bowl was beef, veggies, rice and spices. The flavor of the meat was quite unique (and tasty) and it was tender - not too chewy. As I ate, I noticed myself wanting to shovel more and more in my mouth and before I realized it I was: 1) stuffed and 2) had finished 85% of the bowl. This food was quite addictive. I'd love to go back here, next time I'm in Lakewood, to try their other dishes. Many people there were getting wings, which smelled and looked quite tasty. If you're in the area, stop in, you won't regret the choice.
