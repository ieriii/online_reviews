So, My friend Chris and I really enjoy scouring the city for new culinary finds, and Davanti Enoteca has been on our "to try" list for quite some time. Last night, we finally got around to making the trek to Taylor Street, (which, by the way, looks like it's hoppin! Next stop- Three Aces...) and we timed it right- at 6:45 on a Thursday night, we took the last 2-top- no wait. Lucky us! Unfortunely, we got table 13, (denoted by the big red "13" on our table top) which is kind of smack dab in the middle of the action. Davanti gets 4 stars overall- we started with 2 cheeses and 2 meats- all excellent. We were then greeted by Leon, who seemed to be a manager (?) and Leon brought over another truffle cheese that we had to try... awesome. Next we have the truffle egg toast w/ asparagus tips which was delightful, and next came the pizza D.O.C with sausage. The crust seemed a bit undercooked in the middle, but still delicious. Finally, we got the rigatoni with Sausage, which was also just....good. Not exceptional, and I was sadded to think that this small bowl of pasta with sausage was $10. I should have ordered the risotto, (the couple next to us did, and it looked amazing) but I will next time, because we definitely will be back. Service was excellent and Leon really made us feel very welcome.
