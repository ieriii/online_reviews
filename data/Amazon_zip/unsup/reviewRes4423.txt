I cannot over-emphasize how much I love this place. It is by far my favorite Prohibition-era speakeasy that I've ever been to. The atmosphere is so 1920s that you'll feel like you're dreaming. The bar is old, the wood is old, the cash register...this place is overflowing with old-school vibes. I'm not just raving about it because it was Al Capone's favorite speakeasy either, the music they play will easily get you swimming in the feeling. Be warned, though, they only accept either cash or Mastercard.  I loved the atmosphere, the bartender, the music, and the beer so much that I have vowed that I will never step foot in Chicago without paying a visit to the Green Mill. Can't wait to come back!
