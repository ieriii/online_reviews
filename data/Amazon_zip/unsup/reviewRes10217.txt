Maybe they should rename this place from "Piece" to "Wait". Not that I am complaining though. We managed to find a place to "wait" at the bar and chug a few locally brewed beers before our table was finally free. When the pizza's came out, the first thing I noticed was the thin crusts... wth? I was all set on my first chicago style pizze while in chicago and they bring me this ??? Not to worry. It still tasted awesome. We shared 2 pizza's between 4 of us and it was still way too much food. In retrospect I'm actually quite glad they were thin crust now... Also, whats with the 30 string guitar? Lol!
