This place is a regular spot of mine and back in the day, you'd usually just find Asians eating inside but now has grown to become the popular spot for many Chicagoans. They are known for their duck, crispy skin roast pork, BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken. I also enjoy their noodle soup dishes. You pick your noodle (either egg or rice noodle) and whatever extra ingredients you want...my usual is Rice noodle with wonton & roast duck. It's cheap although since they've moved to their new location, they raised the prices a little....but it's still cheap. If you must order fried rice at a chinese restaurant, I'd just stick with the Jumbo shrimp fried rice (not the regular shrimp fried rice). The beef and broccoli chow fun is also tasty. The service is not spectacular but most ppl that go here do not expect great service...we're just looking for good, cheap chinese food!
