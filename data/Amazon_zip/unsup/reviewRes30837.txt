It's a shame that I was disappointed with Nana. On paper it's the type of restaurant I normally love. I'm not a big 'organic' person but I love places that cook with local, fresh ingredients and present them in a modern way. The Publican, Vie, the Bristol...all done in a similar style but the flavors of those restaurants come through in the food. So what went wrong? Honestly, not much. But that's the problem...everything was just okay. I was expecting big, bold flavors but that's exactly what I didn't get. For the price and the overall experience that this place is looking to push, I don't feel the value is there. I liked my beer but only after it took 15 minutes to find it's way to my table. The service was noticeably slow and I'm a very laid back person when it comes to service. I definitely enjoyed my hanger steak but the vegetables that came with were cold upon first bite. Cold vegetables aren't something I brag to anyone about. The mac & cheese tasted like mac & truffles. Some people say that's not a bad thing but nana forgot to add cheese. It was like a mac & bechemel & truffle, which isn't what I was expecting. Had any mention of truffle been listed on the menu, I would have skipped that entirely. It overpowered the dish. Nana is not overly expensive but there are so many better options in the city for farm to table dining. The brunch looks promising and I may find myself back some day to try. Until then, dinner will be had elsewhere.
