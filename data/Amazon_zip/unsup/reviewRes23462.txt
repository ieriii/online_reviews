I haven't had many chances to experience Greek food, so I am not entirely familiar with true authentic Greek dining, but this place was really good as far as I'm concerned. First of all the have free valet for any customers dining at Greek Islands Restaurant which was great and super convenient. We were seated immediately in the dining area, which has a subtle and pleasant ambiance to it. The waiter that served us was really friendly, funny, and suggestive, though I was lucky enough to be dining with Greek friends so they helped with my decisions. We ordered the traditional saganaki for an appetizer (the "flaming cheese") which was surprisingly good as I didn't know what to expect. My friends ordered the authentic Greek gyro and I had what they call Pastichio. Ultimately, to me, it was the Greek version of lasagnan, and thankfully, it lived up to my expectations when it comes to a good lasagna. The portion sizes were perfect and I left satisfied without being overwhelmed. Overall the experience was above what I expected and turned out great. Free valet, friendly service, good prics, and great food.
