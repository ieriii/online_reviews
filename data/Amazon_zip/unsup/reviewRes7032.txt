Family Style Mondays? A great deal with a plethora of choices...$19.95 per person gets the table dishes to share. Luckily I was with some decisive yelpers, as I am fairly non-finnicky and generally am pleased with what others choose. This was no exception... Butternut squash soup: excellent Cesar salad: Eh. Nothin' special, could've been done better. Bruschetta: hmmm. Boring, but edible. I spilled a lot of chopped tomatoes into my lap. Fried Calimari: Very good, great sauce. Pesto/Chicken Gnocchi: Good, though the pieces of chicken were pretty big, probably better a bit chopped up to blend into the dish. Seafood something or other: It was well received, I am not partial to seafood so I opted out. Salmon: A bit undercooked, but if you drenched it in the dill sauce, it was OK. Tiramasu: Good, though a bit dry and in need of real cocoa. Overall: Pretty good bang for the buck. $20 and you'll be STUFFED. I'd say a great spot to take a large family group looking to keep price point down. However, the food is a bit lackluster and the service while friendly, was a bit scattered. Interior is cozy and cute, and I suggest snagging one of the billion mailer coupons they send out weekly... They offer free parking in the evenings just a block or two away at the Reproductive Genetics Institute on Halsted just north of Diversey. You just need to stop into see the host and she'll give you a parking pass to put in the windshield...meters can be found, but can be difficult.
