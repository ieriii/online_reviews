I'm embarassed (for Chicago) to say that I still haven't found deep-dish here that matches my expectations coming from Palo Alto... (Patxi's is kind of amazing), but so far, Gino's East has come closest. I like that there's more sauce on their pizzas, compared to their competitors. I actually liked the cornbready crust -- but I guess it's not for everyone.
