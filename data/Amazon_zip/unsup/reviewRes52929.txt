So, to paint the picture, I was invited by an old co-worker to join him about about 10 other people I had never met before... The night was already going to be interesting. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that if you're in a lively mood, this is the place to dine. It's BYOB and boy, did our table subscribe to that privilege... Luckily, the restaurant wasn't shy about supplying mixers and keeping our water glasses full so we could make it all the way through dinner. Now, before we go any further, let me say that I'm a vegetarian and so didn't get to try some of the goodies that people at our table ordered, but I heard nothing but "MMMmmm's" and "Oh man, you gotta try this!!" from the others I was eating with, so I know that's a good sign. Of course, about half the table ordered the oxtail, so clearly that's a winning favorite. I had the veggie plate and was impressed that even though it was humble fare, the taste didn't disappoint. It was simple yet flavorful, and I'm looking forward to going back for a more thorough investigation of their menu. Parking was a bit of a chore, although we did go on a Friday night at 8pm, so there's not much that can be done about that in an urban environment. The staff was helpful and in laid-back good spirits and all-in-all, other people at the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves. I will definitely be going back soon.
