Irazu's food in wonderful; but it is the staff and atmosphere that really put it over the top. I've been in multiple times during "rush hour" and am always just so impressed with the courteous and cheerful staff! BYOB's are priceless and it is just a 10 minute walk to the center of Wicker Park nightlife. Cannot say enough about the decor and music in the place and besides 90 Miles Cuban Cafe down the street and Piccolo Sogno on Milwaukee, might be one of the best place for open-air dining. Order the sandwiches/burritos for lunch and the tilapia for dinner- also, do not be scared off by a long wait. Put your name down on the wait list, walk over to Bucktown Liquors 2 blocks North (not the wine sommerlier next door- unless you want to pay a minimum of $40 a bottle) to pick out some BYOB action, order some empanadas to munch on outside while you wait, and chilllll!!! Also, don't sleep on their shakes... solid.
