This store is a field trip in itself! Even if I spend more time window shopping than buying, it's always a delight! There are so many different varieties of everything that we love browsing in there. The little cafe inside (not the restaurant) is great for a quick lunch or dinner that is delicious but doesn't break the bank. We have fun picking out an interesting soda and then eating dinner in there. I will keep coming back for certain items that are interesting or hard to find but the prices definitely won't have me doing my weekly shopping there. 2 tips: 1) there's free parking in the garage down the street on the other side of the road (towards Navy Pier) when you spend $20...that include dining-in! 2) BE CAREFUL pulling into the garage...my boyfriend almost had his oil pan ripped off the bottom of his car by the steep decline in the ramp. I went in my car and had the exact same problem...its a REALLY step decline into the garage....no matter the speed.
