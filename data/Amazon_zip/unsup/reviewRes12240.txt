This was my first (and thus far only) introduction to Cuban food. The menu is creative but highly accessible, and the food (especially the roast pork/carmelized onions/polenta tower-of-power appetizer that I felt compelled to bogart) is quite good. The atmosphere is upscale casual with a tinge of hipster (as you might expect at a place in the shadow of the Brown Line) and the food is cheap (most entrees under twenty bucks) for what you get. The service could have easily been more attentive -- the waiter seemed to forget to enter our entrees, which would have been fine (we were in no hurry) but in the rush to get our food out of the kitchen, he may have hurried a bit too much -- my bistec a la parilla (which I admittedly ordered rare) came out more or less raw. Female (and nontraditional male) readers should be advised that while our waiter's serving abilites were slightly subpar, his very appearance was the subject of much lustful gazing, so if that's an attraction, feel free to mentally append a fifth star to this review. In order to break the annoying style into which this review is devolving, this sentence contains no parentheticals whatsoever.
