After a day in the office, this is a nice place to unwind. A friend had gotten there early to get us seats out in the patio to enjoy one of the few remaining gorgeous Chicago days. With a view of Millenium Park sipping on the Spiced Cider Martini all is well. It was funny because the waiter said that the drink was good, and asked me how I liked it later and also said that he hadn't ever had it before. So, I caught him in a lie and he admitted it! It was pretty funny, but good thing I thought it was tasty! Anyways, we started out with the cheese fondue - it's brie by the way. It was good, but nothing special. It seemed like the regular burgers are pretty popular, but I had the peppered steak. It wasn't really peppery to me, but I did appreciate the combination with the pears and the blue cheese and purple cabbage. It's pretty neat for a gastropub. It's gonna be kind of pricey downtown, but what can you really expect?! Definitely, no daily specials here.
