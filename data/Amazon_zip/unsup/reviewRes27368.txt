Best pizza in the city in my humble opinion. I've tried every other big name place, but none of them really match up to what Pequods does, and it seems like everyone I take there/have eat food from there agrees. The whole concept of the crust being caramelized cheese sounds a little strange at first, but believe me, you get used to it after about oh, 1 bite. Also, they have a very good/cheap lunch special(at least they did the last time I was there). Places like this make me wonder why Pizza Hut and "pizza" places of that ilk are even still in existence.
