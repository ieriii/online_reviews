Pho Xe Tang (or Tank Noodle as we round-eye white devils like to call it) is one of the best places in Chicago for pho. The location is easy to get to via transit. Get off at Argyle and walk a block west. Pho Xe Tang is on the SE corner of Broadway and Argyle Every time I've been, the restaurant is always clean and well-lit. Lately I've noticed a preponderance of Caucasians here. Usually that's a bad sign for an ethnic place, but so far Pho Xe Tang hasn't changed their fare to accomodate a less adventurous Western palate. Here's hoping they don't in the future either. When it comes to the pho, the broth is hot and beefy, but light and sweet with only a touch of anise flavor. The noodles are firm and you get plenty of basil, lime, pepper slices and beansprouts on the side. I love the pho with everything (tripe is not that scary folks...), but for beginners or less intrepid eaters the pho tai is a great safe place to start. Each table has plenty of hoisin, hot sauces, fish sauce, soya, and sugar. So you can flavor your pho how you like. The portions are HUGE! So try the normal size offerings first. The initial service is good, but sometimes it takes a little long to get the check, but no worries, you'll have a full tummy of pho! If you're looking for comfort food, definitely check out Pho Xe Tang. TANK NOODLE!
