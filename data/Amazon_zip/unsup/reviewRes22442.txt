Whenever I ask someone, "Where can I get the best dogs in Chicago?" They all reply... Superdawg. I've lived in the city all my life, but also moved around in the burbs. I lived in Northlake during my High School days and always went to Gene and Judes since they always had the best tastiest dogs. Never went anywhere else. People can say.. a hot dog is a hot dog, but it isn't. If you travelled and lived all over the US like I have, you would appreciate the Chicago Hot Dog. California and Miami don't even have hot dog stands. It's like.. where the hell can i get the easiest thing that a restaurant can make...  The whole drive thru experience is really not my thing. Kind of reminds me of Sonics. But I didn't come here for service.. it was for the dogs. What can I say.. Superdawgs is up to par with Gene and Judes. The super green relish... the jalepeno... the pickle... the onions.. and the almost soggy bun. MMMMMM.. I'm drueling just thinking about it. The one thing that SuperDawgs has over Gene and Judes is their fries.. Damn.. it's like crispy but yet fresh.. Gene and Judes is sometimes soggy.. but Superdawgs is just right...  Unfortunately I'm a health freak.. but I'll go here when I'm on my all you can eat day... =)
