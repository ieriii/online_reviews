It wasn't bad, wasn't bad at all. Aside from a little girl giving me a death glare (she was probably just jealous of my red lipstick, yo) the entire time, the food wasn't horrible. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasn't bad. I had the french toast, which was okay, but if you want good french toast, you've gotta use the right bread. This bread was...meh. It seems like something you just buy in the grocery store aisle. Challah bread is much better, but what the hell does this spoiled french toast bitch know? The service was great, though, which is why they get four stars.
