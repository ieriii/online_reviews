Good eats! I would have given it 5 stars but I didn't think the rice blend on the bottom of my beef shortribs were delectable. Here is a breakdown of what we ordered: honey-ginger braised beef shortribs creamed baby bok choy congee, crispy carrots - HUGE portion and Yummy! sunda rainbow roll with king crab, tuna, salmon, escolar, hamachi, asparagus, avocado - Really good roasted duck hash - glazed duck, daikon cake, frisee, crispy egg - This was some goooood stuff! seafood toban - lobster, shrimp, sunda egg sauce (only if you love egg - otherwise pretty good) Drinks are good here also. I would recommend and I will be returning. The staff is really nice, we didn't have a reservation and were able to get a good seat by calling 15 minutes in advance and the atmosphere is charming for small and large groups.
