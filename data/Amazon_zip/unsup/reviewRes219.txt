Went there for our anniversary. Amazing. Best restaurant in the city that I've been to. 20+ course menu. Edible cocktails, and let me say "Swine Swing" for dessert! Words don't describe how good it was. From the Star Wars -esque entryway with secret sliding door, to the impeccable service -the staff new when my husband was thinking of using the bathroom! The staff let me take a peek at the goings on in the kitchen too, and we were escorted to our car! Google Alinea pictures to get a sense of the amazing food. I was thinking we'd be starving afterwards since these were so tiny, but not true! there were so many, we were satisfied. Pricey, but worth every penny. Loved it.
