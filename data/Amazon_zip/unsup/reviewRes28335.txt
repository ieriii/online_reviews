Peqouds! The dark horse of all the Deep Dish establishments. I'm going to start taking my out-of-town friends here to show them an off-the-path local place. A fantastic go-to restaurant, especially when paired up with a Kerasotes movie to follow. Try deep dish with Pepperoni and Green Olives. You'll thank me. I'm thinking about buying a Pequods thong for the lady... thoughts?
