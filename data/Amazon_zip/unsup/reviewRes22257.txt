(+) Really liked the decor- a bit kitschy but fun! (/) Quick but unfriendly service; our water glasses were never more than half empty but our server didn't seem to be having the best day. He couldn't even muster up some excitement when serving us our saganaki! (/) The meat that came with the chicken shish kabob was a bit dry, but the vegetables were wonderfully grilled- the mushrooms in particularly stood out to me as juicy and tender. I really enjoyed the rice pilafi that came as a side; the tomato sauce was slightly tangy and the flavor from the herbs subtle but fresh. Good standard potato side as well. (+) Liked the sesame bread in particular that came in our bread basket My friend decided she couldn't trust the free valet parking (we have never before heard the words "free valet parking" used together in Chicago) but we were able to find street parking a few blocks away. Overall it was a good dining experience and I wouldn't mind returning, but nothing special to make me want to come back.
