I am not surprised by some of the reviews here for Bonsoiree. We dined at the restaurant for the first time right around New Years. It was so disappointing, that we actually wrote a hand written letter to the owner to let him know about our experience. He never contacted us. So here I am on YELP. Our meal was completely ruined by a waiter that smelled like he had not showered in a month. It was so disgusting that I laughed when they brought over a dish that was dramatically uncovered to unleash an aroma of...well....something...but, we couldn't tell because he smelled THAT bad. The group next to us even commented on the overwhelming odor. I am annoyed by the experience, but more angry about their lack of response to us. We spent over a couple hundred dollars on a meal that we could simply not enjoy. Shame on you Bonsoiree!
