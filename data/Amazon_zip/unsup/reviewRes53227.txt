My girlfriend and I love eating ice, mint, and sugar but hate making it at home! Luckily these nice folks will sell you a pitcher of this troublesome concoction for only ten bucks. You even can put rum in it and make the trendy tropical drink mojito! So if you're looking for a way to stay cool in the hot summer sun, cruise on down to 90 Miles--and don't forget to say "Viva Cuba!"
