RevBrew... you make me pretty dang happy. I work at the salon accross the street. Hairitics to be exact... ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/ ), and we've been watching and anticipating this place for months. The salon has been on this strip for 6 years, and finally other things are starting to trickle in. So when we were finally alerted via Twitter that RevBrew was opening today, we planned an after-work visit. We are neighbors, after all. I called at 7 and the guy told me it was a 3 hour wait. 3 HOURS?! So I went accross the street and put our name in, hoping for a better time. The hostess told me 2 hours. We ran a little longer at work, and then called over there at 8:20 and they told us they just called our name. How perfect! So we were finishing working while 100 others were waiting. Nice :) After being seated I ordered the iron Fist Pale Ale. Its an American Pale Ale, and pretty damn tasty. I had a second, I couldn't even bring myself to order something else because the Iron Fist was that good. For dinner I had the tofu sandwich. Best ever? No. But the fries were amazing, and the blue-cheese potato salad too. I also tried the Sweet Potato Cakes, which are seasoned with curry. Those were pretty amazing. As was the cheddar ale soup. All in all, everyone in my party loved what they got. The atmosphere was nice. Crowded but not horrible, nice ambient chatter, punk rock in the background, and great lighting. The space is huge, and well decorated. The menu looks great, I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the things I lusted over. I am SO happy to work across the street from this place!
