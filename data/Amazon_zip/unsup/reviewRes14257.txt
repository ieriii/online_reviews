Ok, seriously, where has this place been hiding? I went on a search for a BYOB and found Glenn's Diner. It's a small place that packs them in on the weekends! I recommend making a reservation if you are heading over on a Friday night like we did! They have a HUGE board of fresh fish every day and the portions are HUGE!! In addition to being a BYOB, they have a full bar - this place is quite a find!!
