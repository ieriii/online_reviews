Wow, where do I begin? This is now my 4th visit to this restaurant and I can't wait to go back. I'm obsessed with seafood, crab and oysters in particular but also a huge fan of sushi. Being from California I've been spoiled with fresh seafood my entire life but was still blown away at the quality of Shaw's. There are two dining room options: the bar which is to the right when you enter the restaurant and the formal dining room to the left. The place is huge, with each turn you find more and more tables and additional rooms that I never new existed. Caution: the floors are waxed well so please watch your step! Let's talk about the food. The menu is overwhelming, so many options that you feel you need to eat there several times before you can really order everything you really want. My favorites so far are the following: any of their fresh oysters, king crab bites, salmon nigiri, sampler platter of crab cakes, calamari and buffalo shrimp. Plenty of sampler options and half orders so you aren't stuck with more food than you can eat. It's a great date night location but I also suggest going with many people so everyone can share their food! Most recently I sat at the bar and enjoyed live music and lively atmosphere. I definitely plan to go this route once again even though the menu options are less than the formal dining room. After your meal, you can walk across to the Blue Light for some Karoke if you dare!
