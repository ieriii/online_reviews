Can not wait to come back here. Came on my birthday and it certainly was a treat. The space is so chic that I felt a little out of place, but the wait staff is so nice. I loved our waiter, he gave us suggestions and would comment on what were his favorites. The sushi was fabulous. Who knew unagi and foie gras could be so heavenly? The prawn rangoon was ingenious,be warned those squeamish with seafood with their heads left on. To those folks I say you don't know what you are missing. Loved my dessert, the taro coconut bread pudding, it brought me back to my childhood with a teasing flavor of a dessert my mom used to make. Can't wait to come back and try more.
