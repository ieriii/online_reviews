It's a Chicago classic that the fella hadn't been to yet, so we headed down to Pilsen today for some lunch. As other reviewers have noted, it's been here since the 50's and is family owned, so it really is kind of a must stop. As usual on a weekend, there was a huge line running to the door, but we were seated within 15 minutes. Hot chips, salsa, and complimentary chicken soup as soon as you sit down, drinks take only a few minutes to arrive. I've eaten here over the years and have pretty much enjoyed everything, but today I had chicken enchiladas verde and the fella had the steak taco dinner. Oddly, when the fella tried to order 2 steak and one machacado taco, the waiter said "no, all three the same." Now, I'm not new to this place, so I know this isn't an actual rule, but it was really busy so we went along with it and he just got his 3 steak tacos. These things happen on occasion here, depending. If it isn't busy, stick to your guns and they will generally accommodate you. Food was, as always, pretty good and incredibly inexpensive. The fella wasn't a huge fan of the salsa, feeling that it was a bit watery and flavorless. His tacos were very good, my enchiladas good, but a bit on the dry side. I would have requested more verde had I been able to catch the waiter's attention. Service tends to be a bit haphazard on the very, very busy weekends, so I tend to prefer eating here on a weeknight. It's an old favorite, but I think it's pretty standard as far as Mexican restaurants go in Chicago. When I'm down here, I'll probably always head here first, but I usually don't go out of my way for it. More like a 3 1/2 to 4 star restaurant for me, but I'm going to knock it down to a 3 as this isn't the first time I've felt somewhat jerked around by the wait staff here.
