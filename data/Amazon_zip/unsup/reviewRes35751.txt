I moved to the Chicago area a few months ago and this is easily my favorite restaurant in the city so far. The duck is so moist and delicious that I've hardly ever strayed from it. I got pork once and it was good but not extraordinary. When in doubt, I ask for roast duck on rice. It's just the right amount of food for one person, and it costs about $6. There are some complaints here about the service, and it's true that you may find yourself getting ignored by the waitstaff. The waiters play zone defense, so you have to wave someone down if you want something, and you may not have the same waiter throughout the meal. Take that into account! The service is pretty efficient (albeit a bit impersonal). Credit cards accepted with $15 minimum
