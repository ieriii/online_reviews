You can't go wrong with a pizza that's an inch thick made of cheese and sausage. As an out-of-towner, I had to go. World-famous pizza. Great antipasto. Big Cokes. It won't let ya down. Only reason it isn't 5 stars is because I haven't been to Pizzeria Uno or Lou Malnati's, so I can't directly compare. YET.
