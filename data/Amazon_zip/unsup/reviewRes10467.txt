Apparently with 355 reviews before me, I am probably the last person in Chicago to have eaten the pizza from here. However, this is all I have ever had from here. In fact I haven't even been in here. Why? Because last night I had my fantasy football draft and we got delivery from here. Pizza took about 40 minutes to arrive, it was pipping hot and it looked good. Though at that point I was more concerned at who was going to be taking who with the pick before me, I managed to scarf down several slices. Really good pizza. Really good. Thin, but chewy, long triangle slices, (finally not square pieces!!), floppy which gave me a feeling of New York style pizza. We had two cheese, one pepperoni and banana peppers, and one with spinach, black olives and mushrooms. All very tasty, all very good and all very addicting. Now I just need to make my way down there. Apparently there is talk of a mid-season party in the pit.... I am intrigued....
