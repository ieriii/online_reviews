Piece is great for what it is. Good food, beer and friendly service. I live and work in this neighborhood for years now so I kinda see it from more of a less critical, more modest angle. Bottom line: If you don't like the busy friday/ saturday night crowds then why do you choose to go out to eat in one of the busier neighborhoods in all of Chicago? I'm pretty sure there is a wait at all bars/ restaurants on the weekends. If you're not down with that then order in food. Why is this shocking to people. I'm kinda at a loss on this concept.
