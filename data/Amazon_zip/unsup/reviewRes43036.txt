Ok, this is my first 5 star review. I think Gilt Bar is a gem. The ambiance was great. Dark, stylish, good energy, loud but not overpowering. The food was excellent. I had the bone marrow appetizer, which was incredible. Sazerac cocktail. Followed that up with the pork belly. That was... so good. So very good. As a huge added plus, the whole experience cost me about half as much as a certain Michelin star restaurant I ate at recently. (And blew it out of the water in just about every category.) Highly recommend Gilt Bar. It is my new favorite.
