I headed here as part of a friend's alumni event for their college. We were in the rented out space on the lower level. We had a great time. We were drawn there by the alumni association's whiskey tasting. They set up 4 stations around the room and the bartenders were very knowledgeable about the drinks they poured. During the tasting, appetizers were served. The food was really tasty. I think there were fish and chips, a mushroom souffle, some sort of goat cheese puff, and mini sliders. Our tasting fee paid for the tasting, the food, and a drink ticket. I used my ticket on a classic rum and diet. My friend got a whiskey and diet. Both were generously poured by a friendly bartender. The atmosphere itself is nice. The place was pretty busy, but I never felt too crowded. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends.
