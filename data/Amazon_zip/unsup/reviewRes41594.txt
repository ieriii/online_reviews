This is without hesitation the best restaurant in Chicago. The venue is very intimate. It only has 28 seats and the space is broken out so there are no bad seats. The waiter is world-class. You can tell he knows food really well. He didn't just memorize a canned speech about the menu - he lives for cuisine. I don't even know where to start about the food. Every course is a marvel of creativity and deliciousness. It's BYOB so you don't get ripped off buying wine for twice the retail price. This is, seriously, Chicago's best restaurant.
