The only reason I gave this place 4 stars was because I'm old and hate when places are so loud I can't hear my dinner partners. Otherwise, who could possibly hate a place that serves BACON FAT POPCORN!! Where has this dish been all of my life? Seriously, just thinking about it right now has me wiping the drool off of my keyboard. Oh yeah, the beers are great too.
