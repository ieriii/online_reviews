So, what's not to like? 1. Sometimes spotty service. 2. They don't serve ice with water, usually. 3. Most of the dishes are not that great, and overshadow the great ones. 4. Their soy shakes, to someone who can't eat dairy, are scary good and cause me to make up for lost time WITH dairy. Which, I'm sure will eventually make me fat.
