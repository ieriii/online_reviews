a chicago classic! having grown up on the north side, i'm totally conditioned to stop at superdawg anytime i make a run to o'hare. Maurie and Flaurie's red eyes guiding me through the night, i pull into the familiar drive-in and psyche myself up for the experience. great dog, hamburgers are good, too. love the fries, but most of all, love the pickled green tomato. not bad, gotta do it!
