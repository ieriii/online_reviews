Interesting that few reviews mention the only dish I go there for...hu gu, Chinese hot pot!! Amazing.  Lao Sze Chaun (I just refer to it as hot pot) is at the end of the new chinatown mall on the left-hand side walking west. -faily small, typically non-descript. ...but it has amazing hot pot! This is a dish/bowl of near boiling oil/water. -Split: one side light garlic, and the other spicy. I always get the combo with meat, fish, shell fish, fish balls, assorted veggies. Also, ask for the three sauces (I don't know their names) One is a creamy, peanut, garlic, one is an oil, and the other is dark and savory. ...mix all three on the side and use as a dip for the cooked meat, etc. Service is what you'd expect. Price is what you'd expect. BYOB. Warning, you will have that fat kid feeling, like you're sweating oil from your pores. -and with the sauces and the dipping in multiple liquids, etc. You're likely to get gunk all over your black on black ensemble. If you're cool with that then bring a date to a non-cheesy fondue!
