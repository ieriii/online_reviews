Since Sun Wah's changed so much recently, I thought it was time to update my review.  Yep, I still love Sun Wah. Their new location is awesome. They told me that some of their traditional Chinese clientele was upset by the change, but I love it. It's open and airy, with much better acoustics, and now they can accommodate twice as many people. This is truly exceptional Chinese cuisine, and as reasonably priced as always. Sun Wah is my favorite restaurant.
