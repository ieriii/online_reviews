For those of you who hoped Hop Leaf would open a location in Lincoln Square or North Center, you now have The Bad Apple! They even have different glassware to match the beers. I think they will be as popular as the Hop Leaf, so go early. Even tho they haven't been open long, the staff was very friendly and seemed at ease. The owners have done a great job updating the space, and we appreciated the recession-proof pricing. My dining companions loved their mahola (sic) burger and duck confit grilled cheese, but I was disappointed that my veggie burger fell apart (it was tasty tho) and we thought the burgers deserved better buns. And I still like the fries better at Gannon's...but I'm not as harsh as some other reviewers here, so I only subtracted one star.
