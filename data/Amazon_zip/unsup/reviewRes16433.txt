So my girlfriend and I came here after an fun-filled day of adventure going to several museums. Knowing Chicago museums, you could imagine that we were starving! Having made reservations, we were seated promptly in a room off to the side of the main dining room. The atmosphere is incredibly warm, yet very lively. We ordered the ceviche tasting of 5 and it was incredible. The ceviche tasted spectacular and it was fresh. Having fun devouring our appetizer, our asada steaks were ready, The steaks were perfectly cooked and the rice and beans were superb. I, personally, hate back beans, but I had to make an exception with this dish because they were great. But going back to the steak, it was incredible. The meal was perfect, not just taste, but also portion. It did not leave us feeling uncomfortably full, but it did not leave us hungry; it was perfect. The service, as always, was phenomenal and the they really know how to treat one like a high roller. I was back here in Chicago for a visit from school and this was a great Chicago place to hold me over until my next visit. Many thanks to my girlfriend for taking me here.
