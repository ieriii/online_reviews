My daughter and I ate at Brazzaz one recent Tuesday night while visiting Chicago and left with smiles on our faces and full of really great food. The service could not have been better and everyone was very attentive and helpful. The food was amazing, our favorite being their House specialty (roast beef), and the buffet was full of very tasty items. We even shared their creme brulee and enjoyed a specialty coffee.  I definitely recommend going when you're hungry !
