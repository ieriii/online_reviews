Had a late dinner at Cafe 28 with a friend and it was a good experience. We were seated promptly as they were about to close the kitchen. We didn't want anything too heavy so we ordered the coconut shrimp and the green tamales... when I tell you they were good, I mean it!  The style and space of the restaurant is very nice and relaxing. We didn't have to park far, which was another plus. The menu is a little on the pricey end, but the food is really tasty. I can't wait to go back...when I have more ends.  One caveat - if you can, avoid Cafe 28 around the last days of the Groupon rush... cuz they generally run out of food *housecat* face.
