This place is a bit overrated. I have to agree with some of the other yelpers - not a good value...a $14 omlette should at least be cooked properly. My onions and bell peppers were raw, who doesn't saut onions and bell pepper before you put them into an omlette. (they could have at least thinly sliced them, but no - big chunks of onion and bell pepper) My breakfast date enjoyed her omlette and did remark that the coffee was strong, the way she likes it. I ordered the strawberry, oj & kiwi juice not bad not great. So that's 2 omlettes, 1 juice, 1 coffee = $36 nope not a good value. Service was descent. I came here based on their reviews and tales of people forming lines to get in and waiting over an hour because it's that good...I don't understand. I was underwhelmed.
