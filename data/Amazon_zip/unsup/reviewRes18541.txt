i've had two really good meals at caro mio; one with the rents and one with the boy. the atmosphere was really nice for both. the tables are pretty jammed in (the space is pretty tiny) but somehow the volume seems to stay somewhat low. i think people are generally using their inside voices in this place. i've never been disappointed with the food, though last time i went the service was a little lacking. the wait for our table was short but i felt like our server might have forgotten about us a few times. all i wanted was some bread. too much to ask?
