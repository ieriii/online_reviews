I was raised in Chicago and downtown and the north side are my stomping grounds. When I saw the rate for the Whitehall hotel online I jumped at the chance to stay in the heart of the Gold Coast walking distance from all of my favorite places.                                  The only reason they are not getting a better star review from me is because.....when I went to raise the window in my room the entire window came off in my hand and I almost fell out from the 15 floor. I put it back on the tracks and cracked the other window to get some air instead. The outlets were loose in the walls and the shower head was loose. They advertise mini bar in the room but don't think that is a fridge because it is not.          Other than that the staff was nice enough not all smiles but it is Chicago. . . The sheets and the bed were amazing and the gym is pretty cool to have to work out in. This place is about location. You cannot beat the price for were you are. Parking is a bitch....$48 a night but what you gonna do . . . It's Chicago.  Walk over to the Pancake House 7am-3pm for the best breakfast in the Gold Coast. Over all I would stay there again for the price.
