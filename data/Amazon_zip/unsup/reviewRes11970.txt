If you look around the place is filled with single pregnant yuppie women, and married gay men and then a few artists/hippies. This place used to be a cool hangout and the food was reasonably priced. Now it is different. All the artist have grown up , and everything has become very yuppified..and now it is very expensive. Also this place is so loud i could not even here the person across me speaking, so i had to sit and eat in boredom for about 45 rushed minutes. And the food is just ok, but god, to pay 10$ for pancakes?? ..thats ridiculous...and 5.50 for 2 eggs..and then extra for sausage!!! wow this place is really not that good. I say if u go here u should get the pancakes..as this is there niche, and the only thing worth spending the extra money on as u will not have a pancake like this anywhere else. But between the crowds, the lines, the overpriced meal, this really is not worth wasting your time or a meal here.
