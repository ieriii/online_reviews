This place is amazing. Every time I come here it is packed and has a fun atmosphere. The beer menu is great, and the pizza is even better. We love getting the white pizza with clam and bacon, delicious! I have never been let down by coming here. They also have live band karaoke which is hilarious to watch and very entertaining. They usually have a long wait but it doesn't seem bad because you can just grab a drink at the bar. I will definitely keep coming back here.
