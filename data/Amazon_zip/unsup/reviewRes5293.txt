I'm surprised by the rave reviews here. Really?! Went here for a girls night out, thank goodness it wasn't too cold outside because we had to wait about 45 minutes (they don't reservations unless its a large party). The service was slooooooow. Also, asking for bread was a huge faux pas apparently but we were waiting so long for food we needed something so we wouldn't starve! Also, our waiter seemed to be annoyed that not all of us were drinking (the wine selection wasn't amazing) and I guess he thought his tip would be affected from mostly a food bill. The food is so mediocre. We got several of the plates and they were meh. The chicken was overdone, the scallops were overdone... nothing we ordered was bad, but nothing really seemed to be worth the price either. It is not for those trying to eat on the healthier side either. All of us girls left hungry. We would have ordered more food, but it was so sub par that we needed to spend our money elsewhere. I won't be back.
