Great beer, above average pizza. Piece makes some awesome pale ales. The double IPA (Camel Toe, teehee) is a very well balanced brew that delivers a swift kick to the cranium. The American and English pale ales are quite tasty, as well. I'm a big fan of hoppy ales, so it's great to have a local brewery that can consistently serve up delicious batches of all three varieties.  The pizza is everything that it needs to be to keep people coming, but nothing more. I have no complaints. Serving the pizzas on raised stands is a neat, quirky idea, but really reflects the fact that the pizzas are large and the tables are small. Great atmosphere if you like rubbing shoulders with Wicker Park hipsters; otherwise, grab a growler and a pizza to go.
