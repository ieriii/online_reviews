When you see the line outside you really have to wonder, is this place worth the cold, dark wait? I think it depends on who you are with and what you are in the mood for.  I was definitely surprised by the atmosphere and the set-up. Who knew that this would be behind the unassuming, wooden door?! For my party of three, our table was nicely situated in the back room where we can easily see the other parties seated. But, the Violet Hour is definitely not for the social butterflies. You really feel like there is no such thing as mingling with your fellow patrons. This would especiallly be the case if you are seated at one of the front room two-person tables. I guess it could be a very cool, intimate spot for a date, but I hope you are really into each other because you are kind of trapped in your own little seated area.  However, I really would suggest the drinks. Sure, the specialty drinks are $12, but you only need one to get a nice buzz.
