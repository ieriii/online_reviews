My buddy has been going here almost everyday for his lunch break and I have been making fun of him. I kid you not, he seriously has put on about ten lbs since July and I keep telling him it's because that is when he started going to Hot Doug's. Finally I decided to I needed to put on some weight and instead of my usual lunch joints I joined him. I think I am going to be 20lbs more by summer, this place is amazing but I don't have to tell you that because they have a crazy number of reviews. Plus they finally motivated me to yelp!
