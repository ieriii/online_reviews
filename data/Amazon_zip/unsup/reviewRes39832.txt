Went here for brunch today after checking the wait at lula and was way happy. I mean really how can a shredded pig face sandwich cooked in duck fat with a duck egg on top be bad?  My only complaint was there was no wait, but for some reason the hostess wanted u to wait five minutes for an obviously open table? I don't get it. Otherwise the service was fine.
