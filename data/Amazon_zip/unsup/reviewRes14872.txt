I checked this place out a couple of weekends ago and it was got a steak sandwich while the man had a cubano (I think)...we also got all the great starchy sides...moros con cristianos..platano maduro and yuca. It was all very yummy and the portions weregood. The steak was tender, the bread crispy, the onions perfect. I can't speak for the Cubano because I'm not a fan of those. The yuca was crispy, garlicky, salted and excellent. My only beef is that the platanos maduros were not as sweet as I would like and were QUITE oily....think Exxon Valdez oily. Also, the place is too dang small, the only seating is comprised of 3 small counters, 9 people can eat at a time...at most. Since I hate people hovering like a vulture for me to finish and leave, I hate when I'm forced to do that to others. Therefore, this is a good place ONLY if you're alone or +1. All that being said, I'm fairly certain I'll go back.
