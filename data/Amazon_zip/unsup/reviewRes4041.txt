Do whatever it takes to get a reservation here! Schwa is definitely worth the wait and hard work to get a reservation. In face, I think it adds to the overall experience. The food speaks for itself, and it will melt in your mouth. The chef's serve the food they prepare, and they will describe every detail on the plate including how long the balsamic glaze has been aging. I can't say anything bad about this place. It's an underground restaurant for any true foodie to enjoy :)
