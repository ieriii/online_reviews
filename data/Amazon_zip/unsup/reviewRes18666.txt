This restaurant gets an extra star for being BYOB without the corkage fee. The other three stars are for the amazing homemade pasta dishes and sauces they have! I have tried 4 different types now (both pastas and sauces) and they are all awesome! It's a casual place with good service. They check on you at appropriate intervals, get the food to you in good time and keep your water glass full, which is all I ask. It is a smaller restaurant with plenty of tables, so come prepared to be pretty close to your neighboring tables. In general (I haven't tried everything), I recommend sticking to the pastas, which seem to be the real strength. The chicken I had was underwhelming and the fried calamari are no better than what you would get at a bar. The veal parmigiana was a very pleasant exception to that rule, but my fiance got it with a side of pasta in amazing bolognese sauce, which didn't hurt.
