My first meal at Big Jones was on a Fat Tuesday, so how appropriate for me to finally write my review one Fat Tuesday later. The reservation book was naturally full that night, but we were fortunate to snag two seats at the bar. We ordered off the special Mardi Gras menu; Gumbo for me and Crawfish Etouffee for my missus. The gumbo, served with rice, was dark, rich, and very flavorful. Unfortunately they had run out of oysters for the night (Fried Oyster Po' Boys had sold like hot cakes) so they subbed in some extra perfectly cooked seafood. Though generously packed with crawfish tails, my wife wasn't particularly fond of their etouffee. Perhaps it's because they finished it with cream or didn't use a dark roux? In either case I found it to be decent, but wouldn't necessarily order this version of etouffee again. We kept with the festivities and had some King Cake to finish our meal. Sure enough, we found a little baby Jesus in there (good thing I didn't eat him by accident) and that got us a voucher for a free drink on our next visit. I guess that also made me King for the day, but hopefully they don't make me supply King Cakes for the entire restaurant next time around...   Ambiance wise, it's actually quite nice inside. I was expecting something more casual based on the southern cuisine, but this is clearly a dressed up version that would suit a dinner date for two. They also get bonus points for their focus on organic, local, and sustainable food sources. So whether it's Mardi Gras or not, Big Jones is worth a try. They won't throw any beads your way but they will fill you up with some of NOLA's finest.
