dear longman & eagle.......you've left me no choice. The ideas and menu looks and reads exceptionally. I WANT to eat everything on the menu, but over the multiple times that i've been there (not just one or two but many) the only consistent thing you do is serve overpriced crap. Went in one night and spent $24 on an over cooked piece of venison, went in another got UNDERcooked sweetbreads. Actually attempted dessert one night and the donuts tasted like three weeks of unchanged fryer oil, not to mention they tasted like fries..not donuts. Ordered the Tartar the other night...oh my god. You could smell it when it hit the table. Ground beef?!? REALLY!? Thats what you get, pre-portioned two days before, brown, and wreaks. I'm glad they have a great whiskey list because getting shit faced was the only way i got through the LAST meal i'll ever eat at longman. Thanks for a memorable anniversary
