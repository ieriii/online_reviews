Don't come hungry - you're gonna wait. And wait... But it will be well worth it, this is some of the best thin-crust pizza I've tried, and I've tried a lot of pizza. The micro-brewed beer is also fun, but I must admit that our gang was completely wowed by dessert: Chocolate Pizza. Yes, I said Chocolate Pizza. And you'll be entertained by the Bucktown crowd which always makes for an interesting night out. And we could not beat the price, which was something like $25 per person, all in, for beer, pizza and dessert. YUM!
