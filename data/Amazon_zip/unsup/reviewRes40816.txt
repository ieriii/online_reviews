I went back a few month's ago with nicole - this place is still awesome - we brought the bottle of champagne my realtor gave me as a closing gift and got toasted, nicely toasted.  we went on a saturday for their "underground" menu - it's expensive ($100 each) and the portions are small, but that's cool because you can actually finish everything there wasn't a morsel of food that wasn't incredible - take my advice and don't not go there
