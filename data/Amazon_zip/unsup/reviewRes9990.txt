I am admittedly a pretty huge pizza snob. Pizza is my favorite food, and I could eat it for every meal, every day (why not? breakfast pizza, dessert pizza...) - if it weren't for the fact that I would prefer not to weigh 500 lbs.  I finally went to Piece for the first time this weekend and let me tell you - it lived up to my *very* high expectations. We got a white pizza with fresh tomatoes, goat cheese and basil and a red pizza with mushrooms, sausage, and green peppers. I tried a couple of different kinds of beer, and they were both delicious - this is coming from someone who feels pretty blah about beer in general. So, go to Piece. Immediately!
