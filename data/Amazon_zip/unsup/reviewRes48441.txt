My husband picked this place because it looked interesting and different with some cool beers (he's British:)) So off we went on a rainy Sunday while visiting for the weekend. The space was open and airy and had a good energy about it. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and it wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately at the bar. The service was great and it was fun to watch the goings on in the open kitchen.  Now, I'm a southern girl, so the minute I saw pork rinds on the menu, I was sold!!! Everything that followed was just gravy..... Perfectly prepared, interesting and delicious dishes. All the ingredients were super fresh. I had the smoked sablefish and my husband had the shrimp with dirty rice.....all outstanding!
