I like to wait a few years until the line goes down, ya know...so we finally checked out Piece tonight. Again, being among the terminally unhip, we were not seated in the main room...but we *could* still look through the little hole in our booth to observe the actions of the hipsters seated below. It took a while to be acknowledged by the waiter, although a dude with water came by right away. I ordered one of the house beers once waiter came by, and from that point on the service was excellent (not sure if the high alcohol content in the beer had anything to do with that). I got a Caprese salad, BF got a Caesar, and we ordered the red pizza w/spinach, black olives and pepperoni. BF liked his salad very much, complete with anchovies (glad to see a place that doesn't dumb down their Caesar). I was looking forward to my Caprese, but sadly the tomatoes were unripe and mealy...not good at all, but the greens, roasted red pepper, dressing, and mozzarella were just fine. Before salads were delivered, waiter stopped by to inquire "Would you like salt or pepper with your salads?"...I thought that was kind of odd. We said "No", but then I'm thinking "What if I want some pepper later, can I change my mind?"....oh well, BF says I worry too much. Truth be told, my salad coulda used a little fresh cracked....but I had already made my decision, dammit. I loved the pizza, BF thought it was ok. I can totally see myself wanting to go here for a pie once a week if it were closer (or had easier parking). It's a totally different kind of pizza than anywhere else I can think of. There are so many different kinds of pizzas to love and this is one of them...it's a beautiful thing, really. I ordered a second beer and I told waiter to surprise me, and he was confidently up for the challenge. He returned with two samples, which I thought was totally sweet, and I chose one that was perfect. Anyhoo...glad I finally made it to Piece and I liked it a lot!
