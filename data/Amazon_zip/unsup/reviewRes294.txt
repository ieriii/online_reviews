Like everyone else, I was blown away by Alinea. The precision of every course, every progression, is a revelation. Definitely spring for the 25-course menu and the upgraded wine pairings. it's worth it. If I had to come up with a criticism, I would say that I wish the atmosphere was a little warmer and more relaxed and that the service had the easy perfection of Trotter's. But those are minor quibbles if quibbles at all, and this is still easily the best restaurant I have tried. Getting reservations was actually pretty easy for me--I called around a month and a half in advance, and had no trouble getting a Friday night 25-course.
