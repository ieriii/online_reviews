Excellent food and excellent service. While we weren't a fan of the featured sauvingnon blanc wine, the food was amazing and the service matched well. Beside the wine, our only other issue was they started playing loud hip hop/dance music near the end of our meal around 930pm. It brought my rating down from a 5 to a 4.
