Alinea is truly an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Service is impeccable. Decor is simple yet intimate. Not a big restaurant which I think is important to not overcrowd so you can enjoy the experience. Went with my boyfriend at the time 2 years ago. We got the 24-course tasting menu with wine pairing for both of us, which I do NOT recommend. 2 wine pairings are a bit too much because we both got pretty drunk towards the end.. haha. Also not recommended to help your boyfriend finish some of his drinks. So for couples, I recommend just getting 1 wine pairing for 2 people. For each and every dish, the thought and creativity can not only be tasted, but also seen visually and experienced by all the senses possible (e.g. lavender "smoke" pillow that sprays out smoke while you're eating a certain dish, the dessert that doesn't require hands). I will upload a picture of my menu when I have access to a scanner.. but definitely go for the 24-course tasting menu after you get off the wait-list to Alinea. As I said before - a once-in-a-lifetime experience that you will NOT want to miss. Hopefully I'll be able to go again next time I'm in Chicago!
