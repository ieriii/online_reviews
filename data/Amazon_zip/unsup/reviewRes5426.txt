After reading many good reviews for The Purple Pig, my girlfriend and I decided to head here for dinner on a week night after work. It was a good, but there were a couple of things that didn't rub us the right way. First, our waitress, although timely, seemed a little snooty and practically turned up her nose hearing that it was our first time there. Not a great way to start the night. Her tone remained fake throughout our meal. Second, the menu, albeit varied, wasn't very descriptive. Being a semi-foodie, I was able to surmise what most of the small plates were going to consist of. However, it would've helped to have a brief description considering that you are ordering multiple items. Finally, although the food and wine were all good, I couldn't help but feel that it wasn't worth the money. Our bill with tip was over $90, but we didn't feel like we had a $$$ experience. We each ordered 3 plates and shared a dessert. My favorite dish was the roasted bone marrow while my girlfriend preferred the prosciutto di parma. Portions were fair but sometimes made you wish there was more. The wines were great, but were a little pricey considering they give you a strict 5oz pour. Overall, this is a good restaurant with a good atmosphere. Seems adequate for groups and is definitely appropriate for a date. However, the service and the prices will probably keep you from coming back again.
