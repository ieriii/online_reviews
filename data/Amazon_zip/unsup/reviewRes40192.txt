Oh Longman & Eagle, you had me at "Whiskey". Although L&E doesn't take reservations, we called ahead to alert the staff to our large group who would be invading on a Friday night and they were more than accommodating. Now don't get me wrong, if you have to wait for a table, waiting in a bar full of whiskey, backed by a crew who knows their way around an Old Fashioned is the place to do it, but having a mere half hour wait was a welcome surprise. Our server was as knowledgeable and friendly as they come and everything we ordered was insanely delicious. That's right, everything we ordered, now I'd like to get specific here but my memory sucks and they don't have their menu online so just trust me that anything you order here will probably be even better than it sounds when you read the drool-worthy description off the menu. And dear god, order the chocolate banana bread pudding because it's perfection in chocolaty-fruity form. We left L&E full, satisfied, properly buzzed and feeling like bandits who paid far too little for such a fantastic meal. So congratulations Longman & Eagle, welcome into the rotation because you know I'll be returning on my next trip out.
