This place is just ok. it would get a higher rating from me if i didn't have to stand in line that long. Did they cook my dog when i showed up? They must have because it wasn't hot by any definition, i would say warm. The fries are ok as well but not for my taste, i like crispy thin cut fries, and these were a little on the thick side and all mushy from being in too much grease. The price isn't expensive but two of us had dogs, shared a fry, and had two drinks. I remember the price being almost $20 which it was after i put the change in the tip jar ( I always tip). I have two other favorite hot dog spots that i would never dare mention because if i had to wait that long for a hot dog again I am moving out of the city, maybe even state.
