I highly recommend the luncheon salad with goat cheese and I believe bacon wrapped dates, I had that fixed with some of their grilled chicken. Great breakfast pancake variety and some outstanding coffee varieties. I can eat solo there, have a business get together or bring someone special. Relax and enjoy.
