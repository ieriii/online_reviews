I discovered Ikosium last winter while on a visit to Chicago. Now that I live in the neighborhood it makes me happy to know that I am in walking distance to this wonderful crepe place. There are so many options and the decor is cute and authentic without being overbearing. Beware that the portions are large and the food is rich. So come hungry and expect to take some home. They have never been pushy about the amount of time one stays and service has always been extremely attentive and friendly. On my very first visit the waitress was extremely helpful in offering suggestions and her own personal opinion about each of the dishes I was curious about. Another plus for Ikosium... something that easily wins me over anywhere: fresh infused cucumber water. It's delish and simple and SO good. My favorite dish: A brie, garlic and onion crepe with a side salad. Don't worry, I bring gum.
