I loved this place. I thought the sushi was some of the more tasty, inventive sushi I've ever had. We had a wide assortment of sushi and apps-- the firecracker roll was delicious. I like the beef-lollipops a lot. Also, the names are funny: there is an "oh no you didn't" roll. Oh yes I did... and loved it. Also, any and all of the deserts are great. We ordered them all. Tasty Mochi. Chocolates with mango and cherry compote (yummola) and an item called "ridiculous." It was indeed ridiculous... ice cream with a tempora shell and caramel on the outside. Perfection.
