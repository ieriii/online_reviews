Probably the best falafel I've ever had, and I always enjoy an "after dinner falafel" or three when I am in the area. I also met an old guy here who claims to have been John Ashcroft's soccer coach in college. That's an awesome claim due to its strangeness and makes Sultan's even better than the four stars I have given it.
