I like Irazu a lot. Their breakfasts and sandwiches are super cheap, and I love their beans and rice. I just don't think they're great. I've been there a few times, and each time I thought, "this just needs a little more pop."  For example, the fish tacos are tasty, but even with the lime and cabbage, they're not flavorful enough. Maybe some pickled onions, or a bit more seasoning on the fish? The chili relleno was similar. I thought it was very tasty, but the sauce was a bit dull.  I also don't especially like the lizano sauce on the sandwiches, but other people I've been there with do. One other negative is that while most of the empanadas are good, there's something off about the cheese only empanada. The spinach and cheese, though, is to die for. Definitely my favorite thing on the menu. The spinach is fresh and flavorful, and makes you feel a little less guilty about eating an ounce of fried cheese.
