Dug it! Hard to say anything that hasn't already been said here, really. Except I'm disappointed that so many (but still relatively few) people had such poor experiences and/or passionately negative reactions. Making my first visit, I was almost prepared for the worst and I'm glad to say I was very pleasantly surprised. I admit, I wilted a little bit when the waitresse dropped off some complementary spicy cabbage to wake up my palate. That stuff get's your attention quickly! It packed some straight-up heat that caused me to question what exactly I was in for when the rest of the food arrived. But, I found that the dried pepper chicken was fantastic and actually not quite as soul-scorchingly hot as I expected it to be considering that there's a 1-to-1 chicken to chili ratio on the plate. And, the chicken is truly "popcorn" crispy, maybe even crispier, with nice, big, satisfying chunks. Good stuff. I also nommed the Don Don noodles, which were about as expected, and delivered another good greasy alternative. I also bagged some Peking Dumplings, which didn't quite hit the spot. Hard to say why, exactly - but a lack of heat and savoriness just kept them hidden at the back of the table. As an inexperienced Chinatown frequenter, I walked away with a great impression of this place, and I plan to come back. With a menu that large it looks like LSC can deliver some serious food adventures.
