Noticed this place was receiving high reviews from other yelppers and no dinner plans one night last week. Do I need more incentive than that? We're talking BYOB, quick efficient service, menu friendly for vegetarians and carnivores alike, and piping hot, thin fries. What else are you looking for in a restaurant? Oh, extremely affordable prices and wings? They got those too. I'm sad they don't deliver to River North (please reconsider - or create a second location?) and the restaurant could use some more seating space. A sign of a good place is a crowd, but a crowd with limited seating can make frustrated patrons. Though I had to sit at the bar, my vegetarian burrito was slammin. My dining partner had a rice bowl with chicken - and let me tell ya, the chicken tastes like the real deal. Not some crappy meat that you wouldn't touch at the grocery store. This place was so trendy and ahead of the curve I feel like it belongs in the Manhattan dining scene. Looking forward to my next meal!
