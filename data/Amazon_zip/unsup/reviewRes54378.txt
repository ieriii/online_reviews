Pequod's is top quality gourmet pizza. My mom is Sicilian, so I was raised on artisan pizza. At Pequod's it is all about the sauce and the crust. Most pizza in Chicago is a boat of cheese. Pequod's goes lighter with the cheese, and in my opinion gives the perfect amount. Their crust is crisp and flavorful (made in a cast iron skillet) and I highly recommend the mushroom.They also deliver farther west than most other pizza places on the east side.GO PEQUOD'S!
