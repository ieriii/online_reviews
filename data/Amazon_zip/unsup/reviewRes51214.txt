The line at House of Sushi was out the door, so my friend and I stumbled upon Wishbone. First of all they, got a rooster theme going on, everywhere you look there are cocks all around you. Rooster figurines, rooster paintings. However, I thought wishbones were more associated with turkeys. Anyway, we viewed the menu outside and most entrees were under $10,descriptions were appealing, and we were starving. I had the special of the day jambalaya while my friend had the cajun catfish. The jambalaya was blah while the catfish was better. I wouldn't consider this place the epitome of cajun southern cooking. Did the descriptive and appealing menu deliver? Not as much as I hoped, but I would consider going back. I think the optimal reason to go is if you need to fill up on some protein after working out at Xsport. Food is relatively healthy, portions are on the smaller side, and across the street from Xsport.
