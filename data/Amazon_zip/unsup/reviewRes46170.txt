Ok the good things are - it's clean, my dinner mates were happy. The staff was cheerful. The food was ordinary. The staff was not knowledgeable - my waiter had no idea what was in the pasta carbonara and that it is supposed to be made with pancetta (it wasn't). He also needed to get the menu when I asked what beers they had (draught was not working that night) - it was only 16. Ithink the menu is so huge that staff is overwhelmed. And tastewise is underwhelming. Also I am sick of paying a fortune for an enormous plate of food that only the biggest glutton could get through, but this place is nt responsable for that trend.  You could do much worse - and a lot better
