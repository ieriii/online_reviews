I like the bar here a lot. The rooftop is awesome... really gorgeous views, nicely furnished, and good crowd. Unfortunately, they get really uptight about letting people up and it can be tough to go here because there's literally a bouncer that prevents people (mainly guys) from heading up even when it's not that full! This is annoying when you're trying to have your friends meet you here. That being said, once people get up it's worth it... and I saw John Cusack here once, which was the highlight of not only that night, but the rest of my month given my celebrity-less life here in Chicago. I also really like the bar inside. It's pretty and has a great fireplace, never too crowded. Not a bad option in the winter or when you can't get your group upstairs. As for the restaurant, I've only been once and it wasn't worth it in my opinion. It was good, but it was the typical Brazilian steakhouse deal which basically means it was way overpriced for a salad bar and a bunch of meat on a stick.
