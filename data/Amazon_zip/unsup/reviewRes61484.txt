Taco Bell is heaven on earth....especially this location on Madison St. Where else would I go for lunch or dinner?...nowhere. I use to live across the street and would run to this location wearing flip-flops in the snow. After an intense garba (Navratri) celebration, a late-night study amigo, or for the "I'm hangover free and alive the next morning" feeling- I'm going to Taco Bell. If anyone tries to shut this place down...I'll be waiting in the parking lot.
