I have been here a few times now to find items that you might not find in your corner grocery store - preserved lemons, grains of paradise, curry leaves, red lentils, bacon chocolate, tallgrass beef. The only ever have about half of it, so I end up at other stores anyway and without buying $20 worth of crap just to find out they don't even know what curry leaves are and I refuse to buy $20 in bacon chocolate. It's actually cheaper to get your beef from the Tallgrass website or go to the Green City Market. Their fish looked good, but smelled a lot fishy :( The prices were really quite high and I think it's not as gourmet as it wants to be. Now, I hear the cafe for lunch is pretty good, but I've never been. Unless I'm in the area again, I will stick with Whole Foods, the farmer's market, and the respective ethnic markets.
