First of all, the food is vastly over-rated. The beer list always has a few treats, which gets them a few points, but the bottle list needs work, as it is pretty well full of non-vintage working class beers. To be a world class destination, really needs to work on its cellar. That being said, the taps are pretty damn good. Unfortunately, the front room is a horrible place to get a beer with people groping and nowhere to go to get out of the way. And the people seated at the bar tend to be territorial. Not to mention that the prices are higher than Map Room. Not a fan of this joint.
