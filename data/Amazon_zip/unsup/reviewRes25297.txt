This is such a date place! It's been around a long time, and years back this was totally THE place to take the GF for a birthday or special occasion. Flamenco guitar, cozy & intimate candle lit booths, a bottle of wine (from a very good list) and feeding each other meat boiled in oil and dipped in sauce- what could be better? OK, this really is a great place if you're after fondue and prepared to smell like it since you essentially sit in the kitchen next to the deep fryer. I went recently and was reminded by the younger dating crowd how much I liked it back then too. But I knock a couple stars off since I find the whole fondue thing they do here kind of stale and unexciting. The atmosphere can't be beat if you get yourself a booth, but the dipping sauces are kind of lame and I struggled to be impressed by the place now. I guess it's old school- I doubt much has changed in the 30-40 years this place has been at it. So everybody SHOULD check Geja's out once on a date and decide for themselves if it fits their own interests in a intimate dining experience. The prices aren't bad for the dining event you'll experience. Just not 100% for me anymore.
