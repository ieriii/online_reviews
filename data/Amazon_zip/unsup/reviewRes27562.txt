My very first authentic deep dish pizza! (Sorry Pizza Hut, I found out you don't count) Totally a recommend from a friend who lived out in the area who is a pizza fanatic (the guy eats pizza about 4 times a week and remains under 400 pounds, so I had to take his word for it) The place is cute and the local beer we tried gave us a decent buzz before we started to chow down. We got a standard deep dish, pepperoni with the caramelized crust. The caramelized crust was KEY! so crunchy along the ridge with a great flavor. With this being my first deep dish I wasn't prepared for the amount of food I was expected to consume, but according to my BF who grew up in Indiana this deep dish wasn't as thick as the standard (that terrifies me) In all I loved it but I wasn't impressed enough to say it was the best (plus it was my first deep dish, so come on!) Go Caramelized, you won't regret it :)
