I recently attended a birthday dinner in a party of six at Indie Cafe, and the main thing that struck me was the fantastic service--from the man on the phone who took my reservation, to the host that evening, to the waitress and the bus staff. They were all pleasant, patient, efficient, and helpful.  The food is still pretty good, too. I finally tried some sushi: the Bangkok roll is very good, but the Las Vegas fell a little flat. The pieces are cut too large, and the rice was a bit sticky, making for a mushy, cumbersome mouthful. I also had the Bkk Street Scallops appetizer and a seaweed salad--both very good but not quite great. I snagged several bites of the birthday girl's Veggie Delight, a simple but very tasty and satisfying dish. Based on service alone, I would consider this a strong contender for another group dinner. Next time I am going to try the drunken udon and a couple different maki.
