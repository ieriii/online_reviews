I am in love with this place's food. I love their Reuben Sandwiches and the Country Fried Steak meal because they taste just like their meat-based alternatives. I also love the nachos, which taste a little different than regular nachos, but are still good and are probably great for vegans or lactose-intolerant people who can't eat real cheese. I definitely recommend this place!
