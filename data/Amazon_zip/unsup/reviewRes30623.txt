We ended up here because the first place we found with good reviews on Yelp in Bridgeport looked pretty sketchy from the outside and this one did not. We had to wait but it was shorter than they said and the restaurant was warm and inviting. I had the steak and eggs which was actually a pork chop with eggs and other different things than I would expect. It was surprisingly good as were the pancakes. The OJ was fresh squeezed and plentiful. Great coffee, nice and hot. The waitress was quiet but very efficient and friendly. We both enjoyed it quite a bit and plan on returning, we might even check out the sketchy place as well.
