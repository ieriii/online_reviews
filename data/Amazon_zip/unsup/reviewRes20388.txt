Now that I live in the Ukrainian Village, Coast has become my go-to delivery place for sushi. I love that they have online ordering, and the delivery has always been fast and courteous. The fish is always quite fresh, and they have some creative rolls that I really like. I've also had the gyoza and it's quite good. I'll have to update this after I actually visit the restaurant sometime, but here's hoping my experience dining in is as good as all of my delivery experiences have been.
