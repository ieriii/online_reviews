My wife and i went for an early dinner on a weds. night. The place is a little on the small side and IT WAS PACKED!!!! We were both shoulder to shoulder with the people on either side of us. Oh well, that's not their fault. I had the almonds sauteed in pork fat...not sure how that sounds but it tasted amazing. The milk braised pork shoulder was just ok. It didnt live up to the hype. I really want to go back and try other things on the menu. Oh and the wine selection is pretty good. I had a Spanish red which worked real well.
