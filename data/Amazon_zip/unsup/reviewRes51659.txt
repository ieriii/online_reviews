Food is excellent and the margarita's are amazing. They have about 20 different flavors. Not too pricey. The service is typically fast, but they always make me feel a little rushed. Also, if you're with a big group, sometimes it's hard to get a table right away. There's not really a waiting area, so it gets easily crowded.
