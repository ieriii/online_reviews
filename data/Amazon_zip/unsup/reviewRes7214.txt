Came here with a few girlfriends one Thursday evening. First must note that the main dining area is extremely noisy, which made it difficult to converse. As for the food- we started with the BBQ Flight and Hush Puppies; really enjoyed the Kobe brisket and the sauces that came with the different meats, but found the hush puppies to be too dry. We shared a mac and cheese, cornbread, slaw, and the "Competition" St. Louis Full Slab ribs. The sides were nothing special, and the mac and cheese in particular was disappointing. The ribs were pretty good- tender and meaty, and lots of them. Rounded out the meal with the espresso brittle ice cream, which was very sweet and rich. We were stuffed by the end of the meal, but while everything was fairly good I wasn't blown away by any means. My favorite food item was actually the sweet pickles and garlic that come as a side :)
