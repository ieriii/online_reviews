Although I'm a seasoned meat eater, I wanted to try the Chicago Diner to see how its substitutions stacked up against the real thing. Our group tried the whole gamut of choices to experience the different types of substitutions, and we all loved our choices. The shakes are awesome. The wings' texture was a little different than chicken wings, but their taste was right on spot. The service was great. When we first got there we were worried it would take a while to be seated judging by the crowd, but on a beautiful Friday night they seated us very quickly for the amount of people waiting. It was definitely a great experience, and we plan on going back.
