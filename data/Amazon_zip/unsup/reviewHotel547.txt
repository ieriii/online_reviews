** Updated Review ** I wrote a previous review on Trip Advisor about an item of mine that went missing at my stay at Public Hotel. Since then, the hotel has followed up and I thought it was only fair to update my review as well. Mary Beth was kind enough to call me the following day to apologize and make sure that my item was promptly replaced. It was a hugely generous offer and even though it was an unfortunate incident, I'm happy to say that the customer service at least, gets my vote of confidence.
