I loved the concept of this place. Classy, exclusive and a great place to grab a drink with a friend or two. I went for a girls night out with 3 of my friends and we ended up sitting on the ottoman in an awkward circle/square/rhombus/whatever formation that just didn't work. I just wasn't feeling it. The drinks were alright. Everyone loved theirs but I couldn't decide what to get so someone picked for me. Maybe if I wasn't so indecisive I would have picked something better. I will go back, just not on a weekend.
