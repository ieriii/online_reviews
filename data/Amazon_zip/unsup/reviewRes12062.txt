Cafe 28 has made me fall in love with Cuban food. It's simply delicious! We started out by ordering the green tamale appetizer. It came in only 4 pieces, each kind of small, but the taste was great! I expected a sort of corn husk wrapped tamale, but these were baked in a wedge with the "inside" part throughout the tamale. For dinner, my husband ordered the duck and I ordered the Bistec a la Cubana, though we both almost went for the scallops. My dinner was very tasty. The steak they gave me was a huge piece, and it was served with black beans, white rice, yuca, and plantains. Everything was very good and I would highly recommend trying out this restaurant. It can be a little pricey, but we got a 30% off code to use off our total bill. It was a nice amount of savings. Finally, I was impressed by our waitress' knowledge of the wine selection. They have a bunch of South American wines that I wasn't very familiar with. I asked a few questions to see which one I would like, and the waitress' recommendation (the malbec) was perfect for my dinner choice. We will be back.
