I went here for the first time the other weekend, Saturday afternoon, for lunch while my mom was visiting. We were able to sit outside...that was great! I wasn't sure how the ordering / seating 'process' worked, the hostess explained to me...but seemed annoyed. The girl behind the counter that took our order was very friendly...I had the chicken sandwich (really good...but messy) and my mom a wrap. The bloody mary's were good! great garnish a plus. I thought it was a little pricey for what it was, almost $40 for 2 meals, 2 drinks. It was enjoyable, the brunch menu looked good, I'd like to go back to give that a try.
