Well Doug, you lost 2 customers yesterday for life! My friend and I decided to head over there after talking about going for literally months. I have been there once(Great food) and she had never been there. We spent about 15min drooling over the menu online. We got there, no line, parking right on the side.......Starting to get real excited about stuffing my face with Game Sausage, we walk in @ 4:02pm and there is a girl standing right there like a nightclub bouncer that tells us, WE'RE CLOSED! Seriously??? People drive out of their way to come there & wait in line to eat and you turn them away at 4:02? Thats some crappy business practice. Doug, I hope you told her to turn people away at exactly 4pm, if not you should fire her. Plenty of other places to go in Chicago without the wait......... http://www.chicagosdog.c http://www.franksndawgs. I don't think your place is good enough to run it like a posh Chicago Nightclub. A business man you are NOT.  People wait in line for hours?!?! Seriously? Get a life. Its a Hot Dog. haha
