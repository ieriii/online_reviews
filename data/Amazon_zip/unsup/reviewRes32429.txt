If you're not from this neighborhood it is entirely worth the trip to get here! While I still don't know what I ever order, this place has a great staff that will walk you through a new experience with ease. Trust your waiter or waitress' recommendations - they know the menu exceptionally well! The only warning here is that when an item is "spicy" it really is - no watered down versions! Hot is hot and I appreciate the flavors, textures and wonderful vegetarian options! Also, if you have a beer the Kenyan beer they have occasionally is the best! Expensive but worth the money ten times out of ten! Oh and they get busy on weekends - best to have a reservation!
