Nice enough - and we got a great price on Hotwire. It is a little cramped though. The elevators are small, the lobby is small, the standard rooms are small. However, it is very clean and well decorated. The room windows open all the way and don't have a screen, which is a little strange for a highrise hotel. Overall, a fine place to sleep.
