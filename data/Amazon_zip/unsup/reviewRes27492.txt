Pequod's Pizzeria was nothing terribly exciting. I've had several other Chicago deep dish pizzas, and while the flavor was good, I can't say the value is truly there. Why? Because it's pricey for what is essentially a loaf of dough and a tiny amount of sauce and toppings. If you're in the area in search of pizza, it might be worth trying, but be prepared to wait - the place was PACKED when we went to pickup the pie. Well, I should say, both times we went, since the erroneously gave us a sausage and green olives pizza (ew?) instead of sausage and green peppers. They fixed the order and had a new one ready in 20 minutes, but we had to come back with the botched pizza. It's a good thing we were right across the street. All-in-all, I'm willing to give them another shot, but I wouldn't be enthralled about doing so.
