The Bongo Room is worth the wait, if there is one. Getting up at 8am or earlier is no problem for such a wonderful experience. Every time I go, the whole atmosphere is great. It's busy and friendly. The food is exceptional and the music only adds to the restaurant's charm. The Bongo Room has traditional eggs and hashbrowns as well as some artistic and delicious breakfast options. Our group has trouble ordering just one type of pancakes, so we all order different kinds and share. By the end, we never can decide who's is the best!
