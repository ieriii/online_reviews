Location is good, but you get a small place with its location. So, if you understand the space and go for the food...then you will enjoy yourself here. I always get the wings. Big and tasty. Try all types, I do. However my favorite is Seoul Sassy. Surprisingly some of the best wings in the city. Forget bars or wing places. This is where you get some of those great wings.The bowls are good too and there is plenty of food in them. I like the names, like Baby Buddha. This is a place to try and you will find yourself coming back for the wings. Just remember, since the wings are popular, sometimes they run out on weekends.
