A little bit overrated for its food. No doubt it's a fancy dancy nice decor resto, good vibe and ambience w/ its long bar and all, but here's what we ordered: Fish and Chips, recommended by server. Good, but not great compared to some of the stuff back home on the pier. A bit dry, and served wrapped in a cone, but w/ newspaper--the ink! yuck... Fries were nothing special. But the roasted duck was nice and tender, with tasty cranberry gravy mixed sauce.  And the grapefruit soda also recommended for its freshness. But for the value, $75 including tip, nah....guess one's paying for the location.
