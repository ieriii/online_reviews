I love this place and the decor inside the massive space. The salads here are great. If you come here for lunch, make sure to order the lunch portions which are huge. This place can get pretty crazy on weekends so be prepared for a bit of a wait. You can peruse the extensive menu while you wait for your table - it will take a while to get through the entire thing.
