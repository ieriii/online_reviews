The weekend brunch buffet packs some serious punch at India House. This was the best Indian I've had in Chicago - and all I could eat! As a vegetarian, the buffet supplied a hearty array of options that had me coming back for seconds, then thirds, and contemplating fourths (which went something like this - "Do I eat more Aloo Gobi if it means that I will throw up? What if I throw up first, then eat more aloo gobi? Will this ruin lunch for my girlfriend? What if it ruined lunch for everyone? then we might get asked to leave before they think to give us our check").  Highlights we're the saag corn and their baingan makhani (with whole baby eggplants!). But, really everything I had was worth trying.  I can't give it 5 stars, as it was a buffet, and psychologically, it's hard to ascribe much refinement to a dining experience with no presentation or even separation between foods. If we could do that, then KFC's gravy-corn-potato-fried-chicken-swirl depression-buckets might hit the 5 spot for some people - and a rule needs to be in place to systematically bar that from happening. That said, go here and pay a well-spent 15-20 dollars for a brunch that will satisfy your indian cravings for a long time, as well as your physical appetite for at least 24 hours (if that's the kind of thing you might shoot for). As a glutton for spice, though, the lack of any stand out dishes that brought some serious heat would be my one substantive criticism for the food, but nothing was dull.
