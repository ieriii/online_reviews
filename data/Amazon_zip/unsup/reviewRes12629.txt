FAIL. I can officially say that I will probably not return to texas de brazil. Usually service here is super awesome but the last time was just a miserable dinner for us. We made reservations but were sat at an undesirable section AGAIN. Are we ugly? I don't believe so. I mean we dressed well coming from work and all. Is my BCBG dress not good enough cuz I felt that the country looking tourists slobs had better seating than us. Is my lipstick hideous on me? Do you not like my color choices?? I just had a facial the day before, did it fuck up my face??? I had on some Burberry Brit sheer, did it stink?? Waaaaaaaaaah! Tell ME Texas de brazil! Why are you ashamed of us?? :-p On to the next. The food took fucking forever. The guy asked me how I liked my lamb and I said rare. He said he'd have to come back for that. Alrighty. When he finally came back I had totally forgotten all about it and he had to remind me because that much time had passed. It was when we had finished up our meal already. Nice. Also we both requested rare for a lot of our meats but always were given cuts from the outside where it was charred on the outside making the meat not even rare. Well ok.Why bother asking I wondered. Finally, they said they'd come back with more plaintains that never came so we left. The mashed potatoes also took forever that I had to ask again and again for them. "oh we forgot!" It was annoying. Atleast when one of the guys was slicing up some meat for me and the juices got on my friend's dress pants, the manager showed up and offered to reimburse my friend's dry cleaning bill for his pants. We declined but that was really nice because they had apologized profusely. In the end, it was an extremely disappointing meal and service and we'll likely go elsewhere to abuse our stomachs with lots of meat. It's our thing. Hellooo Zed and Brazazz.
