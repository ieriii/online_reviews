Love Sunda! We first went for the Chef's Tasting Menu deal I got on Groupon. Each portion of the menu was plentiful - more than enough for sharing between two people. Since then, we have gone back to order from the regular menu, and enjoyed that as well. The dining room is a bit on the loud side, but wasn't so bad that it would keep us away.  Some of our faves - the Chop Chop Chicken Salad and the Rock Shrimp Tempura for starters. All of the sushi rolls we had were great - especially the Yellowtail Jalapeno roll. Have fun here and enjoy!
