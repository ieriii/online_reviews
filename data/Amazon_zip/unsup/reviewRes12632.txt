YUM! I had never had Cuban food before, but I grabbed up the groupon when this place was featured and my bf and I went for dinner on a Friday.  The red sangria was great, and I loved all the fruit that was floating in my glass. For dinner, I got the blackened duck... I had never tried duck before, but it was delicious! I would absolutely order it again. My bf got some sort of flank steak or something, which he really enjoyed. We also ordered the empanada appetizer and that was also great. I would give this place 5-stars, but it's a bit pricey without the groupon. Either way, we'd definitely go back if we were crazing Cuban food again.
