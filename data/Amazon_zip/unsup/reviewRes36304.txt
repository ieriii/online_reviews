Indie, I still love you. But your Jade Buddha apps (chive and water chestnuts in a crispy shell) were really not good. I was hoping they would be similar to Tac Quick's chive potstickers, but to no avail. Too little shell and too many chives. Flavors were very meh. I will continue to feast on their rangoon as apps.
