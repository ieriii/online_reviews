When my family and I stayed here during the first part of the summer it was relaxing and the service was outstanding and attentive. However, as our stay extended for another two weeks I began to notice that the first-rate service I had previously experienced completely flipped. I felt as if we were staying at a completely different hotel. Housekeeping would come to our room but would leave a pile of dirty towels on the floor and one day housekeeping came to our door at 8 in the morning to chastise my father for calling the front desk after our room had not been cleaned. I thought it was completely unprofessional and unwarranted. Additionally, when I ordered a bread pudding from room service there were moldy strawberries on the plate. Although I enjoyed the first week of my stay, I felt like the last two did not match up quality and service-wise. One good thing about the hotel though is the rooms.Additionally, for all of you fitness buffs the gym is not complimentary but it costs about 15 dollars a visit.
