The food was great, I was not pleased with the service.  Green means go, not wait, and I don't like to wait until my stomach reminds me that I'm full when I go to a place where you can eat meat until you pass out. It took forever to get our drinks and even longer to get the check. I was debating between two and three stars, but after remembering their sirloin, I tilted towards three. This sort of place should be all about service!
