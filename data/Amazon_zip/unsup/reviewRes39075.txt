Another review is sort of pointless at this point, given they are already closing in on 900.  That said, here is mine in brief. This place was highly touted and met expectations. We went for brunch on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. We were seated fairly rapidly considering the day. We had the duck hash and the crab benedict, and a few drinks. The food is top notch with great fresh ingredients and very well cooked. My companion and I split the plates and thoroughly enjoyed both. For the price, you probably can't do better for breakfast food of this quality. Their beer, spirit, and cocktail menu is very nice and competitively priced. The service was fine and friendly, but not always timely, so nothing outstanding there. For the food... I'll be back again for sure.
