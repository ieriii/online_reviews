Me and the BF had our first dinner as LP residents here on Saturday. Very cheerful and crowded, but they seared us right away. I had the beef with asparagus which had tons of crisp, fresh asparagus, and he had the curried duck, which was very flavorful. Yummy lemonade and ice cream. $40 for us both! We'll definitely be regulars.
