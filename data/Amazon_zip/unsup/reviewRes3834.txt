This is one of those places I get a craving for every month or so and nothing else will do. Can you get better bi-bim-bop in the city? Sure. Are there places where you get better bi-bim-bop AND all the menu items aren't named by a frat boy in his second year of business school, broseph? Definitely. Buuuut the bi-bim-bap here IS good and fresh, and the korean-style fried chicken is really really really tasty. And they deliver. On bikes. I like it.
