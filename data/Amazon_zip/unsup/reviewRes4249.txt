Finally. I finally made it in. For years, I'd thought about coming here but couldn't find anyone to come with. Out of exhaustion, I made a note to self when my musician friends came to town, I would take them here and bask in the glow of the glitzy sign. Finally. Well, they had a baby and life gets a little complicated after that happens (so I hear). I thought, "Well, someday I'll get to check it out. Maybe I'll go by myself one late, dark, stormy night." I didn't have to wait for such a cataclysm. One of my musician roommates from college was in town and he was on his way to the Green Mill. As someone who plays professionally (and knows all things jazz), I was convinced the reason I'd waited so long to come here was so that I could experience it with someone who got every nuance of the experience. I was right. Not only was the set hot (it journeyed from touching to electric to soothing to confrontational to illuminating), but the people were nice (met the musicians thanks to my in-the-know bro), the beer was cold, and the atmosphere was exactly as I imagined it. I recently went on a vacation to my future island home. While there, I was overwhelmed with all the history. America's a pretty young country. We can't compete in _years_ of history, but we can get a leg up when it comes to ghosts. I am not much for ghost stories, but I didn't mind the view I heard -- through song -- during my time at the Green Mill. You're not a Chicagoan until you've come here. I'm finally a Chicagoan. P.S. Stella's breasts are hypnotic. *Try* to look away. You can't.
