Everything about the place deserves a 5-star, except the food. The staff is great, the crowd was great (it was really hard to get in when it just opened but it's settled down now), the beer is great. I think the food needs work though. They are trying to be fancier with it than they are able to pull off I think. I'm a fan of wood-oven style pizza in general but I think they missed the mark a bit. Needs some dough and ingredients improvements. The "real" ceasar salad I found to be a bit gross (despite normally loving those too). I also have tried the pulled-pork on-top-of burger, which was better but didn't really jive for me. I'm jealous of all the folks who tried the bacon-fat popcorn, I've heard it's awesome. Anyway, I won't be popping in for lunch again anytime soon, but definitely go check it out for the great beer and cool atmosphere!
