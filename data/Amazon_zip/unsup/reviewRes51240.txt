I generally leave here slowly, wobbling a bit with a smile on my face. Wishbone always hits the spot. I am the type of person that doesn't get too adventurous at my favorite places - - the biscuits and gravy and cheesy grits are staples. I typically pair these with an egg dish (all the benedicts are good), pancakes, etc. The andouille dishes have all been good, especially the chicken sausage. I have only ventured into the lunch area once and was not disappointed. I had the country-fried steak and it was excellent. Lastly, it is really a great place to take young children - - we have a 2-month and 2 year old and never feel out of place.
