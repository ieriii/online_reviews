Can't really go wrong with a good burger, fries, whiskey, and craft beer. It probably helped that one of the people in our party knew the staff, because we got excellent service. The bathroom had soap and lotion that at first smelled refreshing, but then reeked of Ben-Gay. I walked out smelling like my grandma, which was amusing to everyone in my party.
