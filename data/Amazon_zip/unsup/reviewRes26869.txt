When you hear how everyone else raves about their experience at Frontera Grill--the infamous Rick Bayless Frontera Grill--you have to assume it's a fluke when both you and your friend rate the food as being...meh. Nonetheless, a review is a review. So here goes... I started with, what I believe was called, the Gold Star Margarita. And it was delish. I'm pretty sure it was fresh lime juice, which made all the difference. Then we ordered the Tropical Tuna Cocktail and that was very mediocre. I didn't think the mango paired well with the guacamole. And as we continued to eat, I felt more like I was eating out of obligation of having ordered it, rather than because it was amazing. Then came the main dishes. I hear Bayless is known for his mole's so we ordered the Mole Trio, hoping to get a variety (it's the spice, no?). All three moles were sooooo blah. Nothing stood out--to either of us. I mean, I was really shocked. We didn't finish any of the three tiny dishes. We also ordered the Ocean Trout in Peanut Salsa. I'm pretty sure the trout wasn't fully cooked. It was pretty pink and sushi-like in the center. The peanut sauce was tasty. But it wasn't enough to make me want to devour the plate in front of me. So with all that being said, both of us had a C- experience. (at least we both agreed that we were very unimpressed). Could it be because we began eating at 10pm? Maybe the chefs were tired and the food was overcooked at that point. Not sure. But I'm not convinced that this characterizes the full menu as, like I said, so many people rave about it here. Regardless, we were very dissapointed. I'd probably give it another go round, just to double check, but it's a shame. Maybe better next time?
