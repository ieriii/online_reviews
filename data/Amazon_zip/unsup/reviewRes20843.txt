Hands down, best sushi for us peasants. Steve, stick to River North my friend. Volcano Roll is the shit! Never had any issues with the BYOB policy cause I will go to a bar or stay at home if I want to binge drink, see what I'm sayin' Steve? Service is always pleasant. Parking is a bitch so I take a cab or a bus. I love this place. Well worth the trip no matter where you are coming from unless you are an asshole in which case don't go out at all, ever!
