Yes, you're going to have to most likely wait to sit down. That's because this place is so popular. If you're wanting to eat quicker, yet don't want to take your meal to go and are willing to stand up while you eat, get your food to go, then just take it to the little counter next to the door. No one will question you and you can watch everyone you were just standing in line with wait for another 30 minutes. The food itself? Absolutely high quality. It's Rick Bayless. Top Chef Masters Champion, and you can eat at one of his restaurants for under $15 bucks. I'm not a big hot chocolate fan, but the blend they make here is great. You honestly can't go wrong with anything.
