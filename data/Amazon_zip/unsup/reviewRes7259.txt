The ambiance was awesome and the outdoor patio was very cute. A lot of after-work people like myself. The prices were expensive but the food was pretty decent. The chips and pickles were yummy, the limeade drink was delicious, the cornbread was great, all the BBQ sauces were good, but my brisket sandwich (good size) was kind of fatty and almost had a spongy consistency which I did not like. I would come back to order drinks with co-workers and order something else. Not good for vegetarians that's for sure.
