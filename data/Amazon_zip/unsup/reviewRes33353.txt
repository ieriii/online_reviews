Sultan's Market, I adore you. Actually, it's more like borderline obsession. How many times have I circled you in search of an always-elusive parking spot? Too many to count. Who catered my last birthday party? You. I'm beginning to think this is a one-sided relationship but that's okay... because you're so damn good.  Everyone else is on to you too, because there's always a line. But the staff moves quickly. It's difficult to come here and not get the terrific falafel, but I've also had both the chicken and lamb shawermas and they're delicious. Good complex flavor-- the medium has just enough kick yet is ever-so-slightly sweet. Sultan's lines their pitas with Jerusalem Salad-- a mix of mostly cucumbers, some tomatoes, parsley, a touch of olive oil and tahini. It's awesome... and that's coming from someone who despises tomatoes! The Jerusalem Salad is sometimes bit runny though, so get it on the side if you don't like a "wet" sandwich. Also, on the not-to-be missed list: * The salad bar (so fresh, great variety!) * Egg & Cheese Pie (dense and chewy) * Hummus (very smooth and somewhat spicy) * Baba (best I've had!) * Egg & Cheese Fettia (my favorite item on the menu) Oh, and Sultan's Market is completely reasonable... I hesitate using the word "cheap" because I don't want to diminish the perceived quality!
