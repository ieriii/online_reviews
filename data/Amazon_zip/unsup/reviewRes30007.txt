As a white man with glasses and no visible scars on my face, when I ask for a dish that is hot in the majority of Chicago Thai restaurants, I am usually eyeballed by the server, given the once-over, and dismissed as someone who doesn't really know what they want. I can almost hear the waitstaff's thought process; "What he really wants is something NOT spicy rather than the the spicy thing he ordered, even though he said he wants it spicy. I am a server and I know best". It's is so upsetting when I ask for something to be real hot, Thai-hot, can't-hear-anymore-because-my-ears-are-plugged-up-with-fire-hot, stick-my-head-in-a-bucket-of-ice-and-watch-it-boil-hot, and I end up getting New-Brunswick-on-a-spring-morning-hot. That usually means that I have to scowl at the server, ask for chili sauce, and make them watch me make my own food hot. NOT TRUE AT OPART. Goodness, finally a Thai restaurant that isn't afraid of their customers "accidentally" ordering hot and spicy food. It all tastes great too. Fast and friendly service, wine chillers (I think... It's hard to remember when your head is on fire), real good food, and great prices. I love it every time I go. The only reason this place doesn't get five stars from me is because it is not a dive bar. Add some year round christmas lights, a dingy uneven bar, and a bunch of neighborhood drunks slumped over broken and off balance bar stools and Opart will get that last star from me. Then again, that just might ruin their awesome Thai Restaurant. I guess you should just assume that this is a five star review.
