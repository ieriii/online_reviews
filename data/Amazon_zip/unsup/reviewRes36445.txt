This place is great, genuinely friendly service, fresh sushi, inviting atmosphere, great prices, BYOB and their version of (Thai) Panang ranks among the best in the city. This place is the Butterfly (Grand ave) equivalent of the North Side, given that they balance Pan-Asian Japanese/Thai equally well. Service is never something I care about, but the service here is consistently friendly in the most sincere way. The food, price and genuinely friendly service makes this one of the best in the city. BTW- Other Thai favorites: Spoon Thai (Western), Classic Thai Clark St.
