I went here with two friends from the East Coast - Boston and Long Island - so they certainly know good seafood (and honestly probably a little hesitant to try it here in the middle of the country). I really wanted to try this based on a recommendation from a friend, and I'm glad we did. We sat outside, since the inside seating had a 45+ minute wait. It was chilly, but we survived the brisk, fall weather, and we weren't alone. When we sat, we got a basket of crackers. The seafood specialities were written on a chalkboard on the outside wall, so we all started with ordering the clam chowder from it. The chowder literally came in a cup, like one with you would drink tea of coffee. The friend order lobster fettuccine, and the other two of us got crab cakes. They were boasted as the best in the world - so we couldn't resist. I really enjoyed them with the sauce, some sort of red pepper perhaps? There were chunks of crab. We didn't get drinks but there was a nice beer selection. Mussels looked good piled on a plate at nearby table. I highly recommend the Glen's!
