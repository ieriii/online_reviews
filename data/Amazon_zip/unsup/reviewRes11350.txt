Any place that has an average wait time of 45 minutes must be doing something right. I only started eating here a couple of months ago, but now I have spontaneous cravings for BLT benedict. I wish i could say I have tried the whole menu, but I cant get enough of the BLT. Everything on the menu looks good, and I'm sure one day I will venture out, but for now, I'm sticking to this. I tried the smoked salmon benedict my first time, and was not a fan actually. It initially tastes good (first 2 bites) but it is overly salty. The salmon is just too much, and impossible to enjoy. I think if it had something to offset the salty taste it might be a more enjoyable dish. Everyone is very friendly and down to earth. I especially liked that the hostess remembered my name and face every time I have been there. The only downfall is the wait, but its definitely worth it. Ive notices around 1pm the place clears out, so maybe coming around then on the weekend would get you right in the door.
