With huge portions and perfectly seasoned entrees, Opart Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant, so far, in Chicago. The catfish curry, red curry eggplant, Peanut Sauce Spring Rolls and the Basil dish are all excellent. It's about $26 for two to share one appetizer and two entrees. If you the type to judge a restaurant by it's service, don't plan on coming here during the day shift. The service is terrible, rushed and extremely in-genuine. I have never had a problem with the service during busy dinners.
