came here for a "complimentary business lunch" on a friday afternoon. (for those of you keeping track, yes, this was my 2nd freebie meal at a 'brazillian steakhouse' - which is very random, but i'm not complainin'!). first thought: woah! this place is huge! and really decorated! and i kind of love it all! except, what the hell is that monstrosity of a silk floral focal point? yick. design-snobbiness aside, my fellow diner & i were fairly promptly seated and our waiter explained the ins and outs of the brazillian steakhouse experience. salad bar was great, and meats were really tender & juicy. dessert was so-so, but who cares at that point?! my fellow diner kept saying that her fiance would LOVE this place. i agree - it's totally the spot to bring those guys who hate froofy food and have a hard time getting excited for a fancy dinner, out on the town. the wine acrobat was a funky enhancement to our lunch (thought that stupid silk floral display blocked much of our view!).... this is a great place to feel entertained while dining. they take reservations via http://opentable.com too :) love that.
