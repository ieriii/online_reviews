Just came back from Hot Dougs and after reading a lot of reviews on yelp, we expected a super long wait especially on a Saturday afternoon. We arrived at noon and ordered our food an hour later- not bad at all! We ordered five hot dogs and shared them all. My favorite was the foie gras with duck sausage- outstanding! The duck fries are addictive. Definitely coming back.
