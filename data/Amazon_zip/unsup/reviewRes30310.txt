If you're vegan or vegetarian, you have to go here. All the comfort food in the world for you to try and enjoy meat free. My favorite is the reuben- I don't even like saurkraut! But something about it is a perfect blend of sweet and sour and hearty. Yum. They also have vegan Milkshakes and sundaes with Temptation Vegan Ice Cream (http://www.welovesoy.com). It's to die for! My dairy friends said it's better than a regular one! I also love the Empanadas (When they have them) and the breakfast burrito- they're tofu scram is perfect. I'd skip over anything you can order elsewhere- like hummus, thai bowl, etc... I mean c'mon, why pay $8 for one of those here, when you can get something unique for the same price?
