I keep going back to Wakamono. More than the delicious maki rolls I love, I am a huge fan of the decor. This place is super fresh, the service is quick and the atmosphere is laid back and trendy.  I love sitting near the koi fish pool and fountain that borders the front right window of the restaurant. The soft trickle of water, the hum of engaged conversation and the exotic taste of rice, soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi come together to make an enjoyable experience every time.  A great place for late lunch or dinner.
