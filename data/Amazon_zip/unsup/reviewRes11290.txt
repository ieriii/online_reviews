This city is an embarassment of riches when it comes to locally brewed beer. Piece is a huge part of this. Their pizza: rock solid. Yeah its huge sheets of thin crust, but some nights my arteries prefer straight grease to pounds of bread, tomatoes, and cheese. (Forgive me Chicago deep dish, you are still #1 in my heart) Their beer: awesome, inventive, and most importantly accesible to even the most staunch anti-beer folks. I could find something on the menu everybody liked, and got to indluge in some kick ass darker beers. Best of all, you can leave with a growler! Their atmosphere: The space lends itself to being a loud sports bar. Its a little tough to have conversation, but it sort of comes with the territory. Finally, Live Band Karaoke is fantastic. The band knows to drown out the crappy singers and let the solid ones shine, I just wish fewer people thought they could hit the notes for Radiohead's "Creep" Come on folks, know your limitations
