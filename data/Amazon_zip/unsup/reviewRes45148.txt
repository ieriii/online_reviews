This is my favorite Italian spot in Chicago. The food here is amazing. I've eaten here countless times as it is a block from home. I have never had a bad meal. I have had problems with the temperature in the dining room... on my last trip it was VERY hot and it can get VERY loud in the establishment as well. That being said, the food keeps me coming back. The octopus on the appetizer menu is AMAZING. For those of you afraid of it, do try it.  The octopus is tender and tasty. You can not go wrong with any of the pasta dishes... especially if it involves a boar ragu.  As for dessert, I would take a pass. I've yet to have an amazing dessert at this spot. However, as for Italian food in Chicago... this is as good as it gets!
