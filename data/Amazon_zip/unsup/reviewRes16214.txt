I've been here about 20+ times. I love this place. I love the friendly bartenders, the amazing drinks, the elegant and relaxed interior, everything. There seems to be a lot of people that need to know some things before they come. I don't recommend coming here with large parties, especially when it's busy. It will probably take a long time for you to get a seat. You have to order large carafes of cocktails and they don't taste as good as cocktails made on an individual basis. Come here in a laid back mood expecting to wait a while for your drinks. The bartenders are very serious about their cocktails and they take their time making sure they're great. If you come on the weekend or see a line out the door, expect to wait to get in, maybe a long time. I don't understand why people complain about waiting two hours to get a seat. Why would you write a poor review because the place is popular and you were dumb enough to stand around waiting hours to get in? This is my favorite bar in the city, but I'd never wait over an hour. If there's a long wait, go somewhere else, pretty easy. Consider this a fine dining bar. If you went to Tru or Charlie Trotter's, would you ask for a hot dog with some mac and cheese? These people are very good at what they do. They have spent a lot of time learning about liquor and how to mix drinks precisely to great effect. It's insulting when they've spent all this time constructing a wonderful cocktail list and you ask for a cosmo or a dirty grey goose "martini". If you're not interested in their cocktails, there are plenty of near by bars that will suit your tastes.
