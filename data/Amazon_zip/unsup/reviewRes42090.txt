A Vietnamese joint with a Joy Yee's-sized menu...yet not with the same flavors. If you're a lover of Pho, I'd say go for it. They're giant just like you always want your bowl of Wheaties or Mac 'N Cheese to be...but the natives say it isn't as authentic as other spots on the Argyle strip. It's missing some 'umph' however I don't know what to suggest to make it any better... ;(
