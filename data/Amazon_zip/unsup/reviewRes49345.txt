My husband and I love coming here on a Sat/Sun morning for a scone and coffee, or a cinnamon roll. Support this local establishment, rather than the Starbucks across the way. Intelligentsia coffee, fresh and tasty pastries. You will not be disappointed. When not going for breakfast, this is our go-to place for birthday cakes, cupcakes and other dessert treats. The red velvet cake is delicious, and the cupcakes are moist and unique. Bring some treats for a dinner party, or pick up your friend's birthday cake. You won't be disappointed.
