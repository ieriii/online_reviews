So you want to take a date or a group of friends to a great place for it's food and it's atmosphere? This is it! If you have a group larger than six it may be a longer wait but well worth it! The average cost per person here for the main entree is around 50.00 per person. The neat thing about this place is that you get to try all the great food for one price! Drinks and Dessert are extra... but you will not forget this experience! Great restaurant and helpful friendly staff makes this one of my favorite Brazilian restaurants!
