I spent my birthday weekend in Chicago and at a friends suggestion we staid at the Ritz. The location is amazing, right across the street from the water tower. The staff was perfectly helpful and the room was immaculate, perhaps the decore was a bit dated. Marie Antoinette would have felt right at home. I asked a friend who went along in what style the room was decorated and he jokingly said it was "Mormon temple" On a better note the Sunday brunch is not to be missed. A bit pricy, but with a breakfast cocktail included and everything from prime rib to an amazing raw seafood bar, to full service sushi it is perfect for a special occasion. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay at the Ritz again.
