Their food is simply delicious - and I lived in the DC area where there are loads of Ethiopian establishments! The staff here is so friendly and really make us feel at home. The combos can get a little confusing but you can do what we did: write it down and just hand over the list when it's time to order ;-) Come to think of it, this would make a great first date place. If your date has a narrow view of the world, this is a great way to find out. If your date does have opposable thumbs (needed for Ethiopian dining ;-) you've got loads to talk about. Ooooh - and try the coffee. It's the way coffee is supposed to taste!
