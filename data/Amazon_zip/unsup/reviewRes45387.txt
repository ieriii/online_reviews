Good burger, cool atmosphere...Note to management: .When it is in the 40's outside, turn on the fireplace near the books. We ate lunch there and were told by the bartender they wouldn't turn it on because it gets hot....That was the point!! . Another couple came in as we were leaving wanting the same thing...Listen to your customers!!!!.. without them you have no business!
