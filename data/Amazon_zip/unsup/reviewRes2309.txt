So after reading all the reviews and all the comments about hot dougs I finally decided to venture out and try it. I was well prepared for the wait and it wasn't necessarily as bad as I thought but in the end I think we waited about 1 and a half hours by the time we were out it was a good two hours just to get the hot dogs. I don't know if my expectation was just too high or I'm just missing something. The room was crowded after we ordered so we just decided to take it to go. I was super excited for the duck fat fries everyone talks about so I tried one right as they gave me the order. Wait..... I don't get it. It tasted like regular fries. I'm not sure why they were so special. Maybe they gave us the wrong fries but I don't know. They were just simply.... fries. Better than mcDonalds but not special enough for me to wait that long for. I thought well okay, I should try the hot dogs before I judge. So I went back to a friends place to try them. We got the Applewurst and the game of the week which was a buffalo dog with ale and some other things. Our ultimate conclusion was that the hot dogs were special. As it unique but definitely not something I would want to wait in line for almost 2 hours to get. It was an experience for me I'm not exactly amazed by the dogs but now I've tried it I don't think I'll be going back.
