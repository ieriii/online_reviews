So word is I have some past connection to the owners/managers, though my memory is so jaded it probably doesn't mean much, but holy frijoles robin...they fry up some tasty birds here and eating food from places like this reminds me why flesh is meant to pass through my mouth, into my body and leave me feeling fat, full and flatulent. All in all a great day when you have a plate of wings from here. Don't know if its BYO since I've only walked by and had people bring it to me, but I do suggest beer to accompany the food with this place. This is one of them places to get you fat and happy and proud to live in a city with only 4 months of summer.
