Frontera Grill serves some of the best authentic Mexican food in Chicago. There is always a long wait so dont go here if you are super hungry, but if you can stand the wait your meal is worth it. Also this is more expensive than some of the other Mexican restaurants in the city, but i think the food is also much better!
