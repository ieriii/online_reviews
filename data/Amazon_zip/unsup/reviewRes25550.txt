Great room; decent service and strong cocktails. That's the low down in a couple of seconds.  I was here Friday night with a friend and overall, our experience was "nice enough." I must say that there wasn't a thing "bad" about our experience; it just wasn't anything we hadn't experienced before.  Instead of opting to wait 45 minutes for a table (clearly we should have thought about this prior to traversing out on a weekend night), we decided to sit upstairs (main dining room) in a sunken in lounge like area that could seat about 4-6 parties. Our server was attentive (albeit very very young, much like the rest of the staff here) and brought us our drink order swiftly. Damn, my drink was strong - some red concoction with anise in it.  As we weren't starving and were only looking to graze that evening, we ordered the tortilla (not the name on the menu, but it's a lot like the tortilla served at Cafe Iberico), a flat bread with mushrooms and manchego and a couple of grilled (a la planxa) items, namely the calamari and tuna. We loved the tortilla and flatbread, but the calamari and tuna left us lukewarm.  I'd definitely give it another shot, but with a bill for over $80.00 for 4 tapas dishes and 2 cocktails, I may wait a little bit before making it a destination.  Oh, the room is splendid; high ceilings, sunken in dining area with a theater style kitchen in the rear.
