Weekend pizza delivery. Always a good idea, right? We ordered a large, thin crust pizza with spinach, mushroom, garlic, and pepperoni, and a meatball sandwich. They deliver RC Cola products, so we specifically said no soda, but a bottle still showed up anyway. The meatballs were really huge and tasty, but didn't really translate entirely to the sandwich - I didn't really like the bread. The pizza toppings and sauce were good (although, there wasn't much pepperoni), but the crust was borderline cardboard-ish. Seeing as we're working our way through the many pizza places that deliver to us, we probably won't be ordering from La Villa soon.
