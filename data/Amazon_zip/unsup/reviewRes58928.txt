'SUNDA' = that's Japanese for 'VIAGRA DEPENDENT'.Another classically smarmy Chicago 'face-place' for the East Bank Club'in suntan booth, liposuction and hair transplant set. Don't forget to stall in front of the place while parking your leased EuroTrash sports car --like all the other cologne-zone-clones.The food tries sooooo hard to be interesting -- but it's copied straight from similar's in LA -- from two years ago. The 'authentic' Filipino Pancit -- was anything but.
