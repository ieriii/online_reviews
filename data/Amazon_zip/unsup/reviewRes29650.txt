I've ordered takeout and eaten here for both lunch and dinner. Opart Thai is a nice joint, don't get me wrong, but somewhat overrated. You can get better Thai food for a better price at a few other places, for sure. Still, if you've never eaten here before, it's worth a visit. I mean, it's good, but not superb.
