Holy smokes, this place was terrible. If you're considering coming here for a drink, don't. It takes 20 minutes to get a beverage, and not in the Violet Hour, you're-comfortably-seated-and-enjoying-the-vibe way, but in the, I'm-at-a-crowded-bar-and-hope-I'm-showing-enough-cleavage-to-get-the-bartender's-attention way. The pours are stingy and the service is disaster, wrapped elegantly in a trying-too-hard wrapper. If you still want to go here, drop me a line. I'll let you come over to my house where I'll ignore you, then charge you for looking at my bar. The only reason its got 2 stars is the food is decent if you make this your dinner destination-- I just hope you like eating amongst a raucous crowd.
