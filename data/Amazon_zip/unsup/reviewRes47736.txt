They always say the third time's a charm. Those words rang true at my third attempt at Zed451. As you read from my previous review, one can only wonder why we'd come back. Thanks to Tim Fannin, General Manager extraordinaire who takes consumer feedback very seriously, we were invited back to Zed451 the other night to give the place another change. I can say without any hesitation that Zed451 has THE BEST customer service in the city. Thank you for listening to our reviews and rectifying the situation.
