I'm fairly certain a majority of people who dine at Zed451 leave in a meat coma. I, however--beating to my own drum once again--left in a major cheese coma instead. Zed451's harvest table spread was amazing - your eyes will undoubtedly prove bigger than your stomach, but that's okay. While everything I tried was superb, my standouts were the sauteed mushrooms with feta sauce and the duck confit. And of course, EVERY SINGLE CHEESE on the table. I'm not kidding when I say every single one. It's just not right if you miss out on any of them. Unfortunately, I wasn't in a meat loving mood when my parents and I enjoyed an evening at Zed, so I opted out of the meat extravaganza. However, my dad and mom perservered, and my dad (ever the carnivore), couldn't get enough of the buttermilk herb bottom sirloin and the ribeye. If you love quality meat, you will love Zed. Their craft beer list isn't too shabby, and their Spiced Apple Bourbon was a perfect end to the evening. Nothing like a sweetly infused Woodford Reserve to see me on way.
