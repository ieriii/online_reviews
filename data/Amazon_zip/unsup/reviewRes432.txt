There isn't much else to say about Alinea other than everything has been so carefully thought out and planned down to the perfect combination of art and science. By far, the best meal and dining experience I've ever had. (having been to les nomades, everest room, charlie trotters, tru, the former Trio in evanston...i think i can say that.) My taste buds were so exhausted from all the amazing new textures, temperatures, surprises and flavors throughout our 3 hour dinner. Everything, even things that I wouldn't normally like, like crab mouse, was delicious.  I have to say the menthol chocolate dessert at the end was my least favorite dish...mainly I feel it was more a gimmic and theatrical display, than a great dessert, but everything else was total genius. Oh wait, actually, the course Thai Distilliation, was totally not a course people...at least it shouldn't have been counted as a course...it was a beverage, picture half a glass of champagne...but oh well, perhasp that was over my head. I highly recommend going to Alinea at least once in your lifetime. I'm trying to figure out how I can reason with my check-book to go again next year!
