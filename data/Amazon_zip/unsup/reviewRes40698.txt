So this place has been officially outed, as last time I went there, the number of white people nearly outnumbered the number of asians. Not that that's a bad thing. I'm happy more people are getting to experience the delicious pho and other vietnamese specialties. However, it does get quite crowded, especially on the weekends. I've been going there for the past few years with my family. Last Sunday, my family and I went there around 4, and the place was packed! We thought we would avoid the dinner rush by going early, but I guess not. The servers and bussers are very quick and efficient though, so despite the packed place with a few groups ahead of us, we got to sit down within 5 minutes.  It's an authentic, no-frills place where you come to get reliable and inexpensive vietnamese food (like pho!). The menu is expansive, and so far everything I have tried has been good. My grandpa once ordered a bowl of noodles that had chunks of blood pudding in it ("I've never seen red tofu before!") and he actually enjoyed it, so try new dishes too!
