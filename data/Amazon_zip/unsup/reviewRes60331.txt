I was just introduced to this place last week. I've been there twice now. Really liked the food but the second time I went there the sushi was mushy and we had to wait over an hour for a table. Not sure if the food is worth that long wait. The hostess could not commit to a time when I first showed up. We went on a Thursday night. I will give them another try.
