I LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel. I stayed here about a year and a half ago (wasn't really a yelper then). It's a very pretty hotel that has some amazing views and is in a great walking location--although not very close to an EL stop. This place can run really expensive, but I lucked out big time when I booked through their website and got a really cheap price (I think because I booked so far in advance). Since then, when I've come back to the city I haven't been able to afford the place because it books fast and usually the expensive rooms are the ones left. I would definitely recommend this place, and will stay here again when I can.
