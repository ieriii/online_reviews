Whats best for an Easter morning hangover? Vegan chilaquiles at Chicago Diner! After transitioning to vegan several months ago, I don't eat out much. With that said, I've always been a fan of Chicago Diner, just wish I lived closer as I rarely get that far north, but will go more often now. Very friendly staff, Aaron was my server, great menu and the food was delicious! As I was eating alone, I sat at the counter and was happy to enjoy my food and chat with the staff. Coffee was hot and refilled often and I was offered a sample of a vegan strawberry shake by one of the staff--YUM! I will be back for more deliciousness
