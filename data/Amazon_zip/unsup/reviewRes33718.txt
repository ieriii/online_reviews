I like this place. However, the thing about this is, that it got too popular and the food went down a small hill. Well not always, just some of the time. Sometimes you go in and the falafel sandwiches are great. Sometimes you go in and the falafels feel rubbery and old. The times that it is good outweighs the times that it is bad, so it keeps me coming. The chicken and the rice are always solid, and one thing that is a hit is the bread with the egg and cheese on it. Beware, if you want the egg bread, you have to get there early, they sell out fast!
