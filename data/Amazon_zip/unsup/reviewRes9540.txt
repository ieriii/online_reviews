Absolutely fantastic, one of the best meals I have had in years. I was in Chicago the other week, and I had heard a lot of great things about Sprout, so I came in with high expectations, all of which the restaurant exceeded. Everything about Sprout was outstanding: it was located in an intimate space, the service was professional yet warm, and the food was nothing short of amazing. The menu is definitely atypical, listing only the ingredients and requiring a bit of decoding from the staff. But the presentation was fantastic, the flavors all worked, and everything was of the highest quality. Major kudos also go to Sprout's wine list, which is well done and filled with values. This is definitely my new favorite place in the Windy City.
