I really like this place for some reason. The layout of the place is a bit disorganized but the food and service is excellent. Ive had a few meals here and the food is always top notch. I highly recommend the calamari salad and the lobster stuffed ravioli. You can taste that the pasta is really fresh. This is a hidden gem in chicago, but with over 150 reviews, I guess it's not that hidden.  BYOB is a huge plus.
