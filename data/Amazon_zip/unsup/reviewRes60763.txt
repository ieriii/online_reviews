I've been to Lockdown several times (and ordered delivery probably more times that I have eaten in the restaurant). I'm not a "metal" person per say but a lot of people I hang with are and I love loud music so I'm not phased by the loud metal theme of the bar. When I go to a restaurant the ambiance helps but I'm really concerned about the service and the food. Lockdown WINS on both counts. I know they had some ups and downs with their food, as most start up business's do, they needed time and the right people to make it all work. I think they are definitely getting there. I am a lover of a good burger and there are plenty to choose from at Lockdown! This changes periodically but currently my favorite burger at Lockdown is the Border Patrol...I mean carnitas and jalapenos on a burger??? sign me up, I'm in love. The mac-n-cheese never fails to impress as well. I have never had bad service at Lockdown, delivery or dine-in. My drinks are always full and the wait staff is attentive and happily make any adjustments or changes you may need. I am a bit of a picky eater (major major dislike of condiments) and they have always been happy to accommodate my "issues". Ashley and Sol have always made sure we have a great experience and I will be back as many times as they will let me :) It's great to have an excellent place to get an amazing burger and a drink on this end of town...
