My second foray into real Chicago-style Pizza from Chicago. I had tried Giordano's last year. My opinion is that Gino's East is a little better. The Gino's East Pizza had more cheese, and less sauce. I got the sausage and cheese. The corn meal crust is a little different. I liked it at first, and it seems like it would be more consistent than a traditional yeast crust. In addition to the pizza we also had an order of the calamari, which was tremendous. The breading was very tasty and had a hint of oil from the fryer left on it to add a little flavor and moisture.
