I feel like I found a secret place. Not so secret, I see, since there's 500+ review on this place! Unless you've been here, there is no way you know this unmarked door is an entrance to a cozy, dimly lit lounge. If you are a fan of diverse cocktail with intimate atmosphere, this is the place for you.  According to my boyfriend who's been here before, you are not allowed to pass the 2nd velvet curtain if there is a wait. No one is allowed to STAND. Since I didn't have to wait for a seat today, I cannot tell you how I would feel about being at a bar and not being able to get a drink... I think that would suck.  Other than my not-so-personable waitress, I have no complaints. It was a great place for our drinks after dinner.
