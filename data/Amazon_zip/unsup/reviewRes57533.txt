I absolutely love Greek Islands! My sister and I frequent this place and I must say they have never disappointed me with service or food. The atmosphere is laid back and welcoming from the moment your car is taken by valet. After walking in, you are immediately greeted and seated. (note the rhyme) The infamous bread and butter comes out to keep you company while you decide (from the awesome menu) what it is you want to eat. One of my personal favorite things to order are the meatballs. They are a mixture of pork/beef and come with this very savory sauce....get these as an appetizer and you will definitely be pleased!!!
