After a night of stuffing myself full of chicago style deep dish pizza, I decided to have a light lunch at Hot Doug's. Being from California, I am an absolute wuss when it comes to the cold. I guess the other people in line could hear my teeth chatter when they reassuringly told me that the wait was worth it. For all our sakes, I hoped so. 1 hour and 20-odd minutes later: Finally entered zion and it was warm. It was a saturday and they were serving french fries cooked in duck fat. it goes without saying, but i ordered that along with a turducken dog. the guy at the counter was really chill when taking my order. i could tell he was definitely relaxed in his environment. not saying he was lazy or complacent. he was...chill the fries and hot dog were both very very good. anyways, in sum: long wait, chill service, good food. you'll walk out feeling like a champ. a glutinous champ.
