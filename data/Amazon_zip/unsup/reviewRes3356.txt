How does this place have 9 reviews already? Didn't they *just* open? Tonight was my first visit to Crisp, and I was pretty impressed. The owner, Doug, was super nice and outgoing without being pushy. As I was eating, he asked me if it he could tell me about the chicken--he didn't just talk talk talk...he asked permission :) I was in the mood for wings, and I was truthfully walking down the street to Avenue Tavern. I took a peek at the menu in the window (the wording is slightly confusing to me) and went in. The "giant wings" are in fact the entire wing, all three segments. So an order of 5 is like an order of 10 everywhere else. The breading is the signature here. Very very thin and very crisp. I usually eschew breading on wings, but this was very good. The wing sauce is unique here, not your usual half Franks Red Hot, half butter. This was more of an Asian chili paste-based sauce. Very good, even if it wasn't exactly what I had in mind. I'll be back to try the other sauces, and also I want to try the beef bolgogi burrito. Yum.
