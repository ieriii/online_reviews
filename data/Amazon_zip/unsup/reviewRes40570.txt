***Make sure to go to the original yellow building*** This is as authentic as it gets......any more authentic and you would have to go to the taco carts/stands in the streets of Mexico. A true Mexican taco consist of tortillas, carne asada, cilantro, cebolla (onion), a slight squeeze of lime and fresh salsa and this place has this to offer and much more. This place is also great for a sober me up meal.
