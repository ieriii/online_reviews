Me and Amisha S. came here on a Friday afternoon at around 3pm. I was surprised that there was a line wrapped around the building at this time of day. I'd see the lines shown on "No Reservations" but figured it was just the lunch time rush. On, the bright side you get to smell the intoxicating duck fat fries wafting from the front door as people slowly get to enter. After waiting a little over an hour, we got to the friendly Doug at the counter who helped us order. I will admit was a bit overwhelmed by all the tube meat choices and didn't want to make a bad choice after all the opportunity cost involved. We ordered the Keira Knightly, The Dog (w/ chili & cheese), an Irish banger special, and the duck fries!  I now realize Irish bangers are too bland for my taste, but everything else was yummy.  I'd like to come back if I was in town again to try more offerings, but would not be willing to wait 1+ hrs again. Maybe its not as bad on the days duck fries are not available? 3.5 stars for me!
