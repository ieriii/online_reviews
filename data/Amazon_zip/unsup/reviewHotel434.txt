I check into the hotel because I missed a connecting train at Union Station. It was Amtraks fault and this is where they put me. I get into the room and the AC doesn't work. They have no more rooms and bring up a man to fix the AC. I called the front desk and ask if they have somewhere I can get some beer. A guy comes and tells me he'll bring some up. I give him a ten and he never returns. He DID tell me his name, don't give your money to this brother.
