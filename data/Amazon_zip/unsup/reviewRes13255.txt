Great selection of seafood, it one of those places that you look and look and are never sure what to order, it all sounds so so good....and Delivers. I bet the Diner food is equally great but I cant see going and not getting one of the excellent seafood selections. We started with a very nice Crab Cake and the Shrimp cargots both excellent. The Clam Chowder is a real STAR, one of the best I have ever had. I had the Cioppino witch was good, maybe a touch too much celery, my wife had a amazing shrimp stuffed Cat Fish. Great service and many many other things I want to try.
