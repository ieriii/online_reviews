I have been here a couple of times, and I have never been disappointed by the food! Granted, on weekend mornings there is always a long wait, but I do think they do a good job of trying to get you in as fast as they possibly can. Having read other yelp reviews, I tried their strawberry orange juice (fresh squeezed, the only orange juice I will drink) and it is AMAZING! the food is HUGE portions for a very reasonable price, and I always leave with another meal in my hand..:) definitely has become a favorite brunch place!
