What an amazingly beautiful hotel. We went here for Lollapalooza and I have to say I was surprised at how quiet it still was with all us crazy people there. The location is perfect! It only took us less than 10 minutes to get to Grant Park walking. You've got Michigan Ave less than 5 minutes away. O'Hare is about a $40 cab ride away. Not too bad. There are 2 pools which are both lap pools, but not too many people doing laps. 2 hot tubs that were nice and heated to the right temperature. The rooms are very modern and beautiful. Don't get the side with the fire house. I'm a deep sleeper so I never heard it, but the bf complained a lot about the sirens. I wish the balconies had furniture, but I get why they don't. I love that you could schedule your room clean up through the tv. Amazing! I would definitely return on my next trip to Chicago. Loved how friendly and helpful everyone was. Oh almost forgot one of the elevators broke on one of the days and in a few hours it was already fixed. I was quite surprised. Great hotel!
