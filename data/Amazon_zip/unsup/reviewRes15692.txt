Don't let the fact that I only gave this place 3 stars fool you. The food is actually really good. The place is amazing, so pretty inside. My partner and I like to order food for take out on most Friday nights. I have to say, the take out has been really kind of sad. We have ordered take out a few times, every time...sad. Our food is usually cold, had been sitting for a while. Everything is soggy and just very blah. Nothing like how it is when you eat in. In a nutshell, the place is great. The service is good and the food is good. Just never...and I repeat never order take out from here, its just not worth it.
