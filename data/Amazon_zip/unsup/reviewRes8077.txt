Although this is a carnivore's heaven, the salad bar is incredible in itself. As if starting with a city block of salad choices isn't enough, don't' forget the addictive warm cheese bread, crispy polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. But, of course, the main event is meat, meat, meat, and more meat. If you haven't tried a Brazilian steakhouse before, make this your first stop. You will eat like Caesar.
