This was my first time visiting The gage and overall it was a great experience. I must say the decor is amazing, I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant., great for meeting up with friends or even a date night. I ordered the fish and chips and good, I have had better but not in the Chicago, so it's worth ordering and trying out. One thing that didn't really care for was how over sized the menu was, I am not talking about the items on the menu but more so how the actual size of the menu was hard to place on the table before ordering. At one point I stuck my menu behind me, against the chair because it was so in the way. One other thing was maybe our waitress what having a bad night, but she wasn't the most friendly and I suppose not very excited to be there- which right off the bat I noticed . But in her defense- she made sure i was never left dry of beer. :)
