Wow. Wow. Came here from the Greek Festival. I got a croissant and a salad with tomatoes, cucumber, green bell pepper, red onion, Kalamata olives, Salonica Peppers, feta cheese, oregano and red wine vinaigrette. It was to die for. the croissant was fresh flakey and straight out of the oven. The salad was also fresh and had a great taste to it. I wish that I can have this for lunch everyday. I highly recommend this place to all passersby. I love the neighborhood its in. You can instantly feel the culture and generations there. They made me feel like I was at home. Indeed I was.
