Tasty, unique style of pizza.  The crust is chewy goodness and the cheese is outta sight.  Be sure to get a reservation on Fri/Sat nights because the wait can be over an hour at times. While you wait, you can peruse an Italian magazine, or try some pizza crust bread as the they sometime give it out to people waiting for tables. Nice touch.
