yay! fun place! great piece of chicago history. i was here on a sunday evening for some poetry session. some folks/poets outta New York were "guest starring", so my friend called me to join her. she provided the jackncokes, i provided the company. i walked in with no cash, $6dollar cover, atm to the left...BAM. it was a good looking crowd; very diverse and eclectic bunch of people that evening. so you know i fitted right in! i'm a pure jazz-head. unfortunately there weren't any trios or quartets duking it out on stage this evening. but i recommend all chicagoans and tourists to see a session of jazz at the green mill at least ONCE in their lifetime. it will do something to you. y'know that satisfying feeling you get when you're starving and you wolfe down a huge bowl of heavy shrimp and grits?? yeah. i bet most of you don't even like grits. why am i talking about grits???? ..... green mill will be here for another 100 years, but don't take your time. go visit.
