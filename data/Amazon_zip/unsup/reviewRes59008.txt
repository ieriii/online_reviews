I was lucky enough to get invited to the "Pre" opening last Friday for the investors and was really impressed. Brad Young and Arturo Gomez really pay attention to detail when opening a new restaurant. The decor of this place is phenomenal! A gorgeous sushi bar with a free flowing structure suspended from the ceiling gives the illusion of a school of fish and actual ceilings from Asian temples are hanging on the walls!! The bar is beautiful too. This is certainly a top three restaurant in terms of decor in all of Chicago! Now on to the food and service... The menu has all kinds of Asian flair and I loved all of it. We had sushi which was fresh and delicious. We also had some fillet dishes which were cooked to perfection. The sea bass was the best I have ever eaten and I was told that it actually has won awards! There is also an extensive drink menu. I had a sake drink that was fruity, light and really tasty. The server was very good too. Cute with a great personality! This place blows away any Asian cuisine I have experienced in Chicago and I highly suggest giving it a try when the doors open for business this week.
