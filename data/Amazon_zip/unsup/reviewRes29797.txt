Rick Bayless is a genius. Two of us ordered the shredded beef sopes, the goat cheese and barbacoa tamal, and the duck mole with winter vegetables. AMAZING, seriously. The flavors are delicious and the sauces taste so good. If you're a Top Chef (Masters) fan at all, you must eat here. Stopped by XOCO next door afterwards for some hot chocolate. If you know you'll be going here, make reservations about 6 weeks in advance. We managed to get a table and only waited 15 minutes, at about 1pm on a weekday.
