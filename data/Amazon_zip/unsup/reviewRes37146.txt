Had dinner at the bistro, which was very simple yet elegant (minus the paper table clothes). The food was delicious, well worth the price. The service, however, left much to be desired. Very slow, very unfriendly. Not personable at all. The place wasn't even full and it took over 15 minutes to even get bread. Shame, because the food was really good. As for the market I did not purchase anything but I looked around and it seemed terribly overpriced.
