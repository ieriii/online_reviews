Mmmm. Beer and pizza. Three Floyds on draft and--ghasp--THIN CRUST pizza...in CHICAGO of all places! This place is packed at night and so the wait can sometimes be an issue, but its a great place to come with a large group and enjoy some of the finer things life has to offer: friends, pizza, and BEER!
