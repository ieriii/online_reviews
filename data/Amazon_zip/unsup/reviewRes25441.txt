Wow! I have never had fondue and this place was the best way to experience it for my first time. I was looking for a romantic place for my boyfriend and I to celebrate his birthday. This place went above and beyond my expectations. We went during the week which meant it was less crowded. My boyfriend was very impressed with the quality wine selection (we ordered two bottles). The food is definitely pricey and next time i think we could share one plate and it would be more than enough food for two people. The atmosphere was romantic, our waiter was extremely friendly and I loved the gentleman playing the acoustic guitar in the background. My boyfriend and I want to come back with another couple. Overall the food was very good.
