WOW not your typical BBQ joint. My boss took me there for lunch one day and let me tell you I was surprised. Kobe Brisket was very very good. Your meat of choice comes with all three of their bbq sauces, personal favorite South Carolina. Definitely go to this place if you love BBQ. Be careful, can get pricey. French fries, chips, pickles EVERYTHING IS MADE IN HOUSE. Try try try
