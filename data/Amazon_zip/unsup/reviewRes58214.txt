This was some of the best chicken I've eaten in a long time! I would definitely come here again. My friend and I went during Jeopardy and the employees were really cool about playing. Mr friend told me about a cool thing they do there. Ask if a dude named Alden is working and if he is and you tell him Zach sent you, he'll let you put the TV on whatever channel you want!
