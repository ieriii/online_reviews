I went to Big Jones today for brunch, and I absolutely loved it! Highlights: -Great brunch cocktail menu, but didn't try any. Next time... -Great tea selection and comes served in your own little tea steeper. -Complimentary, melt in your mouth beignets -Eggs New Orleans...wow...perfectly poached eggs on top of crab cakes and buttery popovers with hollandaise sauce...ohmygod yum! -Cheese biscuits with real butter and blueberry capote....holy delicious -Great atmosphere -No wait for brunch! -Reasonable prices- mine came to about $30 w/ tip including splitting costs for 2 apps, tea, and my meal I would definitely recommend this place and be back!
