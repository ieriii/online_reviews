Terrible service. Food is ok. We had a table of three, and two friends joined us for drinks after we finished our dinner (now a table of 5). It was about 9PM on a Friday night late in June, and the server refused to bring us the third bottle--I'm guessing the fact that we had just closed out the tab was a factor. Apparently, "There was a need to cut them off." Between three people, we had two bottles of white wine with dinner. We had two more join us, and they refused to serve us another bottle. This would be the first time I have ever been denied service in my life. EVER. And like others said, empty water glasses sat at our table, as our terrible server was MIA, yet somehow he was able to distinguish "the need to cut them off" (even though we saw him a total of about three times during the entire meal) combine for a one star review.  We're not even the type that sits at a packed restaurant and hogs a table while sipping on a nearly empty glass of wine for 2 hours. We ordered promptly, finished one bottle before our main entree was even served, and we were there a total of less than an hour before we tried to order a third bottle when our friends joined us.  Just a very unpleasant dining experience.
