This slightly stuffy Goal Coast spot was a great meal -- truly a fine example of cuisine fusion. The wine list and service were also both excellent. My only gripe would be eye-popping prices. Certainly Le Colonial is a fine restaurant, but I wouldn't eat here unless I'm on an expense account. Which I was. So four stars.
