We had gotten gift cards from a rewards program to come here. We had made reservations a month in advance for 9pm on a Saturday. We arrived at 8:40pm and was told we would be sat closer to 9pm, and that we could sit at the bar to have a drink while we waited. It was packed and then some. We did not take this option, and stood by the lobster tank. There is only one padded window type seat available for those who are not in the bar waiting. At 9:10pm, my husband let the hostess know again that we were there for a 9pm reservation, we had been standing this whole time, and was told that we would be sat in a few minutes. We were led to a small table that had a chair on one side and shared a booth seat with four other tables. I hope that makes sense. We instantly given water and bread, the wheat bread is soft and yummy, the white bread was kind of hard. We ordered off of the price fixed menu, steaks were good, would recommend ordering medium rare, they were good, but what isn't when it's been cooked in lots of butter, no steak sauce needed, sides nothing to write home about. Our server was good, but I was more impressed with the wait help staff, bussers, water guys (not sure of their titles), food runners, wow, they really work their butts off! I hope the servers have to tip them out and I hope that they appreciate how much these helpers do, wow, impressive! After discussing with my husband, we have decided that if we didn't have the gift card, we would not choose to go here again, try Fleming's on Ohio, wow that place was great!
