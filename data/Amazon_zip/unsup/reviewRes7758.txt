we needed a place to seat nine for an 11:30 pm reservation, and through 'open table' we found one of the best restaurants i've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. the ambiance is lovely; dark wood, dim but not dark lighting. the wait staff was wonderful; welcoming, even at that late hour, helpful with recommendations for a tasty wine, conversant and friendly. our server accommodated my 83 yr. old mother who was intent on ordering a mixed seafood dish that was way too ample for her little self by offering her a half portion, and even with that, when it arrived, it was a "whoa" sized amount. the chef also offered a special pasta dish to one of our party who is allergic to dairy. besides those entrees, our group tried an absolutely amazing salad that was large enough to split four ways, the lobster ravioli, short ribs, salmon, & steak, and every single dish was wonderful! there was none of that end of the day tiredness in the food or in the service, and we didn't feel rushed at all, even as the clock ticked past closing time. a bonus i didn't know about at the time is that they offer special coupons through mailers that we routinely just throw away. check those packets out, there are two-fers and a monday night special that offer incredible savings. but even at full price, this place is a gem.
