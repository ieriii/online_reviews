Fries were good. Real good. Service was terrible. Burger was ridiculously raw (I ordered Medium). Took 10 minutes to get water, and another 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge our table. They made us move from a table for 6 (we had 4) to a small table for 4. The place wasn't even busy. Our server must have gotten dumped from her boyfriend that day because she was a huge B****. If you're looking for a bad burger, this is your joint. The Bad Apple.
