Not enough staff to support the crowd, I waited 48 minutes until a waiter assisted me. After the order was taken, it took 34 minutes for my order to come. While the waiter was courteous, and helpful w/food choices, nothing worked that night. Tables are too close together....it felt as if everyone around us were at our table. I'm not feeling that...not at a family reunion. I found the atmosphere fun and engaging, however the sitting was to intrusive for my likes. Once the meal did arrive, it was lukewarm, and bland. If invited to return, I would have to say that I wouldn't go back. I am originally from the Southeast and I can say without hesitation that this place did not prepare a great tasting southern meal upon my visit.
