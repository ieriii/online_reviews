Mmm Mmm Good. M'lady and I went there tonight for the special on Tuesdays through Fridays which is $20 for a 3 course meal. Pricing was based on if you ordered things without a start next to it which would cost anywhere from an extra $3-9 bucks. It's a cozy place with great service, great food, and decent portions. It's enough to get you full without making you want to give birth to a child afterwards which is a good thing for me since that would be really disturbing. I started off with the Soup de Jour which was a Ginger/Carrot soup. I know that it sounds like a weird combo but I threw all caution to the wind and tried it out. The soup was surprisingly good! I could taste a hint of both but neither one was overpowering. A+. Then came the next item which was the short ribs. Wow! The meat was so tender that it easily came apart with little assistance with a knife. VERY good. The last was the dessert dish. I had ordered the banana bread pudding. Mmm. It came out warm with two slices with some sweet creamy stuff in a lil tin cup on the side flanked with a couple of strawberry slices and a couple of blueberries. It was a great way to end the meal. This place would definitely be great for a first date. Did I mention that it was a BYOB place? No? Well there you go. Enjoy!
