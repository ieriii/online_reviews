My vegetarian hubby and I (non vegetarian) came here for lunch, and LOVED IT! I ordered the country fried steak w/ mashed potatoes and veggies, and he ordered the gyro. They were both so delicious! We also ordered the vegan chocolate chip cheesecake, and I have been raving about it. Seriously, one of the best cheesecakes I have ever eaten, I have been craving it since we dined about 5 days ago. We will be back!
