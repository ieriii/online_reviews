The pizza is just *amazing*. This is the closest thing I've had in Chicago to my favorite place back home in the SF bay area (lanesplitter). Wonderfully thin, crispy and powdery crust with toppings (just pepperoni for me)( just charred enough. Just enough sauce, just enough cheese. Too bad its like a sports bar without any real booths. During the summer you might be able to spot a TV with The Tour de France playing, but everything else is ESPN. Also very loud. Another one of those places where you wont be able to hear your date, so you'll just nod and say "yeah, totally" a lot. There is also Piece Out now, which delivers and does take out.
