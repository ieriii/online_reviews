You know how rare it is to find a restaurant that you can take parents to for a early breakfast on a Saturday, your boyfriend to for a boozy Sunday brunch, or alone with a paper on a random Tuesday afternoon? 3rd Coast is all this...It's relaxed, unpretentious, and tasty food. I know, I know it IS located in the Gold Coast, but when 99% percent of us leave our pretensions at the door...Perfect!
