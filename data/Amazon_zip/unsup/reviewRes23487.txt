This cafe is a little slice of heaven in Andersonville. A morning brunch with a beautiful delicate Algerian crepe and coffee (with just the right amount of sugar) will turn any frown upside down. The customer service is very North African -- call the waitress when you are ready -- interruptions are not appreciated when deciding, eating, or receiving the bill. Go to Wrigellyville if you want a waitress pushing you out the door with the fork still in your mouth. Tip: Please avoid the location off Fullerton.
