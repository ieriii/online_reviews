OMG So Yummy! This place is amazing and one of my new favorites. The atmostphere is hip & modern, with music loud enough to noticably hear but not so loud where you can't hear people next to you. Just to warn, the prices are steep so expect to lay out some cash. Their wine selection, amazing, and the tasting menu is a MUST!!!! I highly recommend not ordering straight from the menu but do the tasting. Your missing out major if you don't! This restaurant is a definite for foodies. If your expecting supersized portions, this isn't for you, however you won't leave hungry. And might I say, the truffle popcorn is wonderful!
