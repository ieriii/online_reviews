I loved this place! The restaurant was fairly crowded at 11am on at Saturday but the line moved pretty quickly. Yolk seems small on the outside but once you walk in, you notice that the restaurant expands quite a bit toward the back. With IKEA like decor of red and blue, yolk is a pretty trendy place inside.  As for the service..well at least you get to put your order in and finally get your dishes, but don't expect to have more than that, they are way too busy for small talk. Our server asked us in passing how our food was, but he was already heading toward the kitchen before he finished his sentence. The food is wonderful here! With five of us girls, we all pretty much passed around our dishes. I order the banana nut french toast - it came with a side of peanut butter which totally made the dish!! Another one of my favorites was the Santa Fe fajita omelette. It was amazing, it was filled with chicken, egg, other fajita deliciousness and topped with a ton of salsa, sour cream and guac. I keep taking bites of this from my friend Annie across the table.  My friend Yvonne got the peach cobbler crepes - they were good, I don't know if they were my thing though. My roommate Erica got a skillet which was pretty good. The food around us at the other tables looked amazing too and I am eager to go back to try out more dishes! And get that Santa Fe omelette thing again!
