I am a huge fan of the meat-stravaganza. We went for an early dinner on Saturday (4pm), and it was outstanding. The salad bar was fresh and stocked, drinks were flowing and the meat was fantastic.  The rolls and all the sides (and almost everything on the salad bar) is gluten-free, so my husband could partake in all of it. Only meat he couldn't have was the chicken, which is marinated in beer - and who is going to waste stomach room on chicken anyway?  I tried every meat, but the leg of lamb and top sirloin won top prize. The only meats that I wasn't a huge fan of were the house special sirloin and ribeye. They weren't very flavorful and a little tough. I love that you are able to request the temperature of your meat - the rarer the better for me.  Still wondering how many delicious animals I consumed...mmm, animals...
