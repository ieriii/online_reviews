Where do I start? First of all thinking if you go to china town for chinese food it should be good. Wrong. It was the worst chinese food i've ever had. The whole experience was horrible. We arrived for lunch around 2pm we were seated right away and then totally forgotten about . We watched people who had arrived after us being served.Finally I waved the waitress to come over and take our order. We decided to do a few apetizers first. All four were horrible ( overcooked,greasy, no flavor) we then decided to pass on the main course.
