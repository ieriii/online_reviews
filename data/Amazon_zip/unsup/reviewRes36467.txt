Hands down my favorite brunch/breakfast spot in Chicago. Everything on the menu is super yummy with the freshest ingredients bar none. Whether with the girls, my dad, solo, each and everytime has been the best part of my day. The staff is super nice and attentive. Try and get the female waitress with the cool red watch; she'll take good care of you. The egg white omelets are buttery light pillows of exqusite flavor, oh, and kinda healthy :-) portions are large, perfect for sharing.
