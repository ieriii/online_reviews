Came here during lunch and I was in luck-- the wait was only about half an hour long!  There are a ton of specialty hot dogs to choose from. In fact, it was a bit overwhelming. So, once I got to the counter, I just asked the worker to suggest 2 hot dogs to order based on the things I wanted (1 spicy and 1 chicken). Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of the hot dogs I tried but they were so freaking good.   Note, I really wanted to try the duck fat fries but they are only offered on Friday and Saturday :( I did try the cheese fries and they were still very yummy. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm definitely coming here again! These hot dogs are to die for!
