Technically there was nothing flawed about our experience - there was just nothing exceptional about it either. The service was excellent. But the rigidness of our meals coupled with the unoriginal banality of our food left me contemplating the let down in value moreso than anything. I found the atmosphere to be stiff and pretentious rather than elegant and inspired. The requirement for us to elect the same tasting menu made our dining monotonous. I recollect most courses being predictable and 2 dimensional. For instance, my peeky-toe crab salad tasted of black pepper, watery shell fish, and mayonnaise. My most delectable food - a caviar flight and a bottle of Flowers - was prepackaged and required supplements. In my opinion Tru caters well to traditional-styled executives with parochial tastes. For the same cost, I would much rather opt for 2 meals at most other Chicago 1-star Michelin restaurants or a meal at a more highly rated venue.
