After reading the reviews on Yelp, I was almost scared to make reservations too far in advance, so I started calling 2 weeks prior. Got a reservation without a problem, showed up, ate, and the food was awesome! No one called me to cancel, and the evening was great. I do have to say, though, that the whole cancelling last minute thing is very disturbing. You would think that a place this pricey would keep their customers happier... the anxiety alone from reading those sort of reviews is enough to make me say I probably won't go back. It's good to have tried it though!
