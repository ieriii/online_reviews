Even though the place is so close to the El that it's actually unpleasant to have a table by the open windows on a summer day, the Puttanesca pizza is the best pizza I've ever had. I just looked on the site's menu to see what the accurate name of the thing was, but it's not even listed. A new item, perhaps? At least I really hope it's not just a temporary special. It was a classic Italian sauce at its best - capers, olives, chunks of garlic, fresh oregano, red onions, and anchovies - if I was a cook on the Food Network, this would be my pick for The Best Thing I Ever Ate, Bar Food. or Best Thing I Ever Ate, Baked. Or Best Thing I Ever Ate, With Cheese, etc. etc. Really - WOW.
