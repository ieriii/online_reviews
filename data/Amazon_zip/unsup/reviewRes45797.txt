Reasonable food. No wait, and was close to our hotel. The food was perfectly prepared, tasty, but nothing really unique here. Had the spring rolls as an appetizer, very tasty, and the sauces were nice. My vegetarian pasta was al dente, just like I like it, and the sauce and veggies tasty. Was enough for two people. The farm raised trout was pretty good. However- the chocolate cake was amazing! I could only eat a few bites because it was so rich. Would recommend one piece for the entire table. If you love rich chocolaty goodness, this is for you.
