Food: I think the dimsum/appetizer menu has more interesting stuff than the main dishes. None of it is bad, everything is absolutely fresh, so props for that. I wouldn't come back here basically because I don't find the food to be very thoughtful for the money. I've had the cod and the seabass there - both are good, but literally the just cook the fish put it in an eggplant, and do absolutely nothing for presentation. You spend $25-$30 on that and have to ask yourself why you just did that. It's a $15 dish effort at best. I think people come here for the ambiance - which is indeed nice. However, I'm a rail thin guy But be careful - I would and the stools at the communal table were too small for even me. Also don't come here for serious business like I did. My colleague (and good friend) noted how this is a place where beautiful people go, which was a signed that he was greatly unnerved by the number of scantily clad low self esteem women who seemed to sashay back and forth through the place. But I do understand that this is EXACTLY why some people come here for that so I guess I need to be mindful of the target segment, which isn't me.
