My friend said the thing I have to do while in Chicago is try a deep-dish pizza. Too bad my boyfriend hate deep dish, because he thinks it's just mostly bread. We managed to find this place after a fail attempt looking for hamburgers. My boyfriend said that this place was broadcast on one show on the Food Network, so I was wondering what the hype was. We ordered a side of mozzarella sticks and a small thin crust pizza with a crapload of toppings, which kind of added up to a hefty bill. ($1.50 for extra toppings on a small pizza? Them toppings better be fresh..!) In my mind, I had tried a thin crust pizza from Pizza Hut, and I thought it was like crackers with tomato sauce. This place blew that stereotype AWAY! The crust was flaky, but not too thin that you had to put napkins on your lap to prevent sauce from dripping. Would highly recommend this place for a late night grubbin'!
