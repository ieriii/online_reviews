If I were still a professional kidney stealer, this is where I'd woo victims before I did the deed. Because Davanti Enoteca will romance you in the most unsuspecting ways, from one waiter in particular who likely moonlights as a Super Mario Bros in 8-bit, to the wine by the glass menu (which is literally attached to an oversized bottle of wine), to the cauldron of diners (a stew of Sopranos cast-offs, students and power gays). Get past the overly kitschy and misleading sign outside. Once you do, you enter a sleek yet rustic den full of personality. The back wall is a wine repository, hence the self-descriptive name: Davanti (in front of), Enoteca (wine shop). You buy bottles at their cheap retail price and pay a nominal corkage. Super Mario was right on with his recommendations. The truffle egg toast and the foraged mushroom-leek pizza may just make you wet your pants. The shaved hearts of palm, burrata and swordfish break the mold. For dessert, the torta bacio appears unassuming, but that crunchy bottom will get you. The cost is uber-reasonable and we exited to a barrage of warm send-offs. Yeah, pretty much everything about this place will make you smile. Just make sure you don't wake up in a tub, missing a critical organ
