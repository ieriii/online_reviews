A most excellent place. Delicious food (Rick Bayless you are the man), easy atmosphere, courteous staff, and decent prices. Came here with a good friend to celebrate her recent acceptance into graduate school. My my, what a pleasant experience. I had the duck special caldos and it hit the spot. Also got some churros afterwards. Delicious once again. Highly recommend! (Go on a weekday to avoid lines).
