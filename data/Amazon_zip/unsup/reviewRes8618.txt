We had dinner here last night and I want to go back. Right now. We must have gotten there at just the right time because there was no wait, but it filled up quickly. We had the Insalada di Mare for an appetizer, and it was amazing. The calamari was so tender and tasted incredibly fresh. The olive oil they drizzled on the bread was some of the most flavorful I've ever tasted. We were so sad when it was all gone. We had two pizzas, the Salsiccia and a special which had two kinds of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella. Both were awesome. The crust was crispy and chewy and perfect, and the flavor of the toppings was so spot on. I can't say enough great things about those pizzas. And the service was great, even after the whole restaurant was full. When we left there was a line practically out the door, so get there early. I seriously can't wait to go back. Yay!
