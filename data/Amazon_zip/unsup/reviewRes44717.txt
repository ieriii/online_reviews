I am from California and I love pizza - i mean real pizza not CPK (although it is also good). I had recently eaten at Zachary's Chicago pizza in Berkeley before coming to Chicago, so I had to take the Pepsi challenge and see if Chicago-style deep dish pizza is better in Chicago. After reading the reviews of Giordano's, Gino's, and Uno's (all 3 were recommended), this seemed to be the only place that nobody hated. All the others were either loved or hated with no in between.  Upon arrival, we were seated quickly and was impressed.  Chicago definitely deserves an award for having pizza this good. This place gets everything right. I had the special (which has the exact same toppings as Zachary's special), but this one beat Zachary's on every level. The crust was crustier, the cheese cheesier, and the toppings were great.  The pizza stays together well and the cheese and toppings don't come sliding off the crust. This is the first deep dish that i was able to pick up and eat by hand like a normal pizza. This is the best pizza I've eaten.
