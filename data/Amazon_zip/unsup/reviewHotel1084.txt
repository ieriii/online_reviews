Great stay!! Me and my girls went to Chicago for the weekend, had a great stay at the Fairmont, it was affordable (on Orbitz), super friendly staff and the views were awesome. The prices were ridiculous though. 2 mimosas (not hard alcohol) were $35. Not gonna do that again!! But everything was great :)
