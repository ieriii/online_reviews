We had our wedding reception here. And our guests are still talking about how amazing the food was. In fact, that was our number one compliment!! We were on a tight budget and Wildfire not only delivered within our budget (to use a caterer at another location and to get this same service and food would have cost 3 to 4 times as much!), but their food was TEN TIMES better than any wedding food I've ever had. It tastes just as good for 100 people as it does when just my husband and I go in for dinner. They do NOT compromise on taste or quality, just because it is for a large party.  Jeffery and Laura who take care all the large party details at Wildfire are great as well! They are flexible, patient and work with you and your budget 100%. Seriousy, for anyone looking for a nonconventional wedding reception that is surprisingly affordable (and the best food your guests will ever have at a wedding), look no further than Wildfire. We couldn't have been happier! (on a side note, there is no "per person" liquor price, so it is based on consumption, which can be negative. But we kept it under control by serving apple martinis and a spiked cider at cocktail hour--our "specialty" fall themed drinks--and beer and wine with dinner and throughout the rest of the evening)
