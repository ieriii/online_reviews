My cousin Mistey had me on a French Macarons craze. Literally. So, one evening, after picking me up Tony told me he was going to take me to Fritz pastry but by the time we got there they were closing. He turned and said don't worry, there's another place called Alliance Bakery that sold French macarons as well. So Tony, tamia and I headed there instead. Open for business, Alliance had only one worker that evening. Walking in, you can tell it's a cozy little bakery. I was amazed of all the beautiful cakes on display filled with intricate designs. Anyway, the server asked us if we had any idea what to order, since there was another patron in the store we told him to serve her first. When she left we were still clueless on what to order. Tamia decided on a simple chocolate cupcake, which she had devoured in the car. She loved that it was moist and not overwhelmingly chocolaty. I order two almond croissants for my sister and she said it was AMAZING! Tony ordered practically all their macarons (pistachio, chocolate, lemon, rose with rose cream, vanilla, rose with chocolate). The pistachio macarons were awesome. Light, crisp and moist, none of the flavors overpower the other. The rose was refreshing, very airy and definitely taste like rose. The lemon was my favorite; it reminded me of biting into a lemon meringue pie. The chocolate and vanilla tasted stale and old. That was a huge bummer. Overall, Alliance is a nice hidden place and has a great amount of sweets on display. I know that their macarons flavors are seasonal so you just have to wing it for that particular day and hope it's as great as it looks. I need to come back for their almond croissants and hopefully I can pick up some more macarons. We are kind of staying away from it since Tony went a bit overboard in ordering all of it. 6.5/10
