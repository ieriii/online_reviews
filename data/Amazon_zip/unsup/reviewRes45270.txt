My favorite restaurant in Chicago, without question. Cozy, unpretentious atmosphere with great service and great food. You get the same quality of ingredients and preparation as, say, Blackbird, but in a much warmer environment. The menu changes frequently, but if they have the Trotter appetizer, pasta w/ chicken liver, or the venison w/ sweet potato puree, please order them.
