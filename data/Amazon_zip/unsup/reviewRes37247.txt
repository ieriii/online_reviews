This is one of those places that gets hyped up hard...and for good reason. But a problem comes with that - its always too damn busy. I dont want to wait an hour plus to get dinner. The solution? creep in the front bar area for a little bit and snipe a table as soon as a group leaves. No guarantee that you wont wait long...but I have been lucky. In reality though the real real solution is so just to go a different bar that has just as good food and beer but with little to no wait...like Smallbar. On top of the long wait they have some weird rules... your entire party has to be there before they put you on the list. Im sorry but thats bullshit. Another issue is the upstairs bar is cash only. So food and beer... its definitely great! They have a huge variety of belgians on tap (mmm tremens). For the food I havent tried much because I always get the belgian style mussels. They are too damn good not to. They come with these perfect fried and salted frites (fries) and dipping sauce that is pretty much liquid crack.
