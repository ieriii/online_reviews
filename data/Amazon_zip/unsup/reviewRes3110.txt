The crispy chicken was little too sweet for me. The bulgogi was just fine. The portions were big but there meat was not tender like you would have in other Korean dishes. Maybe the girl who was incessantly cough on my table made me give a three star! Overall the experience was okay, they food was nice. The choices limited.
