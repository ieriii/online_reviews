Dear Hopleaf, Your beer variety is tantalizing and delicious, your food makes me swoon, when I cart myself out, I find myself cooing much like a loon. ------ Let us begin with the food. Oh my lordie lordie oh! Tasty. So listen, I know, as a vegetarian, it may seem daunting to come into what is basically a beer house on the outskirts of a very Swedish neighborhood and not feel like sausage will be thrown upon you. This is simply--a common case of the misunderstandings. They have...DELICIOUS...vegetarian friendly dishes. Don't you worry, their grilled fig/cashew butter/and Gruyere cheese sandwich is so rich, and seemingly swimming in butter (this is true of most everything there, I bet they THROW that shit on). If that isn't enough, try the polenta pate or what about the veggie loaf ? Maybe just some of the frites with that damn delicious garlic mayo? EAT IT. Carnivores/Omnivores/Etc, eat up. The pork chops will floor you. And then there was the beer list. Uh, Mead anyone? St. Berndardus? I mean, really, phenomenal. As an avid beer-luster, I still am not through the list. But that's because I get hung up on my favourites and refuse to budge. But I truly believe there is a beer here for everyone, lights/darks/ triples/just DRINK UP. That said, I know this place is busy. And when I sat down to write this place up I thought to myself, "gosh OH gol-LY does it get hella busy in there at night!" and you know, makes me slightly uncomfortable. But really, the fact remains I know when it is going to start picking up there, and therefore know how to deal with that---so no star demoting shall be had! If you're there to eat, just go strait to the back hall and they'll get you a space, although the front space seems discouragingly busy. Basically, for your reference (although this is only based on my own observations)...place picks up between the most between 6p and 8p. Get in 'round then and you can claim yo'self some cozy personal space, well, like a few inches. *smirk*
