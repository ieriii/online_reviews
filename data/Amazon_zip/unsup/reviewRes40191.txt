The condiments are awesome. Seafood pancake for an appetizer was a good choice, marinated beef short ribs were good, soft tofu seafood soup was nice and spicy, and pork belly was good but really smoky on the grill. Be prepared to take off your shoes if you sit in a big booth in the center. Good service, waitstaff had us laughing.
