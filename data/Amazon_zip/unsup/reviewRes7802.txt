I found this place when I was planning a bachelorette party. It had good reviews, so I called to see what we could do. They not only were able to take my large reservation for a Saturday night at 7pm less than two weeks in advance, but Ricardo (the manager) was so unbelievably friendly and helpful that it really put a smile on my face. He offered a price fix deal in whichever way we chose - family style or each of us ordering our own entrees from a list that he and I would put together. The menu we agreed on sounded wonderful, and I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived and he had put even more options on the menu for us. The food was fantastic, the service was good, and they gave us our own little private room and printed special menus for us that had a message for our bachelorette. We decided to do BYOB and they even put some of our white wine in their fridge for us. Only negative was that dinner took too long, and we had somewhere else to be. But I didn't mention that when we made the reservation, and we were a little late in getting there, so it's not really their fault. I would definitely go back. Everyone loved their food, no one left hungry, and the waiter had some fun with us. If I could give it more stars, I truly would!
