Rehearsal dinner was just as I had imagined it would be....amazing! The service was spot on! The staff was very accommodating and hospitable. Everywhere you turn, "Would you like another mojito/sangria?" with a fresh one already on the tray. The food was, well, how many stars to do you see up there? Garlic Shrimp, Pork and Beef with a ridiculous sauce! Next time we have an event here....Ceviche Bar! No doubt.
