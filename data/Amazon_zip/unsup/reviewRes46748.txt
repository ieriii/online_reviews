RJ Grunts does everything it needs to do to succeed:. Tourists are catered to nicely here. Cheese and bacon are slathered on nearly almost all options, so those without discriminating cholesterol results are happy. With that being said, it's just not my type of place. Most times I have visitors come to Chicago they always have a restaurant recommended by someone's first cousin's brother's friend who wants to say where we should go eat - as though I am not informed enough to make a decision. You can see how I ended up at RJ Grunts. I found it difficult to find some sort of healthy selection (I'm a germaphobe so you won't catch me within sneezing distance of a salad bar). Whether or not my fish tacos were "healthy" is to be determined, but they didn't make me feel all that guilty fortunately. I guess at this point I'm just talking to talk since it doesn't matter what I think - RJ Grunts was busy on a Sunday night; clearly they have no problem getting people in their revolving door.
