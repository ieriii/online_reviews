Mmmm, so good! The food and the atmosphere....not to mention, Mr. Rick Bayless himself was sitting right next to us. I now understand why this place is so many people's favorite! We didn't have a reservation, but the hour plus wait flew by because we were able to get a spot at the bar and enjoy some margaritas and guacamole. Que deliciosa! I kept it pretty simple with my chicken fajitas, but I tried my friends dish and it was unbelievable. I can't wait to be more adventurous the next time I go.
