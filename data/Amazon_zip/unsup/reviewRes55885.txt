Probably some of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had - haven't dined in, just had pizza and salad delivered, but I'm definitely a fan. My favorite is the vegetarian thin crust; my husband likes the Calo special pizza. Greek salad is also quite good. Delicious and they deliver fairly late in the evening. You can't go wrong.
