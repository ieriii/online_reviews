New Downtown Churrascaria. This place kicks Fogo de Chao ass! Now I llke Fogo and Brazazz. Both have had their moments in the meat parade of my life. However, I took a friend to TDB for her birthday this weekend and we were both blown away. The service was impeccable. Our main waiter came over and explained how things were done. That the meat had sea salt on it and typically came medium rare to medium well done. Then he proceeded to tell us that of we wanted it with less salt or rare or well done to please let him or the server know and they would make it happen. He polite asked us to understand that well done would take a few extra minutes to be served. Kick ass! To be clear, nothing needed to be sent back or prepared differently, but it's noce to know they would have. The salad bar at TBD blew Fogo's away. Though I may have to visit again just to make sure. The sushi window and lobster bisque took them another step ahead of the others. And I appreciate the grey garbed host/hostess types walking around ensuring that everyone had what they needed and wanted. It didn't hurt that I had a 50% off coupon good for up to 6 people at one table. Guess what I'm using again next week with a larger group of friends. If I had to rate the Churrascaria's I've been to downtown, so far: Texas de Brazil would be the ultimate - Fogo de Chao would be the fall back and Brazazz would be it for lunch. There is only so much you can eat in 3 hours and you just can't beat $19.95
