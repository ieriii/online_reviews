Chicago Diner's food can make a meat-lover want to be vegetarian. My avacadonaise veggie burger with sweet potato fries were absolutely to die for. I will never forget the first time I bit into that tasty burger. The waitstaff are alternative and outgoing and seem to genuinely care about your experience in the restaurant. My one complaint was that I came here when it was quite crowded, but said I would wait for a booth. So I went behind the back, where there is a waiting room, and they forgot about me. Not to mention it was really cold. However, they did make it up with the attentiveness, quality of food, and a free dessert therefore I still give them a 5 star review.
