Guys. This place is so. good. I can honestly say that this is the only restaurant that I've introduced more than 5 people too and they all loved it. The dishes are fantastic, it has more dine-in room and decor than most thai places, and the service is great in my experience. As far as the food goes, I like my Thai spicy, but not enough to drown out flavor, and Opart has an entire section of the menu dedicated to delicious spicy rice dishes. "Medium spicy" is usually enough for me at Opart. If you wanna challenge the heat, try the Pad Kra Praow or Pad Prik King, and ask for Spicy or Extra Spicy. (You'll likely need a napkin to dab your forehead if you go with Extra Spicy.) Oh, and most times I've been here I've gotten my food within 5-10 minutes of ordering. How's that for service? Good on ya, Opart. More Chicago restaurants should be like you.
