I've been robbed! Robbed I tell you! Stolen, gone forever is my victory, my spoils of war...my dignity. I was 3rd place going into the final round of trivia and had the right answer to boot. But alas, trivia night is no place for those who fear not being right. And so, foolishly, I didn't bet high enough. And moved out of the top three into the black hole of loser-dom. I will be back to redeem myself and next time--no guts, no glory and I'm taking no prisoners. Watch your back at Trivia Night because you never know when Bass' Fan Club will rock the house and this time...this time..take home the victory.
