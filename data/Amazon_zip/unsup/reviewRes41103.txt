So I don't think Tank needs another review, but since I just went for the first time this weekend I'm going to write one regardless. Deal with it. So a group of about 20 Yelpers descended on Tank Friday night... they did a great job of dealing with us so a big kudos to them for that. While they didn't have one table for all of us we were at two giant tables that were next to each other. Luckily, I ended up at the cool person table (I was shocked too)! Having heard of the wonders of Pho but never having tried it I decided that Friday night was my night. Being the non-adventurous eater that I am though I asked for my Pho without the soft tendon (yeah, if I have no clue what it is I'm not going to be eating it) and the tripe. I've tried tripe, I am not a fan. While there was no way I was going to put it in my soup, they also have penis Pho. Much to the chagrin of our group, they were out of penis. I guess penis is popular on a Friday night. Anyway, when my Pho arrived it smelled wonderful. There was all sorts of meat and noodles and then I added the trimmings that they give you. I'm addicted to basil so that featured prominently in my Pho. I liked how I was able to personalize my meal, not to mention that Pho is really freakin tasty. I would be more apt to come here in the winter because that's when I become obsessed with soup, but I was impressed by my first time Pho.
