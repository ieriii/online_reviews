Green Coaster = Bring it On!!! Red Coaster = Ask me First, then Bring it On!! One Important Piece of Advice: Pace Yourself! The meat is endless so there's no rush. We had reservations on a Saturday night (9pm), but still had to wait awhile before we were seated. The lobby was packed with hungry people all waiting in anticipation of endless cycles of meats. I had a Caiprinhas at the bar while waiting. Wow, that was good! I definitely understand why it was busy. The food was AMAZING! Go Meat!!! It's a bit pricey there, but you pay for top notch quality. Our drinks. sides, and heavenly cheese bread baskets were never empty. I've been craving that cheese bread ever since I left that place, and that was a week ago! The salad bar was pretty impressive as well. Going GREEN: I tried all the different types of meat that were offered. DELICIOUS!!! Fillet Mignon wrapped in Bacon = Unbelievable! 1st place/Top Honors Sirloins = Sinful, Never Turned it Down when offered Chicken = Finger Lickin Good!! Very Impressed! Lamb = 1st time I had lamb....Pretty Good!! Definitely Not baaaaddd! :D A couple of the pieces of meat that I received was a little overcooked for my liking. (still didn't stop me from trying it) However, they were still packed with flavor. RED, but turning GREEN (in a good way): I periodically turned my coaster over to Red, but fortunately there was always someone at our table that had their coaster set to Green. Even though I was set to Red, I was still politely asked I would care for more meat; Heck why not? ...Bring it On!!!!  I wish they had a place out here in Michigan like Fogo de Chao. We probably have a similar place here, but I'll tell ya, Fogo de Chao sets the bar, and my expectations are now really high.
