Great food, friendly service. So much better than that corporate place Bennigens just a block south. Highly recommended. Within moments of entering we were greeted and seated. Our waitress was friendly and fast. She even poured my beer! Twice! Woohoo! The food is a little pricey but it's worth every penny.
