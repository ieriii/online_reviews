I used to love this place years ago. But the quality and the service has taken a huge hit the last few years. The last time I went in I think will be my last, the server did not even pay attention to us, the manager(?) was super rude, and the food was meh. I used to love the pizza's here, but the cheese pizza I got was dry and the dough was way too thick. When I told the manager I did not like it, he simply huffed and said this is the way we do things here, if you don't like it go elsewhere for pizza. RUDE!
