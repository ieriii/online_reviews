Tank is delicious and also hilarious. There is definitely a "tank" theme complete with the waitstaff wearing camo shirts and also a fish tank in the back to go along with the tank pictures on the menu. Speaking of the menu, it is huge and so are the portions. The soups are delicious and the perfect way to warm up on a chilly day or when you are feeling under the weather. I have also tried the banh mi sandwiches which were tasty but not the best I have ever had. One added bonus: I don't think I have ever had such attentive water re-filling. It was constant! Overall, very yummy!
