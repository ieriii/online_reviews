I got a wheelchair accessible room by accident.  There is no tub in these rooms, just an open floor shower.  The door to the bathroom slides open (modern, but uncomfortable if sharing a room with people because you can see inside with the open cracks).  Despite this, I give this place 4 stars because the staff is extra friendly and accommodating.
