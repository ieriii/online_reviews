Glorious. This is what a cute cafe should be. I went for breakfast and shared an order of the orange brioche french toast and the huevos rancheros with my sister, and it was delicious, made from quality ingredients. The coffee is served in big mugs, and the staff was friendly. I was expecting table service, but you order at the counter and your food is brought to you. I'm okay with it - the food and atmosphere made up for it.
