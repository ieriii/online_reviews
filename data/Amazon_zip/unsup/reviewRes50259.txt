i friggin' dig it... it's a great spot to watch sports, the food stands out and is always fresh, and the drinks don't break the bank... beyond that the staff is nice as hell... i also like the fact that they've got a solid selection of "off the beated path" liquors... also their bottle service isn't just for puffy and jigga... it actually works out so it's cheaper to buy a bottle than to grab the same amount of drinks at the bar... and they sell half bottles for half the price of a regular sized one, which is kinda wild to me as i've never seen it before, but i think it's a quality concept... it makes your wait time at the bar itself uber minimal... it is actually solid enough of a joint that i decided to throw a party there tonight... if you're lookin' for a time to check it out, this would be a solid opportunity as i'm gonna have that joint poppin'... ;) http://www.going.com/zee bang. bang.
