Pumpkin-zucchini pancakes. Dear God, these were awesome. Great pre-birthday brunch with a friend. I've heard the tales, read the reviews, drooled over the description. And yet, I'd never been to the Bongo Room. Why? The wait. I've also heard the tales of the wait, snaking around Wicker Park. I LOVE brunch, but I don't love waiting.  It takes me two buses to get there. The thought of waiting for an hour after spending around an hour on public transit negates my love of pancakes. The solution: weekday brunch. Veteran's day brunch, thanks to State employment and lesser holidays.  The bigger question: was it worth the wait? Yes. The pancakes really did live up expectation. How many times can you say that something lives up to expectation? Rarely. The Bongo Room does that. I'm not going 5-star review because of the prohibitive weekend wait. I don't have another lesser State holiday until Columbus Day and I want more pancakes.  I hate waiting so maybe I'll brave the queue. October is a long way off.
