Whenever I have had a rough night and am going to be getting to work late, I always tell my boss that I will pick up Sultan's and suddenly - all is forgiven. The Chicken Schwarma sandwich makes me blissfully happy. The spinach pies (while not as good as the middle eastern bakery on Foster) are pretty amazingly delicious and location is everything (meaning these are close and those are far away).  I can never remember if they are cash only or not, which is sometimes stressful but totally worth it.
