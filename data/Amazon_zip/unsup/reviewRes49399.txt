I wanted to like them more. Really, really wanted to like them as I am not used to dropping close to $200 on a birthday cake for 20 people. I asked for a cake with a man in a boat and emailed them a picture of the boat, mentioned in the phone conversation that the boat was white and green. Did not send them a picture of my husband (actually didn't think of it), so the appearance of the boat was really the only tie to it being my husband driving the boat. And they got the colors wrong. So it looked nothing like the boat I sent a picture of. They did try and rectify it, but at that point they could only add another stripe of the color everything was supposed to be. No one got the joke. The cake was huge, but pretty much everyone took one bite and left the rest to be thrown out. The remainder is in my freezer and even my kids are not asking for it. sigh. I really wanted to like this place. I really wanted to feel justified in buying a cake 10x the price of one at Dominick's . But no dice. The macaroons are tasty, but not worth the trip from the 'burbs.
