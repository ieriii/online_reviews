Sooooooo touristy. I really can't get past that whenever I go to Grand Lux. For whatever reason my friends really enjoy this place so I go often and I never really enjoy it. The service is always subpar...my waitress was incredibly rude to me when I last went and conveniently disappeared when someone in my party accidentally spilled water on the table. We had to hail down another waiter to help us. The food is okay, definitely not fantastic. I do enjoy the music selection though.
