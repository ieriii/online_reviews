The BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had, without a doubt. I know Giordano's gets labled as a tourist-y restraunt, but I am a Chicago native and no deep dish pizza will ever beat Giordano's for me (except maybe my mom's homemade deep dish). Nothing compares to walking blocks on a cold winter night and swooping in the revolving door with a blast of warm air and the delicious aroma of pizza. If you hate long waits, call in and order ahead of time or preorder and head to the bar. It takes nearly a half-hour to make your pizza if you're ordering a deep dish, never mind the long wait for a table. But it will all be worth it the minute you take that first cheesy bite. Every time I have visitors to the city, I always take them to Giordano's to have their lives changed, and they always leave happy.
