very nice place. only my second tapas place, the food was much better than iberico. the complimentary bread with sea salt was amazing along with the complimentary chocolate for desert. the white sangria was extremely good. a little pricey but it was a great experience. the atmosphere is great and the service was quick. we went on a friday night around 9:30, had no reservations and was seated within 15 minutes.
