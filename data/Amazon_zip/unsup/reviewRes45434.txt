I live right near here, and it upsets me that every time I try to come here, it's packed to the brim with people so I have to find another alternative to eat/drink on a Friday night. On the few times I have come here, i can tell you that I love it which is why I'm always dying to go back. The food is great (i love the shepherd's pie). I've gone here for brunch twice and each time got a different version of french toast. AMAZING. Whoever thought of putting chocolate covered bacon bits in vanilla ice cream to serve over fried french toast is a genius. And to top it off with their champagne/mango fruit drink thing was just aces for me. Yum. They can be pricey, but it's Lakeview, and that's what you get. I think the food is worth it, but not so much the drinks, unless there's a special going on. The staff is always nice and friendly, and I haven't really had a complaint. The decor is dark and woody, without being too stuffy. it makes me feel like I'm relaxing in an old library ready to discuss Keats over some Brandy. In reality, I'm really having a Blue Moon and talking about the newest movies out in the theaters, and that's ok with me. It can get loud here, and by loud, I mean annoying loud. The last time I went here was unfortunately planned during the last day of the Olympics, so by 2pm all the TVs were blaring the US/Canada hockey game which left little room for conversation. Or thinking. This is by far one of my favorite places to go to when I have the time and money, and when it's not too busy. It's worth it in my book.
