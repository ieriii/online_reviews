My favorite sushi restaurant EVER! My girlfriends and I come here often and always have a blast! The food is amazing and service is great! Love that we can bring our own wine... We always get a variety of appetizers to split between us and have SO much fun! Must-haves: angry salmon, sesame crusted scallops, tropical ceviche, hamachi carpacio!!!! We usually car pool and then do valet, which is great for the price and convenience. I'm pregant now and am craving sushi from COAST every day!
