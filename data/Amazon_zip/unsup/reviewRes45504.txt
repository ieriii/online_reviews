After this week's visit, I have to strike another star from Wilde. It's the service yet again. Here's what may happen to you on your next visit: * While you wait for your table, you may catch the host walking the perimeter of the bar, asking people, "Were you waiting for a table? Were you waiting for a table?" You will reasonably take this as a sign he has lost control of his responsibilities. And then you may observe another party of identical size being seated before you, even though they arrived 10 minutes after you. * Literally seconds after you're seated, your server may open with, "Do you need a few more minutes with the menus?" Feel free to request at least ONE minute... it worked for us. * If one of your party asks for a water, the server will not ask if the rest of the table also wants water, nor will he bring water to all as a courtesy. You must ask for your own water! This is very important! * Your girlfriend's wine glass may sit empty on the table for some time. Oddly enough, the glass that accompanied your most recent bottle of beer will be bussed before you have a chance to use it. * That chicken sandwich you ordered grilled may arrive fried. It's a bummer, because the food, decor and crowd are all above-average. But until management trains the staff, I can't make this a regular spot.
