The deal is the same with all three fondue places in the city. I hate to even compare and contrast but if we only had three sushi restaurants we'd be doing the same. Gejas is definitely the top on the line as far as atmosphere - candle lit, flamenco guitar player, the suggestion for couples to sit side-by-side, low ceiling. The food is all the same but I found that here you get less choices.... At Melting Pot I remember being offered broth instead of oil and a few different chocolate choices for dessert. There is nothing spectacular about the meat or veggies. Gejas wins on atmosphere and great service. it's a Chicago experience that everyone must do!
