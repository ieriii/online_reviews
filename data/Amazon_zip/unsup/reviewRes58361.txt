This is the first ever review that I've written and I tend to be pretty forgiving of mistakes, but I've felt really badly about not communicating my experience to someone. We walked in Tuesday night 8/24 around 9-930 and requested a two-top by the door, which we were very rudely ignored and taken to the back room instead. We were greeted by a friendly enough server who took our drink order, then promptly came back to the table to let us know the bar was backed up and we wouldn't be getting our drinks anytime soon. 20-25minutes for our first round of drinks. Just staring at the wall waiting. We tried to order a few appetizers to test the water and see if we would want more but were told by the server that the chef doesn't like it when we take incomplete orders, so go ahead and take some more time to figure out the rest. We had already taken plenty of time, remember the cocktail situation? We ended up ordering 2 appetizers and 1 entree to share, and after such an unpleasant visit so far, the food was really sub-par and again took way too long. 1.5 hours for 1 cocktail, 2 apps and 1 entree, $85, an inattentive server and sub par food. I was picking undercooked risotto out of my teeth an hour later. I hope that someone there cares enough to contact me and rectify the situation. I'm not holding my breath.
