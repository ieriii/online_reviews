Our group of Chicagoans and relatives from out-of-town went to Frontera last night. There was a situation that developed but Rick Bayless and his team handled it with grace and utmost concern for us, the customers. We ended up having a fabulous time with excellent, innovative, tasty food and drinks. The service and atmosphere was great, as always. Yes, there will likely be a wait, but it is well worth it. Can't say enough good things about Frontera Grill.
