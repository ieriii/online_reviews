I had wanted to try this pizza spot since the mid-90's when I first became aware of it. So I finally did on a Friday night, and boy was I disappointed. Surprisingly disappointed. Two of us ordered and shared the Pequod's salad and a medium deep dish sausage/mushroom pizza. The salad was OK. The pizza was just a big sloppy mess, in my opinion on a way-too-thick crust. Gobs of flavorless tomato sauce as if I were eating lasagna on top of baked bread. Just did not do the trick for me and I wished I had taken my visitor from out or town someplace else, like Lou M's or Bacino's. I felt as if I were in some college joint, maybe in Wisconsin, eating a bad version of Chicago deep dish pizza. On the positive side, the service was good. And the price was right. But it's just not this boy's cup o' tea when it comes to 'za. It's a rare occasion that I eat deep dish pizza, so when I do, it won't be here.
