Urged by my wife, she and I visited this new place near our home on 3/27/10 and were grossly disappointed as Bayless' newest attempt to sell Mexican street food and sandwiches at high cost to the American masses is a flop. We got there and were faced with a 30-min. wait to get in this walk-up sandwich shop before even ordering. The crowding, the prices and the racket were stifling. so I waited outside in disgust much of that time. Then, all the ordering gab (all for a lousy sandwich) was far too lengthy, noisy and more time-consuming than anyone but a "trendy" deserves. I remarked to the multi-tasking, order-counter woman that she deserved combat pay and ear protectors to work here. There were no sound-absorptive materials anywhere in this skinny space and the din was huge. We ordered and split a short-ribs sandwich and had to perch on little stools at a narrow counter facing a wall for ages until it was delivered after more gab. The sandwich was tasty but, hey, at $12 for a lousy sandwich costing $2 in Mexico City, it had better be. All in all, it took us an hour-twenty or more to get in and out of this overpromoted, noisy madhouse for a street-food sandwich and my ears were still ringing! When we left, the line of "turistas" was 50% longer and down the street. So, I guess that I'm a local, not a tourist, a trendy or a "wanna-be". I am also an experienced, non-poor individual who does not feel, like some, that he needs to make reservations at a sandwich shop well in advance just to be hip. This place is an overpriced, overly-loud, touristy and hugely ineffecient sandwich shop which does not deserve any patronage. Avoid it at all costs. Better yet, visit the street stalls in Mexico City as I have or the little, Mexican grills throughout Chicago which will give you real tortas with authentic taste for lots less without putting you through this hell-hole.
