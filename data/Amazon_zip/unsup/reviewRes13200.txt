The pizza I had was good and I enjoyed a nice crisp sangria. The restaurant has a nice comfy feel and I could see it being a place I would put on my bar/restaurant rotation if I lived in the area. I wasn't wowed by anything except the cheese soup that I tasted. It was the consistency of melted velveeta but it tasted like baby Jesus's tears. Delicious!
