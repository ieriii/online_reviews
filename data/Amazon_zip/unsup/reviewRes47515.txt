Great bar, cool decor, and what a good idea to have concert footage being played throughout the place. We had a lot of fun watching Guns N Roses playing a show in their heyday. Our waitress was also great; friendly and ready with food recommendations. What stood out to me by far was the food (which was all named after various prison references, though I didn't see any references to Shawshank). I was lucky I was there with a bunch of people so I was able to try a few appetizers. If you go to Lockdown Bar and Grill, you need to do yourself a favor and get the Prison Shank (a.k.a. marinated steak skewers) appetizer. The flavor was amazing and the beef was cooked to perfection. The Goat Thief (baked goat cheese) was also good, as was the Pepper Spray (Italian sausage), but the steak skewers stand out as my favorite. I ordered a burger (served on a pretzel bun, great touch!) and it was juicy and practically melted in my mouth. The fries that came with the burger were my second favorite thing to eat here. They're easily the best fries I've had in a long time. Dessert isn't available yet, but I can't wait to go back and see what they put on the menu!
