I don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review for The Purple Pig. It's been my one true standby ever since it opened. I go there to show off Chicago's culinary "street-cred" to out-of-town guests, to catch up with friends for a quick after work meet up, or to simply get my fix of good wine and great food. The secret to the Purple Pig is timing. They don't take reservations and the wait tends to be 1-2 hours in the evenings. I usually like to go right after work (or even leave work a bit early to beat the crowd) or at odd hours in the afternoon (who's up for some razor clams at 3PM on a Sunday?) When I absolutely have to dine during peak hours, I stop by the restaurant an hour or two before my preferred dining time to put my name on the list. That way I can come home, get ready, wait for them to call me, and count my lucky stars that I live not far from the Bannos family's latest and greatest. The other reviews did a great job of covering the dishes and ambiance of the place. My personal favorites are the pate, charred green onions, and pork shoulder but honestly with a menu like that you can't go wrong (yes, I've tried most of the menu and no, bikini season isn't going so great as a result). Come here with an open mind and ALWAYS ASK THE WAITER WHAT THEY LIKE ON THE MENU. They will not lead you astray and I've discovered most of my faves that way. PS - If you're lucky enough to snatch the "chef's table", two seats at the end of the bar that faces the kitchen (think Avec), you'll get a front row view to Jimmy Jr. doing his thing. He's kind of hot in a "wow you make a mean romesco sauce" kind of way.
