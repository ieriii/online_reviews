I had one of the specials tonight, which was a no-brainer: bacon-wrapped monkfish. If you've ever had monkfish, you;d be a happy camper with this one. If not, who cares...its fish f'n wrapped in bacon. Ta-da. Its like showing up to dinner and knowing there's going to be a walk-off homer. Piling on to the other bazillion comments, the rumors are true: the bruschetta and mussels are great starters. We tried the duck confit and the beet bruschetta specifically - both were a big thumbs up. Service was top notch, very friendly, attentive, but not overbearing. If you're looking for a sit-down with friends, want to chat and not worry about the scene around you, Revolution is it. But I'd mind the day you're rolling in. Even on the Tuesday that I showed up, it was full (not packed). Your experience may take a nose dive on a Saturday given the popularity halo that hangs over this place still. Oh, and I had some beer. I'd recommend the Cross of Gold, Eugene, and Let's Have a War if you're down with Belgians (beers, not the people).
