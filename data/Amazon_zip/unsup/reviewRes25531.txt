I've recently read some of the reviews and would like to clarify a couple of things for those who may have had a confusing or mediocre experience here. Living in the area and having a Greek significant other, speaking for both of us this little place is a gem. Clarification on which counter to approach. The first one you see is the bakery counter. Head here if you wish to purchase deserts, breads, or any of the miscellaneous items for sale. The middle counter/bar is obviously for coffee or drinks. You can sit here and eat as well. The back counter is for food you wish to either order to go or a quick way to grab a bite to eat instead of ordering via a waitress. Although the prices may seem a bit high the quality of food is excellent and according to my signif other pretty authentic for Greek food in Chicago. I recommend the cheese pies and yes - the chicken/lemon/rice soup is delish as well at the Mediterranean salad and Greek Coffee. For those who had a so so experience...please try again. Cheers.
