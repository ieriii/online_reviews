This pizza joint is the most overrated place I've ever been to. I actually felt that I wasted my time going out of my way to eat here. My goal for my brief Chicago visit was to eat as many deep dish pizzas as I could. While the sauce was decent, the other ingredients didn't taste as fresh. The crust was the most disappointing piece of dough ever. It was thick and doughy. Even the thin crust tasted doughy. There was no bite or crisp to the crust at all.
