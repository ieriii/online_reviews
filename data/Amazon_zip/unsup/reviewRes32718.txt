I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not a vegetarian. Having said that, I don't mind going to places that cater to that crowd. However, I would prefer my vegetarian meal to be all about fresh veggies and what not. I don't really get into the "hey let's make something that isn't meat taste like meat" deal. So I ended up getting a sloppy joe. It was ok. But then i went home and had the poops for three days. Apparently my body does not like junk food vegetarian.
