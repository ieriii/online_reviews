I believe I checked various websites each day for about 15 years looking for news of when Revolution was going to open. At this point, please insert your own play on words involving the word revolution. Something about it not being televised perhaps. We started with the beer flight, which involved two very good ales (Anti-hero and Iron Fist) and one very strong tasting porter named Eugene (tougher than it sounds). There were also two mild beers that weren't my taste. One thing that stood out in all of them was how fresh they were. This is the point of drinking right at the brewery; I am to understand that the beers will be kept in small batches to ensure their freshness.  As an appetizer I recommend the roasted beet, belgian endive & goat cheese bruschetta. The smoked and grilled tofu was also excellent, but not as good as the garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes that I got as a side. These were amongst the best potatoes I have ever had. Finally for desert, I would suggest ordering the beignets if you desire to lose weight by being turned off to this gratuitous course forever. A debate continues with Jennifer D and myself as to if they tasted like cardboard or like dirt. I say dirt, because cardboard leaves no aftertaste.
