Working across the street from where Sunda sits, at Illinois between Clark and LaSalle, my friends and I watched with anticipation as it was being constructed a couple of years ago. Before its heavy blue doors ever opened, we got ahold of the menu online and circulated it amongst ourselves, delighting over the promised delectables. In a gesture that I now know to be characteristic of this establishment, Sunda's owners ventured across the street and handed over a stack of $25 gift certificates to the security guard at our building, inviting our entire staff (100+ full-time) to dine in its plush new digs. And yet, I never got around to eating there until a couple weeks ago, for lunch. I have to say, I was just a tad disappointed. I blame all the hype for my high expectations. Sunda is a beautiful place where lots of beautiful people go to be seen. And if that's your thing--well, you'll love it. But me, I'm all about the food, and to a somewhat lesser extent, the value. Unfortunately, these didn't get winning points in my book. I ordered the Pancit Canton, a traditional Filipino noodle dish. I LOVE noodles. But while I expected these to be delicious--especially since my friend and fellow diner, a Filipina foodie who eats dinner for breakfast, is a huge fan of Pancit--they were just OK. The best thing about the dish was the crispy pork, which I picked through my noodles to get to. And my friend's Ramen Lover was bland. I would still give it another try, when I've got another $30 to blow on lunch. The service was fine, but not remarkable, and I found meter-parking in the middle of the lunch-hour rush. And the Ebony Flower Blooming Tea was delectable, indeed.
