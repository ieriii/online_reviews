I stayed here only for one night. We arrived too early to check in and the concierge was happy to stow our bags for us while we shopped outside of the hotel which was awesome. Check in was quick and friendly. We had desk agent Cookie. She was wonderful, pleasant, and all around a giggler which you usually dont get at hotels...or the fancier ones anyways. We didnt get the room choice we wanted but it was ok. I got a great deal on the room so i wasnt even a bit upset. Room was very clean, beds super comfy with TONS of pillows. Bathroom a tad tight but luckily my bf has a shaved head so we werent fighting for the bathroom to get ready ha. Quick response when we called down to ask for toothpaste and silverwear. The door man was funny and very helpful to point us in the direction we were trying to go. Cab service from the hotel was very nice and quick as well. There is an Einstein Bagels attached to the hotel which was perfect. I believe this is my new hotel in the city. Great value for the location and your modern "hilton" hotel. Very very pleased with our stay.
