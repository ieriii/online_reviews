My friend, who is an amazing bartender, recommended this place. I went with a friend and sat at the bar. I LOVED sitting at the bar and watching and chatting with the mixologist/bartender! I always sit at the bar. They know what they are doing there.  Our bartender was awesome, amicable, and made some amazing drinks for us. We didn't order off the menu. We just told the bartender what we liked/wanted, and he made us a customized drink that rocked our world. We tried two drinks each. They are like $12/each, but I think they are well worth it.  I don't like the wait or the line or the fact that they don't take reservations. I also don't like trying to find parking in the area. It was hard to find the first time there. The ambiance is nice. It's a nice place, and the drinks are amazing. i say have them make you a customized drink if you are sitting at the bar.  I did not taste the food, so I cannot comment on that. I would give them five stars if they took reservations.
