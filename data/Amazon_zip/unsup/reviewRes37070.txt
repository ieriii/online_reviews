When you enter Fox and Obel you can tell that this is not your average grocery store. This grocer is not super huge in size and is pretty neatly organized with a lot of open space. There is a Caf and Bistro as part of this operation. I have never eaten at the Bistro but it seems reasonably priced, and over looks the Chicago River. The caf I have eaten from and I must say I was not so impressed. The sandwich breads are heavy and big and kind of dry and the meat is also kind of dry. Also some of the sandwiches run at like $15. But the Bistro and Caf are not reasons I go to Fox and Obel. The first reason I make the trek to this downtown hardly parkable location, is the Fromagerie. Mmm the word alone makes me salivate! Goat, cow, sheep cheese, you name it; they're got the finest the world has to offer! Have you ever eaten an entire .3 lbs. of French Blue Cheese at once? Let me tell you, that's a whole lotta mold in one sitting. But I just couldn't help myself. My local favorite is the Humboldt Fog goat milk cheese from California, creamy, tasty, outrageous! The deli meats are a small but enticing selection of Salami, Chorizo and Ham from mostly France, Spain and Italy. They run minimum $10.99 lbs. Fox is a little pricey. But this is not by any means a standard grocery store, rather one to visit every once in a while and stock up on little international delicacies. There are also saffron, truffle oils, and Balsamic vinegars from 60 years ago that run at like $500, in addition to your average cooking spices. If you love to cook, you will love Fox and Obel. Some inspirations for this grocer were the old world markets of Paris, Milan and Lisbon. Walking around the store you definitely get this, and in a world of Dominick's and Jewels it is so refreshing!
