This is our favorite Thai restaurant in the world. We go about once a week and typically BYOB a Chardonnay which matches to most of the menu. Usually there is no wait without reservations. The service is attentive, but they kind of stay out of your business. The food is consistently great and our bill is always so low! Food and value are the two main reasons we keep coming back, but the atmosphere is pretty cool too. The place is divided into three rooms. The first room is more pedestrian with the entranceway and traffic, the second room is more romantic and the third room seems to fit larger parties and families. Though I wouldn't say this place is ideal for children, take them down the street to Thai Oscar. It's odd that those two Thai places are so close together, yet still both bring in the business. Food-wize if you're a noob try the Pad Thai or Peanut Lover's, if you're a Thai food junkie try the green curry (hot) and your head will explode. The satay appetizer is very good, we prefer beef. Tiger Cry is excellent, you could easily make a meal out of all appetizers, but after you go a couple dozen times order outside your comfort zone because they do everything so well.
