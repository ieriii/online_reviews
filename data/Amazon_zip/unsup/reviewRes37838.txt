I like how there's a few different levels- tables/booths/bar seating right when you enter, or go up the ramp for more tables, or up the stairs for crazy window booths and tables. Huuuuge beer selection, I tried several and loved them all, from blondes to ambers to something super duper dark (not sure what those are called...hehe). And not too expensive. 5 bucks for a pint of great beer works for me. Perfect for before/after a show at the Neo Futurists theatre, as it's right around the corner. I'd go back!
