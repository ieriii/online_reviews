We went in there with a mission: to eat chicken and eat chicken we did. Sei-Jin, Zachary, and I ordered a whole Crisp BBQ Chicken and then wings in Seoul Sassy and Bud's Buffalo as well as sides of the "magic mushrooms" and "o-rings". There was nothing really Korean about the chicken, but it was good indeed. The sides were great great great. Our vegetarian friends for whom we had checked the menu online first before going here post-movie liked what they had. Honestly, I think next time I may try out the Buddha Bowl or something so I won't feel nearly so gross and full after eating so much fried food. I will definitely be back. They also stock Martinelli's apple juice, best apple juice ever, along with lots of other interesting choices of beverages like pear juice. Mmm!
