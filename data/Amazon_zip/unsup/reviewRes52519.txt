So...I go to Brazzaz a lot. This is probably not the best decision to make for my body as I'm sure eating that much meat more than once a year may be detrimental to my health. But thanks to those 2 meals for the price of 1 coupons I get in the mail all the time, I end up here over and over again. I mean, $25 instead of $50 a person is quite a difference. Damn, I'm a sucker for coupons. But I digress. Brazzaz is a cool place. If you love meat, you'll feel right at home. The tables are a little small and close together, but I'll let that slide. The more the merrier. I really enjoy the salad bar here. That mushroom risotto makes me very happy. But be careful, don't fill up on the salad bar. I made that mistake the first time I went. You can have salad anytime, but how often do you have over 15 cuts of meat carved right onto your plate? The sides are also very good. The fried bananas...mashed potatoes...creamed spinach *thumbs up* I'd say all of the meat is pretty good. The problem is, everything will taste different every time...kinda depends on who's cooking everything. Sometimes the food has been amazing, others it has been just ok. But one of the things that pushed this over the top to a 4 star review is that I had the most delicious lamb chop I have ever had in my life here. It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and damn near orgasmic. I still think about it from time to time. However, that experience was never duplicated :( I definitely recommend this place if you are into meat and all-you-can-eat situations. Also a good place for out of town visitors and Brazilian steakhouse first-timers.
