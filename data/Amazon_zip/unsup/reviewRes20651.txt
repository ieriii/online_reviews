I dragged myself all the way down from where i was staying Logan sq just to try xoco because of all the rave reviews i had heard. Love tortas, grew up with Rick Bayless recipes being used in my house, and was dying to try it. i looked up their closing time and rushed down just in time for a late meal before they closed, and got there 8 minutes before closing. The two people I followed in made the cut, but the host informed me they were now closed and I would have to leave. There were 4 people in line, and I explained that I'd made a trip to eat with them. Still no go. Told them I was getting it to go, then offered to cut my order down to a soup. Really disappointed. Sure it would have been a great meal had the host had any pity what so ever.
