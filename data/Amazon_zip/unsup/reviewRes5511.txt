I can't believe I haven't written this review yet. I'm totally delinquent it seems. Anyway, maybe it's just me, but I don't like small plates. I feel like it's incredibly expensive to get enough food to feel full. But the Pig does have a pretty extensive wine list and a nice interior, so I don't discourage you from sampling their small plate fare.
