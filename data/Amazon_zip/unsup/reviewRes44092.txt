I have been coming here once a year for the past 10 years. This is a place to come if you want a neighborhood feel and be treated like a VIP. No lines or people pushing like at Gibsons, Yet the food is even better! It is very consistent. I really like their new menu. They have more great salads, more pastas, great sides and of course great meats and fish dishes. Nice going Kinzie!
