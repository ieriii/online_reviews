Great sushi - and my vegetarian friends loved it too. The best part was the dessert - little ice cream balls in all kinds of delicious flavors. Whoever invented these was a genius. If I had any complaints it would be that the music was a little too loud for comfortable conversation with anyone not sitting right next to me. But a small price to pay for this great food - I dream of my next visit.
