We LOVE this place! It is such a fun and great place to eat. The salad bar is awesome and I always over do it forgetting that I'm getting a lot of meat soon after. The meat is very tasty as well. I really enjoyed the pork rib, the house meat (forgot what it is called) and the brazilian sausage! The waiter was great and very helpful. Even the manager came over and asked how everything was. We will definitely be back!
