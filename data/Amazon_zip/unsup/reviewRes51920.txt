This is the first pizza I had on my first trip to Chicago over 10 years ago. It was at this location back when it was just a couple of rowhouses that they had interconnected.  I prefered the look of the old place, but the pizza is just as good as ever. My girlfriend and I (her first trip) went here and she was blown away. She isn't really a pizza eater but just lost it. The crust is golden and flaky, the sauce is amazing and the cheese is just perfect.  My favorite pizza in Chicago.
