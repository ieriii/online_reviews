I spent a few years working in hotels before moving becoming a meeting planner so I feel like I can give a fair judgment of a hotel and I am just not sure I would return to the Palmer House. I understand it's a historic hotel, however I was in room 21-167 and beside the room being the smallest hotel room I've ever been in I don't think it was maintained very well. The carpet is worn and and needs replacing (felt the same about the hall and elevator landing) There was black hair on the shower walls, mildew on the shower grout, trash BEHIND the trash can in the bathroom, and it looked like the bath amenities had been used and not replaced. The woman who checked me was was in training according to the badge she was wearing but it took her forever to check me in, she didn't say more than 2 words to me so it was mostly awkward silence. The remote in my room didn't work and when engineering came up with a 2nd one that didn't work. I was told that they were in the middle of a shift change so someone else would have to come up and it took almost 30 mins, that guy brought a remote & did something to the TV before telling me it was fixed (I was working at the desk). However, when I went to turn the TV off the 3rd remote wasn't working either. Because I arrived at 1:30pm, left at 4pm, returned at midnight and went straight to bed, got up at 6 am and left at 6:30 for a flight I didn't say anything to the hotel, it just wasn't worth the hassle of moving. However, if I had been there any longer I would have complained to the front desk. No wireless Internet in the guest rooms. They get 3 stars because: Convenient location, the doorman who got me the cab to get to the airport was very friendly, and the 3rd star out of hope that I just had an off experience. The hotel has a ton of history in it and has been around forever, plus it's a Hilton which is an overall good brand.
