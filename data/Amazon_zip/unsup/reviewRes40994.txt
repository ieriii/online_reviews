Absolutely unbelievable. My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate 3 years of dating! We almost missed the place since there was not a sign outside, or if there was we missed it. The ambience is wonderful. It's a pretty small place, I think I counted a total of 10 tables. But extremely intimate and perfect for a romantic meal. The servers did a wonderful job of bringing our food out, explaining the dishes and filling our wine glasses without disturbing our conversations, romance, ect. The food was to die for. I came close to licking every plate. We did the 8 course meal and we left completely satisfied. Not hungry or too full. Perfect. It is an expensive meal, but worth it I think for special occasions. Oh, and our $75 Groupon helped a lot too.
