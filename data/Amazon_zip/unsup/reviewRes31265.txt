My wife and I dined at Mastro's last night and it could not have been better.  I have to say that although we have been at every 5 star restaurant in Chicago this one thoroughly impressed. The food was outstanding and the service was exquisite. What made our night was out waiter...probably the best we have ever had!  His recommendations were spot on and he treated us like royalty. From start to finish this was a first class experience.  The follow up call from management the next day was the icing on the cake...we WILL be back!!!
