Three words: BEST DRUNK FOOD. I'm sure it's still really good when you are sober but at least when you're drunk you welcome extra guacamole, cheese, and sour cream w/o worrying about how fat your ass will be the next day. Worry free feasting! First off, GET THE CARNE ASADA ANYTHING..... tacos, burritos, all of the above w/ the carne asada. It is the super yummy smell you smell walking up to the place from the outside. You can see the smoke billowing out of the roof carrying the steak-smell all over. Get it. Now. You will not be sorry. You eat chicken every fucking day of the week anyway, right? Tacos are cheap (~$2) and good served tacqueria style w/ onions & cilantro w/ the option of adding guac, sour cream, or cheese for $0.50 extra. If you do go for the burrito, you must get the SUPER BURRITO (~$8.00). It's like eating a pair of small children. This burrito makes Chipotle burritos look like the skinny weird kid at school. If you get the super burrito, not only do you have 4th meal taken care of, but when you wake up at noon the next day, you will still be full from the night before, AND on top of that, you now have dinner for the next day b/c there is no freaking way you ate the whole damn thing w/o vomiting (although you want to). They cut the pair of children in half so you can easily eat Hansel and save Gretel for the next day. The place is a dive in that awesome kind of way. The free chips and salsa are delicious. Very fresh, similar to pico de gallo. They give you squeezable condiment bottles full of unlimited salsa verde (the hotter sauce here) and tomatillo salsa (the black looking one). What's not to love?!
