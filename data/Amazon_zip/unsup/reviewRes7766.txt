The ambiance is great and works for large groups. Service was impeccable. Food was...mediocre to less than mediocre. Their famous butternut squash pasta dish was way too sweet. Portions are huge but what's the point of getting more of something that wasn't great to begin with? Tiramisu was yummy, other desserts less impressive.
