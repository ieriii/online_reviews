Awesome interior. Loved the set up of the restaurant.. made me feel like I was attending some kind of feast. I heard a lot of amazing things about this places.. but unfortunately, I don't think I ordered the right things on the menu. The steak tartare was amazing!! like how it had pickles mixed into it that gave it a little sour kick to it. The oysters were worth paying 6 dollars each for!! If you are a Vodka martini drinker.. DO NOT order a vodka martini here.. I don't know what kind of vodka they use but I had the worst headache after having just 1! Although this experience wasn't the greatest.. I would definitely go back to try the RIGHT things on the menu.
