Anteprima is a great (relatively) new addition to the Chicago Italian restaurant portfolio. We dined at Anteprima for the third time (in two years) this past Saturday. I am fairly picky as far as Italian cuisine goes, having been raised Italian-American and spoiled by great family chefs. So you'll be hard pressed to get five stars out of me for an Italian joint. Anteprima is pretty darn close though. All three meals were great.  Two out of three times I had pasta dishes as an entree, as did my wife. All were pretty spectacular. Portions are middle of the road (to very slightly below average) in terms of what you can expect in Chicago. If you like spicy, try the orrecchiete or buccatini. Both were rock solid. On my most recent visit I was craving some meat - ordered a flank steak which was both tasty and tender. This was off the specials list.  For appetizers, we like the anti pasta sampler. This provides a good assortment of the smaller plates, and will certainly feed 2-4 people, depending on hunger. I've had a few special appetizers that included marinated grilled eggplant, and all were delicious.  Never had dessert - prefer to wander the streets of the 'ville to get some ice cream. During all three visits service was attentive, friendly, and helpful. Most importantly they were honest - waiters and waitresses answered questions based on their perspective, and never did I feel like they were trying to steer my dinner selection. We were also seated promptly at our reservation time despite the restaurant being very crowded during two of the visits.
