As my group of 7 arrived, we were told that it would be around 40 minutes. Well after 75 minutes, I was ready to kill someone. But after we sat down, we were ready to kill the pig ourselves.  I suggested that we let the server choose for us and she brought us The Purple Pig Platter (a variety of cured meats) and a variety of cheeses. Did I ever mention to you that I LOVE cheese. We also got fried olives, a corn/tomato dish, roasted bone marrow, sardines, pork liver pate and pork neck bone rillette. Well, the food was terrific. The recommendations from our waitress were spot on. And the tapas style worked perfectly with our larger group. I hoarded on the cheeses and pork neck smear. The liver pate and bone marrow smears were tasty. The charcuterie were cured and slice paper thin - yummy. The vibe is energetic. And if the weather is nice, it's great to eat outdoors. So just expect a much longer wait than what they tell you. But the food is really good.
