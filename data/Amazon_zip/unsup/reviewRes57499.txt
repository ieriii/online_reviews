The dessert was great, but the rest was average or less.The service is awful, but it is written in big at the entrance that you shall leave 20% tip or they will include it in your bill.I am from Canada and was eating with my Texan colleague. The waitress was quick to pick up my accent and clumsily let me know at the end that Canada is considered like Europe, meaning : they don't tip. So she was telling me how stingy her Canadian customer were usually.I have never been treated so badly before. This restaurant, beside being average and way overreated, left me disgusted and insulted.
