The food? Awesome. Menu options? Not as many as I'd like. The service? I've DEFINITELY had better... I really don't understand why 1). my party was not greeted by a server for over 15 minutes, 2). we weren't given any waters with our menu and 3). our server acted as if the long wait was our problem. Not the type of customer service I was expecting. Honestly, the food is great and offers vegan/veggie/organic options. Everything always taste fresh and the meal portions are equal to what you pay. Not the cheapest place to grab brunch, but definitely consistent in terms of food quality -- however the customer service is another issue. I must say that the first time I came here, our server was a rockstar, so maybe it was just an off day the second time around. Ehh, I may come back if I'm really craving an omelete or apple-smoked chicken sausage, otherwise there are plenty of other yummy brunch places in Chicago to choose from. I guess, don't believe all the hype?
