Went here while I was in Chicago for a few days, and I really wanted the "Best" deep dish pizza in Chicago ---- Lots of places came up, but this place came up more than once. So we went here and ordered a 12in Stuffed with Spinach/Garlic/Onion, and it was fantastic!! It took about 1hr, but it was worth the wait.  I just had the two leftover slices cold while waiting for a plane at ORD, and it was still good. So good.
