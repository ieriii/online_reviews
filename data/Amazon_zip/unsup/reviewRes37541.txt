Oh Fox & Obel. You never have everything I need, you're awkward to walk through and have no right to charge $65 for a bottle of vinegar but I love you. This place has a great selection of items and brands you just won't find at your local Dominicks or Jewel. The meats and cheeses are fresh and delicious. They have an amazing coffee, tea and candy selection. I had been looking everywhere for Revolution teas and they had a bunch of them including a little 6 tea sampler. Don't get me started on their bakery section. I will stand there for 20 min debating which piece of heaven I want to permanently attach to my thighs. Everything is delicious!
