This place is like taking a trip down memory lane. It is a carhop style fast food joint frozen in time from a bygone era. I vent there as a kid and have been there as an adult. The hot dogs are unbelievable and the fries are the best! Only thing is I eat better these days so no Superdawg for me unless I vant to just splurge on something "bad" to eat and feel nostalgic. It vas listed as a place you must see before you die...So, I can honestly RIP happy now.
