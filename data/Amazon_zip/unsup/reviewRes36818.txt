I went to Meli for brunch and was extremely disappointed. The food was good-but the service was disgusting. We sat down, our food was delivered within 10 mintues-before our coffee, and the check was on the table before we had taken 5 bites. They were extremely busy, but to make your customers feel that unwelcome and uncomfortable is inexcusable. The waitress and bus boys were hovering over us constantly. I cannot count how many times our waitress wandered over by us to see if we had paid the check. I was with 4 other people, and all of us were in agreement that we would never come back again.
