I have now eaten here twice. Both times the food/drinks were awesome but the service was deplorable. The first time was lunch and there was no wait. Still the service was nonexistent. I found a large blue rubber band in my food, sent the dish back uneaten and they still tried to charge me for the meal. The waiter actually brought the manager over and made me argue my case, while I held up a large blue rubber band (the kind that comes on vegetables). Hello! The second time was dinner and there was a two hour (on the nose) wait. The food was awesome but the smelly hipster waitress, after insisting that our order be made in full, could not course the meal to save her pathetic life. Our dishes were plopped down with no explanation or serving utensils. I finally had to go find the waitress after a 20 minutes of waiting for our dessert. She was mixing up some oatmeal for her to eat. Her station was still packed! Then, I begged for the check and THAT took a good 10 minutes of waiting. Despite the good food, I will not be going back. There are awesome restaurants all over this city (Girl and the Goat for example) where I can wait two hours for a table ACTUALLY SITTING AT A BAR, and get fabulous service as well as delicious food. Nope, no more Longman & Eagle for me.
