LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! One of my favorite places for Breakfast and/or Lunch! I have been going to Milk & Honey for over a year now. ( I work in the area) Everytime I have been there I have never been disappointed. I highly recommend the Breakfast Burrito. They always have a pancake special also!  People should aware that at peak hours, M&H gets really crowd. Dont let this completely shy you away. The line and service moves pretty quickly during peak hours. During the summer there is outdoor seating. It is a small place, so groups of more that 4 might want to consider somewhere else. Lastly, please note if you are craving some of their amazing bake goods... there is another Milk & Honey Bakery under the blue line by the Damen/Milwaukee/North Six way!
