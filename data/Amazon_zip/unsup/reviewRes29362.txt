Dear Opart Thai House, Thank you for being close to my apartment. Thank you for being inexpensive. Thank you for your fried bananas.... which are so disgustingly rich they make me ill from all the sweetness but I still order them every time. Thank you for your pad thai, even though it is such a typical choice, it is still soooo tasty. Thank you for the jalapeno slices on my spring rolls. I love jalapeno.
