So I finally made it out to Hot Doug's today before they close for the holidays (I believe they're closed from Dec 25th through Jan 4th ish - check their website). Luckily, our wait started inside the first door so we didn't have to stand outside in the cold but after the meal I had, I wouldn't have minded at all. The atmosphere is very retro, lots of hot dog stuff, and I love that Doug takes your order and he was extremely pleasant to talk to. Between our group we ordered 3 different dogs: 1. Kiera Knightly (Fiery Dog) - SO GOOD. The beef is seasoned just right, I don't know how he does it. 2. Tequila Chicken with Jalapeno Mayo and Habenero Pepperjack Cheese and Beans - I was a little weary of this one but the chicken was delicious.  3. Dave Kingman - amazing as always says the husband The fries are just what you'd expect from a joint like this. Maybe nothing absolutely amazing, but not short of great either. Can't wait to go back there. They only accept cash. If I could think of one improvement, it would be to change their hours so I could go there more often.
