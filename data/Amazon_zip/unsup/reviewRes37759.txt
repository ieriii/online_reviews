Hopleaf is the place to go in Andersonville. An extremely wide selection of beers (Unfortunately for me I'm not a big fan of Belgian beers as I don't think they have ever discovered that HOPS should go into beer...but I've found beers there that I do enjoy immensely). There menu is stupendous as well. (i.e. Mussels...get them...love them.) Unfortunately it has lost some appeal to me as it appears to always be crowded nowadays....probably due to appearing on "Check Please"... But if you find the right time it can be a great place to go...and relaxing.
