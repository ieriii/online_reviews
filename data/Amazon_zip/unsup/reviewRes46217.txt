I know they are owned by the same company, but Grand Lux is far better than the Cheesecake factory, and has a better view! The huge kitchen says it all, and makes your mouth water while you walk by it. THe made to order desserts are great too. I would suggest the cookies or the molton chocolate cake. Their breakfast menu is awesome and they always make substitutions! It can be summed up as good portions, great prices, and nice comfort food! Great to take friends/family visiting the city!
