This place really isn't that great as far as Pho goes. The beef stock isn't super flavorful and that is a shame. Aside from Pho dishes, the other entrees aren't that spectacular either. Additionally, the wait staff really isn't attentive to your needs as a customer. They typically drop off the food and leave you for the rest of your visit. It's sometimes hard to find a waiter to pay for your meal. I recommend the smaller Pho restaurant just around the corner in the parking lot of the grocery store called Tai Nam.
