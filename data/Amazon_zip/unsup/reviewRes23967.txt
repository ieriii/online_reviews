first night in chicago - fellow yelper susie m and i was overwhelmed by the portions from this place. let's recap the dinner. dolmades - it was hot with some creamy sauce on top gyro - enough lamb slices to feed the army of australians for an entire australia week pork tenderloines - sauteed in tomato based sauce - this pork dish was delicious - but also enough for 4 people yogurt and honey - it is now my favorite dessert if i am back in chicago, i will definitely need to go back and try some other stuff - but next time, i will bring an army of my own.
