An hour wait to get into a hot dog joint, it better be a damn good hot dog joint ... It is. In fact it is probably the best if only for it's uniqueness. Finally tried the fois gras sausage, good but why order it again when there is so much else here to try. The duck fries are some of the best fries I've had. The bacon sausage was great, an absolute treat. Gotta make it less than 3 years between visits to this place.
