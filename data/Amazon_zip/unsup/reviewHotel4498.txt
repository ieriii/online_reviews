Did I book the Palmer House on Hotwire- Yes! Did I get it for $100 on a Sat. night- Yes! I am not even joking this was the convo I had with the front desk guy. Stuff like this would only happen to Ben Stiller in meet the parents. Me: We are checking in. Clerk: We have the parlor room for you on executive level. It comes with free breakfast. Me: Sounds great. Clerk: The room doesn't have a bed in it. Me: Wait . . . You are trying to give us a room without a bed in it. Clerk: it is a very spacious room, we could try and get a roll away for you. Me: uhhh. . That's not going to work for us. Clerk: that is the only room we have available. Me: the only room you have doesn't have a bed. You are going to have to try harder than that. Clerk: Well. . .how about a smoking room. Me: No- try again. Finally normal room non smoking. . . And that jackwagon was trying to give us a room without a bed. RIDICULOUS!!!!!
