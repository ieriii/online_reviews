Doug is hilarious, and it never ceases to amaze me that he can do math in his head (go private school education go!). The food is worth the wait!! It's best come come early, preferably on a weekday, and def before the lunch-time rush for your best chances at a short line and a seat if you are eating in. The duck fat fries are good but only available on Fri-Sat. Also, cash only!! (and free soda refills!) The decor is eclectic, lots of conversation-starters as we sat down to enjoy our meal. The menu apparently does change, so check out their website for the current menu.
