Of course there are better Korean restaurants. Of course there are "more authentic" Korean restaurants (whatever that means). Of course they did it differently at that restaurant you always used to go to during your semester abroad in Korea. Of course there are other Korean restaurants that cater to the Food Network-cultivated prejudices of middlebrow Chicago foodies. Ok, listen, that's not why you come here. This is why you come here.  You come here because you want to spend 3 or 4 hours of a cold evening drinking and talking happily with your friends and eating bulgogi and banchan while wrapped in a warm cocoon of smoke from the coals, the transcendent smell of grilling meat, and the kind of quiet that comes from being in a loud room full of happy people all doing exactly the same thing. You come here because it's 3 am on a cold night, you've just left the bar, and you're dying for the kind of buzzed, happy, post-beer food-daze that only cooking meat at your table with fire and stuffing your face with kimchi and namul can bring. Cranky servers and dangerously hot grills inches from your vulnerable flesh, yes - and heaps and heaps of magical comfort food. So put on your coat and gloves and come here. It's getting to be about that time.
