wife and i went and decided to get 6 appetizers, 3 cold 3 hot instead of getting entrees to do our own tasting menu. very filling. awesome caesar salad, gnocchi, and buffalo chicken, and very clever spins on all of them. edible bloody mary was a very cool "drink". hits your palette in an unexpected way. beet salad was excellent. risotto and kobe beef tartare were lackluster. modern but casual ambience. wine list was very accessible and priced well, $8-$12 per glass, bottles from $30 and up. wait staff, bar staff were good. our server was a little cold but it was fine. love the concept, since my wife and i are definitely foodies, but not into really "fancy" restaurants.
