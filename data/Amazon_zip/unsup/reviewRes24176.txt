A bargain meal to be had at this Costa Rican joint. Avena (oatmeal - sounds weird but delicious) or guanabana (soursop) shake with a Pepito sandwich (steak, caramelized onions, beans, and lizano sauce) are my favs. I also opt for some tostones (fried plaintains - think fries - not sweet) with garlic mojo sauce.
