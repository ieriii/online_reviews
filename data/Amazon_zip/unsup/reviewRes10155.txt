I have never been disappointed here. The pizza comes out perfect; slathered with your choice of sauce (or not), peppered with garlic (or not) and topped with anything from mashed potatoes to broccoli. Their brews are award-winning-delicious and rotate on season/month/etc. And decor! The first time I went into Piece I felt like I was transported elsewhere. Open, lofty ceilings bring your eyes up while allowing you a moment to pause and reflect, "It didn't look this big from the outside." Go for the pizza, but stay for live band karaoke, small-batch brews and all that jazz. Just watch the wait times on Fridays and Saturdays; it's best to get a piece at Piece during the week.
