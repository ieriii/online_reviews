The meat here is seriously delicious - drunk AND sober. I've come on both occasions, multple times. I only go to the sit down one...not sure if they are different - i know the one next to it is more of a "to-go" place, but I like my chips and pico de gallo, thank you. The tacos are delish and minimal - just onions and cilantro here, folks. If you want the extras like sour cream or cheese, it'll cost ya. But the black sauce is good enough for me...ok, fine AND sour cream. Gotta have it. The tampiquena is damn good too if you're hungry or if you have a buddy to share as it's alot of food for good value - steak, 2 quesadilla, rice and beans and lettuce and tomato. drooool. Oh, and tortillas of course so you can make tacos from it too....good deal. Sometimes, it's kinda oily, but not a deal breaker, really.
