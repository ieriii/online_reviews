Frontera's inexpensive (well, compared to the others) little sister. I've tasted 3 or 4 of the tortas at this point - each delicious. You can't go wrong, but the chipotle chicken and milensa are stand outs. The caldos are good too, but let's be honest, even the very best caldo can't match the worst torta.  Bustling atmosphere, extremely friendly staff. The line can be a bit intimidating, but tends to move pretty quickly. Expect to pay around $35-40 for 2 tortas + 2 adult beverages.
