Yummy! I was here on a Saturday night- definitely need to make reservations. I had the veggie lasagna and it was amazing! Seriously such a huge portion too. The fried calamari was good and tasted very fresh. I would love to come back and try more. I think their outdoor seating is also super cute and romatic with the christmas lights hanging above. Cute for a date!
