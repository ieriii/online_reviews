For me, no trip to Lakeview is complete without stopping for lunch at The Chicago Diner. As a vegetarian, I acknowledge that I may be a bit biased, but this seriously is a place that people of all diets can enjoy. The worst mistake you can make is to think that the only thing you'll find on the menu is steamed kelp or gluten-free wheat germ tacos with watercrest mole. The menu fluctuates according to the season, so depending on how often you go, you may never see the same menu twice. And it's not much different from any run-of-the-mill diner menu, except for the taste,and that you can feed yourself for under ten dollars. I'd say the best meal I've had there was a lentil based meatloaf which could effortlessly beat the hell out of your grandmother's recipe that she learned from the Dione Lucas Cooking Show. Basically, their dishes that are meant to resemble meat actually do taste like the real thing. Since Chicago Diner makes an effort to go organic on just about everything on the menu, this includes the coffee. I can't think of any other place that serves a more flavorful cup of coffee. They could build an addition to start a coffee bar and run Starbucks right out of Lakeview. It's not some freeze dried Taster's Choice. It's some serious gourmet shit. Feel free to tell your server that in your best Samuel L. Jackson voice. The staff seems very friendly and might get a good chuckle out of it.
