This place is a Chicago treasure. It is one of the first stops when I host guests from out of town. The menu is large and selections creative, yet it changes constantly, so it is impossible to tire of the selections. Favorite items return, and new choices pop up weekly. The duck fat french fries are dynamite. Also, the fun ambiance and Doug himself make each trip one of the most unique, anticipated, and enjoyable experiences in the city.  Downside: long lines... In this case, it is well worth the wait! The menu is creative .
