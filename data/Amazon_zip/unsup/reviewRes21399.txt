This place is pretty decent. It has a loyal following in the area and seems to always have a nive sized crowd. I like the tortilla soup they have. It's probably the best reason to come here. Scratch that... the best reason to come here is for the half-price margaritas on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But while you're there have some complimentary chips and salsa and order a bowl of tortilla soup (and the flautas are also pretty tasty). The ower is extremely friendly and is always talking to the regulars and treats new faces very well. I live close to the area so I end up here every so often. It's worth a try, for sure.
