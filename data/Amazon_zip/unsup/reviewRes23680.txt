Finally, the patio is open! There's a cooler where diners can store their BYOs, pretty flower boxes and a very substantial line of hipsters waiting to be sat. My threesome had to wait about 15 minutes, which really wasn't that bad. Once we were seated, it took about the same amount of time for a server to stop by. We didn't really care, we were in no hurry. It was the first real day of summer anyhow. The service just needs some time to catch up, right? I eventually gave up asking for a glass and drank my beer from the bottle. The chips were stale. Bummer. We doused them in salsa and ate them anyway. Some advice: Whatever you do, don't expect much from the Vegetarian Salad. When it came out, I bit my lip to keep from laughing. Shredded lettuce and some slivered beets. One slice of avocado. A cucumber. Irazu, why, why did you disappoint? Your savory plantains with black bean puree are out of this world. Your burritos overflowing and your guacamole is delectable. Put some life into that salad, Ok? And make sure to fry up some fresh chips. I will be back to check on you.
