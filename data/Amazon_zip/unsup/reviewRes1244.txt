What can I say that hasn't been said? Having frequented Hot Doug's for six out of the seven years it's been in business, I've watched it grow from quirky little Roscoe Village hot dog stand to nationwide sensation. After all the press (Check Please, Gourmet magazine, the New York Times, the Tribune, LTHForum) the lines have gotten longer but nothing's changed. Doug is still the same lovable wiseguy he always was, the prices have stayed super-reasonable, and almost every sausage combination offered is still a home run (I'm particularly partial to the ribeye steak sausage with chimichurri sauce and crispy fried onions, and the Teuben, a corned-beef sausage with sauerkraut and Russian dressing). Doug's is the only eating place in the city, if not the entire country, for which I can justify standing in line for 45 minutes on a weekend afternoon (unlike several well-known Lincoln Park/Lakeview brunch spots, whose popularity I find absolutely incomprehensible). Once inside, the place is a well-oiled machine; somehow there is never, ever a wait for a table once you've placed your order. Soon after its inception, Doug's quickly became a Saturday-afternoon tradition for me and my friends (and thousands of others, I know). If you live in Chicago, you're probably thinking about eating there right now. If you have lived in Chicago, or you've spent any time here in the past six years, you've probably contemplated flying back just to eat here. I even know a few people who have attempted to do it on a really tight layover at O'Hare or Midway.
