You will not find another restaurant like this in the city. Granted, the food is very pricey, but it is worth every penny for the creativity, atmosphere and wonderful service. The taste of each bite was impeccable. I went here with my boyfriend and we immediately were seated when our reservation time was. Be sure to call a few days ahead of time unless you want to sit at the long community tables btw. I highly recommend getting the seared american kobe beef tartare and the Chilean seabass. Remember to sit back and relax and enjoy the flavor though!
