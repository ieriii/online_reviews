We had a lot of expectations for this place, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. Not sure what happened, but when the whole table (7 people) ordered their burgers medium-rare, we all received well-done burgers, which was quite disappointing. The toppings were good, and since it was a holiday weekend, we relayed this to the waitress but offered to stick with out meals. She said she would talk to the kitchen and check what she wrote down, but never gave us any follow-up.Our experience aside, the burgers are well-thought out and the beer list is not bad (there's a lot of beer competition in the neighborhood, so adding some more exciting local taps like Three Floyds, Half Acre, Two Brothers, etc would really help).Though the Ukrainian Village has a lot of great places to eat, Lockdown is a welcome addition. I'd give it another chance - their heart is in the right place, hopefully we were just an off-night as far as the kitchen is concerned. The other positive experience on Yelp make it seem like my experience may have been an outlier.
