Let me tell you...I have been to a lot of different sushi places in the city. I love sushi! And Sushi X is definitely one of the best!  I've only had their delivery, so I cannot comment on the restaurant itself. Our absolute favorite rolls that we get every time are the Crab Rangoon and the Godzilla. Then my husband and I usually pick one more roll to add to our order. Their rolls are HUGE.  The delivery is always within about 45 minutes. Oh and their Wasabi Mashed Potatoes are also really good!  We've tried out other places in the West Loop area to give them a chance, but none compare to Sushi X.
