Yum. Loved the ambiance, the family-run environment... and the brunch - WOW. One of our friends (who is quite a foodie) asked the waitress to compliment the chef on "one of the best brunches, I have ever had." Quite the compliment, but SO true! Easy street parking and no wait time make Nana's a much-preferred choice over downtown brunch locations.
