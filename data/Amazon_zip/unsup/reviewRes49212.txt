Been to Bin 36 twice now and loved it both times. Hey, I went mainly for the wine and was happy both times. First was a red flight (Spanish old school/new school) that was solid. Thought Nos. 1 and 4 were the best. That night my friend and I wanted to try a cheese flight but didn't know which one to pick. Our waiter (shame on me, forgot his name) said he'd put one together for us. Fabulous. My friend was trying to get them to make the third cheese, gouda, into a toasted sandwich. Hey, she tried. Second visit was a white wine flight. Once again, solid. Paired it w/ the Big 10 cheese flight; had the smoked salmon w/ mozzarella after that. Delish. One of these days I'll have a full meal at Bin 36. Right now, it's a damn fine wine/cheese flight choice!
