let's start off this way. i am just evaluating this pizza against other chicago style pizza places. that means you have to love motz cheese. in case you don't know a chitown pizza, the style is basically toppings solidified within a ton of cheese, contained in a crust bowl. the cheese is everywhere. so, what's left to evaluate: cheese and topping. let me jump to the conclusions -- you can't beat giordano's crust. it's butter and delicious. if you you're a sausage man, you should hit up gino's. if not, then this is your place.
