Dear God, if you to exist, you should eat here. First and foremost, if you like beer (and I don't) they have a ridiculous list of them. I like Lambic beers and I've tried a few here and most were great. Recently I've been trying their ciders and have not been disappointed. For some people the beer is reason enough but for me the food is what brings me all the way north from Bridgeport (friends too!). I'm a big fan of the CB+J. I've recently had the Brisket sandwich and it was fantastic. The Frites are incredibly seasoned and provided with an equally delicious aioli. Heads up! If you site next to the stove in the main dining area you will get toasty! Seriously, you won't realize it until you're sweating. You've been warned. This place was made for groups, 3, 4 or more. I've never been there alone and I don't care to experience it that way. I've had some of the best dinners with friends and conversations over drinks at Hop Leaf in recent years.
