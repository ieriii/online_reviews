Longman & Eagle is the best restaurant in Chicago. Best sweetbreads I've ever had If I didn't know better I would guess they were marinated in the souls of penthouse pets. Ox tail and scallops were fucking delish. Bone marrow with onion relish got me harder than a Trigonometry exam! Short ribs with beets and Lima beans the least creative dish but executed to perfection. Get back in the kitchen Charlie Trotter! And stop it with the novelty 'foam' Moto! This is the new deal! Service was extremely attentive without being annoying. I can't say enough good things about this place. Out of all the places akin to this none come close. Oh and the cocktail are made perfectly with the utmost attention and care. Unquestionably one of the best manhattans I have ever had. Maker's Mark shots for $3.00!!! Best $9.00 desert I have ever had. Shit and there is foie gras on the desert menu. Sadly I was too full to get it...But these people get it. Duck fat and 90 proof bourbon for desert is something I have longed for longer than the lines Rick James used to chop me up.
