One of the few brunches I've had in Chicago, Milk and Honey was much as I expected: busy. Really, really busy. So busy in fact, that to be able to order and sit down in under 45 minutes, we ended up eating outside on a 45 degree day. It was sunny, so I didn't mind too much, but our limbs were a little frozen by the end. Just the whole order at the counter set up threw me off a little bit, and seemed chaotic with people having ordered with no place to sit. Another thing that threw me was the woman taking our order, who impatiently told everyone in my party (with an eye roll) to move along after we had ordered...even the person who had been here many times and knew the drill. She seemed very much in her own world of getting people through the line, but I don't think you're ever too busy to be polite. Especially to paying customers. This, combined with getting your own drinks and silverware, made the prices seem a little high. I got the famous granola with yogurt and fruit and found it to be...eh. There were no chunks or nuts in the granola and there was hardly any fruit in my bowl. The vanilla tea I got was nice, but the lady who served it to me was again, impatient and rude. Something redeeming was the amazing (second hand knowledge here) huevos rancheros and insanely tasty looking bacon. It was great to be at brunch with friends I don't see often, but I don't think I'd come back to Milk and Honey the next time I'm in Chicago.
