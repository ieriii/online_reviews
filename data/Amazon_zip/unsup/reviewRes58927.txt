Great food, great atmosphere! I am typically not the type of person to love those new, cliche restaurants that are launched by a group of Chicago nightlife staples. Sunda definitely proved to be an exception! I went with my extended family for my mom's birthday. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table which were all amazing. The wrinkled green beans were so delicious we had to get a second order and I am still trying to figure out how to replicate them at home! I couldn't decide what to get for my main dish (the menu is huge) and ended up getting riddled with anxiety when the waiter came by me and just ordered some sushi. I ordered two of the signature rolls which were both phenom! My sister ordered the duck which was also amazing and one of my cousins ordered the pork - also fantastic! My aunt, uncle and grandma all went with the soft shell crabs which were cooked in a steaming boll filled with vegetables and thai dried chillis. The results were magically spicy and delicious.The menu was pricey, so definitely more of a special occasion place, but definitely worth trying if you're into Asian cuisine!
