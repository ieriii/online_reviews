Ok, maybe it's not Hop Leaf's fault, but I am getting SO frustrated that I can't go here on the weekends anymore. Hop Leaf is one of my favorite places on earth, but EVERY time we have tried to go during the past few months, the wait times have been just RIDICULOUS. I don't want to go here on a weekday, I want to go on a Friday or Saturday. And I can't. And that makes me sad. I want everyone to experience the Hop Leaf love, but come on? It's one of the best places in A-ville, but it's starting to lose my loyalty. I don't want to have to carefully plan my visits as to avoid crowds, but it looks like that may be the only answer if I ever want to taste those fries again...
