i went here hoping to have a life-changing meal, especially after reading all of the positive reviews this place has received. however, my expectations were not even close to being met. first of all, it was at least 80 degrees in that restaurant. it was very crowded, which i'm sure did not help the temperature, but it was stifling in there. it felt like a sauna. but even if the temperature was more comfortable, nothing could have saved the food. my group ordered guacamole, the combination platter, asada de puerco, especial cazuela, and 3 barbacoa tacos. the guac had a very interesting (and not in a good way) texture; it was almost gummy. the combination platter is definitely nothing to write home about. it had a beef taco, tostada, tamale, and enchilada. nothing memorable on that plate. same goes for the barbacoa. it was okay. on the other hand, the asada de puerco was really good and flavorful. the meat was really moist and tender. the especial cazuela, which was grilled steak, giant chunks of cheese, and some veggies was also good. the steak was a tad overdone, so it was a bit tough. both of these dishes came with rice, beans, and tortillas. the rice was terribly salty; i couldn't taste anything besides salt. the beans were just okay, nothing special. there are much better restaurants on 18th street, so i think i'll nuevo leon next time.
