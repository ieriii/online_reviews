I consider myself a pizza connoisseur and I must say, this makes the grade... one of the best places for pizza in the city. I especially love the mashed potato pizza (weird, but strangely very good). The local beers are great too. If you're in for karaoke or a good laugh, come on a Thursday night to watch the good and the bad.
