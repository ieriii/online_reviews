loved this place!! went last night for dinner with a couple of friends and we all loved it. really tasty vegetarian food!! my favorite: the lentil cakes, OMG those were good, but actually pretty much everything that we ordered was really good. The only thing that wasn't specially tasty was the humus... the staff were friendly and the place has a cool vibe prices are reasonable and the location is excellent.
