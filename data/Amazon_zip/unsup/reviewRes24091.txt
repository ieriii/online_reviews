I went there for brunch last week, and the food was really good. They will also make any of the crepe items into a salad, which is a ncie option for the health-minded. My husband ordered decaf, which maybe they make special, and it was phenomenal.  While the food is well-seasoned, the waitstaff is not; it was clearly everyone's first restaurant job. Hopefully this will improve, or you will want to avoid this place if there's more than 4 tables already seated.
