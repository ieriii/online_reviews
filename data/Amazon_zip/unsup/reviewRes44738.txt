Wow, you Chicagoans don't play around when it comes to making uber-thick pizza! Six of us newbies showed up at Giordano's and ordered three medium deep-dishes and appetizers. We were famished so we figured half a pizza each... Oy, the menu wasn't kidding when it said each pizza serves 3-4 people! By the time we were done, we'd only finished half of what was on the table and our eyes were rolling into the backs of our heads. I lost my deep-dish cherry to the spinach and special, and I'm still having foodgasms thinking about it.
