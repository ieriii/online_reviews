Disclaimer -- I never personally stayed there but my in-laws stayed there twice.-- With that out of the way I have visited the room and the pool. Not really excited about either. Their room overlooked the pool on the first floor. First the room- It for real looked like Motel 6! I am not kidding. Like when you are on a road trip and you just need a place to sleep where you don't have to worry about getting hit by a semi truck. Yeah one of those places. It did have the standard cable and the really fake I am a quilt but light enough to be a sheet thing going on. Of course in red! Second the pool-- One word Dirty! Leaves all over the place. And the tiles were turning black from grime and dirt. But hey it was cheap and about 2 minutes from our apt. It was also close to the Jackson Park Express # 6. And the saving grace of this place is it had parking!!
