love this. just had my wisdom teeth pulled and needed pho desperately. unfortunately, nobody would drive to argyle for me, but i found this place via google, and its WONDERFUL. thick rich broth with the perfect amount of veggies and noodles. cant WAIT to try dinner. yum yum yum. they even threw in a free side of gorgeous watermelon, cantaloupe, and pineapple. big huge chunks, that were very obviously freshly cut. highly recommend.
