I come here pretty often for the $30 Bejiing duck dinner so I can't comment on the rest of the food...but WOW, their duck is amazing. I think the word has spread because I was there last night (Tuesday) and the place was packed. Keep in mind that the $30 price tag is per duck, not per person. It's a bargain for two people, even though it can probably feed four pretty comfortably.  First, they roll a cart out to your table to carve the duck tableside. The woman who carves it is extremely knowledgeable and will give you a detailed explanation of how it's cooked and how it's traditionally served. When it's all sliced, they give you steamed buns (like bao) with some homemade hoisin sauce and shredded carrot and scallion to eat the duck meat with. They also give you a small salad of pickled daikon radish and carrot for the side. The next course is a massive bowl of duck soup made with the duck bones. Next, they bring over a huge piping-hot platter of duck fried rice. Finally, they give you a bowl of refreshing sorbet. It's all just phenomenal.  The rest of the food always looks delicious and I WILL try it sometime, but the duck is just so hard to resist!
