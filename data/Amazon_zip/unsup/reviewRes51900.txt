The line outside was long, but we were almost immediately seated. Upon ordering, we were told there would be a 45 minute wait for the pizza - it did not feel that long. The pizza crust was not too buttery, but had a nice flavor. The sauce: non-descript, non-intrusive. Unlike at Uno's, for instance, it was the toppings that stood out - though not always in a good way. Our sausage and spinach pizza turned out well, the bacon cheeseburger pizza not so much. A nice experience - recommendable - but I have had better.
