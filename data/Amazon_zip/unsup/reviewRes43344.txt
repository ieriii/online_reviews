Not impressed. Not seeing what everyone else sees. Pizza doesn't have to be a parity product but this one sure is. Just because you're square and expensive does not make you good, Art of Pizza. Try quality ingredients and qualified delivery people who actually carry the necessary amount of cash to make change. Only then can you rightfully begin to overcharge me for this stuff. Right now, you stand out only in your costliness. Will not be ordering from here again.
