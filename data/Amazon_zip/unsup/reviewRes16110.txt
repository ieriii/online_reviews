This is so much more than a bar, and offers a completely elevated experience. The entrance is hidden behind a boarded up facade, with a single yellow light marking the door. This could be a pretentious move (is clearly a reference to speakeasies of the past), but once you enter, it's a blessing that the space isn't open to a clueless stranger passing by. The feeling is lush, dark, and seductive, and so are the drinks. Every cocktail was superior, and completely unusual. The music selection was phenomenal. What I loved best though, was the arrangement of the seating areas - high backed chairs create little private cocoons, and this might be the best place to go with people you actually like and want to talk to. They only allow as many people in as they can seat, which keeps the noise level down and the ambience always intimate. The fireplace was a nice touch as well. Loved it.
