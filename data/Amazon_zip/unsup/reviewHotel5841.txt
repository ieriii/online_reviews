I booked this hotel last minute on a trip to Chicago. From the moment I walked into Hotel Lincoln I was well taken care of. The entire staff was helpful and friendly. They offered up great advice for places to eat and remembered me the next day. Do not book this hotel if you are looking for a large, luxurious suite but please book it if you are looking for a hotel that is a little hip, amazing location and a great staff. I would absolutely stay there again and recommend it for most of my friends.
