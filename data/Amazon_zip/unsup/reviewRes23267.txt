This Algerian restaurant in Andersonville is a great place to go for crepes, coffee and traditional North African mint tea. You can also order a "build your own" salad with wonderful ingredients like goat cheese, fresh mint or basil, various nuts, etc. I have only one complaint. I went there recently to order a crepe and it did not come with a scoop of pistachio ice cream (as they used to be served in the past). The server told me that they stopped serving crepes with ice cream a year ago because "we no longer have ice cream here." What??? Despite that one little issue, I would recommend this restaurant.
