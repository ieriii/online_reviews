One Off Hospitality does it again. I'm a huge fan of Avec, Big Star, etc and Publican did not disappoint. Such a neat space w/the closed door booths and communal tables...warm and cozy lighting. Service was great, providing good recommendations. The food was wonderful..grilled octopus knocked my socks off. We shared so many great dishes I can't even remember them all but left full and satisfied. also, the beer list is incredible...could barely make a decision! Will definitely return.
