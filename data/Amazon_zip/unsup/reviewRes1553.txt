I'm with Vincent - Doug deserves it - but I can't match Vincent on the length of review. Hot Doug's deserves all of the praise and all of the long lines on Saturdays. No matter what, it's a fun time out for a bit of fun food. I agree with all of the raves on the specialty encased meats, but for me, I love Hot Doug's because it's a classic full-blown Chicago hot dog done perfectly. Give me one with everything, and don't forget the celery salt.
