In short, terribly disappointed and it may have to do with our waitor. We were two women sharing mutiple courses and we chose a main dish- our waitor suggested we consider another choice (more expensive) and we went with that one and it was awful- I could only take two bites of it- tasteless, fried- not something I would ever want to eat- They knew we were unhappy but did nothing to rectify it. Some of our other items were good. I was showing off someone Chicago's great food- not so here. I should have gone with the many other excellent Italian restaurants in town- thought I would try something new that seemed to be getting attention- Choose wisely here.....
