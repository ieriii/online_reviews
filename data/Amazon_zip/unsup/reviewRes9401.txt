I'm not sure it it's cool or not lame try to "collect" my favorite Top Chef's restaurants, but for some reason, I have the urge to. After a random sighting of Dale Levitski on Broadway, two giant dogs in tow, I wondered if Dale was working in Chicago. So I Googled him up, and found a Trib article about the rough times he's had since Top Chef, and that he's now the exec-chef at Sprout. Obviously, I Googled Sprout, and found out their specialty is brunch. Amazingly, my specialty is eating brunch, so I made a reservation. The girlfriend and I showed up and were seated quickly. Brunch started out with a pleasant surprise, as we were given a free glass of champagne for checking in on Foursquare. Service was a little bumpy at the beginning, as it seemed the staff did not know who we belonged to, but everyone who helped us was friendly. When our actual waiter asserted his claim, we ordered cocktails, the Bugeymosa for the girl and a Rumaki Fizz for me. The Rumaki Fizz was startling; it tasted exactly like a Hawiian glazed ham. It was not thirst quenching really, but it was interesting and fun. It is the first thing I tell people about Sprout. We ordered and began chatting. After what seemed like a relatively small wait, a server stopped by and apologized for the wait. She said they were having kitchen printer problems and we would get a free order of Lithuanian bacon buns for our inconvenience. Now, I did not think we waited too long, but I was not about to say no to free and bacon. Wow, were these things delicious. They were dense little buns, packed with some thick, cubed bacon, and served with a sweet whipped butter. It was like eating the clouds in heaven. But with bacon. I will be ordering these at full price from now on.
