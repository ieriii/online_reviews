Pizza by the slice all the way! The crust had a very nice taste as well as the sauce had some good flavor all the way. I was in a thin crust mood and had two pepperoni slices and a medium pop for 7 dollars. Not bad as these slices were huge! Very clean interior and I ate on a nice granite counter top by the window! Small parking lot though...
