From the moment I heard they were grinding their own cacao beans on premises, Xoco became a sweet flavored dream. To avoid the opening rush, we got there at 4pm the day after opening. The only thing that kept me from ordering immediately was staring at smiling, composed, stately Rick Bayless.  We ordered the Pepito Torta (spicy) and the Jamon (griddle) Torta. Everything was as expected- simple, fresh, super, super tasty. The cheese on my sandwich literally dripped into my basket. I just couldn't wait for the sandwich to cool down- but it was more of a cheese sandwich with ham than a ham sandwich with cheese. A side note- descriptions are slightly deceiving. I expected black beans and avocados on my sandwich and it appears that they were there- in spread form. A little expensive for a regular lunch....but I am cutting other parts of my budget to make room for THE CHOCOLATE. We had the Authentic and the Almendrado -both with homemade Dulce de Leche shots. I am not a fan of almond flavored food or drink so my companion had most of that tasty chocolate concoction - and I'd like to point out that he hates chocolate. I've actually seen him spit it out of his mouth when catching an accidental bite. He enjoyed his. I wanted to dive in and roll around in mine. We also had the churros (cinnamon sugar bliss!) and a flan topped chocolate cake. A cake that caused people who don't seek out flan (me) or chocolate (him) to fight over the last bite.
