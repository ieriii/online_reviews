We have only been here once. It is definitely more convenient than heading down to Little Village for some decent sit-down Mexican. There Mole was tasty, I wouldn't say anything that we had was out of this world. They seem to be pretty popular and the BYOB is definitely a plus. Probably will head back and check out some more offerings. Their Horchata is tasty. Over RrL
