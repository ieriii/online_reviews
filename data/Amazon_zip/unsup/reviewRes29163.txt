First things first, make a reservation. Now. Some friends and I tried to walk in and we were faced with a three hour wait. But we were lucky enough to get a reservation a few weeks later. Now, the good part. And is it good... Between the four of us we had: Guacamole - 4 stars Enchiladas de Chorizo Verde de Borrego - 4.5 stars Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - 4 stars Pez Espada en Mole Verde de Cacahuate (swordfish) - 4 stars Falda Asada Brava - 5+ stars Cochinita Pibil-It was the Wednesday special - 5+ stars Everything was amazing. I'd say the highlights were the falda asada and cochinita pibil. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the salsa that comes with it was phenomenal. The whole dish combined excellent flavors with a subtle spice that was never overwhelming but always there nonetheless. The suckling pig was to die for. The meat was tender and packed with flavor and served with a salsa that literally blew my mind. The moles in the other dishes were great but couldn't compete with the asada and cochinita pibil. All in all Frontera was some of the best mexican food I've ever had. Can't wait to come back for more.
