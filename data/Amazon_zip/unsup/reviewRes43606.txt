We really enjoyed our meal here. The steak was perfectly cooked. And I mean perfectly. Of course, one would expect no less since it is a steak house, but nowadays that isn't always the case. It was delicious! We also ordered the calamari as an app and it, too, was absolutely perfectly cooked, and extremely fresh and tender. The risotto side was average as was the spinach and mushroom. Nothing bad, but not stellar. I would buy the risotto again.. The 'shrooms...meh. We went fairly early, so the service was good. Our waiter was attentive without being annoying. I also appreciated that the hostess seated us at a nice four top instead of cramming us into a teeny table. Granted, they had the room to do this since we came early, but many times (im old enigh now i am authority on this!) we have been stuffed into a corner when other tables were available. I don't know if it's because we are two women or what... The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the dessert. It tasted like it came from DQ. Really. Do not get the chocolate banana cake. Blech! Oh, and the Bernaise sauce had a skim on it like it had been sitting awhile.
