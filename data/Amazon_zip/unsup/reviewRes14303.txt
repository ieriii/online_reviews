On a thursday night around 8-9pm there was a waitlist of about 45min but finding open seats by the bar is easy. I tried the bacon fat popcorn- eh.. its ok but not like SEHKS in the mouf. Then.. The pulled pork- it had a hint of spicyness just enough to add a lil ZING. And... The long-haired-cool-tatted-kinda-hot server of mine just made my dining experience all the better. Cant complain, well... only maybe with the couple that sat beside me smooching all the time while I was munching on muh fries.
