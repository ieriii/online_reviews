Yum yum yum!  Oh how I wished this place was open later than 4pm on weekdays! Came here on a Saturday afternoon and waited in line for about an hour. I would definitely tTry to bring a book, magazine, IPhone or interesting company. No matter how fast you think the line is moving, when you finally get to the register, it will be at least an hour wait.  I had the apple chicken sausage with cubes of madeira cheese topped with some type of chutney and my bf had the "Keira Knightly" (like a regular Chicago hot dog but spicy). The hot dogs were a little smaller than I expected especially since mine was around $7 (the "Keira Knightly" was only $2.50) but once I took that first bite I didn't care - I was in hot dog heaven. Every ingredient had such a distinct flavor but all went so well together and I was surprisingly full by the last bite. The "Keira Knightly" was also good but nothing that you can't find at any other hot dog joint. If you're going to wait that long, I would definitely go for one of the specialty hot dogs.  We also got the duck fat fries (only available on Fridays/Saturdays) which was definitely the highlight of our meal! They came out hot and crisp but then melted deliciously in your mouth. Didn't even really need salt, pepper or ketchup. Unbelievably good! Definitely want to try the duck + foie gras dog next time and get my own order of duck fat fries :D TIP: CASH ONLY + get the small soda if you dine in (free refills)!
