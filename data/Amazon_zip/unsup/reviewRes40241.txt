Lol at the reviews complaining about the service here. Okay, I won't disagree with any of them, cuz they're all true! But that's what makes this place so damn funny. It's like you stepped into another world the minute you walk into the door....er, make that try to park your car. That parking lot doesn't make any sense, and god bless you if you try to do it. Anyway, if you make it past the first 10 minutes there if you can stand the smoke, you're in for a real treat. And seriously people, don't waste your time getting mad at the waitresses. I have a strong hunch they don't give a sh*t about what you have to say. They don't speak a lick of english, but they know why you're there, and it won't take much more magic from there to figure it out. The little dishes that come with your entree make this little place what it is. There's too many to list here, but my favorite is the tiny minnow thingys. Sounds gross, but it goes so well with the meat and lettuce wrap thing. You gotta try this place at least once in your life. It might be more entertaining than Disney World.
