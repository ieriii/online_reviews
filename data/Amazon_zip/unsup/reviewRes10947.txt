Perhaps I got lucky, or maybe it was because we went around 1 p.m. Tuesday, but there was no monster wait at The Bongo Room. My party of four immediately was seated, and the service was terrific. I love the Intelligentsia coffee served in big, beautiful mugs. I enjoyed my vegetarian breakfast croissant, loaded with an egg, sprouts, basil mayo, cucumber and other goodies. Surrounding it was a terrific plate of seasoned home fries. Although I understand the prices and quality of the food, I can't consistently afford to spend $15-20 on breakfast. So I'd keep this a special occasion eatery. And I still prefer brunch at Handlebar.
