I used to eat AOP a lot a couple years ago. Anyway, really good deep dish and stuffed pizzas. Thin crust is good as well, but comparatively, not as good as deep or stuffed. But thin is better than most! Thin also is more of a traditional crust thickness rather then thin, thin. Or probably what is considered a chicago thin. Crust - good Sauce - good Mozz - good
