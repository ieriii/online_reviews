I don't get why people would wait for hours at Kuma's Corner when you can get great food and good service at Lockdown. Been here a few times and the food has been really consistent. Burgers are perfectly done (if you want a medium-rare patty, that is what you'll get). My only grouse with the place is that service can sometimes be quite slow (albeit friendly) and the wait for food can sometimes be a while. I'd appreciate a larger range of craft beers on tap as well. The restaurant is what you'd expect. Don't come if you cannot stand loud rock music. My personal favorite is the Bootleg. Basically a burger with kimchi, bacon and a fried egg. Who would expect it, but kimchi actually goes really well with a burger. Their ginger dressing which you can get to go along with your salad is superb too. Half-price burger night (Tuesday) is always a huge draw but they've got daily specials too which are always nice.
