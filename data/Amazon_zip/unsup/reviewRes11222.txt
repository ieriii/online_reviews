I want you to want me... immortal words from the great Cheap Trick, and who knows, maybe Rick new that they would be saying this to his future customers.  I grew up in Cheap Trick's home town, and don't get me wrong, I support the home team like its nobody's business, but I feel like Piece is just trying too hard for me to like them. Of course, the person I went with was on her last night in Chicago, so I let her order whatever she wanted, which would not have been my first choice. The white pizza was okay, definately not the best I've ever had, but I guess it was okay. It took longer then expected to get the pizza, and I think they need to make it clear (on the menu) that the salad is splitable ( thankfully our waitress was able to do that for us). However, that was about all our waitress did, everything else that we needed, seemed like we had to ask someone else to do for us.  As for the beer, it was decent, but it didn't finish as well as I or the friend would have liked.  Rick & Piece, I want to want you, but not sure if I do!
