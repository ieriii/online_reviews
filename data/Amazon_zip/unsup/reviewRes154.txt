It's no coincidence that Alinea has three michelin stars and is the number one restaurant in America. I came here after two long months of anticipation. We had a reservation at 9:30 so we finished our meal around 12:45. Service at first was kind of awkward and the server kept mumbling his words. After they knew that we weren't some uptight twenty year olds, they loosened up and made it a fun time. Although not every course was perfect, probably 19 out of the 22 courses were simply mindblowing. I won't go into detail on the food because I could probably write a five page paper on each dish, but everything was either great to life changing. My favorite dishes were the halibut, black truffle explosion, rabbit rillete-parfait-consomme, hot potato cold potato, wild mushrooms and the mindblowing dessert finale. The two dishes I feel were not perfectly executed was the escoffier inspired dish. It was lamb and it was pretty cold and chewy. I expected it to be hot and melt in your mouth tender, but it seemed like it was sitting out awhile. The venison in the eucalyptus was also not perfect. The venison was pretty overcooked. From pictures I saw, it looked to be cooked medium rare, but mine was rather tough and more cooked medium-well. That being said, they were still pretty great. The service was also spot on and I liked the beer progression. So is it worth it? I think it is absolutely worth it. Although one could not dine there very often, I recommend you at least try it once to see the possibilities of what can be done with food. I would say wherever you come from, Alinea is worth the trip alone. People say it is a once in a lifetime experience, but I am excited to say that I will be back many times in my lifetime. Enjoy.
