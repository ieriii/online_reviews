Established in 1971 as the first Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, this place is, by far, one of the greatest restaurants in the city. Photos of previous waiters and waitresses fill the walls along with other interesting artifacts. There is actually a waitress that has been working there for over 20 years, so if you want some history of the place just ask her. I usually hit this place up about once a week and I have never had a bad meal. The Burgers, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, French Onion soup and HUGE salad bar are among some of the best on the menu. The waiters, waitresses and bartenders are all really friendly and informative. Because of it's popularity, there is almost always a wait (usually shorter than what they say), but hanging out at the bar helps pass the time. There are honestly not many negatives to Grunts If your in the mood for some great American comfort food and laid back atmosphere you should not pass this place up.
