Sun-Wah is simple meat and rice place. Like I duck, chicken, pork, and rice, mixed with the house sauce, which I think is a collection of meat drippings. I love the place though, the dark oak of the tables and the small waitresses is a beautiful thing for some reason. The table next to us ordered the steamed chicken, which looked really wet. Make sure the meat is wet, that way its tasty.
