This place is gorgeous to look at inside; just lovely. My table of 5 shared a bunch of appetizers and entrees (about 10 total) and everything we ate was wonderful. I'd highly suggest this so that you are not limited to one or two items - everything's so good, you'll want to sample many items. You will definitely not be disappointed if you come here. It's an excellent combination of excellent food and a beautiful setting.
