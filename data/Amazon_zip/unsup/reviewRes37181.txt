This place definitely gets more charming after a few beers. And the clientele is very interesting...including the couple whose table we crashed in the bar area...they were funny and nice and the conversation made our hour-long wait for a table fly by. Hopleaf's Pros: Great selection of beers, good solid food, decent service, rustic decor, lively crowd, good energy. Cons: Crowded, they don't take reservations, hour to hour and a half wait on weekends. Lots of beers to choose from (too many!) and I had trouble deciding what to get. I was trying to stay away from my usual stout and go with something different...something Belgium, so I tried the Tripel Karmeleit, which was good but a little lighter than I was expecting. Went back to my oatmeal stout for my next round, needed something heavier to go with the food. Mini fries are addicting and good. Mussels were tasty. Braised beef cheeks--well done and flavorful. Pepper steak was also good. All in all a good experience--I was indeed charmed by Hopleaf.
