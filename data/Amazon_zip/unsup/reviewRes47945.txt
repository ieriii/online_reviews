concidering i am a vegan... i love this place. i know its a meat-on-a-stick kinda place, but they have the wonderful harvest in the middle of the resturant. soups. salads and veggies of all kind. it was delicious. i tell all my clients when they ask me where to go. its also a lovely place to go for drinks  when its nice outside they have the rooftop patio. there is usually a line to get up there since it is so popular. also if you choose to just eat the harvest, its $25 as opposed to about $50 for the meat. try the sangria when u go there. yummy!!
