Carol M. meet large table of really loud old people. And next to that we have a loud generator right outside the window to fix a water line that just broke (not ours). You might want to use your outside voice on this one! Actually this was the case, but our waitress came over w/ the manager immediately and offered to move us to a quieter part of the restaurant. We were almost done with our entree's at this point but they took what we had left....gave us a fresh sizzling hot plate...a new fresh plate of broccoli and a comped round of desserts. SOLD! We didn't even complain about the noise. They did this all on their own accord. Thank you kind kind staff of Ruth's Chris.
