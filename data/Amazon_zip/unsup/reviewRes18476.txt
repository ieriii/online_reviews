I love Mexican food and I love a good sandwich. Enter XOCO, the perfect combination. I have been here a few times and tried many of the tortas. They are all super yummy. The guacamole has a great flavor and the churros con chocolate is to die for! Get your own. Don't split it. Again, trust me on this. The line can be intimidating but, don't fret, it moves quickly and it is worth the wait. The staff also has the seating formula down pat so, you will have a seat when you are ready to eat.
