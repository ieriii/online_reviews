I must declare that im not a big fan of chicago deep dish style pizzas but felt like i had to try a more authentic version before being sure. I got a pepperoni pizza and it wasn't too bad. It took a while to get done and was oozing with cheese when it did. The crust was nice and spongy as i suppose its meant to be. Once again declaring the fact that im not the biggest fan of this style of pizza i have to say that i wasn't that blown away. My friend who is a less fussy seemed to really like it though so maybe you'd like it if you love deep dish.
