Went to coast on the first snowy night of the winter. Outside the weather was no good, you forgot about all of that when stepping inside. Coast is a romantic, dimly lit restaurant with lots of candles. Our server Mark was AWESOME. He was honest with his recommendations and they were all delicious! Yes the white dragon was awesome, and so was his recommendation for a roll that was created years ago for Valentine's Day that they will still make. I forget the name but it has asparagus inside and a tempura scallop on top that you eat with your hand (it looks like a sushi cupcake). He even asked if we wanted a bucket of ice for our 6 pack we brought! I recommend going! Having a full bar would have made me give it a 5 star rating.
