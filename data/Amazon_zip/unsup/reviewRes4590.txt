I really loved this place as evidenced by the amount of food we ordered. I think it was 12 dishes for 4 people, which included the Meat Platter. And we left no dish uncleaned. There are so many things I recommend here - meat platter, truffle goat cheese, octopus (very soft, but without losing the texture), roasted cauliflour with pickles, and the smears. Oh the Smears - basically different combinations of meat/cheese/sauce that you mix up and spread on thick crusty bread... we tried one that was like the most delicious bolognese you ever had, soft tender pork, flavorful chunky tomato sauce, and the creamiest, softest ricotta. It was so delicious. I highly highly recommend the Purple Pig if you are in Chicago.
