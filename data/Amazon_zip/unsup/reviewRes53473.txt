This was great! The tasting menu is the way to go. Comparing it to my gold standard, Alinea, it would get 4.5 stars. The presentation was fun-one dish had dry ice giving an artistic effect. The cheese course was amazing!!! The extra effort for our anniversary was appreciated. They brought us menus with our names and date on it as well as a Happy Anniversary in chocolate and a little cake.
