We checked this place out randomly one evening in Chicago. I'd say I'll be returning for sure. We order 6 different swine dishes, and none were a disappointment. We got brave and attempted the marrow, to say it was interesting is an understatement. It was an adventure for the palette. Huge wine list, and modestly priced. Great cheese list, oh and the swine is amazing as well. Sharing is the motto here at The Purple PIg, so enjoy! What a time you'll have. Will visit again!
