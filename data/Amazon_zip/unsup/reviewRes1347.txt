Oh man, this place is tasty. I love encased meats. This is encased meat heaven! I really enjoy trying all sorts of different exotic meats perfectly paired with rare cheese and tasty sauce/ garnishes. And on a bun? Whoa. I've tried rabbit, antelope, etc... etc... Seriously, this place is genius. The duck fat fries? Wow. Extra flavor and tons of them. However, this place has a lot of downsides. 1. Always a huge half hour line out the door. Why not move to a larger space, or at least have more than one register? 2. Not open for dinner and far away. It's extremely hard to get here in time to eat lunch. With the long line and the drive time to get all the way out there, there's no way it will work unless you get two hours for lunch. 3. Cash only- With sausages costing as much as $9.00, this place should take cards. And there's NO ATM. So if you didn't bring cash you just waited a half hour in line for nothing (happened to me). It seems that Doug knows his food is the best and makes enough to be happy with it. But shouldn't the owner of such a popular restaurant have a social responsibility to make things as easy as possible for the customer? He could be raking in the cash with a large place in Lakeview. I would go there once a week but it's such a pain in the ass.
