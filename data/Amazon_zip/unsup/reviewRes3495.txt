I finally went to crisp after wanting to try this place for awhile. The guy taking my order was so friendly. I was super confused (I am always confused) on how to order the wings with the sauce, and he didn't even get mad at me. I am definitely going back for their wings. Their bowls were OK, but the seoul sassy wings! hmmmmmm! I stole my boyfriend's wings and he was not happy.
