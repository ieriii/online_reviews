Ate there tonight with another couple. More style over substance. The space is beautiful. However, it is very loud. We sat in the corner and could barely hear each other.  The food was ok. The noodle dish was ok. The beef shank was bad.  The service was very bad. We had to wait a long time to be seated. The meal was slow. Just not what you would expect for the price.  You can find just as trendy places elsewhere. You can get just as good or better food most other places.
