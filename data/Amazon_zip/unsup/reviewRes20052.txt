My #1 favorite sushi in the city. So fresh, and so creatively delicious. I always order my staple fresh salmon sashimi, and the unbelievable White Dragon rolls...ohhhhhh those knock my socks off. I heard they are worse for you than a big mac, but I don't care one bit. Love the BYOB factor, not only does it save me a couple bones, but it makes waiting the 45 plus minutes for a table not too crappy. Plenty of people to socialize with, too! Getting a rez is a biotch, so plan ahead, or wait 2 hours. You will still probably wait a half an hour with a rez, btw. Well, well worth it though!
