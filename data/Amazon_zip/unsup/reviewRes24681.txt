I fell in love with Artopolis not just because it's a European-style cafe, but it's a taste of my times in Athens and Thessaloniki. The cafe, the bar, the taverna, and the patisserie, it's like all those little shops you find on the streets rolled into one scenically beautiful venue. My first visit was during the Greektown festival in the summer. It was nice to step away from the crowds and sit with a frappe and some dessert. Their kataifi was the best we ever had, and their bougatsa was very tasty. I loved the venue. The second time was for a last-minute dinner with my girlfriend. We had salad, one of their pizzas, and Greek coffee. It was all light, delicious, and easy on my wallet. I can never get enough of Artopolis. It's like taking that small excursion to Athens, only in the middle of Chicago. I'll have to eventually try their hot food bar.
