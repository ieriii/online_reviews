This restaurant made for a great evening. Our server was very knowledgable on the different menu options and helped us pick out options for a diverse sampler platter to get a great taste for the restaurant's best dishes. The manager was very friendly and had a sense of humor. The honeywine was incredibly sweet. I personally was not a fan, but be sure to try it so you at least know what you are missing (or not missing). The setting is small and intimate. It is in a great location to go out on the town afterwards!
