You go here for a pre-symphony dinner. And for what it is, it is pretty nice. They employ a repetition of ingredients. For example, the halibut was served on a bed of asparagus and topped with an asparagus puree cream sauce. The halibut was light and flaky, although two servings would have made a nice meal. This place actually had a pretty thriving thirty something happy hour scene. A few fancy cocktails. I must admit the old fashioned was pretty good. I need to make it back here to chat up a few honeys.
