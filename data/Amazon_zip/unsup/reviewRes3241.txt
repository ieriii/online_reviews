I've heard about the legend of Crisp for quite some time, but until now, I never knew that it was true. All of it. I made a special trip to go out of my way (I mean, REALLY out of my way) just for a taste. Hell, I would have settled for just a smell. But as luck would have it, I got the whole kitchen. Literally. First of all, the smells coming out of the place were heavenly. I literally tried to grab them out of the air and eat them. Like they were morsels of food dancing around my head in one of those dream bubbles from the cartoons. To my surprise, they had a deal going where you could get a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks for under $20. I nervously ordered the sauces for my chicken (thinking that all of them were going to be heavenly, and how do you choose JUST two?), then picked two sides not really knowing what would come out of my mouth (since I was so delightfully excited for getting that sweet sweet chicken in my stomach.) The friendly gentlemen had our order out to us in less than 10 minutes and the smorgasbord began. I don't really remember the meal much. I think I blacked out from happiness. The last thing I remember is seeing the tray and hearing the Hallelujah chorus in my mind. I think I had a dream about getting married to their chicken on the beach. It was romantic. Everything about the food was fantastic. The meat was fall off the bone, the sauce was incredible and the price was right on point. I would definitely go back here again and rumor has it it's BYOB?? If only I had known!
