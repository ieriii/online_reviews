Typically I don't like to wait 45 min to an hour for my meal at a restaurant, but I knew I had to try the deep dish pizza as that is what they are known for. Alas, it was honestly a rather poor tasting pizza, which I will describe, but that wasn't the only issue with my dining experience. Our drinks where never brought until I reminded our waitress once the food arrived. My boyfriend had received the wrong sandwich (thankfully, they remade it for him, but after waiting an hour it sucked having to wait even longer). I'm a patient person, but everything took such a long long time from waiting to get into the place (even though it was pretty empty once getting in) till having the check brought. The pizza was barely average, the crust particularly awful. Good deep dish crust should be flaky, buttery, crispy, but not hard as a rock? In my head I thought the crust tasted like stale corn bread, and my boyfriend said the same thing! Believe me, it was just not enjoyable. I would not go to Gino's again, there are too many good pizza places in Chicago.
