I love to have a strawberry/banana/pineapple smoothie while waiting for my very generous veggie burger. ..Waitstaff usually great...sometimes you have to wait a little longer than expected...but, worth it.  Brought my husbands 92 year old grandparents here before heading to Dinkel's Bakery, and our server was wonderful! She listened to them and hugged them at the end of the meal while exclaiming how wonderful they had been. Its good to know great places really do exist with people who really do care.
