We went here on a whim and we were pleasantly surprised by this little joint. The decor was interesting but the staff was very attentive and the food was stellar. Their pretzel rolls on which their sandwiches are served were a little sweet and just the right texture and their prices were reasonable. I'd go back here if I was in the neighborhood, for sure!
