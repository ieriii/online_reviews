Diner food, but completely vegetarian. Talk about perfection. The service is very friendly and the food comes out fast.  Every other good review is correct about this place. I have gone there a lot and only ONE time have I had a bad waiter. The good thing is that I haven't seen that person there before or since. Hooray!
