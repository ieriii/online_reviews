This is the most interesting and intellectual meal I've ever had. Everything on the menu was thought provoking and carried the conversation the entire night. While the place is a tad pricey, I think it's worth it because the food is so interesting. Something things were better than others, a few things didn't really work (Italian beef), but it was still good and extremely interesting. My date did a better job at ordering than I did, but I was not disappointed in my meal and would go back every few months if I had the money to do so. The place is hip. The place is cool. And while it might be a tad too Rush Streety, the staff cares and knows what they're talking about.
