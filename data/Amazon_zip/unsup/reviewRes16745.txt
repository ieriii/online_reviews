India House. My friends ordered everything, but all the dishes were pretty familiar as I grew up with Indian nannies. Some curry, chicken tandoori, lentils.  I also ate it with my hands when like all of my nannies, so when I scooped all this saucy, runny stuff (meant to be that way), on to my flat plate, I didn't get how I was supposed to eat it. I managed. That being said, I wasn't super impressed...except for the nan. It was like cheesy Indian garlic bread! It wad ridiculous good and I really wanted to eat THAT all night. Best thing about Indian food...or any Indian restaurant is that if you're a vegetarian there's a ka-billion options. So the "I-House" had that going for it.  I guess a good sign is that were Indian people also eating at this new River North spot. Because of the location they charge up too. Would I go back? No. I'll try Klay Oven next.
