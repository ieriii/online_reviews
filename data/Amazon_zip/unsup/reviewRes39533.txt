Clearly with over 300 yelp reviews, this place has a good reputation and it has something going right. High quality food served with high quality drinks ---- unfortunately at a high-quality price tag... nevertheless, good food. We started with some good craft beers (constantly rotating beer selection, so just pop in and see what's on tap) - prices between $5-$8 a draft beer. The appetizers consisted of a pretzel ($5) that was out of this world delish. Like really, amazing for a pretzel. Sorta crunchy outside, slightly sweet, very warm, fresh, and a perfectly cooked dough inside. Large too for an appetizer (at least at this place where basically they serve small dishes except for entrees).  While the pretzel kicked butt, the scallops were pretty sad for over $7 - just two pieces on a LARGE plate. It made it look even smaller than it already was!!! Tasty, but not for seven-bucks worth and only two pieces.... The burgers are definitely a winner on every angle. Large, fresh brioche buns, nestled with a perfectly cooked (or in my case, under-cooked burger - the way I like it) burger patty. For $12, it is the best bargain on the menu. Comes with amazing beef-fat french fries. Well, tastes simply astounding... but your gut will be needing the gym and some laps for about another 2 months after scarfing down those bad boys! But hey, its good stuff. Overall, Longman & Eagle serves carefully crafted food with a unique flair, and an extensive drink menu. However, be ready to fork over many bills to eat and/or drink here.... for a "budget eater," stay far away...
