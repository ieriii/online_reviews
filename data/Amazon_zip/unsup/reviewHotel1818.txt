If given the option, stay at the JW Marriot directly across the street from the W. That is, if you care about the quality of the gym, the room service options and the room. The W gym (I was there just this morning) is a dingy gross room with VERY OLD equipment. 3 treadmills: This morning one was broken completely, one was locked on chinese language and shook violently when operated and one worked. 2 very old ellipticals, 2 old bikes and 1 weird cardio machine that must have been free b/c no one would ever use it. The guy next to me described the place as a "dungeon" and we both were just disgusted. The JW Marriot, on the other hand, has a gorgeous and clean workout facility. The machines are new and the place is just clean. The W is downright dirty. Oh, and the wipey towels were totally dried out so clearly are never used. The room service menu is very limited. The restaurant is weird and expensive. Bottom line: If you can stay at the JW, you should. The W is a dump.
