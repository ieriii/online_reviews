I went here on a Thursday night with some friends after wanting to go back for a long time. I had come in 2007 or 2008 and really enjoyed myself. Finally I came back! We waited an hour for our table--that's fine, we were able to wait upstairs where there were only about a dozen other people and choose our beers for the night. Once we got our table we pretty much ordered right away. Two of my friends ordered starters and entrees and then myself and my other friend just ordered entrees (I got the duck reuben, the others got mussels, fried onion, ravioli, chicken sandwich or something). The appetizers came out surprisingly fast, but we did not see our waitress or our entrees for another hour. The first thing I (and the rest of the table) noticed was how incredibly burnt my sandwich was. I've never actually returned something in a restaurant, and this was the first time I really wanted to. But I was starving and there was no sign of anyone coming near our table for who knows when. So I ate it. The bread was rock hard and I did scrape a decent amount of the carbon off of it. By the time our waitress finally came back to check on us, we were all done, and ready to get out of there! I took a picture of my sandwich on my phone, but I can't figure out how to upload a photo to the review... is that possible? I'm sure I'll come back, but I'll stick to bar service and try many more of the delicious beers that I didn't get a chance to try!
