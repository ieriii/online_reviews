Before I begin my incredibly glowing review, I'll gloss over the one negative of Hopleaf: the claustrophobia inducing crowds. People are climbing over each other to get a coveted seat in the bar. Of course, there's a reason for this - Hopleaf delivers the goods. First off, this place is Mecca for beer swillers. Hopleaf has hundreds of beers, including at least 30 or so on tap, from every corner of the globe. The vast selection of hard-to-find Belgian brews makes me weep with joy. The prices tend to be on the high side, but we're not talking about Miller Lite, folks - the beers served at Hopleaf are complex, top-quality, and bursting with alcohol content (you are best off leaving the Toyota at home). On top of the encyclopedic beer selection, Hopleaf's food raises bar cuisine to a new level. The mussels, served up in iron pots, swimming in garlic-y broth, served up with crusty bread and heavenly pommes frites, are better than you'll find in a high-falutin French bistro. My most recent meal involved the "CB&J" - a grilled sandwich with cashew butter, fig jam, and morbier cheese. While a bit unusual-sounding, it was an incredible sandwich, and the accompanying stilton macaroni and cheese and (again) those pommes frites put this meal over the top. If you can handle the crowds, you will not be disappointed - this place rocks.
