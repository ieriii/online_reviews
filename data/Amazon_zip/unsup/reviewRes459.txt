This is truly a dining experience. I am very privileged to have been able to go to Alinea and I feel that my time and money was well worth it. My bf and I did the full 24 course and man was it a lot of food. For those of you who say you are still hungry after, you must have the biggest stomachs ever! I seriously almost could not finish the last 4 courses, but of course I made myself finish because I wanted to try everything and obviously get my money's worth! I would recommend doing the wine pairings. There is nothing better than having great food complimented by an even better wine. I feel that the experience is heightened ten fold. I was very concerned that the place was going to be snooty. It definitely has an aura about it, but I didn't feel out of place there. Everyone around us seemed to be having a good time and you didn't feel like you had to whisper. There were even 2 children next to us about ages 11 and 13 who were on their best behavior but seemed to be having a great time. I guess kids aren't normal there, but it was great to see that people feel comfortable enough to bring them. The whole experience was truly mesmerizing. I would want to come back, but it's hard to say when and if I will ever do it. Maybe for a very special evening out. The price really puts a damper on the repeated visits, but I definitely think that if you enjoy food, wine and ambiance, then you need to come here at least once. *They have recently raised their prices, which is a bummer. **I've added a few pictures of some of the courses.
