I have been to Revolution three times since it opened. The first time was the best and the next two times got worse and both times it got worse because of the service.  I attribute this to growing pains and so many articles praising the brews and food. Perhaps it fixable but I cannot recommend going now. We called ahead for a party of 5. "what's the wait?" "30 minutes". We arrive. "40 minutes". 1 hour and 20 minutes later.... "Sorry, the two tables with enough room are just hanging out and won't leave." Um, no free round of drinks? How about some coupons for another visit... or frankly, just be better at apologizing. It's true that the beer is tasty and I did like the IPA Greyhound I tried while waiting. I assume the food on the menu is as good as before, but alas I did not have a chance to try it last time. I specifically labeled a few of the recent reviews on Yelp as helpful if they mentioned the service and/or the staff as being disappointing because it's a real problem currently. I should also mention that I am about to move to Boston this fall, and am going through my Chicago "bucket list". Revolution was on it, and now, I will not ever go back. Sorry :(
