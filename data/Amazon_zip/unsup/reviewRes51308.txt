The upsides: it's open late, the margarita pitchers are cheap, and Garcia's is centrally located to everything else in the square. It's the perfect place for a quick bite and a lot of drinks with a group of friends. The downsides: Everything I've had here has been sub-par, or torn up my stomach for hours. I've also seen a few drunken fights break out here... but maybe that should go in the upsides category. Dinner and a show!
