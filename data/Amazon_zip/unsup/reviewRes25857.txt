Came here on Sunday for their tasting menu, showed up with no reservation at noon for 2 and was seated quickly as the place was rather empty. The menu is comprised of ~8 tasting dishes plus the carving station (suckling pig), charcuterie table (3 cheese, 3 meats) and 'bottomless' dessert table (nothing extraordinary).  The served dishes themselves are remarkable - the bacon-wrapped dates with almonds, which i've had before elsewhere were out of this world. Heated to just the right temperature and served over a light salad with blue cheese dressing.  Other courses included mussels, buckwheat pancakes, poached eggs... all very flavorful and tasty. Portions on the smaller side. Decor is rather bland but I could imagine the place lights up better at night.
