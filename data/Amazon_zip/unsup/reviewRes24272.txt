This is one of the best places for a unique breakfast in Chicago. The Gallo Pinto, a traditional Costa Rican breakfast is the best! Tortillas, black beans, rice - get it with both plantains and eggs. It's so delicious. Add to that an avena (oatmeal) banana shake (just try it!) - Heaven! My only warning, wait a half an hour after the posted opening time to show up. They're on their own schedule and are never ready on time.
