Leave your disdain for corporate-chains at the door. YES, Grand Lux is a subsidiary of The Cheesecake Factory, so like The Cheesecake Factory - the food is delicious, with adequate, uniform execution. And, like its Mag Mile neighbor, The Cheesecake Factory, it's a bit touristy. I think that based on those premises, many Chicagoans may over-look what would be a truly satisfying meal. Seriously, the BEST buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had - and I've explored A LOT of buff chick sammiches (local spots included). BBQ chicken pizza is rich and delicious, with an endearing smokey, earthy aroma - a la' southern BBQ joints (or pseudo southern joints - e.g. Smoke Daddy). Easily falls within the top 5 flauntas I've ever had - including southwest chicken, and vegetarian potato. Service = fast and attentive; they clearly take personality into significant consideration, in hiring servers. Portions = take home meal Prices = not high at all - for the area, quality, and portions of food. There is ample opportunity for people-watching via the glass walls of this above street-level, large facility (and easy to get a window-seat). LIKE.
