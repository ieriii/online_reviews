I will revisit this restaurant and my rating another time, but my first experience was disappointing. It makes me sad, too, because I had heard nothing but awesome reviews. I wonder if it's another victim to Andersonville's restaurant scene - a burst of popularity in a trendy neighborhood, and then forgets all attention to detail. We walked in on a Wednesday at 9pm to get a glass of wine and an appetizer on the patio. The manager, who was acting as host, hesitated about whether he wanted to give us a coveted table on the patio. There were three open, it was 9pm, it was a Wednesday. I ordered the only rose on the menu. They were out. My friend ordered an appetizer. They were out. No apology, no second recommendation, no nothing. Our bumbling server dropped off our wines, came back once to see if we wanted to order any other food, and then dropped the check. I put cash in the check presenter, and accidentally put my elbow on the presenter (I still left 20%). He came back and actually took the check out from under my elbow without as much as an excuse me. On our way out, we were able to see the manager eating at the bar, and then the bartender coming out from behind the bar and the busser out from inside the kitchen both cut us off.  I know it's a popular restaurant with delicious food (allegedly), but attention to detail is the lifeblood of sustainability in a restaurant. I certainly hope it improves.
