Maybe I had romanticized their rooftop a little too much given all the good things I had been hearing about it, but this place wasn't all that great! The rooftop itself was nice, but too crowded and no space to stand and experience the feeling of being on a rooftop. All the area was used up to build seating, which is enclosed to the point of taking away from any sense of being out in the open air. There was absolutely to wait staff around to help! The music was either non-existent or inaudible. The bar downstairs was spacious, but even on a Friday night wasn't busy at all. The wait staff again was a rare sight.
