All you smell is butter when the dishes are brought out, YUMM. I've visited this place on two separate occasions. Their stuffed chicken breast is to die for (salivating). I have also had there fillet Mignon which is tender, rich and mouthwatering down to the last bite. There mashed potatoes are good. I tasted their corn pudding and it was to die for- And I don't even like corn pudding. The only recommendation that I would have to suggest is that they have better desserts to choose from but after you chow down on the bread, appetizer, and entree you really won't have enough room for dessert anyway. But I highly recommend!
