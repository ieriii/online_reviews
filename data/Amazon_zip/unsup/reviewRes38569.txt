This was my first Chicago meal. We had the ten inch special with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions. Waiter tells us it'll be 20 min, so we start off with a cannoli. It comes out sprinkled with green specks of chocolate. The core is crunchy and the filling is just perfect-no hint of cheese scent and mildly sweet. Delicious way to start off the meal. The pizza arrives looking like a bowl of tomato soup. One bite into and I was filled with cheese and sparks of veggies, so much cheese. Not bad for a chicago deep dish pizza. Crunch solid crush holding the fillings intact. The ten inch supposedly serves one to two people and I can't imagine one person finishing the whole thing. For two grown gals we could barely finish one slice with the cheese expanding our tummies. :o)
