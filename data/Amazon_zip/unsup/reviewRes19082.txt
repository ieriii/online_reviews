Let me start off by saying i'm more of a chicken than burger person. That being said, I ordered the rosemary chicken. The rosemary was good, just too overwhelming. The fries were forgettable, not bad, not good. They had a very large beer list which is good, but since I'm more of a PBR fan myself, it made no difference. It had that snobby, hipster vibe that lincoln avenue seems to have that I don't really care for. Now if you really want a good burger in the area, Head down to the Lincoln diner and get a burger and wafflefries, so good.
