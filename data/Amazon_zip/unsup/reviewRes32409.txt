The service here is generally good, but it is always crowded and the food just isn't that good. All the tempeh and soy items are over seasoned to compensate for bad textures or bland veggie combos. You would do well just to get a juice or a salad. I always have to come here because one of my buds is vegan. I suppose they do really well because there aren't that many sit down veg restaurants with good atmosphere. The decor is cute, though.
