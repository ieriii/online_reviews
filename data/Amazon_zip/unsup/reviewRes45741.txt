I've been here a couple of times - brunch, happy hour and dinner. All were very good. the highlight of brunch was the perfectly spiced bloody mary. Their fish and chips were perfect, and you can order them in an appetizer size. At dinner - we had shepards pie, macaroni and cheese and the steak sandwich at the table and they were all good. I love the way the pub looks inside - it's huge, decorated with dark wood, and even has a small library. There's a couple of TVs, too. It is a little more expensive than some of the other options on the street, but it's a solid choice.
