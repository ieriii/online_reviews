If I could select no stars I would. This place is WHACK!!!! I'm sorry, let me qualify my statement. This place is WHACK if you go on the weekend, and you're hungry, and it's cold outside, and you like to have a little elbow room to eat your meal, and you like to have a server actually cares if you enjoyed your food. The food is okay but not worth going for all the details that make this place unbearable. I think the only people who really enjoy the Bongo Room are people who believe in their coolness so much that they would wear flip-flops on a cold day with a scarf and winter coat. What the mess??!!!
