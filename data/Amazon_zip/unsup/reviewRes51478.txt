We came for a late night snack, with a large group and we were seated rather quickly, As a side note this place is pretty deep with plenty of seating. On the verge of being a three stars but not quite there for the reasons below. However, I'll admit that I'll more then likely give this place a second chance. So what went wrong this time. Well it definitely wasn't the menu selection or the price. Which is very extensive and relatively cheap for most of the items. My issue was with my torta. The bread was so so and needed to be toasted a bit more. It was to soft and almost soggy. The chorizo was little soggy as well and could have been a little more crispy as well. So why would I go again, well service was good and quick, salsa and chips were excellent and they had a good menu to choose from so why not a second chance.
