Went on a Monday night at 9ish w/a friend. It was very crowded and lively but we were seated immediately at a private table. Service was a tad slow getting started and we needed on several occasions to flag our busy server as the night went on. She also was not very well versed in wine terminology and had trouble recommending a suitable wine. Those were the only negative issues and were not major problems. The food was very fresh and creative and came out extremely quickly in good-sized portions for the price. The wine was also well priced especially for Michigan Ave. The salami panini was a standout -- it was actually two sandwiches. We also enjoyed the shaved asparagus, rock shrimp with peas, lardon crostini and chocolate soft serve with hazelnuts. All but the crostini were hits; the crostini was just bread smeared with bacon grease and a tad of bacon fat. Not bad, but not great...and probably not worth the fat and calories. Overall I highly recommend this spot and will definitely go back.
