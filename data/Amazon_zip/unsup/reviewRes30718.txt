I love meat. I enjoy eating animals and I will continue eating animals until the day I die. I will be eating a bacon cheeseburger as they perform my triple bypass. That being said, I was skeptical of this place, but after returning a few times I quite enjoy it. Yes, it is "fake" meat, but I think it works well with the dishes they serve. Their vegan desserts, I have to say, are very tasty. Service has always been great for me. They have been friendly even in their busiest times.  The place can get frustratingly crowded. I would not recommend going with a party of four or more. It's small place with seating arrangements designed for 2 or 4. I went with a party of 3 and it was like trying to fit square peg into a brick wall.
