First off this is the one place I've been to in Chicago that takes time in the presentation of the sushi. (BAD example of BAD sushi which is so over rated is Sushi Samba)  I put some photos on here so you could see some sushi rolls. (Don't let the first photo on here of the dining room make you not go. They have redone the restaurant since then and it's very classy and cute.) This is a hidden gem on Broadway. And yes, it's not in the best of areas though. First off. The crab Ragoon is probably the best I've ever had. It's not too "fried" and greasy and it's not just simply cream cheese overload it's got great flavor to it.  So if you're a fan of the crab Ragoon get it here! I promise you won't be disappointed. Out of all the sushi places I frequent (Which is many I might add) Indie Cafe were not only open on Sunday afternoon,--they had lunch specials as well! (Till 3 pm.) The Las Vegas roll was incredible and the sashimi piece of tuna I had was very fresh. Very friendly and nice waitstaff. Also the dessert we had, one was a mango cheesecake the other a passion fruit creme tarte was also wonderful.  I would recommend this place to anyone!
