Art of Pizza has the best pizza I have tasted in Chicago. They have what they call "stuffed pizza". Its basically deep dish only 1000 times better. The thin crust is great as well but I strongly recommend the stuffed pizza. They have pizza by the slice and whole pizzas as well. I am a frequent visitor. I usually order a stuffed sausage or their stuffed "special".
