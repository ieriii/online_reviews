Coast is my favorite sushi place in Chicago. Great atmosphere, for being a sushi place in the Midwest the sushi is great, and it's very reasonably priced mostly due to the fact it's BYOB. Definitely try the Maine roll if you like lobster. Always get reservations, they say they leave half the restaurant open for walk ins but I don't believe that having been there several times. Anytime I've tried to make reservations for more than 5 people it's been difficult, but it's a perfect place for you and a date for a small group of four. Anyhow I've never been disappointed and am looking forward to going back sometime soon.
