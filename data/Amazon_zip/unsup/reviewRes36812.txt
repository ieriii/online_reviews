Came in here for breakfast the other day and ordered an omelet with bagel and hashbrowns, and everything was delicious. I had the boursin cheese eggs and they were so freakin good. I made them the next day at my place, because according to me everything should be made with boursin now. I like how they have fresh squeezed Orange juice too.
