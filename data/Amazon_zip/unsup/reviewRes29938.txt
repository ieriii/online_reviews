In town for business, and this was our last shot to try Frontera -- the gf is a huge fan. The seating area had a 45 min wait -- seriously? Luckily, a bar table was open and we swooped in. So we'd eaten 6 times in the last 24 hours, so not too hungry, so we got the "must." Which is the enchilada da mole. Very smooth, smokey, with a little bit of kick. By the sauce alone you can tell why there's the wait for the place, and why his "quick service" XOCO next door, had people out the door. The sopes was good also, but not as special as the enchilada. Topped off with a bit of tamarind cerveza and some other seasonal, mint margarita.... happy.
