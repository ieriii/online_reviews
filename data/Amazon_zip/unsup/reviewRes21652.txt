Mmm this place is good. I always like my food. I'd recommend sitting inside as opposed to on the 'patio.' I felt like I was sitting in someones garage at a high school graduation party out there. Not only that but the service was terrible too. And I think they just raised their prices. Still, I've been there a bunch and overall the experience has usually been really good so they get four gold stars.
