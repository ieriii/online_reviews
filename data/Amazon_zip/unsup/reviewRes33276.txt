Darn, I forgot to bring my lunch to the office so hence my need to go out for some grub. Thank goodness Sultan's recession proof pricing fits the bill. Good prices, fast service and pretty good grub equals good times at Sultans! Colleen C. tempted me with her review on having a falafel sandwich there. So I had to try it myself and yeah it was very good as advertised and nicely priced at about 3.75. I added some bottled water and a piece of baklava and it all came out to about $6 bucks. Not too bad and I left satisfied which after all is the desired result, no? I had the shawerma dinners before and they were very good too but make no mistake - the falafels and other veggie options are a big draw to this place. No wonder why there are over 300+ reviews. I just wished this place was closer to me but it's worth the trip!
