I have been here a handful of times. I think this place is really good if you want to hang with your girls after work, get hit on, or drink a few too many martinis.   The decor is lovely and the service is good. As for the food, it's pricey. Fifteen bucks for fish and chips? You kidding, Gage? I've had it and its not worth it. Nothing I've ever eaten here stands out for me.   On a side note, I am not crazy about the fact that you have to walk downstairs to use the restrooms, but that is because I have bad knees and a bum right foot and still have not given up high heel shoes.
