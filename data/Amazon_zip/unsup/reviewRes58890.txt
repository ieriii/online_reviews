Overall I was impressed with Sunda. It has a great atmosphere, location, and I thought the food was awesome. A bit pricey, but I think it's pretty fair for what you get. A good place for groups or special occasions. The loompya, crap cake crusted ahi tuna, the dry braised string beans, and the dessert called "ridiculous" were all delicious. I will come back for sure!
