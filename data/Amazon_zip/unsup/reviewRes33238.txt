We visited here last summer during a cross-country spree. This was my first time eating sarmales and ciorba, and they were good (but obvs never as good as the full-blown Romanian mom experience which I had over the holidays). The saganaki was happily cheesy, and the sausage stuffed chicken breast was delicious but could have served four and not just me. :) I strongly recommend having the tuica. Too bad we couldn't stay for the club part of the evening! It's not a terribly chic place, think more of a place you'd go nuts with the Gogol Bordello band. Which is a good thing! The owner kindly gave us a bottle of apa minerale to go. Mulumesc!
