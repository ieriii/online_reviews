Went here for a co-worker's birthday. To say this place is full of itself would be an understatement. People are asked to wait behind a heavy curtain until other people leave, but since my group was already there I didn't have to go through the ritual. This did raise the ire of the people waiting who made numerous comments. Strangely though once inside I noticed several open spots at the bar and at least one empty table. Velvet rope mentality indeed. I was warned that in the interest of "finely crafting" their drinks it takes a really long time to get your drinks, and the staff didn't disappoint. At one point it was so long that we were trying to remember if the waitress even took our order. After being unimpressed with a couple of their signature drinks I opted for a good old vodka tonic, and you would think I was trying to order a white castle burger at Mortons. The look the waitress gave me was of utter contempt, and after staring at me a couple of seconds I broke her stare by asking if the bartender knew how to make one. She got the point. Drink still took forever to get though, not sure how much crafting is involved in this super simple drink.
