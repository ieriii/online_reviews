I went on a Sunday at 11:45am and never got a chanceTo step inside the restaurant as the snooty blondeMaitre'd stopped me at the door and asked if I had aReservation. I did not and was told it would be an hourOr more wait. I was with my infant son in his baby stroller.Then she said in a condescending tone we don't allow strollers, so you are going to have to do something aboutthat (the stroller). Needless to say I left and took my patronage to Fork restaurant in Lincoln Square which to my delightWas very baby and stroller friendly.Note to families with babies and strollers, take your Business elsewhere as Glenn's Diner does notWelcome you.
