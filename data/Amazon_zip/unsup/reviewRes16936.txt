Fun atmosphere. If you are looking for a swanky up-beat Latin restaurant... this is for you. The guacamole was great. Drinks were good but the serving sizes were kiddie-sized (we recommend the white Sangria). The dining area is vibrant and full of culture. The bar area attracts the after work crowd that I could do without (two very different atmospheres). Be sure to make a reservation.
