I always wanted to go to Le Colonial and I finally went this weekend! It is the PERFECT place for a romantic date, especially the upstairs. The downstairs is a little tight for space, but upstairs, you are surrounded by plants and it is dark with just the right mood lighting. And the cocktails are fabulous--I had the "passion" drink! My chicken was really good, too! However, the best part about this place is the mood it gives off--secretive, sensual and romantic! And you can't resist wanting to nuzzle on your date if you go upstairs! Can't wait to go back!
