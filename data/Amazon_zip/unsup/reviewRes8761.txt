In a town that has more than its fair share of good pizza, this place really stands out. The service is great. If you're forced to wait for a spell, they might bring out a taste of prosecco. At our last dinner there, they came around with complimentary cannoli around dessert time. The Neapolitan pizza is a huge winner. True to form, with a number of different combos. I would put it up against any other thin crust pizza I've had in Chicago. I also like that they don't seriously mark up glasses of wine here. I had a Nero d'Avola that was only $5.50 a glass. Some other places would want to charge me $10, I imagine.
