Not recommended Tang Noodle. There are lot good restaurants like Triple 7, and Silver Seafood. I went to Tang Noodle on 4953 N Broadway Last month with some of my friends.  We had very bad experience. The room was so crowded, and people next you kept knocking your back.  It was noise and smelling.  The smell of the food stained my cloth even my under shirt.  They put two tiny tables together for five of us. We ordered hot pot, and there were no place to put the food and hot pot.  We asked the manger if we could get a big table. The manager was very rude, and he switched our table with a dirty look. They brought out a plate of seafood, a plate of glass noodle, a plate of veggies, and a plate of sliced meet.  There were no special sources for the hot pot.  We spent over $90 for five people, but none of us had enough food. It was because we ate too much. The portion was very small. When the manager gave us the bill, and I noticed that he had already added 17% tips in the bill. We felt that the service was so bad, and they didn't deserve the 17% tips.
