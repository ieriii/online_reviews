Visited pevious location and think its as good as ever. Great place to get a variety of tastes and will work if you have family that likes varying degrees of heat. Have stopped often while in Chinatown and always like to try something different. Would lik to get a little more adventurous wih some items, but will get there. Have recommended to people in for conventions and they love its close y and not the typical fare they have when in Chicago.
