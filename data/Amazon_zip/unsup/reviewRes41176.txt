Although I have my sources (my friend's parents) for good homemade Vietnamese food, I don't think they would appreciate me randomly dropping in at 9 PM expecting them to cook a good meal. This is where Tank comes in. Located at the corner of Broadway and Argyle, it is easy to find, and if you are not that adventurous when it comes to food, this may be the best choice to start before exploring the rest of Argyle. Having said this, Tank offers a variety of dishes, ranging from pho, to various rice and noodle dishes. But for most people, the starting point for their Vietnamese experience is pho. And because pho is quick, cheap, and filling, it is a regular meal as well. I've tried other dishes as well, but I will always come back to the pho. Think of pho as everything you need for a filling meal, served in a boiling bowl of stew. Meat, veggies, noodles, spices, and garnishments all floating around, releasing their individual flavors into the broth. You can kick things up more than a few notches by throwing hot peppers or hot sauce into the mix, or dipping your meat into a mixture of hoisin and hot sauce in a seperate dish. Either way works. Combine this with egg rolls or spring rolls, and you can easily fill yourself up for a couple of hours. Although I have tasted better pho elsewhere, Tank's pho has a good price/size ratio, and you can't complain with that. Some tips should you go- This place can get really crowded on some nights. With two entrances, one on Broadway, one on Argyle, this means two lines can and do form. The service can be lax, but I've endured worse in Chinatown. Pros: Easily found, lots of seating, prices are reasonable, long hours, and most important, pho is tasty. Cons: Gets crowded fast, service is lax, street parking can be hard to find during the day. To sum it up: A good starting point for exploring the food aspect of Argyle, as well as a good standby once you get to know the menu.
