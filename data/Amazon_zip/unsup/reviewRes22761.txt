Oh man was this place good. And we definitely left in a serious food coma. I can't remember a time that I have been that full! I had an amazing vegetarian burrito.. chip and some delicious guac.. and topped it all off with an oatmeal shake. I have to say I was a little weary about the oatmeal shake.. but I had heard so many good things I had to try it... I am so glad I did! I can't wait to go back and have it again. But maybe this time I will limit my intake and try an prevent another food coma episode!
