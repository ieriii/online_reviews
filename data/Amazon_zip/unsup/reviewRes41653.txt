I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! The space itself is small and modest, but the lighting and decor make for a nice ambiance.  My concern was not getting enough food, but as it turned out, I had just enough. We ordered the 4 course menu and were served 5 courses, 4 of which were excellent! The main course, smoked pork shoulder, is the first that comes to mind. It was delectable! The pork was carmelized and had a rich smokey flavor. I also loved the scallop gratin that was a "bonus" dish. It was indulgent with a rich buttery flavor, and the scallop pieces were very good! Most courses had a subtle kick to them which was much appreciated. The only dish I was disappointed by was the first course - a "salad" consisting of about 3 frisee leaves, a few paper-thin slices of beet garnished with anchovies (no thanks), pumpkin slivers, some strange fennel thyme mousse, and two escargot (super delicious!). I would return, though it's a bit pricey without the Groupon and the service was slow. The BYOB factor helps alot!
