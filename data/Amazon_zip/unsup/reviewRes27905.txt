I was so so disappointed when I got tried Pequod's for the first time this week. I was really craving cheesy deep dish pizza that was new to me so I came on yelp and saw all the great reviews. The pizza was delivered and got here fast enough. I don't like that the pizza is basically all crust. Most deep dishes have a good percentage of topping and crust. But my pizza wa 90% crust...yuck!! I was just very disappointed and won't be ordering from here again!!
