Food was very tasty. The fried pork egg roll appetizer was the high light. However, service was poor. Our server seemed to rush us to order returning to the table about every minute to see if we were ready; despite indicating that it was our first time and we wanted to look at the menu for a bit. The server stared off into space at an empty table on several occasions while i attempted to get his attention for needed things. He also stood over me while I signed my credit card receipt. Overall: Food is good. Service is Poor. Atmosphere is nice.
