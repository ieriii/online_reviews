This is one of the most amazing Korean BBQ's I have ever eaten at, in Chicago! I love their kim-chee. I also love the BBQ set up with the little cauldron, the aesthetic really completes the mood. This place is exceptional especially because of the service - it's the first and only Korean BBQ I've been to that I didn't feel like they were a front for some sinister mob operation ;)
