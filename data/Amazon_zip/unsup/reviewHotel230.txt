We stayed at the Hotel Indigo during our first visit to Chicago (7/6-7/10/09). The location was very close to the upscale shopping of Michigan Ave and the John Hancock Observatory. And much to my surprise, it was a short walk to the beach area located near the Drake Hotel. I enjoyed the neighborhood feel of this hotel. I didn't feel like I was really in the city. The rooms were very spacious and had lots of natural light. The hotel decor gives it a beachy feel. The beds were very comfortable and the common areas were kept clean. I believe this hotel accepts pets as the room next to us had a dog. My only gripe is the lack of "cheap eats" in the area. I used yelp a couple of times and found a great breakfast spot not too far from the hotel you have to check out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/. Other than that, you won't really find any ethnic foods, especially the kind I'm used to living in the SF area. I would definitely recommend staying at the Hotel Indigo for your first visit to Chicago!
