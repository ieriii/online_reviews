Last year, I did a pho quest to a whole slew of Vietnamese restaurants after the multiple flus I got (three times, betches). In LA, this one pho in Silverlake was one of my miracle cures when I was coming down with something, so this was a quest to better prepare myself for these dire emergencies. One place had a good broth, but lacked the rare meats and tendon I really like...and the spicy condiments that cleared the sinuses. Another handful of restos just didn't cut it in terms of broth. But at Tank? Hands down the best pho in Chicago. I judge this on broth and variety of meat combinations. Everything you'd want to embellish your pho can be found here, but you really don't need to squirt so much hoisin sauce since that broth needs no backup. Super delicious, uber healthy - it's become a regular spot for family and friends.
