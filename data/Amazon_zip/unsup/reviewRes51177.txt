I so wanted to like Wishbone, but it was just okay. Blackened chicken was bland and crawfish cakes were okay-- kind of a lot of filler. The shrimp and grits were delish, but almost a little too rich. Mad props for the mac and cheese and cornbread. The collards are pretty good too. Dixie Kitchen and Heaven on Seven are still tops in my book!
