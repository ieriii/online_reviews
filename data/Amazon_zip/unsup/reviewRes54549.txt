Cashier generally wears swish pants. Hip-hop lord on the prep line is always rapping about having money, but the dude works at Sultan's Market. Delivery team is full of post-grads with ironic beards and ugly, yet expensive track bikes. Food is delicious and cheap. The old lady is kind yet crazy and takes 7 minutes to pull a single dollar out of an open cash register.
