The place is great.  We were fortunate to get a table for 7 outside on a beautiful night. It's BYO, and having planned accordingly, we had a great dinner, lots of very good food, and still didn't spend too much since we supplied our own wine.  Definitely check this place out, and ask the wait staff for recommendations. Our waiter suggested a few items that were all great choices.
