Eclectic Spanish/Latin. We had a nice selection of Spanish hams and cheeses--the hams were excellent. Appetizers were good, the beef and chicken empanadas were good, the guacamole was very good. Main course was a very nice roasted bass for me. Everyone enjoyed their meals, the mojitos were fine, and the atmosphere was noisy but fun.
