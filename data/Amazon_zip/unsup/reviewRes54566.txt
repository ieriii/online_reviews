sultans is always yummy and in the summer there is a nice little patio. yeah, ofcoarse the pan fried options, like falafel are the best! but, the salad bar stands on its own as a healthier option. they also deliver, which is cool. the only complaint i have is for some reason they got rid of their orangina, and for that reason alone i had to dock a star. there is something so right about the orangina and falafel combination.
