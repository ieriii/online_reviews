This Restaurant is more that a 5 star. It is simple one wonderfulplace to entertain clients or just simply hang out with friends for drinks. If that isn't enough try the Winter Delight Menu which givesyou a 3 course menu for $20 bucks. How great is that? If you arethinking of larger parties they even have a private dining experienceand work with you to set up all your food selections for the evening!It's as if you have a country club membership without the fees. Go Dine! You will love it!
