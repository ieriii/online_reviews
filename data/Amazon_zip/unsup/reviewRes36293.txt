This little gem of a place has become my absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago. The food, whether Japanese or Thai, is consistently, inventively wonderful. Highlights include the crab rangoon or thai samosas as a starter, any of the specialty rolls in the sushi menu (Summer Passion & Sex on the Moon are both particularly good), or the Indie Signature curry with pot roasted beef. Their Pad Thai, always a good indicator for any Thai restaurant, is also to die for. And, if you're in the mood for a cocktail, their special martinis (lychee, ginger, cucumber, etc.) are all delicious. Every time I introduce someone new to this place, they can't believe they haven't found it before, and they keep coming back. GO HERE.
