I was in LOVE after my first bite. After a 40 mins. of anticipation and many stomach rumblings... there it was... a stuffed sausage pizza with fresh garlic on top. A small pizza fed two hungry tourist with much left to spare. I'm willing to say this is my personal favorite Chicago style pizza I've had ANYWHERE. Come with an appetite leave completely stuffed. Don't be discouraged by the 40 min. wait for the pizza to cook, its worth every second of it.
