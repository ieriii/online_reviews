I came here with the Windy City Pizza Club and I loved it! We sat in "the pit" which is a great area for bigger parties. I shared a medium white pizza with spinach and artichoke hearts with a friend and thought it was delicious. It was really big but I was glad for some left overs to take home! It tasted great with their beer as well! The waitress was really nice too. Overall a great experience! I can't wait for the next pizza place the club goes too!
