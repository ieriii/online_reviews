The pizza was great. But if you've read anything about this place, you already know that. So allow me to talk about the desserts... We had TWO - the Panna Cotta and the Nutella Calzone. Holy crap, they were both insane. They brought the Panna Cotta first - it was the perfect texture, perfect flavor, drizzled with some kind of balsamic reduction and raspberry something. Who cares what it was, it was delicious and so light I could have eaten 17 servings. I licked the plate. Don't judge me. Then they brought out the Nutella Calzone...basically they take their pizza dough, spread it with the chocolatey hazelnut goodness and fold it in half. Theoretically you could make it yourself with a Boboli pizza crust and some Nutella. But your version would be a waste of calories so forget about it. This thing was huge and delicious - I had to hold myself back from swallowing it whole. In a completely uncharacteristic show of restraint, I saved a sliver for leftovers the next day. And I'm happy to report that it was amazing on the re-heat. So order it even if you are already full from the incredible pizza. You will thank me.  Did I mention that the desserts were like $5 each or something? Deal of the century!
