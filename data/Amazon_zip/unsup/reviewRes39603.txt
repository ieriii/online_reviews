L&E Highlights: - Pork belly BLT. - Wild boar sloppy joe. - Whiskey cocktails. - Inn upstairs. - Michelin star. Very rich, but so very worth it for a special occasion. On our first visit last summer, it seemed mostly like a local crowd from the neighborhood. That's definitely changed (see: NYT Dining & Wine section over the last 6 months). But it's still very Logan Square at heart.
