Despite the long wait to get a table, it was well worth it as this restaurant does not disappoint! The dishes are complex blends of different flavors and textures that combine to form a beautiful plate. Gf and I had guac and chips, enchiladas and a mole dish with a side of rice that might have been the best Mexican food we've ever had. Also, got the treat of being seated 2 tables away from Mr. Bayless himself!
