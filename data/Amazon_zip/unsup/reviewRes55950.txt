Great BYOB Italian food! Warm environment that is nice for a date or small group of friends. The service is a little speedy and they do not go out of their way to be overly attentive or friendly. Be prepared for a big plate of yummy pasta with lots of sauce that is just as good the next day for lunch at home.
