YOU DON'T NEED TO GET TWO CREPES! As long as you know that, this is a 5 star experience.  The waitress told my friend and me that the crepes were made smaller to encourage mixing flavors, and I heard her tell a few other tables the same, but seriously- these crepes are equally filling as before but maybe they've been folded smaller. All I know is, they fill me up hard core, and when presented with two, they are too delicious not to consume entirely.  I had the Marrekech? which had olive tampanade, cream cheese, mint, and a ton of deliciousness inside. I genuinely don't like olives but the blend was so perfect with everything else inside I wouldn't recommend eliminating it for other olive nay-sayers. Trust the combo! I also had the Salim? which was just honey walnuts and pineapple. Holy mother. The pineapple was so fresh! In December! How is that possible? It's a great dessert crepe to split with someone else.
