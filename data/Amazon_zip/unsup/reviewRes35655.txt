It's been forever since I have written a review and what a place to reboot my reviews! Sun Wah is both delicious and engaging with it's deep traditions.. One tradition the peking duck is one I wish I tried sooner! We had the duck dinner which was so much food that a table of four brought home leftovers. The duck that was carved at the table, soup, duck fried rice.. It was all simply amazing! One of my new favorites! The only weird side note is the corkage charge for byob, it's $1 per beer. But we found if we cleared our own bottles in the bag we brought they only charged us a dollar per person.
