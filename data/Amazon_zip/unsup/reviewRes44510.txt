A small little bakery that makes a ton of food. The front window alone will keep your attention for a few minutes as you gaze over the latest cakes that have been created. With my most recent visit there was a giant hamburger cake, an edible six pack of beer (each can was a little cupcake), and a giant towering cake with each layer looking like a giant strawberry with chocolate drizzling down. Once inside there are plenty of items to try. I went with the cinnamon roll and my fiancee the red velvet cupcake. Both were very good with a nice chewiness on the roll and a moistness on the cupcake. I look forward to going again and again and again.
