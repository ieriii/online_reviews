Allow me to preface this review with the fact that prior to my visit to Demera, I had never enjoyed Ethiopian cuisine. I was also extremely weary of how my brother-in-law described the process as "communal eating without utensils". I'm a fairly 'traditional' silverware guy.  Having said that, my experience at Demera was superb. We were a fairly large group and decided to order a meat messob for two (six choices) and a vegetarian messob for two (six choices).  I can't recall all of the dishes that we chose, but I can remember the Quosta (chopped spinach cooked with onions, garlic and ginger) & the Ye-siga wot (beef stewed with berbere sauce, flavored with onions, garlic and ginger root) standing out as my favorites.  Demera also offers a couple Ethiopian beers among twenty-or-so other imports and domestics. The Bedele (Ethiopian) was a solid Pilsener.  The service was good. I don't believe my ice water ever passed below the half full threshold and our waitress was patient and polite.  If you are like me and either have never been to Demera or haven't ever had Ethiopian food, I would recommend taking a minute to glance through Demera's website. Their entire menu, with descripitions & their reasonable prices, is posted there (very helpful when writing a review).
