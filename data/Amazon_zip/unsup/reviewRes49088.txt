Service, beer selection, and concept of the restaurant were excellent. The food was very good. We had the pork rinds, scallops, pork belly, chicken, brussel spouts, and gratin. Favorites were pork belly and chicken by far. One downside was the amount of pork/bacon aftertaste in many of the meals - even the fries appeared to be fried in pork oil! I enjoyed the communal seating much more than anticipated, and again, the service was nicely attentive and our waitress was extremely helpful and recommended excellent dishes and great beer pairings. Post side note- am feeling a little overwhelmed at the amount of pork/bacon fat taste in many of the dishes and have since developed a slight aversion to the taste. I think that though my dining experience there was excellent, I'm more likely to go back for the beer pairings and a few of the dishes but would probably avoid getting many of the dishes that left a pungent taste in my mouth (e.g. pork rinds).
