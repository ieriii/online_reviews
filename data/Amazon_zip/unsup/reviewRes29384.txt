It took me nearly 20 years to try their crispy bacon. Yes I had the audacity to type that and we know that this is one of Chicago's hottest and oldest vegetarian spots. It's a shame that i've worn the concrete out in Boystown but never popped into this place and I've wanted to for so long. Our BBQ Vegan wings came to the table and while you know you're not eating meat, you simultaneous pee your pants slightly after slurping the exceptional BBQ sauce. I believe the wings are Seitan and they taste the slightest bit bready but these are quite wonderful and crisp! My BBQ bacn cheezeburger is a delicious housemade veggie patty with seitan bacn and tangy BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato and onion, melted cheeze. The wheat buns remind me of Epic Burger and the fake bacon was on point. Since summer '91 I rid my diet of pork and in 1993 I slashed all red meat. After 2 years of being vegetarian, I began eating seafood and poultry again while still loving many meatless or meat free dishes. The service is very friendly, though I think they definitely get a bit overwhelmed when there's a packed house. On second thought, maybe they're just trying to leave you alone to enjoy the food and convo with your guest. Will be nice to go back.
