Everything about this restaurant is amazing. It is a bit pricier than other charrascurias, but is certainly worth every penny. As others have said, if you'd like to save a little money go for lunch. Also, if you have the chance to go to one of their competitors...always choose Fogo de Chao...they are the best! The salad bar is great, but their meat is even better. I typically opt to save my hunger for their incredible cuts of meat rather than their salad bar. Their dessert is also outstanding.
