The uber-special drink list was fun. The space is maze-like, with tall furniture dividing a high ceiling room into intimate micro-spaces. If you sit at a table, I hope you like looking at your mates because your sightline around the space will blocked by large dividers and tall furniture. Fortunately I loved my table, and the intimate booth space made for a special evening of charming conversation. My visit to Violet Hour for Monday evening post-dinner drinks was well worth it. Music was eclectic and surprising. Sometimes it felt like they were playing a quirky iTunes playlist on shuffle.
