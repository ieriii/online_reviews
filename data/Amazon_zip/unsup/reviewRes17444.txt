I went to an event here for my friend's work clients a few months back so I can't speak for the normal dinner service, but the service we got was OUTSTANDING. The layout of the place is amazing with high ceilings and 2 floors of various lounge areas. The food was absolutely amazing as well (especially the lamb- meat shanks FTW!). I really just loved my whole experience there. Since it was a free event I can't really judge whether it was expensive or not, but it's classy so I'd peg it for a nice romantic dinner location.
