I had a family style dinner with my cousins from out of town who wanted to have really great Greek food and my first thought was Greek Islands and they did not disappoint. Everyone was happy and full with the food. I ordered the avgolemono soup and it was just like my grandma would make it. You can go with a big group small group or just on a date. Great Place OPA!
