I had heard so many good things about Gilt Bar, I really looked forward to dinner reservations this past Saturday. We were seated and waited on promptly, but that's about the best I can say. First, it was so unbelievably loud it was difficult to have a conversation with anyone other than the person right next to you. Second, I'm vegan. I'm not high maintenance at all and never have trouble finding something at any restaurant I've been to. Sometimes it's just an assortment of sides prepared with oil instead of butter, which is fine by me. Not so at Gilt Bar. After checking with the chef, the waiter told me the only options available on their menu for a vegan were the salads without cheese or the cauliflower side without chili. I ordered a salad and asked for it as my entree so that I would have something to eat with the rest of the table. I didn't realize that I would have to sit there through more than an hour of my friends eating appetizers and salads. I have no expectation that restaurants carry tempeh, tofu, or seitan to accommodate vegan guests, but I do have the expectation that restaurants accommodate patrons. Whether it's by putting sauces on the side or steaming rather than frying for those who are watching what they eat, or using oil instead of butter or vegetables instead of meat in a dish for those who are vegan/vegetarian. I've had amazing vegan meals at French restaurants, and Gilt Bar couldn't come up with more than a salad?
