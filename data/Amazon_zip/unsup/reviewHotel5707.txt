Great location! We were in one of the smallest (advised for 1 - 2 people) rooms and yes, it was small but it was efficiently laid out, had everything we needed and an AMAZING view! Besides it's Chicago so how long are you in the room anyway. While our room could have used some general maintenance (crumbly plaster on ceiling), it was clean.
