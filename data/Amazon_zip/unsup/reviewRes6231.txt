Been here several times. I've almost worked through the entire menu. My stand outs have to be: Burger, now with bacon jam!, Corn salad, Swordfish, Carbonara pasta & Pizza's! Everything I've had here is fantastic. They have wine along the back wall for you to choose a bottle for there or to go. All very reasonably priced. They charge a $7 corkage fee, great idea. The La Quercia Montepulciano is my favorite!
