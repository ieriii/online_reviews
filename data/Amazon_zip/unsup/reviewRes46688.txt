Still 5 stars!! Went here for the Sunday Brunch after my sister-in-law and cousin-in-law ran in the Shamrock Shuffle and even with a group of 10 people in this tiny place, it was AWESOME! The brunch items were SO good...my favorites were the Chicken Sausages, some kind of Denver-type scramble and the Bread Pudding french toast casserole. OMG! I could eat here everyday! I also ordered the 8 Buffalo wings and added the brunch to that...and let me tell you...the wings here are amazing! They are really meaty and the sauce is a sweet/spicy sauce, really different from anywhere else I've been and I LOVE it! I will DEFINITELY be back here for the Sunday Brunch again! And I highly recommend reservations, like I had, cause it seems to get pretty crowded around lunch time on Sundays! Mmmmm...seriously...I can't wait to go back!
