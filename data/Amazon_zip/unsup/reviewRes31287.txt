I find myself getting the same thing every time, the Sweet Potato Quesadillas. Can't help it. So good!! This particular time, they were trying out new software and hardware. It was a hand-held device where they are able to submit orders without going to the actual monitor. So, our food came out a bit slower than others who were doing it by hand. I don't mind being the guinea pig. They were nice about it and gave me my drink for free along with a soy cookie dough shake. No complaints from me.
