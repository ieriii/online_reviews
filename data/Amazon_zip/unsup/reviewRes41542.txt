Small (not many more than 10 tables), BYOB with limited menu choices. It may sound like this is going to be a bad review - but it's not. In fact, these things, and its near nothing location, make Bonsoiree all the more interesting. We went with the four course dinner and it was outstanding. They even seemed happy to work around some dietary preferences we had. The meal did take a l-o-n-g time, especially considering it was a Tuesday and we arrived at 5:00 PM. But, if you're not in a rush, indulge yourself at this little gem. The food and servers are top notch.
