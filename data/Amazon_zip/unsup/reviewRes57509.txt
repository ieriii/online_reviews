Geja's ambiance and food are a great combination. Despite the fact that you are cooking your own food, the meats and vegetables were fresh and flavorful. They have an extensive wine list, and an attentive staff. In comparison to The Meltingpot (another fondue destination), Gejas was superior. The menu does not have as many choices, but the dishes were simple and delicious. The chocolate fondue was also served flambeed. Yum! Great date destination
