This is easily my favorite restaurant .... me and fondue go together like ... well, we go together like Tonya Harding and a lead pipe. My first time (um, still talking fondue here), I was 17 years old and a cute boy surprised me on our second date with a fantastic fondue dinner ... he had prepared everything before I arrived and set it up like a little picnic on the floor. a-friggin-dorable!!!! even now - several years and boys later, this stands out as one of the most original and romantic dates that I have ever had and while the boy didn't last forever, my love for fondue has remained loyal. Years later I would be introduced to Geja's Cafe and it would be love that stands the test of time ... um, still talking fondue.  This place ... (insert dreamy sigh here) ... how I love this place. It just does not get any more charming or cozy but you have to be ready and willing for a loooooooong meal ..... and you have to be capable of laughing at yourself and/or your date, cause yes, this is a romantic way to eat food but its almost like fishing and when that piece of filet mignon falls off your little spear, you will forget everything else other than the immediate task at hand - to find and save that little bastard piece before it burns!  Now, if you're at all concerned about calories/health, I strongly recommend switching out the oil for chicken broth for the main course portion of the meal ... yes, yes, everything tastes better fried but trust me, you'll be seriously full after this meal ... save the room for the unbelievable wine list and of course, the dessert. You'll thank me later.
