By far, my favorite pizza in the city! The crust is delicious (especially with a side of their ranch dressing) and the toppings are equally yummy. I'm partial to the pepperoni but I've had other toppings and they've all been great. The service is overall as friendly and efficient as you're going to find for a pizza place that's as busy as it is. If you haven't tried this yet, go for it!
