Great selection on the menu! Tons of omelets, red beans and rice, steak and eggs. They all sounded so good I couldn't decide what I wanted. The red beans and rice were great! Not as spicy as I thought it was going to be, but still very tasty.. You have to try their cornbread! It's delicious! Our waitress was very nice, and aside from the fact I was elbowed three times by the bus boy, the service was excellent. Get there early on Sundays. or you will be waiting around for a while.
