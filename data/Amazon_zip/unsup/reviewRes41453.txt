Good food and atmosphere in this smaller BYOB. Went with a large crowd on Sunday night, got the larger prix fixe menu, and it was really an excellent deal. My favorite courses were the cheese course and the dessert course so try to save room! Just a great experience all around, perfect for a special occasion.
