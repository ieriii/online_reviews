After a movie date at a nearby theater, my date & I didn't have any idea where to go afterwards. We got out to the parking lot and saw a pizza place so we decided to check it out. We walked into Pequod's and were digging the environment. More importantly, we were really impressed with the pizza. The deep dish was the perfect portion and the price was really good. I'm talking, I checked the bill to see if the server rang up the wrong thing. It was great pizza and the price was astoundingly good. I can't wait to go back.
