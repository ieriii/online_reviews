The only reason I am giving it a 4 stars is because. The cashier was a rude ass and kept rolling her eyes at customers and kept making snotty and condescending remarks. If she is so unhappy there. I am sure they are hiring at some buffet place where she will feel more at home. Food was excellent and the servers and the hostess were very friendly.
