I would give it a 3.5, to be honest. The place is really nice and feels cozy. As a starter, we shared the asparagus salad which was pretty good. For entrees, I had the meat lasagna. Overall, I thought the pasta and the sauces were typical mass produced stuff. Huge portions seem to be their saving grace. For middle america, probably a good italian place. In NYC, it wouldnt survive very long - even in the tourist scam area known as Little Italy. If you are looking for american-italian, by all means, this is the place. If you are looking for more traditional italian, maybe not the best idea.
