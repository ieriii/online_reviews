I thought the "regular" (non-competition) baby back ribs were competition quality. They were cooked to the right tenderness - easy to take a bite, but not so soft and mushy that the meat falls off the bone - and well seasoned and smoky. Get the q3 to share so you can sample the kobe brisket, pulled pork and ribs.
