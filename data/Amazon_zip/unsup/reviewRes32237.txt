I've only had Ethiopian cuisine once before but it was years ago so I considered my visit here to be my "first" time eating Ethiopian. I dined on a Friday night with two friends, one of which is fellow Yelper and recommended the place. It wasn't crowded at all which was nice, but it made me yearn for a slightly louder atmosphere because it seemed to me as if this type of cuisine would be best enjoyed among the company of friends and strangers. For the first time diner, the menu describes the cuisine and lists a glossary of terms. Our server was helpful as well, offering recommendations and making sure one item that wasn't listed as orderable for messob could be ordered. For the three of us, the Demera messob was more than enough, preluded by spinach sambussas. Regarding messob specifics, it was great to diversify the selections, from chicken to lamb, spicy to mild. Service was overall attentive, with the host surprisingly aiding our table during the later part of the meal. The ambience was pretty nice, but the music was just short of perfect. Though what appeared to be traditional Ethiopian music was played on the speakers, some of the tracks started skipping which made us giggle a bit. Near the end of our dinner, a live musician began performing - but he sang and played jazz/soul. That didn't fit at all.
