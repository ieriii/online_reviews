I have made this my go too as its blocks from my house but I am never ever going here again and I suggest a boycot. Asked for 2 cups of cheese and they bring us 2 big bowls and charge 5 bucks a pop ( for dipping a few fries?) ...combine that with the super bad attitude of the woman manager and her waitress made me sick....this place sucks.  The time before last they put me in a hi traffic area and after 20 min I had to ask to move cause it was the worst seat in the house.i tip very well and i refuse to give these horrable service a cent..I would rather have mcdonalds than deal with this horrable service...I highly highly recomend superosa over la villa any day of the week....your staff needs a major attitude adjustment and I will make sure to let everyone know it. Worst service I've ever experienced firgured it was a one time thing but after going again I realize that this place doesn't know how to hire respectable management or wait staff....if you want great food and awesome service search elsewhere. Huge let down time after time :( BOYCOTT) WORST SERVICE IN CHICAGO!!!!!!!!
