This place is - incredible - ! Amazing food, consistent, quick (in the door to eating in 10,) friendly staff, and AMAZING food (did I say that?) Its an amazing alternative to a quick lunch at Chipotle or Potbelly if you have a little extra time. I go for the vegetarian mousaka or the chicken riganati. And the tsatsiki is purely addictive (but bring gum!) The service is prompt, thorough, and polite. And, FREE VALET! One of my favorite places to eat. I never get tired of it!
