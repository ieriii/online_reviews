Food = 5 stars; Service = "meh" Ever since I was introduced to Agedashi Tofu, I can't help but order it everywhere I go now. And I must say, this is, hands down, the best one I've had so far. Outer thin layer of light and crisp golden flakes of bliss embracing the tofu and dipped in just the right amount of sauce? STOP IT. I couldn't help myself with that one. I almost forgot to share it with my date-for-the-evening. 1 for you...5 for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the New York City Maki as well like how Sound of Music's Maria enjoys "raindrops on roses." Like no joke. It was the combination of 3 of my favorite things: eel, avocado...and that's right, cream cheese. I liked the options between Maki, City Maki and their Special Makis. Tried the Shrimp Tempura as well but wasn't much of a fan... it was kind of bland for my taste. I shall return! Literally. Cheers to the freakin' weekend, I'll cheers to INDIE. P.S. Minus just one star because service was kind of slow. Not so slow where I wouldn't return though. And ambiance was pretty intimate. And..AND...BYOB?! Sold. You ain't gotta ask me twice!
