I feel like we totally wasted our money. Overall we were really impressed by the service, but the food was a big let down. We went there to celebrate my birthday. They printed up a special menu with my name and a birthday wish in it, which was a really nice touch. We ordered off the Prix Fixe Menu. The amuse-bouche was bland, our appetizers were good, but the entrees were a total miss (no taste, the lobster, which I paid extra for, was rubbery and the portions were really small). After our main course we were still hungry, so we ordered an additional cheese course served with a side of honey and chutney (the cheese plate was the best thing we had all night). Our desserts were also a big disappointment -pretty to look at but bland and unimaginative in taste.
