I went with two of my best girlfriends b/c one had picked up the Groupon and we thought it would make for a fun girl's night. Never fear, we had fun but we could probably find a good time just as easily anywhere else...  First impressions? It does not smell good and you will not smell good when you get home; I'm assuming it's the cost of being able to deep fry, errr, fondue, scallops and the like in hot oil but it's problematic when you have to take shower before bed to get the smell out of your hair (and annoying to have your husband ask why you smell like Chinese take out). Let me interject, I'm pretty sure I've decided that fondue for dinner/appetizers isn't my thing... So, I set aside my issue with the smell after we were seated and decided to enjoy the food. I did, for awhile. I've had an ongoing love-affair with cheese for a few years but had a hard time eating a lot of the cheese fondue here, it was great the first few bites and then it got boring and, eventually, started to bubble and spit, and tasted a little gross (burned?). I covered the sterno to stop the cooking process and couldn't put one more cheese covered anything in my mouth for fear of getting sick. Oh, and then they finally brought out the veggies we paid extra for... too large (please, people, cut them to BITE size), too late even though I asked three times where the veggies were. Fail. Out comes the chocolate, another mistress of mine for years and, sadly, a similar experience was had. The highlight was most certainly the ability to roast a marshmallow at the table and the ground graham crackers were great, I sprinkled them on all 4 bites I had. Perhaps the experience is different if you can afford the $50/person dinner and have the variety of the hot oil in addition to the cheese and chocolate? I guess my point is, if I'm going to cook my own food for dinner, I'll do it at home next time and save the money (and time in the shower).
