Yes, the line can get out of control. Yes, it's cash only. Yes, the hours are limited. Yes, it's gotten tons of, maybe too much exposure. But you knew all that going in. All that really matters is the food. And Doug Sohn delivers. Whether it's one of the pricey but superb specialty sausages, one of the more standard numbers, or just a dog with everything, with peppers, Doug Sohn delivers. If you don't like the food at Hot Doug's, then I hate you.
