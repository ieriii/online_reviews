Wha? They have good sweet potato fries? I'm kicking myself for not reading all the Yelp reviews before my last visit to The Fifty/50 because I LOVE my sweet potato fries. I guess I already have another reason to return to The Fifty/50... Besides the sweet potato fries I apparently missed out on this is a cool sports bar that fits well into the Chicago scene. On my most recent visit we took over the downstairs area for my friend's 30th bday bash. Finding a good space for these types of bashes can be harder than expected and this was perfect. The staff was nice, kept the drinks flowing, and brought over all the necessities so we could serve the 2 bday cakes we brought with us. If I had known about the sweet potato fries ahead of time then 1 cake would have been sufficient. The cab driver who picked me up at midnight (right before i turned into a pumpkin!) made a comment that the crowd outside of Fifty/50 looked like a bunch of "douchebags." I glanced back and found myself agreeing, but hey...."douchebags" need a place to drink (and eat sweet potato fries) too!
