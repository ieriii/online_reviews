In Rogers Park we've got a couple winners when it comes to Ethiopian, but when my friend who lives in Uptown mentioned she wanted to try Demera I was all for it. I'm always looking for the next great handful of mashed something-or-other. We went in on what is probably an off-time: Sunday night about 5:45. The place was nearly empty so we were seated right away. But the service...slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Over the course of a couple hours we had to continually ask to have water glasses refilled (and we weren't chugging them down). We ordered 2 different "tasting entrees" (you know, you get four different selections from the regular menu). She got one too so all in all, we shared 4 different types of veg entrees and 4 meat entrees. I can't say enough about the veg choices. Really really tasty. Not so crazy about the meats although the beef choices were generally better than the chicken choices (which I found different as usually I prefer the chicken at Ras Dashen and Ethiopian Diamond).  It was slightly more expensive than the two neighbors to the north (Ras and Diamond) and I couldn't really put my finger on why, so I say I'll probably not be back to Demera unless it's just more convenient to go there. Not bad. But also not worth a special trip.
