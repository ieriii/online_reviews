Hopleaf has great food and great beer. the real reason to go of course, is the beer. If you're hungry, the added bonus if the food is good. It's not as mind altering good as a lot of people say, but if you're in this bar that has such fantastic beer and the food is creative and really good, who can top that? At least for a bar this is my favorite place.I agree, the service is crappy and more or less indifferent. If you want great service, go to Big Jones or Jin Ju.
