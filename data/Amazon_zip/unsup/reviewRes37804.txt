An unbelievable selection of Belgian beer on tap. Dont miss the Kwak, which comes in its own wooden holder.  Lots if bottled selections too - but why bother? Excellent food, and very reasonably priced. If this place was downtown it woudl be at least twice as expensive. A friend of mine went with and thought it was the best meal he'd had all year.
