After moving to Chicago from San Francisco, this was the first place I went since I was a huge fan of Mexico One Plate at a Time. I thought it would be easy to get a table at 5:10pm, a mere 10 minutes after the place opened, but I was wrong. We walked in the door and it was already a 60 minute wait, which wasn't a big deal because I just sat at the bar and enjoyed some delicious Margaritas and chips. Once we got our table I had a pretty good buzz but that didn't prevent me from enjoying a great meal. Everything on the menu is great, however I would recommend eating from the small plates menu, that way everyone gets to taste a little bit of everything that is ordered. All in all a very successful evening.
