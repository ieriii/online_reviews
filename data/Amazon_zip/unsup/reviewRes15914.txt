Something's going right if you feel like you're dinning at a masquerade in a mysterious bubble country that is the love child of old Italy and new Mexico. Eating at Carnivale is the equivalent to falling down the rabbit hole and ending up at the Mad Hatter's tea party. I have been wanting to go to this place for 2 years, and finally my GF took me for my bday. Aside from her getting the girlfriend-of-the-year award with dinner, we got some pretty solid dishes. Food is a bit limited for vegetarians, but if you like cheese then you will be well accommodated. Margaritas are limey and clean tasting. The waiters are attentive and quite knowledgeable. Much of the food is made from local produce and they have several events you can partake in. Prices are slightly unmatched with the quality/quantity of food...but really, you're paying for the changing lights display 100 feet above you, not the assortment of goat cheeses. I'd go again just to sit there and stare at the walls. Romantic, exciting, inspiring and completely worth a visit.
