Solid. That's really all there is to say. Super tasty burger taken right from the Chicago Heavy Metal Burger Bar playbook. Lockdown is a slightly more convenent and better Kuma's Corner, but it is identical to Kuma's Corner in almost all aspects other than the crowds. Chicago needs some fresh life in its burger bar scene. I'm going to open a new spot in Logan Square and call it Puma's Corner. It's going to have a soft rock theme, nothing but Steely Dan, Christoper Cross, Michael McDonald and Sade. 50 white wines by the glass or bottle. Sandwich names such as "the Smooth Operator" or "the Blue Eye'd Soul," all served on a seven grain roll. No bacon or eggs on anything.
