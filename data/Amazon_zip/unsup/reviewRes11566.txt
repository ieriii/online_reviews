You can beat around the bush all you want, but the simple fact remains that there is no reason you shouldn't eat Piece any night of the week you'd want pizza. That's all you need to know. Unless you've been blessed with the pizza god up in your ivory tower (which apparently some of you have), you're going to think the pizza is amazing and some of the best Chicago has to offer, and you're going to like the beers they offer. And those aren't assumptions, you will. Yeah, it's busy every night you whiny hipsters, so get the equally amazing take-out next time, some Piece brewed beer, and stop complaining.
