ate here once a year ago..i'd eat here more often if it wasn't so darn far! i had the strawberry and belgian chocolate crepe with vanilla ice cream it was great! it was around valentines day so they drew a lil heart around it ..i don't know if they do that all the time or just around v-day..but i thought it was super cute! i also had the veggie soup bc i love soup! and it was excellent :) then to finish my meal i had the algerian mint tea minus the honey :) it was a great meal for a great price!! i'd def back again when i'm in the neighborhood
