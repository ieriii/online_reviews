Solid bar. Wish it wasn't packed a lot of the time...but otherwise nice dark pubby vibe, great beer, and good food. Got rejected at the door one day for not having an I.d. by a pimply young boy who looked 15 himself but I guess that's my fault for forgetting it. I plan to go back with my I.d. soon for some mussles n beer.
