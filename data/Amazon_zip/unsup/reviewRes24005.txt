The food and atmosphere at this place are both excellent. The crepes are sooo good, and as a very picky eater, I really appreciate the make-your-own option. I recommend turkey breast, goat cheese, sun-dried tomato and pine nuts...that combo is truly delicious and I find myself craving it all the time. I also like that it's BYOB. The only negative is the portion size...the crepes are kinda on the small side. They're perfect for lunch/brunch but not filling enough for dinner (even with the complimentary cup of soup that comes with it).
