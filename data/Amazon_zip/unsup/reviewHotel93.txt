I had my wedding here, have had my family stay here on several occasions. Best value. Best Location. Trains to the city are a block a way. (but why would you leave Oak Park?) everything in walking distance... even the motel rooms are MOD, and fab, (recently updated) Restaurants are wonderful too. You will enjoy the locals at Poor Phils, Ask for the beer of the day. I would totally recommend this hotel for weddings. Easy access, walk around abilty, and top notch everything. John Mahoney from Frasier even came to my reception- well, he was in the bar for the after party!
