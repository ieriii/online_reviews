Finally - we made it to XOCO! A couple of surprises here (for me, anyway): 1. It is more like a cafetaria (with upscale decor). The only difference, you cannot choose your own seat. Someone will assist you. 2. The 'water fountain' - one is still water, the other one is sparkling. Being me, not paying attention to all of the writings/signs (it was after office hour on a Friday- I've had enuf stuff to read throughout the week) - it was not a pleasant surprise when I taste the bubbles as I sip my water (since I'm not a fan of sparkling water). I had the Ahogada (pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions) ~ which was awesome. Me likey when I can dip my sandwich. The bf had the today' special ~ something with pork, too - which was also, awesome. We also ordered churros with a side of the yummy soft-serve ice cream (it's maple and bacon!!) Bottom line - I love XOCO - and will probably go back if I could convince the bf. It is a bit pricey for sandwiches ~ not to mention the cafetaria style. But for as long as I cannot find this anywhere else, I'll definitely be visiting XOCO again. Soon or later.
