Holy Crap, I love Wildfire! My meal was a blur of awesome, amazing, spectacular food. I started with the Martini Flight, which was quite a little bang for my buck. I love sampler things that let you try a lot of variety and this little flight did not dissappoint. I also had the crab crusted stuffed shrimp...very tasty. I shared a Wildfire chopped salad....OMG. Please buy a bottle of dressing, you are going to want it again the next day and you will regret it.  For my entree, I had the Filet Medallion Trio with hoseradish, mushroom, and parmesan crusts. YUM YUM. The mushroom was definitely my favorite, but the other two were delicious as well. Steak was cooked perfectly and super moist.  I had some sort of cookie for dessert...I don't remember much about it. So, don't get the cookie dessert...it's forgettable.  I can't wait until my next trip to Wildfire...chopped salad, mushroom crusted meat of some sort....oh yeah... Sign me up (on open table about 2 weeks in advance...)!
