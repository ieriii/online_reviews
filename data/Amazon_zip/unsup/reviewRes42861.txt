I had a living social coupon and used it recently at Fogo. You could use the coupon for delivery which was great. We got pizza, a whole chicken and an appetizer - bocce balls which were meatballs wrapped in dough and baked. The pizza was delivered a little cold so I was not overly impressed with the pizza, however it was fine. It was good enough where I would try it again. The bocce balls were fantastic as was the chicken. The chicken had great spices and was very juicy. Go for the pizza but stay for the chicken! I will order again!
