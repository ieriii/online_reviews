This is a great restaurant for a date because you can show youre kinda flashy and you have good taste, but also the food is good. and you get a lot of food, it tastes good, and ive never really had a bad experience. it gets a four for the long waits and the loudness. but it also get a four for the quality of food, so its tough. but its a great place and if you havent been there you should check it out.
