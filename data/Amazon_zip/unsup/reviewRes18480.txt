This place is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago.  You're greeted by a warm server every time, the appetizers are wonderful, and the half-moon ravioli is to die for! (Seriously, it's got a tomato-cream sauce, with sweet peas, and minced Italian sausages.)  I would recommend the desert, but I've never been able to discipline myself enough to save room!
