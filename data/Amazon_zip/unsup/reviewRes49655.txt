The service, food, and decor at Las Tablas were very good. I tried the lengua (beef tongue) with a Spanish caper sauce. The tongue was cooked to the right consistency. The plantains and yuca were also good. I like that the corkage fee is only $5.  The main drawback to the restaurant is the noise level. I don't mind if a busy restaurant is loud, but at Las Tablas, I felt like I was in a club. I had to yell to be heard by the people sitting next to me. (I'm sure I accidentally got saliva on both of them, trying to communicate). I had to yell and pantomime to converse with the friend sitting across from me. (Sorry for any saliva I sprayed on your food). The music may have been good in another setting. But this place was so noisy to begin with, it just detracted from the ambience.
