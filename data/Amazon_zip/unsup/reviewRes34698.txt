I really enjoy the food here, everything I've had! Best falaful in the city (not the world, but Chicago at least). The salad bar is totally fresh. I also love the campy seats. It's just cheap and good. You can't expect a ton with prices this low, but they manage to keep it consistent and good. I heard a rumor they're opening something at California and Milwaukee? I hope this is true.
