Best brunch in the neighborhood. I recommend the eggs benedict with avocado. Less pretentious than many of the local Gold Coast brunch spots. One of my favorite neighborhood hangouts for happy hour/a lite dinner. Reasonably priced with great drink specials. Low-key; a great place to catch up with girlfriends or for a quiet date night. The dinner menu is not quite as broad but the specials always brighten up the menu. Try the cheese plate. -1 star because they always seem to be a little bit understaffed.
