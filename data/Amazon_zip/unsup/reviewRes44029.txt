My Favorite Gem in All the Land! And I am self-professed sushi snob, having grown up on sushi and traveled to its birthplace. Try the Oedipus Roll. And the Jalapeno Miso Soup. And their specials. The grade of sushi is immaculate (I tend to eat sushi in the traditional sense of the word, not the all-encompassing term). I love this place. I remember when it opened up and was just a little room and now it's expanded to double the size. Sure, it may be a tight squeeze during the rush hour but totally worth it and have been coming back for years. Intimate, creative interior that makes you feel as if you are in a Japanese forest with the wallpaper and dark wood finish. The ambiance is especially enhanced with the connected 1920's Art Deco Chinese bar next door). Always recommend this first to my out-of-town guests. When they come back into town they always ask to return.
