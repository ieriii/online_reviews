Alinea is amazing, and Alinea knows it. I. Loved. Every. Second. My experience at Alinea reminds me of going to an amusement park with my best friends: I smiled and was delighted for all of the three hours I was inside this womb of culinary wonder.  I went to Alinea in mid-March '08 with an old friend. Remembering this occasion fondly, I think about the food and the drink all the time because I have never eaten food created with such precision and focused so hotly on taste and experience. We each had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was exquisite. The nutmeg pillow was so wonderful, I'm dreaming about it still. The Amarone was a sip of joy. The waitstaff and sommelier were wonderful, as one might expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by their professionalism which was delightfully lacking in pretension.   You need to eat here. I don't care what anyone says: Alinea is worth every silly penny.
