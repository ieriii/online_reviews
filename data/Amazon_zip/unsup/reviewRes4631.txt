I have been here multiple times in the last 2 years---quality stays the same. This is really 4.5 stars--a little dent due to the occassional long lines and loudness of the space.  I have probably had about 75% of the food menu through my many meals here. One tip for newbies: this food is rich, savory, and full fat. This means that when your server suggests you order 2-3 plates per person, take into account how much of this style of food you can actually eat AND bear in mind that they have an awesome dessert donut thing that you have to order. (because I dream about this thing and think about it often--it is that good) I think their recommendation is too high.  Other than that I recommend that you be adventurous as this isn't your typical menu, share with friends so you can order more, and ask for a wine pairing because they have a good selection. You really can't go wrong with the menu.
