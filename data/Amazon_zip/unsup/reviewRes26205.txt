So good, so romantic, so much fun! I'm allergic to lots of fruit and they made a special plate for me and filled it up with other stuff so I could enjoy the cheese and the chocolate fondues. This place is such a great date place but i' ve also been with my family (five people) and we fit fine at a booth. Bring a flashlight to see the menu...also it's pretty expensive but really fun. So much better in terms of atmosphere and taste than going somewhere like the Melting Pot.
