We ended up at Noon because two of the other Middle Eastern places in the hood were closed. It was good, but there was nothing that would bring me back as opposed to trying another place. It's kind of like Chinese restaurants - there are so many to try that a place has to have something really special to get me to come back. Noon O Kabab didn't quite have it. The decor is cozy and pleasant, the service is very friendly and prompt, and our waiter in particular was very knowledgeable about all of the dishes. The place was packed with a long wait, we got there right before the rush. I couldn't decided what to have and so decided on a couple of appetizers rather than one main course. I had the saffron chicken soup, which was really, really good - great flavor and fresh and tasty white meat chicken pieces. Next I had the stuffed peppers - I was intrigued by the idea of oatmeal used for something other than breakfast and cookies. They were tasty and the portion was huge. The free pita and cheese appetizer was good as well. My friend had the pomegranate rice mushroom special - I can't remember what it's called - and she liked hers as well. The Persian style baklava for dessert was also yummy.  There was nothing really wrong with Noon, like I said before, there was just nothing to set it apart.
