I was back there over the weekend and had been away for a couple of years. Boy oh boy how things haven't changed. The wait staff at this place are thieves. they mark up your bill, they add anywhere from $15-25 extra to your bill. They've been doing it for so long it's almost normal. and don't you dare catch it because they get mad. and don't even dream about complaining to the owners. they do not take well to customers complaints no matter if it is small or big(food poisoning) they get mad at you for complaining. they are rude and have no manners or customer service skills. they have this attitude that almost sayswe have too many customers anyway so who cares what you think but wait till everyone starts paying attention and stops going for the greasy food, dirty place, rude service...then they'll care.
