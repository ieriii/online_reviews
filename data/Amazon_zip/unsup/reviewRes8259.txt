I've never been to Italy, but if I had a gun to my head asking for the most genuine (not Americanized) Italian pizza in Chicago, Spacca Napoli is the first place I'd think of. We started with the basic salad with oil and vinegar, and it was perfect. The right amount of dressing over top of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes and olives .... mmm! And the bread with olive oil that comes to the table is just as amazing (and I'm not usually into oil on my bread, but they do it right here). And the pizza was spot on. I've been to other places in Chicago that do coal/brick oven pizza and it comes out totally black on the edges and you can't escape the burnt flavor. Not here! Perfect chewy-doughy crust with a hint of smoky coal, topped to perfection with delicious sauce and really fresh ingredients. We shared the margherita and funghi pizzas and we loved them both. I'd say that one pizza per person is a good portion if you get a salad or appetizer. If you pass on the salads/appetizers, I'd definitely go for three pizzas per two people. They're smaller than I expected, and because they're thin, they won't fill you up as fast. The service was also excellent. My poor waiter had to describe all the salads to me because the names are in Italian, so I had no clue what to make of them. He knew exactly how to describe each of them and made great suggestions and didn't sound or look at all annoyed by my ignorance. Overall, an excellent meal. My only complaint is that the pizzas could have been a bit larger for the price, I thought. I'm still used to getting a 16-inch pie for 12 bucks in NY, so that always gets me when it comes to the table and it's only 10 inches or so.
