Not entirely thrilled. I went by myself and requested a small booth. Even though the place was dead and seating was readily available, they put up a fuss about seating "Party of One" at a booth. The food was alright -- I enjoyed the biscuits, but the salad was tiresome, with crisp lettuce quickly wilting under the surplus of dressing. Maybe I'll come back to try for breakfast.
