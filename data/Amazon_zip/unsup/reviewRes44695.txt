The pizza here is fantastic and it probably ranks in my top 5 for pizza places I have been to. I have been numerous times and there always seems to be a 35 minuet wait, which is OK considering the reward is top notch deep dish pizza. If you are presented with a wait and are going to order a deep dish pizza, put the order in while you wait and if the timing works out you can get your pizza not to long after getting your table, which beats waiting for 35 min to be seated and then waiting another 30 min for the pizza to bake. The pizza is layer upon layer of pizza goodness and is very filling. A friend and I got the medium and could not finish the whole thing as it seemed like eating one piece filled you up like two pieces of a normal pizza. The salad was also not to bad, though the pizza stole the show. Overall a great place to get pizza if you don't mind a wait.
