A while back I would have given this 5 stars but they've been less reliable. Last two times pizza just wasn't as good. What happened? The salads are absolutely delicious--and I am not a big salad person. Solid beer selection but also decent wines if you don't like beer. Can be crazy crowded. Pick up is fairly reliable. Service is always friendly and mostly quick.
