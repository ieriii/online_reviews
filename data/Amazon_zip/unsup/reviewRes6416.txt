Davanti is one of the best restaurant experiences of my life. Warm atmosphere, amazing Italian cuisine, on point service, good prices. This place has it all. I dare you to have a bad time. Start with drinks in the bar, pop open a bottle of wine at your table, and then go crazy. The dishes are perfect size for ordering a bunch and sharing. I tried the cheese course, the canellini bean bruschetta, honey comb and ricotta, ravioli and margherita pizza... among others I can't recall. Honestly, the pizza was just standard but everything else was effing delicious. Esp the bruschetta and the honeycomb. Inventive but not over the top. I would recommend everything I tried in a heartbeat. Perfect for family dinner, date night, drinks for gurrrrls night. This is one of those places you won't be able to stop raving about to your friends.
