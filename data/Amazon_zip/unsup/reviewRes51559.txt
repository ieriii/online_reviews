How can anyone give Garcia's anything lower than a 4?? This place is one of the best restaurants in Chicago, period. On weekend nights, the wait can be 30 minutes. I'm not one of those people that have no patience, so I don't mind. Aside from that, the food is GREAT. The prices are competitive with other sit-down Mexican restaurants. I usually fill up a full meal/drink for less than 12 dollars. Plus you get free bottomless chips and salsa. Service is great too! I used to go every week a few years ago before they remodeled, and they remembered my group whenever we came in. Always courteous, quick, and check on you. =]
