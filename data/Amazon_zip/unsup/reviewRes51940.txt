I feel so bad rating Gino's 3 stars because I'd had high hopes... No thanks: 1. Pizza took forever to come out. 2. Atmosphere wasn't very welcoming. 3. The sausage patty (albeit my fault for ordering it) had an odd texture. 4. Some parts of the pizza were cold (unforgivable). Thanks: 1. The experience. 2. The sauce - the amount was perfect & the flavor nice. Would I go again? Probably not - I'm trying Giordano's or Lou Malnati's next time.
