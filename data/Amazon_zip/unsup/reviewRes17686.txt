Was here a couple weeks ago and so far it is one of my favorite places, I came with a Groupon so I ended up paying about 45-50 for 2 people before the discount. Nice layout and very nice decor. The only thing I didnt really like is that the waiter did not seem very happy to be there wasn't rude to us but never really smiled or felt inviting.
