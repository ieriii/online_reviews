Here's what you need to know: It's all about exquisite encased meats on hot dog rolls here, excellent speedy service, and awful awful lines on the days you might actually be free to go. Thing is, unlike the slightly brusque attitude over at Kumas - another local legend and barely blocks away - you feel respected here. All smiles, all funny quips and no oppressive music. Feel good and enjoy! I guess it's because - let's face it - a hot dog is an American childhood comfort food. If you grew up here, and even if you're from a different culture at some point you were likely exposed to encased meats in extruded form, served on a bun. What Doug Sohn has done here is capture the honesty of youthful pleasure, and embue it with a decidedly adult twist in the greatest Chicago fashion. Remember, these are just hot dogs, sausages and linked meats so you aren't going to rival a trendy new american West Loop joint with food here. What you are going to rival though are your most cherished childhood memories of picnics, afterschool snacks and family/friend/team bbqs. I had the pleasure of the apple cherry pork sausage with Voges bacon chocolate and pear dijon mustard, and I swear I can't find a memory as good as this tasted!
