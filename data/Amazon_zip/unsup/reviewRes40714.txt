Wait. What? Why have I only just NOW visited Tank Noodle? It's as if I was living the past seven years in Chicago under a rock, and then one gigantic serving of Pho brought me back into the light. Is this what Gloria Estafan meant when she sang "Coming Out of the Dark?" It must be. Tank was my first foray (PHOray ?) into Vietnamese cuisine, and I was accompanied by someone who considered himself to be quite a novice on the subject so when he suggested I go with the Pho (number 43 to be exact) I didn't argue.  We were served enormous helpings with plenty of condiments - the smell of fresh basil leaves alone nearly knocked me over with sheer delight. My only complaint was that I would have preferred a few more sliced fresh jalapenos, though I'm certain on my next visit asking for extra wouldn't be a problem. Luckily they have a jar of them at the table as well. Unless you like your face to be on fire and/or beading up with sweat as you slurp your noodles, I wouldn't advise putting what would equal an entire jalapeno pepper in there. But I enjoy being mildly uncomfortable while eating something spicy so for me it only added to the experience, even if four hours later I still felt like an overheating car. I foresee many return visits to Tank as the weather turns colder - I can't dream of a better scene - a crisp Chicago day in January, frosty store front windows and a piping hot bowl of pho. Almost makes me long for winter...almost. And bonus - it's BYOB. I mean...what's not to love about this place?
