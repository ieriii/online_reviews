With over 200 reviews and climbing there is not one thing that hasn't been said (and in great detail no less) about Hot Doug's. At this point, the only thing your review serves as is your self-serving badge of honor proclaiming that you too are now an esteemed member of the Encased Meats Club. Hot Doug's has a crazy following and this type of yelp hype certainly isn't slowing him down anytime soon. He could move the shop to Peoria and we'd still be clamoring wind, sleet and rain to stand in line for that greasy goodness. And if anything else, just go to say you went, as apparently we all do... the badge is actually pretty groovy.
