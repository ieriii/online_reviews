Here's a syllogism for you: Grand Lux is Cheesecake Factory. I like Cheesecake Factory. Therefore - I like Grand Lux. I'm not going to waste my time by explaining Grand Lux, but that doesn't mean I don't like it. Huge portions, excellent service, & amazing cheesecake - all the things you've come to expect from this chain. If you've never been to either Grand Lux of Cheesecake, I can't really help you out - you sort of just have to experience it for yourself. What I want to really talk about is the beautiful windows that overlook Michigan Avenue. If you get the opportunity to sit in one of the two-person tables in the corner room, I highly recommend it. There's something sort of retro and elegant about having a big, hearty meal while overlooking the bustling Mag Mile in a room that can truly only be described as "grand". Oh. Grand Lux. Like Luxury. I get it now...
