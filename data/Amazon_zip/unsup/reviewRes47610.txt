superb service!!! excellent meat choices and in my opinion far better than fogo de chao! what makes it unique is the meat selection which does include duck and fish (salmon + snapper). i am a sucker for lamb and loved how tender it was there at Zed451. We also enjoyed the harvest table,,,some of the things that it included that i would recommend you try are the poached pears marinated with wine, the tuna salad and delicious Fuji apple salad.  We came as a party of four and every one of us agreed we would rather come here than any other Brazilian meat restaurant. The desserts are amazing! We tried the s'more pie, three mouse chocolate cake and pear creme brulee (which was topped with raspberry sorbet).  I have nothing bad to say about my experience it definitely was bang for your buck!
