This place is very close to get a 5th star from me - but just because that would indicate that its the best ever i will give it 4 and send a mental note that says 4 and a half). What i really liked about this place is how low key everything (but the food) is. From the outside you can't see its a restaurant - let alone a very good one (mental note - bring the address, dont expect the cab driver to find it), the decor is very stylish and simple, the waiters are cool and just the right amount of reserved. On any days but Saturday the menu is decided for you - but it is GOOD! As in all tasting menus there will be things that you go 'hmm' - but the majority is really good and especially the Wagu was out of this world! BYOB is a big plus for the wallet, but if you really appreciate the paring of wine and food it can be an issue. In hindsight i will recommend (for the Fall 2011 menu) to bring a Pinot to start with and a GSM/Rhone wine (we had a bit too powerfull Malbec from Mendoza)... I will definitely recommend you go! Seriously go - now!
