First of all, let me start out by saying - Great wine list! Oh yeah, Great cheese list too! We started out by pairing a cheese flight with a wine flight - I could have done this all night. I had the grilled prawns, my Redhead had the swordfish - ALL was delicious. Service was great - did I mention the cheese & wine flights???
