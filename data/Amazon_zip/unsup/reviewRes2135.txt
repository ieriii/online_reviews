Seriously how many Hot Dog places get a 25 from Zagat for food. I just wish the hours and lines were more convenient. Now that I am on Vytorin, I would be there a ton.. Example : I have the menu bookmarked on my blackberry and saw the menu was a killer this Saturday...( Venison, elk, and buffalo in one sausage ...ribeye..bacon...) get there and the line is almost to the alley...I had to skip it because I did not have enough time and I yearned for it the rest of the weekend...
