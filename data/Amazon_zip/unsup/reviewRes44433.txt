Wakamono's good. Not great. Good.  The sushi quality isn't bad and the presentation is nice, but the preparation isn't up to par. A maki shouldn't fall apart, and Wakamono's maki does fall. My biggest issue is their service. First of all, the host told us where to sit specifically at our table...As in, "You should sit there. You can sit there." Um, OK. We were short a menu and didn't receive one until we had already been asked to take our order three times. ne of our dining companions didn't receive a glass of water until after the appetizer. IIt was close to the end of our meal when we finally received refills. When the check came, it was evident that they were trying to rush us out. Three different people came to check to see if they could process our tab. We wanted to split the check between two cards with two different amounts (They will only split the card between two cards FYI), and the person who took our order couldn't remember how much to put on what card...repeatedly. Finally, the best part was when the host asked us to leave (as we were finishing our wine) because "I have a list of 40 people waiting." Hmmm...Not my problem, now is it? Maybe you shouldn't have overbooked through reservations? Maybe you should just deal with the fact that it's a Saturday night and you got swamped? Maybe it's because there's a party of 12 taking up half your restaurant so you're short tables? Nope. Honestly the food was decent. The BYOB policy is no longer in place since they have a full bar so a minimal $3 corkage fee applies. The tab for 3 people was roughly 90 bucks before tip and included an appetizer, 7 maki (some pricier than others), and 2 orders of sashimi. As I said, it was good - not great. I don't know if I'll go back again mostly because the service was frankly irritating as shit.
