Thought I'd try this place again to give it a fair chance. First time was when it opened and a lot of margin for error then. So..sorry to report, I didn't miss much. I was bullied into sitting in the back covered patio since the hostess thought it was going to rain and didn't want to bother relocating us later. It never rained and I regret not being more adamant about that. Service was improved; bit of a whack job but efficient, friendly and spoke English...what more do you want, right?! Quality of food was improved too. Got the shredded beef sammy and very lean. The ham croquettes arrived cold and small...don't bother with 'em. Expect plastic plates and plastic baskets on every order. Even plastic pitcher of water. Got an ice bucket to keep beer cold...and of course, it leaked all over the table. Plastic plates and baskets remind me of a picnic and these are NO PICNIC PRICES. The best thing on the menu, which you should not leave there without having, is the Guava and Cream Cheese pastry. Again, it arrived cold so make sure you let them know you expect it warmed...and hopefully that will make all the small stuff that can't get right, seem a little better. Many other choices out there that trump this on all levels. Go once, but then head back to Irazu for the real deal. p.s. Not to sell them short...they roast suckling pig every weekend in the summer. Pretty awesome. Might be an eye-sore for veggies though.
