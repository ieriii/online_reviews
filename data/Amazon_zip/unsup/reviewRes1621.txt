It has great atmosphere, great service, good clientele, cleanliness, and tasty dogs and fries with a great selection. I think it is slightly overrated. I don't think it's worth a 30minute wait.  I did try the duck fat fries- in my professional french fry opinion, these duck fat fries are not really "fries". They're more like potato sticks or even potato crisps. Crispy on the outside, dry and mushy in the inside. But they are delicious! I wonder if their regular fries are more like real (in true Belgian definition) fries.
