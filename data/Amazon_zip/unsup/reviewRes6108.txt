Wildfire is a good steakhouse, but as many others on here have stated, it is as suburban as it gets. As such, I personally would recommend you go to any of the many other wonderful Chicago steakhouses over Wildfire downtown. Having said that, I truly enjoyed my meal here. I was with a group of about 10, for a graduation dinner, and we were treated with a respect usually reserved for smaller, higher-margin groups. We were a bit over dressed, having come from a formal graduation, but we did not feel uncomfortable, as there was a wide array of clothing from casual to formal all around us. We ordered a variety of food, some of which was a big hit and a few minor misses. My filet mignon (pepper crusted if memory serves me) was delicious, cooked to my preference, and came with a delicious side of mashed potatoes. It was so wonderful I ended up finishing a partner's identical filet as well! The miss of the meal was probably the beef wellington, which had a poor crust and rather bland tasting meat. Overall, the ambiance of the restaurant was quite enjoyable, quiet but not hushed, but colloquial as well. If someone were to suggest a return to Wildfire, I'd have no qualms, but by my own volition, I'd like to try other steakhouses over this. Of course, if I was stuck in Oak Brook, this would be my first choice for steak!
