Despite being a vegan, I somehow end up at a lot of burger joints & have become quite the veggie burger connesuir. I tried the identity theft at lockdown which was their house veggie burger patty w/ mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoe, & fried onions on their signature pretzel bun. I would opt out of the shallot dressing that comes with it if your vegan because I'm pretty sure there is dairy in it. While this was not the best veggie burger of my life, I was very impressed with how moist and substantial the veggie patty was. It had a strong red pepper flavor & seemed to be mostly made of lentils. I only finished half & was stuffed!! For follow vegetarians they also offer veggie patties on any of their traditional burgers & have a portobello mushroom sandwich.
