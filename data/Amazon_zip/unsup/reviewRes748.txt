I have eaten at many great restaurants, but none come close to Alinea. From the minute you step in to the violet glowing hallway you know you it's going to be a wild ride. And that it was. There are enough reviews here so I will not bore you with the details, however, the food and the amazing presentation of it all was unbelievable. I felt like a kid at Disneyland, anticipating each course to see what surprise it would bring. Now ,let's be clear if the food was not spot on, any show in the world would not impress me. The success of Alinea is that the chef pulls off the most delicious mouth explosions that are works of art. One more thing, the restaurant"s acoustics are a welcome change from all the super loud places that seem to be the rage. It was a pleasure to be able to hear everyone at our table. Our head waiter was very nice , and very knowledgeable. We had the 12 course with wine pairing. Worth every penny.
