We went as a group: 5 adults and 3 kids. The restaurant was full so we expected that service would be a little slow. Within a few minutes, a manager appeared saying that we would be getting free appetizers because of the delay. I am not sure we deserved it, but we did appreciate it. And the food and beer (Iron Fist A+) were excellent. Nice atmosphere, good lighting, a little loud, but overall a well run establishment. I recommend it wholeheartedly...
