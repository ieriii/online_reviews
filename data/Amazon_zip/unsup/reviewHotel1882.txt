I enjoyed my stay. Probably one of the roomier Ws. I'm definitely a fan of space. The hotel was centrally located. I was able to walk to my favorite Italian restaurant, the Village, and the office. The only tip for improvement would be for the concierge to brush up on their restaurants and their restaurant contacts. They couldn't make a certain restaurant reservation for me and they didn't even know about the Village. (sigh) For those of you who are interested: http://www.italianvillag.
