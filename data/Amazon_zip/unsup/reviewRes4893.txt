I got out of work early for Summer Friday and made plans for a late lunch at Purple Pig. Around 2 p.m., there was still a bit of a crowd lingering, but we were able to snag a nice little seat outside. It was a bit chilly, but the heating lamps were fantastic. I have to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we ordered several small dishes to share but forgot to save room for dessert. What we shared was: - Roasted beets w/ whipped goat cheese...so good. And quite a lot for sharing. - Chorizo stuffed olives...major flavor explosion. - Charred cauliflower w/ cornichons...really delicious. Something even a non-cauliflower lover would enjoy. - Prosciutto bread balls...these were fine, but I wasn't overly impressed. Reminded me of meatballs (duh...) - Fried manchego with quince paste...kind of a glorious version of a mozzerella stick. yum. And here's where we reached the tipping point: pork rillete with crostini. Good lord. This was just so rich, I almost felt like it should've come with a warning. There was a LOT of it too, which would've required more crostini to finish. Alas, we'd met our match and had to throw down our napkins in defeat. I was expecting a much higher bill, but for all that deliciousness, plus one glass of wine and an Italian IPA, I felt like it was a steal for $67. Definitely going to make a return!
