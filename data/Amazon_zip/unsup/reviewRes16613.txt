If you don't like this place then you don't have class. No TVs, great drinks, and a printed list of "No's", like "No base ball caps on backwards" to keep the "bro" level way down in the hole. The only problem is that because Chicago has only a few classy places to drink, the waiting line is exceptionally long. Which means they should open up another location in Logan Square or close down the one in Wicker Park and reopen in Logan Square
