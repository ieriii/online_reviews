Not @ all what I expected with the Pizza, Way too East coast for me, But hey, The beer was awesome here, Great selection with many being made on the premises, I'll 4 star the Beer but 2.5 star the Pizza, When I want great Chicago style Pizza I go to La Gondola on Ashland or Lou Malnati's on Damen & North Ave.
