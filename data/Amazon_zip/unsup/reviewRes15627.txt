I'm not a huge fan of the idea of exclusivity, and this place reeks of it. A seat per person, some staff with attitude, yea i had mixed feelings about the place. Walking in, the tall chairs reminded me of Alice in Wonderland (i know it didn't to others, but that was the first thing i thought of). One thing i didn't know was that i was risking expulsion by texting on my phone. I was giving play-by-play of my experience and also getting the stink eye from staff. I also risked expulsion by standing. That's right, no cell phone use and no standing allowed. You are to sit at all times. Apparently you have to crawl back to the exit when leaving (obviously you don't have to do that but there's a sign in the bathroom that says no standing). The drinks are in the $12-20 range but you'll see why when you taste it. The drinks are solid and hella strong. I should say though you can probably take a nap or do a crossword while waiting for your drink to come out. The music wasn't too loud which was nice as we were able to hold conversations at normal decibels. Also, they have coat racks...sweet.
