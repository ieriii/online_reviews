I just took my husband here for his birthday and we had the BEST time! It was my first time dining in the cellar, though I've frequented the bar after work and have thoroughly enjoyed tasting my way through the wine list. Anyways, I have to say that from the moment we walked in, we were treated like VIPs. When I made my reservation, I had mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday, and the staff all did a great job of making it a special night. You absolutely HAVE to take advantage of the flights if you dine here, we had a great time trying so many different wines and cheeses. My husband loved his hanger steak, which was perfectly prepared. We also tried the tandoori chicken sausage and I discovered a new favorite...sooo good. We were happy with everything, left with big smiles on our faces, and will definitely be back for more. :)
