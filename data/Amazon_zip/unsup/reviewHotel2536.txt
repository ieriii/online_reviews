So, when I went in here on a Friday with friends and fam, I was like, hmmm. 1st- the sign outside looks like a scary movie sign. Like, it looks abandoned, but there's this compelling force that makes you want to go in. Besides, all the other stupid people were right on their way in. So, shoot, we should get killed by Freaky Jason too. 2nd- Walked in (after a stupid 20 dollar cover) and it was not what I expected. I expected the victor to be a grown and sexy shin dig. It was just a night club filled with youngers and one sexed crazed dude. He was trippin, oh yes he was girl! 3rd- After about 20mins, got me a bottle of my Moscato d'asti Saracco 2007 I believe they had, or maybe 8 and then, the DJ started doing HIS THANG!! I mean, throw back stuff for at least 30mins and I was like, this is it. It was an enjoyable night. However, I would not go back if there's something else live and poppin or if I can get there before 11 when it was free.
