amazing! I've heard all sorts of great things about this place and I finally took the time to head up to Andersonville and how I regret not going before. They don't take reservations, so we went very early, 5pm, on a friday and got to sit in the outdoor patio. Their beer selection is impressive. We had the mussels in the beer sauce, special duck confit eggroll, and tilapia sandwich. It's a cool place - with no pretentions - as refreshing as their beer!
