Okay so I was in Chicago for a day this spring and I decided to follow fellow Yelper's suggestions and get to the brunch at the Bongo Room. I got there when it opened and it was already busy in there, not packed, but busy. I sat at the bar, next to another person who was just in town for the day or weekend, she ordered french toast and I ordered the spinach, roasted tomato, and feta Eggs Benedict. When my neighbors food came out I had second guessed my choice in menu items, she had piled high french toast with fresh fruit and powdered sugar... It looked and smelled like a good dream. Then mine came out, now Eggs Benedict can't ever look like a good dream, I mean it's just sloppy, but it smelled and tasted AMAZING. Their potatoes could have been crispier but I admit I forgot to ask for them to be extra crispy, they were seasoned well though... Beware of the large portions here, and eat your food slowly (okay, mom), otherwise the flavor will take over and your plate will be clean before you know it. My neighbor said hers was fantastic as well, she also said her mimosa was one of the best she had had. So this combined with excellent service and moderate brunch pricing, makes for a easy five star review.
