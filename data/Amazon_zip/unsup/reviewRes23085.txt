I think this was the first official Greek restaurant I went to, so I have nothing to compare it with but I loved it. The place is pretty big and it was super packed. I wish I tried the Greek beer at the bar, but I shall try it next time. Everything about this restaurant screams Greek and its really cute. You gotta get the cold spread sampler. All of them were soo good. The saganaki was awesome too!!
