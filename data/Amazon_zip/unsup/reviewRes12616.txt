Everything you would expect from a high-end churrascaria. Expansive salad bar - check. Lot's of high quality meat - check. Attentive service - check. I was hoping for a few distinctive meat offers and found none. All the perquisite cuts were there in the beef department but only one chicken, one pork and sausage. Not even a bacon covered something or other. I'm not a big fan of hearts or liver, but I wouldn't have minded it for variety-sake. I really would have appreciated grilled shrimp, but sounds like this is not in their repertoire. One thing I didn't expect was to see a woman on a trapeeze behind glass supposedly there to pull out bottles of wine from the two-story high wall. Kinda cool, but nothing to bump them up a star for.
