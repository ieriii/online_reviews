Go here! Just do it. The atmosphere is sweet. A little dark, a little cramped and a little busy which just makes it even cozier, more Italian. The service is attentive but not overbearing and the evening ran great from start to finish. Excellent date spot. The grilled calamari appetizer is huge with plenty of squid, roasted red peppers and makes for a great bread dipping sauce once the calamari is gone. For dinner I had the veal parmesan which was the LARGEST plate of food I have seen in a while. Seriously, it was served on a platter. The veal was pounded nice and thin and cooked well. There were 3 patties with the entree and I had plenty of leftovers for another meal. My only complaint was that is came with penne and I prefer my _______ parmesans to come with classic spaghetti. The pumpkin ravioli was extra plump and full of pumpkin deliciousness. My folks both enjoyed their veal entrees as well as the asparagus salad we all shared. Last but not least, DO NOT SKIP THE TIRAMASU! Hands down one of the BEST tiramsu's I have ever had. Yep, it's that good. Salud!
