Sorry, Brazzaz, Texas de Brazil is better. We arrived promptly at 5 p.m. on a Wednesday - that's when their doors open. And yet, despite the restaurant being 97% empty, the hostess had us wait five minutes for a seat. I think it was just a power-play on her part. We sat down and got the green light for the salad bar, which was good, but not great.  And honestly, when I hit Brazilian steakhouses, I'm not looking to load up on sushi, cold chicken and whatnot. But since we were there right when they opened, the Meat Cowboys were nowhere to be seen. I made my obligatory trip up to Saladville. Eventually, I started to see the meat making its rounds and I flipped my disc to let the Meat Bearers know it was time to take down some animals. The food was good, but a lot of the meat was very fatty. I flashed back to my two visits to Texas de Brazil and recalled that wasn't the case with them. But the meat at Brazzaz seemed to miss the mark. Something I did prefer about Brazzaz was that they'd bring mashed potatoes and rice directly to your table, along with the customary banana for pallet cleaning. It's nice to have an array of sides within arm's reach. At TdB, you can get rice, but it's up at the salad bar. Unfortunately, we were in a rush to hurry out of there, so I didn't get a chance to sample everything on their menu, but from the seven or eight meats that were brought 'round, I was pleased, just not impressed. Brazzaz is a nice place to go - it looks nice - it feels nice - the food is nice. But if you really want a "wow" experience, hoof it to Texas de Brazil.  Brazzaz is like the WNBA, while Texas de Brazil is the NBA All-Star Game.
