Probably the best Cantonese in Chicago. Especially the soups - the broth is top-notch.  Hon Kee down the street does a few of the BBQ items better (char sui in particluar) but the dishes here are much better. At $28, the five course peking duck (feeds 3-4 people) is practically giving it away.Anyone who thinks this place doesn't have atmosphere need to die. This place has atmosphere an interior decorator couldn't buy with a million dollars,
