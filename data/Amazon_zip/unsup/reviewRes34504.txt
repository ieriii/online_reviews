On a lovely Monday morning that both the hubs and I had taken a vacation day, we finally decided to venture to the one South Loop eating establishment we hadn't tried yet. And we were not disappointed. The place was surprisingly busy for a Monday at 10:30 am, but we were seated at the counter within 5-10 minutes of arriving. We started off with coffee, which lived up to the rave reviews we had heard (mmm Metropolis...). He went with eggs benedict, and I decided on a California omelet. Holy cow, portions are ENORMOUS here. I made it through about half of my omelet, 1/3 of my pancakes, and all of my fruit (yay!)...and I came here ravenous. The omelet was really tasty and unique; I'd never had chunks of avocado or sauteed garlic in an omelet before. And while garlic may not have been the best choice for a morning meal, boy was it tasty. The pancakes were your normal tasty pancakes, and the fruit was the perfect light touch to an otherwise heavy meal. The hubs actually made it through all of his benedict, but it was a battle. The prices are fair, the staff is friendly, and the food is good. We'll definitely return.
