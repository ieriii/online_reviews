Went here for a birthday celebration. There was 25 in the party so we were in the side/back room. The burgers were OK, fries average at best and worst of all the ketchup was runny and tasted as if it had been watered down. So food OK not good, but the waitress was nice and the drinks were flowing so we decided to stay. Then hostess came in to inform us that we were loud and she couldn't seat the other tables and they had a considerable wait so it was an issue. We took the hint and immediately asked for the check. While waiting for the check I walked into the dining room to find a washroom and noticed that there was NO wait and lots of open tables. So thanks for the lie. Our $700 check wasn't enough? If we had been left to continue the celebration the Bad Apple would have received the remainder of our business that the other establishment got another $300. I will never return and neither will the other 24 in the group. Don't waste your time or money on a not so great burger, runny ketchup and MAJOR attitude from the front of the house.
