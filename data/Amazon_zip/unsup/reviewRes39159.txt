This is a great place for groups- large and small. The food is great, the dining is very communal, and the restaurant is large and now takes reservations. It can be a little difficult your first visit if you are unfamiliar with Korean food, as the place is usually pretty busy, the staff moves about quickly, and you will see plumes of smoke rising into giant overhead hood vents right at diners' tables. But don't fear, you will get the hang of it and become hooked! If you are a meat-eater, you have the opportunity to grill cuts of meat and seafood right at your table or have it cooked in the kitchen. You get a lot of little appetizer dishes to start which is fun to try and share. If you are a vegetarian, I recommend the Dol Sot Bebimbop- just ask for no beef. If you are vegan get it without egg as well- it will still be very delicious!  The space is large and although not anywhere near "fine" dining, it's comfortable. The service is fast, and while some of the staff don't have great English-speaking skills, there are a couple of ladies there who can help if you have questions and will even poke fun at you, in a playful way. Heads up that your clothes will smell like a cookout when you leave, and also if you are in a large group, you will most likely be sitting in a semi-private raised floor area. You will have to remove your shoes and sit on the floor of the area- so keep that in mind for people who may be uncomfortable with that. There is a parking lot, but it's very tight and you risk having people bump and scratch you car more than usual, but there is free street parking in the area. Lastly, there is a very small waiting area, and they will not seat your party until everyone is there. These may sound like a lot of obstacles to deal with for food- but I'm telling you that it's worth it. If you haven't had Korean food- give this place a shot!
