Absolutely fantastic beer list with a wide variety to chose from...loads of Belgians and triples, my personal favorite, so I was happy. Plus, they have some tasty wine too if beer isn't your thang. As far as the food in concerned I really think the way to go is the mussels. The fries are usually excellent as well, nice and thin and crispy, yum! Personally, I think the rest of the menu is kinda lacking and the desserts are defiantly not worth the calories. Service is hit or miss, sometimes they are nice and sometimes super duper BITC*Y. Go for some beer and tasty mussels.
