I work down the street from Kinzie Chop House and am a huge fan of their outdoor seating area for a quick drink after work. They have a great wine list, a tuna tartar that I dream about and their staff could easily be named the friendliest in the city. About a month ago, some co-workers and myself were looking for a new place to grab lunch and I suggested we try Kinzie. I was floored! I ordered the grilled shrimp salad.The shrimp was huge, fresh and perfectly grilled. There is a perfect amount of goat cheese and the most amazing marinated red peppers you have ever tasted. I recently went back and was talked into trying the mushroom ravioli and was blown away again. Perfectly prepared ravioli with the most amazing cream sauce. I highly recommend Kinzie's lunch menu, and I can't wait to try them for dinner!
