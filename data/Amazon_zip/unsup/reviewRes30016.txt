Upscale Mexican. Yes, it exists. And now, welcome to tequila heaven. They have about 20 or so to choose from. If you're looking for straight up, I recommend the El Tosoro Aejo. MUCH cheaper than the Patron and just as smooth. As for dishes, many are good, although I have had a few misses here. My fav is anything with mole. That sauce is just chocolate, spicy goodness.
