YUUMMMOOO!! I love the cabbage appetizer with crushed red pepper oil they give you at the beginning of your meal. Went to visit my sister downtown and decided we should come here. Good choice, even though she hates Chinese food...how dare her!! lol We got Sichuan Chicken, Chicken fried rice, noodles and some vegetable soup. It fed ALL four of us and it was as scrumptious as I hoped it would be. Spicy food is at the top of my list of things to eat so this place does not disappoint.  My sister also got a mango shake and I couldn't believe how good it was. I will definitely be going back sometime soon. The only downer was when one of the waitresses spilled water on my chest but hey, it happens right? lol
