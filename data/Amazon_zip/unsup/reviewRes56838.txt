Outstanding. We made an earlier reservation and got to sit on the terrace which was perfect. The food selection, preparation and presentation as well as the service was fantastic. Afterwords we headed up to the bar on the roof and had a few more cocktails. If you've not yet been to Le Colonial you need to go.
