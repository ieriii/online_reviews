This was our second time at Big Jones for Brunch, and we were not disappointed... I was pleased to see loose-leaf tea on their menu, and their sweet tea appealed to my Tennessee-born and bred wife. We proceeded to make our way through the menu and ended up ordering the Oat and Raisin Scone, the corn cakes with scrambled eggs, and the grits with shrimp... we sat outside on the back patio, enjoyed excellent service, and will be back again before too long. This is the place that Wishbone aspires to be.
