I went here a few years ago... Didn't have to make reservations, went in around lunch time, and enjoyed everything about this place. The last time I went here, was with my friend Cristobal. We sampled almost everything that came around and just loved it. They have a very nice salad bar in the center of the restaurant to balance out all the meat. I would have to say this place was just amazing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in search of a good steakhouse.
