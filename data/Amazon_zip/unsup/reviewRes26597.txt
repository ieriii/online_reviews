at almost 500 reviews (most favorable), I believe my review won't hold too much weight, but it saddens me to see what has happened to Nuevo Leon. I miss the good old days when the servers were able to take their time and actually wait on their tables. When the food tasted like it was especially prepared for me by La Seora de la Casa, and it was a place where I felt like I could take my time and enjoy my meal.  This place is a mad house and heaven forbid you get seated in the front of the house near the door during a peak time - awkward both for the people waiting for a table, as well as the people eating.  Yes, I am happy for their success, but my most recent trip will probably be my last for a loooooong time. I felt so bad for the older woman who was waiting on our table...I thought she was going to have a heart attack. I can't blame her for forgetting several things we asked for, she was overwhelmed. As for the food, well considering that prior to this visit I use to LOVE their food, this time I could barely chew through the steak - I ended up only eating 1 taco I made from my fajitas. I was grossed out. As for the sides, they were ok. Nothing special..which makes me sad. I really was looking forward to going back since I hadn't been there for about a year or so. :-( Again...when a place has this many reviews, one more is just like another grain of sand on a beach...but I was so disappointed I had to voice my opinion...for whatever it's worth. Word of warning...if Nuevo Leon's lot is full and you park on the street feed those meters...those meter maids are just circling like sharks looking to slap stickers on vehicles with expired parking meter tickets.
