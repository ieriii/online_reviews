just go here. and try everything. you couldn't possibly be disappointed with anything you order. the chips and guac are amazing. the milanesa is perfect. chicken tinga = yum pepitos = yum the ahogada is amazing. it comes in a spicy tomato soup-ish broth and it's to die for. if you go during peak lunch or dinner hours, be prepared to wait. but also be prepared to not care once you've tasted rick bayless' delicious food.
