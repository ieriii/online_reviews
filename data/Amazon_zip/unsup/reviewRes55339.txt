My favorite place for kabobs in Chicago. This place serves amazing food. And now that they've expanded a bit, the wait isn't too bad. The only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars is that the service isn't very consistent. I've had good service sometimes, and other times our server has been just awful. But the food is always good and I will always drive across the city to have it. Ribeye and shrimp combo is my usual. The lamb shank is also really good.
