Cool. I never had authentic KBQ before. I'm gonna call it the KBQ because it sounds awesome when I say it. Only when I say it. So you get your own charcoal pit and like 50 different little Korean tapas. Sweet, because there's so much variety for someone like me with little attention span. My friends ordered so I couldn't tell you what we had. I assume it was pretty traditional (I hope). From what I can remember some of the dishes ended in "-gogi." So these two large plates of raw marinated meat come out with tongs.  We just lay the stuff on the fire and eat...it...up. I'm all over the seaweed, the kimchi, the weird fish noodles, and the miso-like soup. And before I know it, my beef - cooked. It's cool because everyone's cooking for everyone else. See if it were up to me I wouldn't notice that right away; my self centered butt would solely be concerned with my own meat. I know, I'm an ass. Be sitting there with tongs in one hand and chopsticks in the other. But I have good friends and they showed me the way. The cooking and watching the meat for me was more meditative rather than just waiting for the next piece to be ready. I really enjoyed that part of it. Taking care of the pieces up there on the grill - making sure they don't get burned or stuck. Even better, my clothes smell like KBQ now. Whatever - they're open 'til 3AM, so I'll deal with that. Hours alone gives them 6 stars.
