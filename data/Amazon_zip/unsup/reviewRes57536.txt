This place is a joke. The food is disgusting and the dust alone on the wine bottles is enough to make you throw up. I left reeking of fishy oil that never came out of my clothes. Our African American server stunk of booze and it was only 9pm. His breath was a liquor cabinet. I was shocked. I wanted to remind him that he was playing with fire and to perhaps think before he drinks ON THE JOB!! The one decent thing is the chocolate. I would never come back but if I did ha this is the only thing on the entire menu worth a sinlge dollar. This place is a joke. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!
