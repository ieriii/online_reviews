I know this place has a huge number of reviews - well worth the popularity and high ratings. I too will jump on the bandwagon and say that this place was outstanding. I took a friend visiting from out of town who wanted to eat at a steakhouse downtown - I suggested we try this place instead of the typical tourist traps.  We were not disappointed! Our meal was back in Mid-March (I'm late in writing the review) and it was one of those freakishly warm March days. We sat on the patio outside. The atmosphere, inside and out, was great. The place was packed. We ordered wine and several small plates. I had some calamari that was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I also ordered an eggplant and goat cheese bread dish (eggplant caponata "smear") that was phenomenal. I know my friend really enjoyed his steak and the other dishes he ordered. I would definitely return!
