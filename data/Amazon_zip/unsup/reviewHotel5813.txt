This place was not worth the money at ALL. If I would've known it was this bad, I would've spend twice the money and stayed downtown. The staff is rude and unprofessional. The whole place is in a bad area and it's dirty and run down. The 'free parking' is hilarious. The parking...uh.. 'structure' is totally unsafe and it was SO hard to even park! The elevator was shakey and felt like it was going to break down, the hallways are dark and the rooms are not welcoming at all. There was hair (from someone shaving) in the sink, a ponytail holder laying on the sink (geez, I felt like someone was already STAYING IN THAT ROOM!), the towel I used had makeup and what looked like spaghetti sauce on it, and when asked (two days in a row I might add) for more, they promised to bring them within 15 minutes and they never came. The shower was making a screeching noise and our room flooded!!! We had to move rooms ..wet luggage and all... in the middle of the night and we had to wake up early the next day. We also asked for the manager in the daytime and nighttime 4 days in a row and he was never available or they said "he would call up to our room in a few minutes" and he never did. I left my name and number when I checked out and they never called me. I'm in the middle of dealing with the corporate headquarters now. DON'T STAY HERE. It isn't worth it!!!
