The old lady and I headed north to this fine lil' place for a fancy-schmancy 7-course V-Day dinner this year. Twas my first and only time there. The food was pretty great. I'd say 6 out of the 7 courses were right on. Especially the 'main' 5th course - pheasant with quinoa and some mango - it was rich, filling, juicy, and the all the flavors hit the palate just right. Second favorite was the last course, mixed berries with cream and some port wine sabayon - fresh, light, sweet... everything it was supposed to be. Overall the meal was totes fab! The cappuccino we had to wash down the meal was also delightful. Big plus: the place was BYOB. And since we knew the menu ahead of time, we could match a wine perfectly AND stay within our (tiny tiny) budget. The only drawback was the ambiance/decor. I understand the place is primarily a cafe/bakery, so that might have had something to do with it, but there wasn't much on the walls and with the exposed brick and all it felt a bit warehouse-ish. I did like the smallness and intimacy of the place though. I signed up for their 'underground' list and am looking forward to having another meal there. Word?
