The best freak'n hot dog restaurant in the country, hands down, one of the coolest places i've been to, and its all really affordable. Make sure you come with plenty of room to be able to try atleast 2 or three, I had the foie gras, atomic dog, truffel infused dog, salma hyeck loaded with all the chicago hot dog regualrs, if you gotta ask what those are you need to get experienced my friend. Yes this is one of the coolest place to eat in the country let along chicago. oh yeah, only down side is their hours, only open till 4pm, and closed on mondays i think...24 hours doug, and you'd be a billionare....
