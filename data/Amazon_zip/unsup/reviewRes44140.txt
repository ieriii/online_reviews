Strolled by here yesterday and decided to walk in after spending a good 10 minutes admiring the cake art in their window display. Friendly staff, yummy treats, I'm into it! I made the person helping me repeat the macaron flavors about 10 times before I realized they were written right in front of my face, but she didn't complain. I'm eating a rose macaron right now, in fact. I'll return! I do wish they had just a couple more gluten-free options around. Oh, and they should make maple macarons, that's a really underrated flavor, IMO. But, you know, not every place can cater to me.
