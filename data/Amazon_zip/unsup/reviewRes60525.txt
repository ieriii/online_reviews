Food was good, but the wait to get a table was about 30-45 minutes. Which I guess is not too bad in Lakeview on a Friday. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. The setting can be rather intimate depending on where you are seated. I was placed in the area that look like a study. The beer selection is great, they have a lot of my favorites. If I am in the area, I would go back for that alone.
