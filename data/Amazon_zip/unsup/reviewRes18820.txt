I already think Rick Bayless is a total rock star. Love his show, love his recipes and he seems like a genuinely nice guy. Went here twice on a recent trip to Chicago and really enjoyed it both times. It is not oh-my-goodness amazing but an excellent take on Mexican street food. First, we went for an early dinner and we split the Ahogada torta and the seafood cocktail with red sauce. I have wanted to try the Ahogada for some time and while I can get tortas easily in Dallas, I haven't come across this one. Total deliciousness! It's golden pork carnitas with black beans in a spicy tomato broth. Think a Mexican version of a French dip. The broth was so robust and flavorful. Definitely one of the best sandwiches I've had. The seafood cocktail (with shrimp and scallops if I remember correctly) was also quite tasty.  The second time was for breakfast. I had chilaquiles with scrambled eggs and my boyfriend had an egg and poblano empanada. The chilaquiles were so good. I wish there had been a little more egg but other than that, I was a very happy camper. We also split an order of churros which we had with the classic hot chocolate. I love churros, you can't go wrong. I could eat these all the time. And the hot chocolate was so rich and perfectly complemented the fried sugary goodness. Breakfast, lunch, dinner...it doesn't matter, make sure you get the churros! They list the sources of their menu items and are committed to supporting local farmers and purveyors which I really like. Plus Rick was there the first time, tasting the food and talking to the staff. Quality is what really sets Xoco apart.
