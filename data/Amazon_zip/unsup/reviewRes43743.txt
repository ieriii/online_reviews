I love this place. If it wasn't for the insanity of the crowds on weekends, I'd stop by more often. Actually it's better to come here alone because there always seems to be an available seat at the counter. The breakfasts are the best. They give you oversized cups of coffees. The hot chocolates have hearts in them...how can you not like that? They make their own granola. The portion sizes are decent. And their huevos rancheros are the best ever.
