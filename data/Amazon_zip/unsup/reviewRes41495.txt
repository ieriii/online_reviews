This is by far the best steakhouse on the planet. Who cares if it's a chain? I began going to Ruth's since high school. My mom would take me there every year for my birthday. When I moved to Chicago I began going every few months. Honest to god I have never had a a bad experience there. Excellent service and the food is TO DIE FOR. Check it out!
