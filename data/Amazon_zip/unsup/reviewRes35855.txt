"Everyday is a good day for a good fish" The reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because I don't remember how the fish tasted. I am pretty sure it was not impressive, otherwise I would've remember that. Although, the portions are descent size and their stuff are helpful. Parking could be problematic, I'd rather valet. This place is usually crowded, if you are thinking about a romantic dinner... I would "fish" somewhere else.
