I went to Nana's a few months ago and was in love. Not crowded like other brunch spots on the north side, warm decor, natural lighting, and a menu that had too many delicious options. I was trying to negotiate to share plates with my boyfriend so that I could try as much as possible. I settled on the corn-oat waffles and they were perfect. Not too sweet, crunchy outside-chewy inside. I had a cappacino with it and it was made expertly. Everyone else was thrilled with their food (so much so that there was really no sharing going on) and the staff was attentive. NOW, the thing that has pushed me to write a review on yelp was that I emailed Nana's to ask about the corn waffles and to ask if in fact they are gluten-free as my sister has a gluten intolerance and was looking for restaurants that have GF options. The Executive Chef emailed me back an incredibly thoughtful response. he checked with the retailer of the oats they use in the waffles and was assured that yes, they are GF, then went on to explain his experience and knowledge about Celiac and GF, AND gave me resources and recipes for GF cooking! Who does that?! People that truly care and have amazing business practices-that's who. Nana is a gem, the food was great, but to me what really sets it apart is the care of the customers and you can get better than Nana's!
