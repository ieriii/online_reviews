One more five-star review for the pile. Hot Doug's takes the familiar Vienna Beef store and turns it into an orgy of encased meats. The line is intimidating, but it moves pretty swiftly and is well worth the half hour you'll probably wait in it.  If you go with a friend, then you should each order two different dogs and split them. Also, add on a corn dog. They go down smooth.
