I was underwhelmed during my first visit, and even more underwhelmed after I got back from Costa Rica. The food is fine. It's fresh and tastes good. But MAN, is it overpriced! I chowed down in Costa Rica on casado (meat, beans, and rice) at $5-7 a a pop.  Irazu's casado tops $15.  Even as the only Costa Rican restaurant in Chicago, skip it and go to one of the area's many (and phenomenal) Mexican or Puerto Rican places.
