So im a bit biased because i work here, so i wont talk about anything other than this. we do take reservations, just not for holidays, or week nights. we take them for : Monday-Fri from 11am-12pm, and 1:30pm-5:30pm for parties of 4 or more only. and if u want a special request, like the window or rotunda you can only request those once at the restaurant, and its possible you might have to wait for them, even if you had a reso. if we're on a wait, we give out pagers that alert you when the table is ready. we have valet parking for $14 for 3 hours and $25 for 3-6 hours. the food takes about 15-20 mins once put in, and a few of our desserts are baked to order and take 1/2 an hour. so we suggest you put it when you get your entree. when u first check in upstairs or downstairs with a hostess you should put in certain seating request then, it might increase the time by a little, but it wont be as long as compared to telling them while they take you to your table. we only serve breakfast/brunch on the weekends. hope that makes your experience a bit better.
