Wishbone satisfies all your Southern cravings. Be it Lousiana, South Carolina or Kentucky... you'll find what you're looking for here if you're missing some good ol' down home cookin'. There's rarely ever a wait, even if you're going at noon on a Saturday for brunch. This is due, in part, to the size of this place--it's pretty huge and the seating capacity is high. Two dishes I can highly recommend: shrimp and grits and biscuits and gravy. Not many places in this city offer biscuits and gravy. Well, they might offer them, but they SUCK. Wishbone, however, delivers. Service is excellent. Your coffee cup will be refilled constantly.
