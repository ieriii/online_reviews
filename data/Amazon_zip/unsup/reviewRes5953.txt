Davanti Enoteca lived up to its high expectations. The hype has been big - Yelp reviews, Check Please, and the recent top restaurant award given by Chicago magazine set the expectations bar pretty high. But the food was great, prices were phenomenal, and the environment is very cool rustic Italian. The only problem, of course, is the wait and lack of reservations. We got there at 9:30 on a Saturday night, figuring that the wait would have died down somewhat - wrong! They announced an hour and a half wait. No worries - I assured my friends that we were great bar hawkers. My husband and I have the uncanny ability to hawk seats at the bar, which means we've never had to wait at Kuma's for more than 15 minutes. Got a seat at the bar, which, for starters, is not very big. If you're not taking reservations and you're that popular, it might be helpful to have a bigger waiting area - just saying. Hopefully the new rooftop patio that is supposed to be opening up will help alleviate some of the crowds. Ordered a pizza, which came up quickly and was absolutely delicious - light crust, great herbs and flavor. We got seated much quicker than initially told. We ordered a number of appetizers, all which were great. The truffle toast and polenta were delicious. The grilled asparagus and the seared hearts of palm were my favorite, though - just bursting with complex flavors.  Wines are inexpensive, so it's almost like you are at a BYOB. The decor is rustic and comfortably chic. I would totally go back, as the price is right, the food is great, portions are perfectly sized, and great ambience. And Taylor Street is fabulous - the night would have been perfect if only Mario's was open when we left!
