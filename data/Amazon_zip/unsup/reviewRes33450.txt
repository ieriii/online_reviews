The correct answer for this place is: Falafel. I had heard about Sultan's Market a few times and clearly by the hundreds of reviews on Yelp you can tell that this place is getting it done.  I was lucky enough to have rehearsals scheduled in Wicker Park a few blocks away for 6 weeks with about an hour and a half to kill between work and start time. What did I do? I ate a falafel sandwich every week for 6 weeks. And I got excited each and every time.  I even took my mother here who fears any kind of "exotic" cuisine (i.e. not meat and potatoes) and she loved it. She got the spinach pie and I was able to steal a few bites, I can concur it was great. I always wanted to try their salad bar because it looks incredible, but I couldn't stray from my old trusty.  The only bad news is I kind of overdosed on this place and haven't been back in a long time, and that makes me sad since it is delicious, fresh, and crazy-cheap. Learn from my mistake and pace yourself with this one so you can enjoy every now and then for years to come.
