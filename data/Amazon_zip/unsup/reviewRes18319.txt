Ok...so, when my friend insisted upon meeting me here, I kept thinking "what dive bar am I going to now...."...See, I was trying to visit a new, supposedly hip spot in Logan Square...but NO....I had to go to the Bad Apple. Well - I was wrong. The Bad Apple is GOOD. First of all, it's no dive bar. It's more of a gastropub - dark wood, a nice long bar and a mix of tables. There are a ton of beers here - many of which I have never heard of (well, let's face it, I'm more of a wine girl anyway...). However, I drank beer that night and the bartender suggested something that was really great! Some sort of IPA - I don't remember what. And the food - surprise! It's delicious! Again - I think I put too much stock in the name and the fact that the friend I was there with always insists upon crappy bars... Anyway, the food is great. I had a burger that was perfectly cooked with some delicious fries. There was nothing I could find to complain about in terms of the food. I liked the atmosphere, but I will admit that it gets a bit crowded. I would have preferred to sit at a table, because in the end, I got smooshed at the bar and then when I got up to go to the bathroom, my friend had to almost fight off someone for my chair (yes, with not only my coat on it, but a full meal in front of it!).  Anyway, aside from the crowd, this place was spot on. If you want a quiet night, this is probably not the right spot, but for great food, a lively atmosphere and a great beer selection (at reasonable prices), this is a good bet in the area.
