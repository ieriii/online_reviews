i came here for my second dinner. it's a testament to how awesome publican, both for drinks and food, that i spent mad $$$$ after an already expensive first sushi dinner. we were over 40 minutes early, so we first shared a round robin table with another group that we briefly got to know and toasted before being seated for our actual reservations. love the ambiance, so schoolhouse-rock and the unique enclosed jail-like tables. food was tasty too. yum to charcuterie plate, trout, sweetbreads and rilletes as well as the wide variety of beers and house-brewed cider. this makes for a super fun, if costly, night out.
