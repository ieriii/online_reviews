We waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night for Voilet Hour. People walking by repeatedly shouting "It's SO not worth the wait", "Get over this place!" but we stood our grounds and did not waiver, even with Big Star and their delish smelling tacos and beers on tap. There's about 342 lines you have to wait in before you actually get seated, or so it seems. Eventually we got seated at the bar. Our bartender was a man of few words and although we tried, no conversation was started. Oh well... This place is nice, classy and upscale. The drink prices actually do not reflect that, as they are standard cocktail prices. Win in my book. We ordered all the drinks of their signature cocktails menu: Juliet & Romeo, Thick as Thieves, and one from the Whiskey choices, and one with egg whites. Juliet & Romeo was definitely my favorite. What I would give to be seated in those awesome vintage arm chairs.
