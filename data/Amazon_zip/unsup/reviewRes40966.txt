Took my Dinner Club here on Tuesday night for the $30 prix fixe, and we had an excellent time. VERY small space, so definitely make reservations. Everyone who worked there was nice and accommodating, especially our server who graciously answered all of our stupid questions:)  I had the oxtail and bone marrow starter which was rich and delicious. Others loved the sweet onion soup and sashimi apps. For entree I had the onion consomme with ravioli, which was interesting and tasty, but not as good as the escolar. Chocolate mousse for dessert, also great, but not as good as the banana bread pudding and creme brulee.  Great price, nice ambiance, kind people, interesting and delicious food. Ladyfriends all said they'd go back, and so will I.
