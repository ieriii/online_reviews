These may be the best wings I've ever eaten in my life. My wife and I stopped in after seeing BMG and we ordered 10 wings and a steak bowl. It was more than we could eat! The wings are so big that the drumette portion is bigger than some actual drumsticks I've seen. I'd be afraid to meet that chicken in a dark alley...We had half sassy Seoul and half BBQ and both were delicious. The steak bowl has excellently seasoned bulgogi-style beef and perfect rice. I think a five-piece wing or a bowl would be plenty for one person (either one is around eight bucks).It is a unique ambience - big slab tables and a couple of counters with bar stools. If you can get the window seat, though, it's great for people watching while you eat. This place is so good that we'll make a special trip downtown just to come here again.
