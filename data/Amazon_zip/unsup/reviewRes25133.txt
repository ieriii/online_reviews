DISAPPOINTING! I had been wanting to try this restaurant for months when I finally got the chance to head out that way. The reviews were plentiful and positive, the photos were deliciously tempting, and the menu looked great. However, I was seriously disappointed in the food and service we received. The guacamole was fresh but tasteless. It needed some lime or lemon, salt, and cilantro. The oatmeal shake that everyone raves about tasted like plain oatmeal in a cup with a straw. Nothing spectacular whatsoever. My food was not prepared the way I asked for...how hard is it to make French fries extra crispy? To top it off, my bf and I waited one hour....yes an HOUR for our food! He ordered one of the steak dinners and I got a simple sandwich. They obviously forgot about us in the kitchen. There was no apology or adjustment to our bill for our bad experience. Oh and btw....they only accept cash. Come on! This is supposed to be a decently nice restaurant. How CHEAP can u be to not accept credit cards? We will definitely not be back. It's unfortunate because I really wanted to like this place.
