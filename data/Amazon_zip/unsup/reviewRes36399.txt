This is quite possibly my FAV brunch place! It has awesome (and a gaziliion) menu choices, daily special items, healthy and organic stuff and it's just damn good. It can get costly the healthier you go, but it's so worth it. I really dig it here. And their coffee and juices are heavenly. There's a bunch of jam on the table for you to choose from and every time I have dined here, I never left disappointed. Ever. I want to try everything on the menu - they have sooooo much to offer and I'm sure it's all good. I have never had lunch here - but bfast/brunch is more my thang anyway. I tend to go for a special of the day - but the skillets and scramblers are ah-may-ZIIIING!!!!!! Beware as it gets BUSY on the weekends...I'm talking about people waiting outside - even when it's freezing. That def tells you something - and I, myself, as impatient as it gets...but this is worth the wait. Or would be...as my hubby and I tend to go early to avoid all that nonsense. :) Go! Seriously, it really is a MUST and a Stand Out in our land of food.
