Let me preface this by saying that I attended a dinner for about 30 people here so I didn't choose my own dishes. But the people hosting the dinner know I'm vegetarian so I expected there to be things for me to eat. So with that in mind, absolutely steer clear of this place if you're vegetarian and especially if you're a vegetarian who is allergic to nuts, like me. The starters were taramosalata which I've never seen before and looks bizarrely like hummus but has fish in it so I couldn't eat it, dolmades, which have meat in them here for some reason and saganaki which was actually delicious. There was Greek salad which didn't have actual mixed greens, just romaine/iceberg lettuce. And for the main course there was vegetarian mousaka, which was basically a lot of oily potatoes, chicken and gyros. I wouldn't say that I'm the absolute healthiest person on earth, but somehow cheese, iceberg lettuce and potatoes doesn't seem like the best thing for you. The people that did have the meat around me weren't too thrilled about it either. Oh and I can't forget the dessert that I couldn't have---cookies and baklava. Apparently even the cookies have nuts in them! I asked one of the managers if there was any dessert that didn't have nuts in it. He told me there was and I asked if I could sub that since I'm allergic. He said no. Bummer. I'll never go back and I'll be sure to make sure the people I know stay away as well. Makes me sad that they can't be even a little accommodating.
