Oh my goodness gracious! We were a group of 7 on a Sunday night and what a wonderful time we had. It's definitely a benefit to come with a group, because you can order lots and lots of food. We started with salads, sliced cured meats and the most amazing fried sandwiches that were a crispy flavorful delight. We had two of the special pizze, and two off the regular menu. The specials were topped with anchovies, capers artichoke hearts on one, and prosciutto and olives on the other, OMFG! The salty and savory flavors were perfect. We also had two of the bianco pizze, the four cheese was spectacular, the gorgonzola cheese added just the right amount of funk to keep it from being a one note dish. The other bianco pizze was topped with sausage and rapini and was equally delicious.  Dessert was deeelightful! Yummy spumoni, tiramisu, gelato combined with chilled Limoncello and Strega on the rocks were a perfect finish to a perfect meal. The service was stellar, and this place is beyond clean from top to bottom. I couldn't imagine anyone not enjoying themselves at this very modern vibrant spot.
