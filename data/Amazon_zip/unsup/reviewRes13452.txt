Once again we had an awesome meal at Glenn's. I had a hard time ordering any appetizer other than the crab cakes, which are so-o-o good. So much crab, so little filler. And now there's a menu change. Several items have been added, but only one new one that matters to me.  At lunch on Sundays Glenn's has had their San Francisco Cioppino on the menu. It's called San Francisco's answer to bouillabaisse. It a fabulous thick tomato based soup of lots of delicious seafoods, from shrimp and scallops to whatever whitefish they choose to put in. I've only had a taste of it before, when my wife ordered it on a Sunday afternoon. But NOW, it's on the dinner menu too. So cioppino it was for me. It's absolutely delicious with piles of fresh seafood. Seafood nirvana, as always at Glenn's.  The portion is so large I had plenty to take home for another meal. That's one of Glenn's Diner's values - the greatest restaurant leftovers ever.
