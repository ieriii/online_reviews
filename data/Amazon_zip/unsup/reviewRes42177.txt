A lot of people say this is the best deep dish pizza in the city, and who am I to disagree? Except of course that it's not deep dish pizza, it's pan pizza, but most people seem not to know the difference. (If you're interested, Dane does a whole exegesis of it in his review.) And I generally don't believe in the "best" rankings. But Art does a good job. My first time ordering from Art was almost my last time. I got the thin crust, and I wasn't crazy about it. It was fine, it was serviceable, but nothing to write home about. For whatever reason, the pan is where they shine. The crust is thick enough to stand up to the toppings, but it still cooks through and isn't gooey, unlike *some* places I could mention. The toppings are plentiful, but not ludicrous. And it's great in the morning. All in all, just what you're looking for in a pan pizza. You don't believe me? Go look at some of the pictures people have posted. Kev L does a fine job of capturing the fiery red of the sauce. Go look, I can wait. [Feelings ... nothing more than feelings ... trying to forget those ...] See? Good stuff, huh? If your answer is "no," you should probably skip the Art. I order the Meaty Delight -- sausage, bacon, ground beef, sliced beef, and pepperoni -- because I'm a carnivore, as well as a pig. But they have plenty of other specialties. And if you just want some plain cheese, that's cool too. Bonus! Pan pizza by the slice. Lots of people do slices of thin crust (well maybe not "lots"), but Art does a good pan slice. I assume it's because they have enough turnover that the pizzas don't sit too long. Their calamari sucks, but I didn't have to tell you that, did I?
