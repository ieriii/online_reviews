This is the best place to go in greektown. Free valet parking. Huge menu. Well decorated. Great food. They didn't take reservations until after 7 but I didn't wait that long for a table and it is a big place. Great ambiance and well layed out. We sat on the third level. Ordered a couple of saganakis with a loud Oopah everytime. I recommend the sampler that gives a taste of everything for $20 including dessert. The gyros had a wondeful flavor that I haven't tasted before. I will be back.
