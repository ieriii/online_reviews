I was only used to eating crepes of the sweet, and didn't even know that there was such a thing as savory crepes. Either way, I went with a group of friends, one who particularly stated that this place was delicious. The interior of the restaurant is very ethnic, great service, nice servers. The food, on the other hand, not so much. I started off ordering this 'Arabic juice', which was basically your Indian-styled orange/mango nectar beverage - not worth it. I thought they literally had these housemade, but it just came in a bottle. Disappointing. I ordered the Palace Crepe, which comes with roasted bell peppers, goat cheese chunks, arugula, caramelized onions, Roma tomatoes, pine nuts, baby spinach, and roasted garlic. The crepe itself was a soggy batter mess - it tasted like a bad think pancake. The ingredients itself were not even cooked or infused with the crepe itself - it was like eating a pancake burrito. The goat cheese was not melted, and all the other vegetables were cold. It was disgusting. I did add the Algerian lamb sausage, merguez, and this was the only best thing of the crepes - did not have an intense lamb flavor, seasoned well, but not enough bits for $3. For dessert, I ordered the Crepe Perla, which comes with cajeta, banana, and coconut. This crepe was actually the crepe I was looking forward to - the cajeta was goat's milk caramel, drizzled over the crepe with the banana slices and the coconut. I would come back here for the dessert possibly, but I'm sure you can buy the ingredients and make it at home (and would be even MORE delicious). Overall, this place is a disappointment, and I have yet to find a good creperie in the Chicagoland area.
