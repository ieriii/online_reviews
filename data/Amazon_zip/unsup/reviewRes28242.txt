I was so excited to go here and eat burnt cheese!!!!! After two buses and a long walk I finally found myself drooling over other peoples pan pizza...ordered the pequod salad, actually used real lettuce and it was huge- easily enough for 2 people, maybe 3. Nothing extrordinary but satisfactory. The pizza was a killjoy. What is up with the bisquit crust? First off- the crust is almost and inch thick and 3/4 of it is semi-crunchy like a british bisquit. The bf/cook said that they precook the crust so they can melt the cheese on high heat and get the burnedness...but I wasn't into it(the crust)... and another thing- It's called Salt people- use it. Screw our blood pressure. Bland sauce, bland crust. Not terrible but not worth the two buses and long walk. I would go back if a friend insisted on it- but I was definitely disappointed.
