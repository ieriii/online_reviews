Of course I'd be a fan of one of the more expensive places to get a steak... Although, in my Chicago eating adventures, Ruth's Chris didn't really give me sticker shock (well, except for the fact that my sparkling water cost $8). Anyway, Joe and I came here for our anniversary (3 years!) and it was pretty good. The hostesses were, well, nice enough. I gave them some trash on the seat in the waiting area though. It was strange that they had like four hostesses hanging out around the hostess stand and every now and then they would go and fix the door, but there was trash in the waiting area and we had to bring it to them...  Our server was Anthony and he wished us a happy anniversary. He treated us really well and was attentive and spaced out our dinner really well. We got a really good vibe from all of the servers upstairs - laid back! There was also a mix of people here on a Saturday evening too... Families, people in jeans, and people dressed like they were going to a club afterwards. Oh, and there was a large table of 40-something guys pretending they were still in their college fraternity. Complete with sharing and explaining the different sex shows they'd seen in their time. So romantic! Our steaks and sides were great. I got the filet and Joe got the Cowboy Ribeye (he ate it all too). I ordered my filet medium and it came our rare in parts, but it is such a good and tasty cut of meat that I didn't care. We got mashed potatoes and broccoli gratin as our sides... Unfortunately, I have to say that I needed the mashed potatoes, but then again, I can only remember one steak I've ever eaten that I didn't need mashed potatoes with... For our anniversary, they brought us out a little cupcake desert that was delicious. THEN, Joe ordered the Chocolate Explosion and ate it all... And I ordered the apple tart thing and.... took it home.
