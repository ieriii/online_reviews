Ok. I never thought this possible but I had the salad bar and the salad bar only tonight. It was outstanding. I forced myself to try things I wasn't sure I would like. Wow was I surprised. Brazilian chicken salad. Delicious. Mushroom risotto, seared ahi tuna with mustard sauce, tri colored tortellini, aged parmesan, fresh sushi, Mediterranean tabouli salad, oysters. They were all so good!
