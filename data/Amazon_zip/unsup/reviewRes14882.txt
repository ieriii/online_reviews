I went to Revolution on a Thursday night (around 7:30) and my overall experience was pretty good. There was about a 30 minute wait, but there's a nice seating area complete with a server so you can have a beer while you wait without having to shove your way into the bar. When we were eventually seated our server, Matt, was awesome. Even though the place was pretty packed he was super attentive and never left us waiting for too long. My only complaint is that at this point the menu is pretty short. But with Matt's suggestion i got the pulled pork sandwich and the fries were delicious (i'm picky about fries). I got the house brewed Bottom up (i think think that's what it was called, its a wheat beer) and loved that as well. Prices were decent too.
