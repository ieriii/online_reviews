5 Stars, BUT - I come here for one thing and one thing only - the Pho with Beef, Brisket and Tripe. And man is that delicious. Service is usually fast and friendly with lapses only when they are jammed, so I totally get it.I've been here with family and friends and have gotten a variety of foods here and everyone has always liked everything, even the vegetarians! : )
