Once I discovered Sultan's Market, I became addicted. This place combines QUALITY food with super super super budget friendly prices. Check this out - Falafel sandwich for just $3.95, or a whole falafel dinner (falafel, rice, lentils, cucumber salad, heaping of hummus, and pita) for $6. Nice! The food is very authentic and is served super quick at the counter. Simply tell them what you want and expect it in your hands in about 28 seconds.... maybe 20 seconds if you smile nicely. :-)    Plus, they have a fair selection of middle eastern food items and desserts that you prolly won't find that easily on your own. Sweet items, some things in bottles, other things that my mouth simply wants to try right then and there. It's all good.  So basically, stop reading this, start getting your butt over to Sultan's Market and be sure to bring cash (no cards accepted).... but not too much, cause its pretty darn cheap. Cheers!
