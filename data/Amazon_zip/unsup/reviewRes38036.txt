Hands down the best Pizza on the face of the planet. No other pizza can caompare to the stuffed Crust Combo pizza.  They have a dish of fried everythings that is so tasty, especially the fried mushrooms.  The service lacks quite often, but fortuantely the food makes up for it. Prepare for the Food Baby. Your stomach will be huge afterwards. We usually compare ours.. to no one's amazement, I usually win.
