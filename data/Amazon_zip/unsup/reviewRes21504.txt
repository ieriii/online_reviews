I heart xoco enough said. Food is delicious, guacamole awesome, churros so so good. The milanesa torta is my usual choice, so flavorful, a bit spicy but so good, its just so so delicious. I always go on their off peak hours just because I'm not a fan of long lines. The staff is very friendly, they have indoor and outdoor seating so yeah, its pretty awesome.
