My family and I came here with a gift certificate. The service was SNOBBY and they seemed to turn our noses down at us, and we could overhear the servers whispering in worried tones that we would not tip well because we seemed to be wannabe clientele. Although the plates were artistic looking, they were no great shakes when eaten. Um, I'll go to the Art Institute of Chicago instead: thank you very much. One of the courses included a salmon dish that was bland-o-rino. Tru, my readers, is completely false! I seriously think this restaurant gets more credit for its social prestige (Could there be serious groupthink going on mistaking high price for high quality?) Exclusivity in setting soo does not mean excellence. My dears, who are you fooling?!? Compared to the great restaurants in New Orleans and Philadelphia, this wannabe, chic place falls flat on its face.
