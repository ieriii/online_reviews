My sister spent a lot of money and effort to make this a special graduation dinner for her daughter. We were in a very nice private room upstair but the main track lighting in the middle of the room had 3 bad bulbs out of a total of 7. That to me was absolutely not acceptable for the caliber of restaurant that they tried to be. The salmon entree choice was overcooked and the meat was luke warm. The wine list was way overpriced for mediocre selections. This restaurant is just appealing to people that want to spend a lot of money. They did a lot of fancy stuff that added nothing to the taste but only for show. They are definitely good marketers. Sorry but our family had a great time because we always create our own party anyway.
