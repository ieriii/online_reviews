I'm not even a big fan of kebas and I loved this place. All the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly. I[m not sure how it's cooked, but it all seemed really healthy. Amazing feta and really good hummus too. And wait staff helped us pick out a nice variety of food and some great wine. One of the people in our group was very hesitant of coming here because she is unfamiliar with Persian food, but she left raving about it and telling everyone she knows about what a great place this is.
