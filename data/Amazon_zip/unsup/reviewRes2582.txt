I decided that in honor of my birthday I would eat the things I don't normally eat on a regular basis. I knew I that I must go to Hot Doug's and try the hot dog because I do love hot dogs. I had heard about massive lines at this place but when I arrived at 11:45am I got rock star parking in front of the place and there was only about three people in front of me. Doug himself took the order and I got a corn dog, the hand cut fries and a char dog with everything on it (Chicago Style). By the time I sat down there was a line forming out the door. I got their just in time!! All I can say about the corn dog was that it was the best corn dog I have ever had, EVER! The batter was delicious!!! I'm salivating thinking about it now. The char dog was great too, but I only ate a couple bites because I wanted to devote my taste buds to the amazing corn dog. The hand cut fries were also delicious, perfectly cooked- not too soft and not too crisp- just perfecct. I can't wait to go back and try some of the more interesting, less traditional items on the menu!
