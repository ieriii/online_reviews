Tank Noodle (Pho Xe Tang) is a very busy Vietnamese restaurant at the corner of Broadway and Argyle. I dined here on a Thursday evening and the place was rolling in and out with customers, though there never seemed to be a line. The menu has over 250 selections, so it takes awhile to thumb through if you have never been here before. I went with the beef pho, which is a big brothy bowl of thin noodles with huge slices of semi-cooked beef (supposedly the boiling broth is poured over the sliced beef and the warmth of the broth basically cooks the meat) and a side plate of toppings including bean sprouts, cilantro leaves, jalapeno slices, and a wedge of lime. My friend had a combo fried rice with shrimp and waxy Chinese sausage. We also had a veggie spring roll as an appetizer, and it seemed way too healthy with a non-fried skin wrapped tightly about sprouts and tofu. The peanutty sauce helped add some flavor to the very subtle taste of these spring rolls. The banana sweetie dessert was very good, with slices of sweetened banana "cake" splattered with coconut milk and nuts.
