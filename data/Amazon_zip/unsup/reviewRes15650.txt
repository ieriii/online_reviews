SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY A STIFF DRINK THE HIDDEN DOOR Only steps away from a 7-11, a bank, and an Asian massage parlor stands a sign-less facade with a door handle and a yellow light bulb overhead. At first glance it's a bit gimmicky - manufactured exclusiveness. On second thought, it's pure genius. For this entrance is more than a door. It's a rabbit hole, the symbolic beginning of the Violet Hour experience, a portal meant to transport you away from the trains overhead and the text walkers below, a proscenium that separates two worlds...one where everything from cocktails to conversations are devoured quickly in Big Gulps and tweets...the other where time slows down, where the music is soft enough for people to talk and more importantly to LISTEN. Which is the stage and which is the audience? Which world is real and which is the farce? The calm within or the chaos outside? All things best pondered over... COCKTAILS A no cosmopolitan rule; I'm already in love. I had a fight with a bottle of Tanqueray nine years ago, and I figured if I was going to give gin another chance this was the place to do it. I go with the Indian Summer, a mix of Plymouth Gin, lime, lavender syrup, and house-made tonic. First sip... Hello hello... light bulbs flash, my eyes open wide...I pause. This is delicious. My first reflex is to drain my glass dry, but I stop. I pause. I savor. I reflect. I smile. And I notice my friends are doing the same. I end the night having had a wonderful conversation with old friends, expertly prepared cocktails, respectful and unhurried service, my world expanded to the wonders of gin, and perhaps a mandate to slow down and enjoy life more. I will indeed be back and I suggest you do the same. 5 perfect, gin-soaked stars.
