Great ambiance, good wine list, friendly staff. The server accidentally knocked over a glass of water on my girlfriend; the server was so apologetic, piled us up with towels, got someone right over to clean the chair and floor, and asked us if there was anything else she could do. We're easy going and helping us dry off was fine. She comped us our next glasses of wine for free. Very nice - just one of those situations that rarely happens, but she handled it well. We stopped in for a couple glasses of wine and a bite to eat - don't miss the crisp breadsticks at the bar - they have to have anise seeds in them or something - and the hummus was very good.  We'd definitely go back for wine & apps - didn't make it around to looking at the dinner menu. Thanks Bin 36!
