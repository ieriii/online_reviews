I've gotten take out from here at least a dozen times and have eaten in only once. I highly, highly recommend the steak burrito with everything + rice. Oh my god, it's the definition of food coma. But soooooooo good. I got the steak taco salad there once .. bleh. (I was trying to be healthy) And shrimp fajitas another time. Bleh. STEAK. BURRITO. PLUS RICE. STEAK BURRITO PLUS RICE.
