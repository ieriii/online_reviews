I'd like to give this a few more stars but I can't. They are losing their flavor AND HAVE BECOME INCONSISTENT. 90 Miles has become inconsistent with their dinners. I have been going to the Clybourn location since it opened (which has better food by the way) and have gotten disappointed each time I went to this Armitage location; 3 in all. Mind you, I have only gone because they have seating for more than 4 guests. 1st experience was great (for me)...I had the Red Snapper for $9.95 and it came with Black Beans and Rice...bad for guest because she knows and i know what to expect from the Bistec (we are frequents at Clybourn location) and it just didn't taste the same. 2nd experience...I had the Red Snapper but this time no beans and rice even though paper menu said otherwise. 3rd experience they have a new menu, raised the prices to $11.95, Red Snapper still no beans and rice even though NEW menu suggests otherwise, and the Bistec is now grilled (boiled before NEW menu) which gives it a smoked flavor. Good but not great and inconsistent to what I am expecting. I will stick with the Clybourn location only because it's close to home and better tasting. To bad because Clybourn does not have the Snapper. Although my friends and I agree that they don't always give equal portions and are losing their flavor as well. I don't know if it's a switch in cooks, or sign of the times has put a toll on better spices, but 90 mile....CONSISTENCY IS KEY.
