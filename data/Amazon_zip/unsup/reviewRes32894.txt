I went for drinks and appetizers last weekend and, being a budding foodie, have to reserve my full opinion until I try the main entrees/sushi. However, I tried all the signature appetizers about 6 in all and was not impressed.  One did stand out, the "jam and toast" however the rest were ordinary at best with the "devil crab" being the biggest disappointment of the table.  The signature drinks were nothing extraordinary either. Stick with sake. The ambiance is key to this place and makes the experience worth trying again, especially with lowered expectations of the quality of the food. On a side note, the couple next to me said that they also found the sushi average.
