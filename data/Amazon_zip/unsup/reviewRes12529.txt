Leaving me with the impression that this is a classy restaurant with a caring staff, Cafe 28 is one of the rare restaurants where large groups and intimate dates can co-exist next to each other without feeling interfered upon. Start your meal off with a nice drink. Try a mojito (they have a neon sign on the window that says "mojitos" so you just KNOW it has to be good, right?) or any of their other specialty drinks.  The appetizers are not your average throw-away starter. I enjoyed a bit of the tender and tasty Tamal Cubano (pork, onions on garlic polenta). The table next to us ordered the Calamar a La Parrilla (calimari) and if it tastes anywhere as good as it smelled passing by, it's a definite must.  At this point I was worried that the bread and appetizer would hinder being able to finish the main course. I was wrong. My Carne a La Parilla (steak) was made to order in a peppery sauce that may or may not contain A1 steak sauce.  A nice side of squash, corn and green peppers balanced the dish. It tasted so good I had to finish the dish on the spot. My girlfriend ordered the Ropa Vieja (slow simmered beef) and it had a sweet flavor that went along well with the accompanying plantains. We skipped dessert but they do have a dedicated menu for after-dinner conversation.  Throughout the meal our server and their staff of runners made sure the entire meal went smoothly. With the music of cuba staying upbeat in the background, the experience at Cafe 28 was complete. I'll definitely head back to try more of the menu.
