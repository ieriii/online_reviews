I was not impressed.  I went for lunch on a weekday, and we probably ordered 1 of each item off of the menu for our party of 5. The portions were disappointingly small, and every item was entirely too salty.  After spending $40/pp, we did walk away full, but I don't think I'd come back here again. They do offer a special pre-fixe for lunch, but it still seems way overpriced for the food you get. I guess some people are willing to pay for the decor but not me. Service was also very spotty even though we were 1 of 5 tables in the restaurant for lunch.
