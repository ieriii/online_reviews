I had heard great things about Sunda and read the raving reviews about it. I planned my birthday dinner here for me and three of my friends. When we got there, we had ordered an appetizer which took over a half an hour to come. Then, we all decide to order sushi. The sushi was absolutely sub-par. It wasn't good, and there weren't a lot of options. My friend said hers was so bad that it has ruined sushi for her for a month. On top of all that - all of our sushi came out at different times. My other friend, ordered a soup, which never even came at all. Our server was unapologetic, and didn't even recognize the fact that he had forgotten the soup and still wanted to charge us for it. Then the bill came... We had to separate the checks ourselves, which we did; and we wrote all of the totals/separate on the back for the server so he didn't have to do any work. It takes him at LEAST a half an hour to come back... and he came back with incorrect change. Needless to say we were very irritated. The manager had to go correct his careless mistakes. The food is completely over priced for what you get (not quality). The wine menu is pretty limited. The service was so poor - that almost that alone would make me never want to return here. We were there from 5:30-8:30. For someone who worked as a server in fine dining for five years, I would say that Sunda should be embarrassed.
