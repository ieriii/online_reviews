Long line. Pretentious. High Curtains. More high curtains. Dark. Alice in wonderland chairs. $12 cocktails. The thing is...the drinks were amazing (Dark and stormy, Juliet and Romeo, and Ginger Toddy). I can't deny it. We also ended up getting the onion dip and it was delicious. The problem for me is the very thing that makes this place special. There is such an air of pretension and exclusivity. It is a place that takes itself so seriously, when really it is kind of amusing and silly. Yes, the drinks are great...but I've had great drinks elsewhere as well...finding drinks made with special ingredients and spices and whatnot is not so unique anymore, though I will admit there is a great variety here. I'm glad I went. (I had been meaning to go forever. But everytime the lines were so long that we would just say fuck it, let's walk to Map Room or whatever.) I will probably go again for good drinks...but knowing what is inside now, I know that the high curtains and getting your name down on the list and standing around in a tight space with a bunch of other suckers isn't going to engender any sense of anticipation. It will only serve to annoy me.
