my first love (when it comes to pizza) i remember when my dad first took me to the pizzeria many years ago. when i walked in the doors i was instantly hit with the aroma of sweet tomatoes, savory meats and melt in your mouth cheese mingling atop a bed of crisp buttery crust. with that first whiff, i knew i was in love. and to this day when i go back to Chicago, i re-live the same experience. no matter what pizza you get, you will not be disappointed. they pile on the cheese, meat and sauce. one slice with serves as your appetizer, first and second entree. and the crust...when you cut into it and see the melted cheese oozing out inviting you to take a bite...oh my! you always end up with left overs unless you come with a pack or decide in inhale the whole pie. this pizza does taste good cold or re-heated the day after. be forewarned! if anyone sees you eating their pizza without a fork and knife...looks of craziness will come your way. it's considered rude to pick up a deep dish pizza and eat it by hand. the service is super friendly. of course it's packed with tourists so finding a table might be difficult (45 min wait sometimes).
