I'm not crazy about deep dish pizza, but this changed my mind, as the flavor and texture was very strong. I don't really have much to add other than that, but I will say that, as someone who microwaves his leftover pizza, this stuff does not microwave well at all. Guess the microwave is a friend of, I dunno, medium-crust pizza? At Pequod's, it's either deep or thin, and I think neither one really takes to reheating that well. My first visit, actually, resulted in me going to the Thai restaurant next door as I didn't want to wait forever by myself on a Friday night (and you know, I doubt they wanted me to either... I learned my lesson after Food 4 Go). I went to the Thai joint next door which was a mistake (three stars, huh Yelp? I don't think so). Reviews are available on both if you are curious! The point is, I got in the next day for lunch with no wait (it was raining, after all).
