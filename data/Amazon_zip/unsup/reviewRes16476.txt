I love that Violet Hour repaints their "door" every month. I once even overheard someone saying, "did you hear that Violet Hour changed their name to Panda?" This was when there was a painting of a giant panda outside. Quite humorous. If you want a nice, quiet, romantic eventing, I'd highly recommend Violet Hour. On the weekends, you'll see people lining up outside for a wait. They don't let you wait inside, I think this is a nice touch for people who are sitting inside but sucks for the people waiting in the cold! I haven't gotten anything other than a bottle of champagne here. But the server was attentive and nice. I love the decor - I feel like I'm in Alice in Wonderland every time I'm here because of their high chairs. I'd say you have to at least go here once in your lifetime!
