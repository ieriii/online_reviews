I've been to XOCO a handful of times, from breakfast to everything in between, and I must say my verdict: Rick Bayless is a GOD! He has single-handedly taken over the Grand/Clark Street block with his culinary visions. I've had the open-faced breakie torta with Poached Egg and slighty spicy tomato broth, the Chicken Tinga and Ahogada torta, guac and chips and to round out my xoco menu samplings the mexican hot cocoa and also the churro with vanilla bean ice cream, for dipping of course! Might I add, this was not all in one sitting, but over a period of a few food binges. HOT TIP: Like most Bayless establishments, this place is a hot commodity and gathers quite an audience. So....GET IN LINE EARLY! This place starts serving lunch at 11 AM so you want to ensure you have a seat, if dining in. Otherwise, call ahead and order, you'll save yourself a headache. I just noticed they have a mole poblano especial on Thursday, I'm so there.
