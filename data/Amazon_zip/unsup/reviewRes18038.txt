[ Visited March, 2011 ] Maybe I'm living in an alternate universe, but Caro Mio was about as interesting eating Chef Boyardee by candlelight. I ordered the fettuccine with bolognese sauce and $4.50 extra for two meatballs. I actually received the parapadelle....strike one. The food was quite bland with hardly a hint of Italian flavor. Strike two. The meatballs were equally as bland. Strike three. The service was slow (4 pasta dishes take 25 minutes to cook when the restaurant is less than 25-percent full?) and the waiter accidentally mixed up the to-go leftovers with (not mine) with the to-trash leftovers. This was probably once a nice restaurant when the area was a dump, but next time I get invited I'll kindly pass.
