One word, RUDE ! And that's before we even crossed the threshold.My husband received a call from the restaurant at 7pm Friday inquiring if we were supposed to be at the restaurant at that moment. We hade made reservations for the next day, Saturday, at least so we thought. Some less than polite discourse took place. My husband asked if they could maybe accommodate us on Saturday even though we knew it was unlikely as their space is small. He hung up the phone. The phone rang and it was Schwa. Conversation ended with F@#% ! coming from the Schwa end of the phone and a click.Not sure what exactly transpired between my husband and Schwa from reservation to confirmation to the rude discourse on the night of the missed reservation. Everyone in our party knew the reservation was for the Saturday and one member in our party works on Friday nights so we never make reservations for weekday nights. It may have been that Schwa wrote down the reservation for the wrong night or then somehow confirmed by DH incorrectly. I really can't be sure. I realize their space is small and missing a 6 person reservation can be devastating, but there's no excuse for rudeness. I've been in the restaurant industry and retail industry. In no situation should you ever lose your cool. It destroys your reputation. Even if you tell yourself you don't care about that. Your business loses and, more importantly, you lose your own dignity.I'd still like to try Schwa but not sure that DH will even give it a fair chance.
