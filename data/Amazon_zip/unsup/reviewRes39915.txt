It was a very delicious and fun experience. There were only two of and it was full of groups so we waited a bit for a table. Be assertive for the service your desire but don't be rude. It is always busy here and the servers work hard. When I left my glasses on the table they found them and kept them until I picked them up. I appreciate that type of service. I thought the price was a value for the experience. For the two of the us the bill without drinks the bill was forty.
