We have only had Cuban food a couple times but we loved this place. You might need help with the menu (we did) and it was a month or so back so I don't remember what we had but they were on the specials menu. Very tasty and different. The price is right. The outdoor eating area is great, as well as the BYOB aspect. Very friendly and helpful staff. There is no restroom for guests (so have your kid go before you leave home). There is a small parking lot.
