Tasty sushi, but HORRIBLE service! Nine of my girlfriends took me here last night to celebrate my bday- thanks friends! I walked in celebrating my 28th bday and feared I'd be 43 by the time our sushi FINALLY made it out to our table. Yes, a table of 10 young women (notice i'm still trying to milk the "young" for as long as I can) is no easy task for any waitress to handle, but waiting 1 1/2 hours for sushi to come out is unacceptable. I wasn't exactly shy about sharing my thoughts with the manager who was very unapologetic and didn't do anything to rush the process along. Fortunately I still had a good bday celebration (with no thanks to Coast) due to good friends, lots of wine, and a delicious cookie cake...
