For breakfast this morning I ate the chilaquiles, and my friend had scrambled eggs with chorizo. They brought us a complementary starter - a piece of pork and a tortilla in sauce. There are chips and salsa on the table. All that, plus a cup of coffee, and the bill was less than $10. The food isn't the best I've ever had, but it's quite good, and when you match it up with the cost, among the better values around.
