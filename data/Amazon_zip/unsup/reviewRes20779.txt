Quality is much much higher than most other places i've been to around chicago. The wait was long but they have a nice sitting area and they'll take your number and give you a call if you want to go down the street or whatever. My only complaint is that it was extremely loud in here on a friday night. Could barely hear the people sitting next to me. They should get some acoustical panels or something.
