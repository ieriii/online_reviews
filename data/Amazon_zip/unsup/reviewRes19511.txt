A great addition to the Bayless empire, Xoco serves up a changing menu through out the day. Starting with pastries and moving into tortas, soups and more. The kitchen is totally open and itsnot uncommon to see Rick Bayless working away. If you've already been to Fronterra this is a fun way to experience Bayless's cooking without the price tag.
