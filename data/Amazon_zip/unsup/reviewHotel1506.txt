A fabulous boutique hotel with unbelievable views and amazing location! My family and I stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend because we had a wedding to attend down the street. A bit pricey, but since almost every room was literally booked downtown that weekend, we decided to go for it. It was a great decision mostly because we didn't have to drive back and forth between the burbs and city, and the fact that we felt super fancy having an awesome view of the river and Trump Tower. The hotel staff were all very accommodating, and really made us feel welcome. I would wholeheartedly recommend Hotel 71 to anyone that needs a temporary home in our beautiful city!
