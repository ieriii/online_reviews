Wow, I really wanted to love this place... Coming in here for a Easter brunch I was delighted by their menu. I love places that try to be creative and unique. I ordered the South Beach which was fine (gave me great inspiration to create it later at home). My boyfriend ordered the orange bread french toast which seemed perfect. And then... This is. Where. Things. Go. Wrong. Biting into a piece of the french toast, I taste a hair. I tell the waitress,she brings out a new dish and I ask to speak to a manager/owner. Out comes this man who looks pissed. I tell him my story and he says in a heavy accent "WHAT DO YOU WANT ME DO I ALREADY GIVE YOU MORE FOOD!". I ask that I would like the french toast to be taken off the bill and he refuses! After arguing with him we get a 10 dollar gift card "FOR NEXT TIME". Yeah, I can see through that. You treat me badly and then want me to come to your establishment again and spend more money since I have this gift card. I owe it to years of seeing other people making fools of themselves in public by fighting with others so I did not make the same mistake. When this guy yelled at me I was seething with anger. I really had to control myself not to yell at him or call his mother a diseased harlot. I've never had such bad memories of a place to eat. If I want to get yelled at I'll go to the Wiener Circle!
