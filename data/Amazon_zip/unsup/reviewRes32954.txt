I caught up with the law school girls on a Saturday at Yolk for a quick breakfast. I had tried coming here on one other occasion but the wait was too long. Fortunately we got there early enough that we only had to wait a few minutes. But after having actually eaten the food, I can definitely say that it's not a breakfast that I would go out of my way for or wait more than a few minutes. The space is nice, not too loud. My friend and her little one appreciated the "stroller parking" off to the side. The service was fine for a breakfast place, except we had no spoons for our coffee (despite a couple of requests), which should be a no-brainer. As far as food, I ordered the nutella crepes and next time would order something else. I did not think that anything with nutella (and gobs of it) should at the same time be doused in chocolate syrup. Also it was just a very heavy dish. My girlfriends seemed to like their breakfasts but weren't blown away.
