Such friendly service! They serve you nice hot ginger tea when you get to your table. The vegetarian selection was wide, but none of the dishes caught my fancy much. For appetizers, I tried spring roll, egg roll, avocado wantons and sticky rice cake. None impressed. For entree, I had the vegetables over crispy rice and probably the most liked dish of the lot, but still not something I'd go back for.
