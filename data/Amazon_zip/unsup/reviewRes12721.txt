I went more than 24 hours ago. I'm still sweating gravy. Here's the deal - Texas de Brazil gives you all-you-can-eat meat. Yes, there's a salad bar, but don't even screw around with it. You came there for meat, so forget the formalities and settle down like the carnivore you are. For roughly $50, guys bring an endless supply of large meat skewers to you, dropping off a chunk or a slice whenever you like. It was all quite salty, but the waiters were excellent about keeping our water glasses topped off to mitigate any dehydration. I loved the tenderloin and the chicken wrapped in bacon was also very good. Parmesan pork was an interesting flavor sensation.  The sausage was insanely spicy, but if you like hot stuff, you'll love it. I wasn't a fan of the ribs, though. For a place where most of the meat comes medium rare, it was odd to run into such overcooked ribs. No matter. I pushed the remains aside and summoned the meat bearers for another round. Why was I even bothering with something I didn't like when garlic picanha was just around the bend? Your server will tell you to cleanse your palette with the cinnamon bananas. Garlic mashed potatoes and super-chewy rolls also take up residence on your table. But in time, you will learn to ditch anything that didn't once walk on four legs. You came here for meat, dammit, so demand the sacrifice of another victim! The decor is very dark - lots of browns and deep reds. Giant floral arrangements are featured prominently. And if you want a bottle of wine, a woman on a bungee/trapeze-thing soars along the massive rack to retrieve it. This kind of place is a once-a-year event. Save up your allowance, fast for 24 hours and then barge through the doors like some kind of demented Noah, demanding that animals be shoveled two-by-two into your mouth-ark.
