After seeing Crisp on the news, I decided to give it a try. This might be because I hyped it up too much after waiting a week to try it and eating at Buffalo Joe's on Howard and Clark the night before, but I was a little disappointed. My roommate and I shared a whole chicken. Half Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. The skin on the chicken was VERY flavorful (maybe a little overwhelming), but the meat underneath it was pretty plain. It was delicious, I just thought the marinade was too syrupy for my taste. After 3 pieces, I really couldn't eat any more. Their fries were perfection though! They were small, crispy, and sooo good. Despite my disappointment, I will still come back to Crisp. Now I know what to expect and order, so I might have a better experience. I'm looking forward to trying out the other chicken flavors and dishes. Also, I really like the owner. He was extremely friendly and laid back and seemed to think it was funny when I licked my lips when my friend ordered.
