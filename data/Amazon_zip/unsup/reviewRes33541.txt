We held an event here in their back upstairs room. Everyone raved about the food and our server Armando was great. He really knew his stuff about the food and the area. Our order: Bruschette, calamari, risotto fungi - appetizers Caprese and another kind of salads Ravioli Spinaci and Gnocci Ricotta - pastas Pollo Romano, Filetto Funghi - entrees Profiteroles w/vanilla gelato - dessert I recommend this place if you are looking for a place that can host a large group.
