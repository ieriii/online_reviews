I have previously only got take out from these guys and always really liked the hummus but never really ate full meals. Well, I dined in their restaurant last night and I will definitely be back. This is really pretty straight forward food for the uninitiated. A lot of Kabobs and a lot of just straight meats with sides. Nothing too exotic. I had the cornish game hen and it was awesome!! Highly recommend that. My brother got some split between lamb shank and beef and everything was cooked to perfection. It was a Thursday and we were there early so there was no need for reservations but there were a few people there which not a lot of restaurants can't say for a Thursday at 7:00 which with all the other similar options in the neighborhood, is a good sign. This leads me to believe that it can get crowded on the weekends. They do serve beer and other alcohol. Everything is high quality, cooked well and reasonably priced.
