LOVE. I'm lucky to have such a great place so close to my apartment. My go-to meal is 2 pizza slices with a drink included for an amazing price. These slices are HUGE, absolutely a great deal. My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza, with the BBQ chicken and margarita coming in as close seconds. A few of the workers go above and beyond to be friendly and you can tell they take pride in their store. I'm definitely a loyal customer to these guys.
