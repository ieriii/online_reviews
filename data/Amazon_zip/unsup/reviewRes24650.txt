ok .. so i think you can judge a restaurant on how well it takes care of awkward customers and boy was i feeling awkward last night. we booked gejas for a romantic going away dinner for the two of us... arrived a little early, we were greated warmly and seated RIGHT BESIDE THE GUITAR GUY, so i politely asked cud we be seated somewhere a little more personal, no problem, relocated to another seat ... this time we're seated at a table that might as well have us sitting on the laps of the guests next to us. by the time the waiter asked us for drinks for the third time we were ready to leave. i apologised and explained how id been hoping to spend quality time with my boyf and how i was leaving the country blah blah blah.... no problem, the waiter went off, found us a booth and told us if we waited at the bar he wud have it ready in 15mins... what great service, and i felt so bad for being difficult. i think the moral of the story is to specifically resquest a booth when you book. the rest of the night went off without a hitch, shannon our waitress was wonderful, we did the international and the beef and lobster, i loved every moment of it, my boyf really enjoyed cooking his own food too, it was just like an activity date but wth great food and alcohol. obviously the price is ridic, but for a special occasion i definatly think its worth it. the pitcher of sangria topped off a fantastic evening of fun and food
