I'm originally from Chicago, and when I go back I try to stay here whenever it's feasible. The rooms are nicely decorated and some have funky shapes - no standard cube, which I enjoy. Nice staff, great location for downtown activities, and it's next to the L so I can hop on and visit friends just about anywhere in the city without too much trouble. Yes, some rooms don't have great views. But you are in Chicago - if you want a view, go visit the Sears Tower or Hancock Building. Book your room online for best rates. And remember - you can always request a room on the non-L side when you check in.
