I really like this place - it's great food. It's cheap, BYOB and the food is authentic. I'm married to Mexican and this is one of his favorite restaurants in town when he's craving his mom's food. The service is mediocre at best, but the food and prices are worth the trip. I would recommend ordering something non Tex-Mex (don't get the enchiladas), go for the stewed meats, soups, fish dishes, things a bit different from what you can get at On the Border! in the suburbs. It's worth the trip to Pilsen to try this place out!
