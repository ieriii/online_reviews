Good but overrated. I'm debating between 3 and 4 stars. Will give it 3 because the spring rolls aren't authentic enough for me (no mint leaves? I love mint leaves!) Plus I don't have any favorites here. It's a safe place to take a group to try Vietnamese food because they have diverse offerings, but no particular dish shines. Plus it's always mad crowded and I hate waiting in the winters.
