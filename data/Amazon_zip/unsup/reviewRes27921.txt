This pizza was amazing! We had to take a taxi to get here, but it was worth it! The sausage is amazing. The crust taste a bit burnt, but in a good way. The sauce is terrific. It was even good leftover and cold; I don't usually like cold pizza. I did my homework before heading to Chicago and read this place was as good as it gets. I have to agree, the pizza at the other places was good too, but the sausage put this place over the top! I should note I am not normally a sausage pizza fan, but this sausage pizza is wonderful!
