Sometimes I think that the reason my wife really wanted to move to Lincoln Square was to be within walking distance to Opart. She loves the curry that much. I mix it up a bit, but haven't been disappointed with any of my choices. And we both agree on the spring rolls to start - if anyone has figured out the secret ingredient that gives them that slightly unique flavor please let me know. The dishes are all reasonably priced and just the right size for me - I get plenty to eat, but usually don't go home with leftovers. It's also a pretty big place, so I've never had a wait and they seem to accommodate groups pretty well. There are a lot of choices on this stretch of Western, but Opart usually gets our vote.
