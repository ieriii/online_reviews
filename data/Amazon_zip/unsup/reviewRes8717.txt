i have been to many rodizio places in my life. hell, i've even been to rodizio style places in argentina and brazil. this is hands down the best. the loss of "weird" meats like chicken hearts is more than made up for by the quality of the service, the quality of the meats, the quality of the continuously replenished sides, and the fact that they actually give you meat cooked to your request rather than *every other rodizio place on the planet*, which just gives you whatever overcooked rump they have on the skewer. it is pricey, and well worth every penny.
