interesting gastropub. paul kahan's blackbird has an awesome prefixe lunch $22. avec currently closed but opening again next week. anyways, came for some beer, oysters, cheese, also had the chicharrones, half roast chicken and sausage, and egg frites. pomme frites with the chicken tasted the best. was not particularly impressed overall, so when you have a list to pick from including the girl and the goat, graham elliott, blackbird, etc, pick wisely. communal dining, communal bathroom, reason to come is for the beer selection and you can come earlier (even at 3:30 without reservations)
