Order the following and you will not be disappointed. I love the fact that it is BYOB also. Sea scallops with sesame for app. Whatever the freshest fish of the day is for (toro happened to be that day and it melted in our mouths. We ordered a second round for the table because it was so darn good) White dragon roll (large and in charge) Spicy tuna roll (better than your average spicy tuna, had tempura crunch and was pretty big) Volcano roll (nice and spicy with tuna) Bring your own white wine vodka and beer as we did and the waiter graciously and qucikly chilled all of the above. We skipped dessert because we were so full. (Mind you it was me and 2 dudes so the rolls were pretty filling) I cant wait to go back to check out mor fresh fish and the other rolls there. I prefer this place over Bob San for sure. The BYOB element makes it even more attractive! We had a reservation which allowed speedy seating.
