Now I am not one for waiting more than 30 minutes to eat as I made an attempt to eat here months ago and was told it will be a 1 hour wait. I walked away and ate somewhere else. Usually when I walk by the sidewalk is flooded with people waiting to be seated in this popular brunch eatery. A friend of mine who happens to be a huge fan told me I have to get there once they open, which is 9AM on Sunday. We went today and met at the door at 8:55 and the line was getting longer by the minute. We walked in and our party of six was able to get one of the two big tables they have. Lots of sweets on the menu as it was difficult for most of us to choose. I saw they had some interesting mimosas on the menu such as the grapefruit mimosa, raspberry mimosa and the raspberry & pear mimosa (which i was destined to have), but they do not serve alcohol until 11AM (damn!) I ordered the French Toast that was on special which was covered in sliced pears and some sort of white chocolate creme sauce and the right dose of cinnamon. I also ordered a side of thai chicken sausage which was great. The three huge slices of french toast was tasty and very fulfilling, but sad to say it was so much I could not finish it (that almost never happens). I tried someone else's potatoes and they were off the chain! (yum). I also tried a piece of the Chocolate Tower French Toast and it was good but just too rich. The service here is pretty good except they brought the check a little too early for my taste. The atmosphere is very chill and laxed and I also enjoyed the selection of music while eating. I would like to go more often but as I said earlier I will not wait very long to be seated on most occassions and I do not think I will get up so early on weekends to eat.
