Awesome Pizza. I've been here but my wife hadnt. She fell in love and she isnt a huge pizza fan (I know, but she's beautiful so I put up with it ;-)). The wait was long but nothing out of the oridnary even on a Saturday night withe Air and Water show going on. The pre- ordering that they do while you wait really minimizes the time that you have to wait once you get your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. The only negative was the location that they put us. It was too close to the other table and I kept having to move anytime someone got up or when staff cleaned the table. The Pizza was worth the hassle however.
