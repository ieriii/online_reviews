I eat here at least once a week. I consider Wildfire to be a moderately priced steakhouse. When I was younger and made less money than i do now, I would consider Outback to be a good place to go have steak at a reasonable price. Wildfire is now that place for me. Average meal price with a half bottle of wine and 2 drinks comes out to about $120 for two people. Their fixed price steak option is always a good bet - you get a salad, 6oz filet, and dessert for under $40 pp. My steak always comes out done like I ask (medium) and I've never had any issues with service. They are always busy but you can usually walk in and wait for a table.Definite must haves: Wildfire Chopped Chicken Salad, Bacon Wrapped scallop skewers, double stuffed baked potato, Skinny Pineapple Martini, and if you go on sunday - their turkey dinner is delicious!!!
