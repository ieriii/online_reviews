Clandestine.. That's the word that comes to mind when I think about the ambience at Violet Hour. The seating is arranged in such a way that feels very private so you can feel at ease discussing your next top secret mission. It's easy to keep your focus on the people you came with. The extraordinarily high backs on the Queen Anne wing back chairs feel sort of Alice in Wonderland. The lighting is very dim. I like it. This can not be overstated. THE BEST DARK & STORMY I HAVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE!! It is unreal how good this is. I have had them at many other high end establishments and no comparison. They even have special ice which resembles a stick of butter so as not to dilute this magical cocktail. Summary: This is a great place to go if you like a sophisticated, clandestine vibe and very finely crafted cocktails expertly prepared with the best ingredients.
