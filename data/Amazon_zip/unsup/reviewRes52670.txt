After all the hype and excitement, I left not very impressed wit Brazzaz. I went here for lunch and something they don't tell you is that LUNCHTIME SELECTION IS SMALLER. I came here expecting a ton of different kinds of food but I noticed there was a lot less than what was on the website/sign outside. The website also said they sushi would be available but I saw none. The meats weren't labeled at the salad bar either. The first cut of meat I tasted was cold. The presentation wasn't anything to write home about. Something about the atmosphere seemed to be missing. They have some Brazilian dancing DVD on and it seemed off. Overall, I thought it would be more of an "experience". What gives this place 3 stars is the fact that the waitress told me "you barely ate anything so I didn't charge you." :D
