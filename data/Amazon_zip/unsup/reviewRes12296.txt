I now have been to this place more than a handful to give it a proper review. It is by far one of my favorite Cuban restaurants in the city. This place even offers other Latin flavors in their menu so it has a good mix to choose from. I've sat in all areas of the restaurant and enjoy the outdoor patio the best. Nothing beats sitting out there with good company and one of their mojitos. I did realize that this drink seems to get lighter in alcohol every time I visit though. I'm not a huge drinker so I won't go into that any further. I had the ropa vieja entree as it is one of my faves but they have a menu full of favorites to pick from. My date had the same and she was happy with the dish as well ... as a matter of fact most people in the patio area order it as I can tell so it must be a house favorite. I can attest that it will not disappoint! So the only thing that is left for me to try is their brunch and I will surely find my way there at some point. I do love the ambiance of the place and a great wait staff.
