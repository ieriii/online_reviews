What a fantastic restaurant! As a fan of Latin American Cuisine, i had my eye on Las Tablas since the summer and finally had a reason to go a few weeks ago. 7PM on a friday night, there was a 1hr 45 minute wait for a table of 5 at Tango Sur, and NO wait at all at Las Tablas. Service: The waiter was exceptionally kind- took the time to explain the different entrees and cuts of meat that they prepare. He said " if the skirt steak does not make you smile when you eat it, i will personally bring you a pitcher of sangria for free". He never had to bring the pitcher. Food: We began with the empanadas- delicious! I preferred the beef over the chicken, even though the chicken empanadas were recommended by the waiter. the Aji is delightful flavoring that I dunked the empanadas in (and also spread around the meat as well). I had the bandeja Paisa, which is more delicious food than i can eat in two meals. My friends had the combination skirt steak/chicken plate. Everyone was extremely happy with the taste and quality and portion of food. Cost: Not cheap, but worth it. Entrees are about $20+ .Expect to have a $35 per person meal if you bring your own wine. (don't forget $8 corkage fee) Bathrooms: Were SPOTLESS. top notch. Well maintained and comfortable. They even had a nicely decorated lounge in the basement as a waiting room. Environment: Wooden benches with no back, ahhh uncomfortable. But apparently quite authentic, as the waiter described this is how many Colombian "fondas" look. I'll buy it. Dark overhead lighting, candles on the table. Live brazilian samba music in the background, not too loud. Will be my default "date place". Didn't get crowded until 9PM for some reason...do colombians eat that late? 5 Stars!
