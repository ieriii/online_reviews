I think it's incredibly lame that so many reviewers complain about the sort of people that fill L & E. Gimme a break, someone who is as happy with themselves as the reviews make them sound shouldn't give a crap about what other people are saying or wearing or what "douchy" neighborhood they came from.  Anyway...my husband and I had a rare night away from the baby and promptly headed to Longman & Eagle.  Yeah, we had to wait. But we knew we would. A drink at each of the restaurants right next door helped pass the time.   We thought the food was sooo worth the wait. I don't like that they encourage you to order everything at once--after waiting for two hours our eyes were def bigger than our stomachs and we ended up barely touching the last item (a $15 lobster parfait which was probably pretty good but our taste buds were just too worn out to appreciate it).  The scallops with gnocci were a big hit with us. MMMMMMM! We also really enjoyed the marrow.  The aerated blue cheese foam on the buffalo frog's legs was so interesting, quite an experience!  We had the tete du cochon too but didn't think it was quite as awesome as the other stuff. Because we hardly ever get to have a kid free date these days we squeezed in dessert too--some chocolate torte thing with malt foam. Very good and not too sweet, which was perfect. We had a few drinks each and spent $150 with tip. Kinda pricey I guess but we both thought it totally blew The Publican away.  The air in the place does get a little heavy with kitchen grease but not intolerable like Geja's or something (barf). I like that it is just off the blue line but there is a cheap parking lot right across the street too. Overall it was a great meal, a great date and even though we really have to pick and choose our rare dinner dates I would go back to this place again in a heart beat!
