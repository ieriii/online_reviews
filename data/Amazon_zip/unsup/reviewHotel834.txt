I give this hotel a 5-star FOR ITS CLASS (i.e., we are not talking the Four Seasons. However, it's easily above run-of-the-mill Hilton's and Marriot's in which I often stay). It was a combination of great price, extremely customer-focused service, nice decor, very comfortable room, etc. I chose this hotel for its proximity to a meeting I had. I read reviews in yelp, and was concerned that some guest rooms were near the subway line. I called in advance and asked for a room far from the subway, and they assured me rooms on the other side of the hotel are quiet. When I arrived, they had put me in a king suite, at the same exceptionally low price as the regular rooms with queen-sized beds. About 30 minutes after I'd settled in, Elizabeth at the front desk called to see whether everything was to my liking. Nice touch. The women at the front desk were exceptionally courteous and customer-focused throughout my stay. Most of the bell men were also, with Louis, in particular, being wonderful (from the warm greeting at my initial arrival, to offering to wak my luggage to the subway [which was a better bet to the airport than a cab during rush hour] in quite cold temperature). The room itself was spacious, warm, comfortable. The metalwork art throughout much of the hotel (which I supposed represents silversmithery), and other artwork, were tasteful. Wifi was reliable (and also free). All in all, great value for the price. I'll look to stay agin on future trips to Chicago.
