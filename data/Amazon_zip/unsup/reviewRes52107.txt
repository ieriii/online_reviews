My first ever Chicago-style deep dish pizza, ordered and consumed on location! A true culinary landmark! Pizza, pizza, pizza! We only had a few hours here in town, and one meal, so deep dish pizza had to be it. I was surprised to see both the tour book and Yelp recommend chain locations, so we randomly picked one convenient to our location and stopped in. After a short wait we were brought upstairs and were just about to sit down in a booth with a great view of the restaurant when a guy at the neighboring booth panicked, "Don't sit there! It's still wet!" See, Gino's East is full of graffitied names, phrases, and slogans added by years and years of customers, and the bottom of my new pair of shorts was about to smear the restaurant's most recent addition. We wisely relocated to a nearby booth. The waiter was friendly enough, despite his sneering at my request for a Cherry Coke and just daring us to finish a medium, 6-slice pizza (probably around $22). He warned us that there would be a considerable wait for a freshly-baked pie, so we pulled out a deck of cards and the time flew right by. Before long, the pizza was laid bare on our table and we dug in. It was good pizza, for sure -- thick, cheesy, and covered in sausage and vegetables. Maybe this is laughable, but it almost tasted healthy; it wasn't greasy at all but rather had almost a watery taste. As the waiter predicted, we finished only 2/3 of the huge pizza pie, but we gladly boxed it up for a meal back home. How does Gino's compare to other deep dish venues? Being a newcomer to the Windy City, I can't say, but I would probably try some of the other famous locations first for comparison before returning to this particular chain. From here on out, though, all Chicago-style pizza I consume will be compared to Gino's high bar!
