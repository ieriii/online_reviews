So far the best meal I have ever had in my life! With ingredients like: snail eggs, lobster, truffle, beets, chestnut puree, green curry and chicken livers you really don't know what to expect. Expect creativity, fun and none of the pretentiousness you might think you'd get. I came here for my birthday dinner with 3 friends. We had 5 bottles of wine which we left up to the chefs to pair. We did the 9 course dinner. The wines were paired wonderfully as we were brought out each course by the chefs themselves, who joked and made us laugh. We couldn't figure out how each course be better than the last and were proven wrong every time! And while each plate was made up of several components, each item was great on it's own and outstanding when brought together. We would take our bite and look at each other with wide eyes..."Do you taste what I'm tasting?!" My friend, who truly despises seafood, ate her lobster dish without hesitation. And another didn't like beets and loved the beet risotto! The only problem with having an experience like this is the expectations that this will put on other places I go. I will be fair but it will be difficult.
