Why have I been here twice? The wait is stupid long (last time waited 2.5 hours to be seated) and there are too many damn people! The food is not great and the prices are whack. The first time I came here half of the kitchen was closed due to it being flooded so they were only serving like 8 things on their 200 item menu...I guess that's why i agreed to go back, cuz I didnt get the full experience. Well I did my second time and that'll be my last.
