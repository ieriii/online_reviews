Certainly a more upscale Indian restaurant that most place I've been to, but was not the greatest Indian food I've had. The naan is pretty good here - really soft and hot, brushed with the perfect amount of butter. However, the main courses were not that great - had the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken.  The chicken tikka masala was seasoned fine, but the chicken was just too dry. It's all white meat pieces and the chicken was certainly overcooked to the point where it was really dry.  The tandoori chicken was good - the dark meat pieces were obviously still tender, and I liked the fact that there were a good amount of onions covering the bottom of the hot plate. However, it wasn't good enough to keep this restaurant from ending up just average. Prices were certainly high - about $4 for naan and entrees were about $15-16 each. I also hate how places charge for white rice - $5-6 for white rice. Fail.
