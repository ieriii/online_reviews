Awesome. Had 7:30pm reservations on a Saturday evening with my husband. This place is huge and gorgeous! So many rooms, all uniquely (and brightly!) decorated. There are lots of half naked photos of celebs on the wall...which was an interesting touch. We had phenomenal food (I had a chicken dish and my husband had beef). I also had the best Mojito I've ever tasted AND the best guacamole. The staff was great -- very helpful and attentive. We had a really amazing server who was really sweet and made great menu suggestions. There were a really interesting mix of people here. A lot of middle aged women who dressed like they were still in their 20s, but as the night went on more people our age (mid twenties) started to arrive. The ladies room was also great -- very big, very clean, and very well decorated... more naked celebs! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, but it's a bit pricey. Our meal + drinks + tip cost about $100 bucks, but for a special date night once in a while Carnivale is TOTALLY worth it!!
