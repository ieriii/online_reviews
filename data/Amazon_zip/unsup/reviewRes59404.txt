Problems: We waited over an hour for ONE pizza that we had pre-ordered in order to save time... yet, no time was saved. We got to Giordano's at 7:30, "pre-ordered" at 8:20, got seated at 8:50, and didn't' get our food till 9:30... surely something must be wrong. As we sat there we saw one family finish eating and paid, watched the table be bussed, watched a new family be seated, watched that new family order and then eat their food, while we continued to wait for ours. The waitress avoided us, not even making eye contact. The only time she was attentive was when she was trying to collect our paid bill. The pizza was NOT HOT, at best room temperature. Having been so hungry we just ate it but left a shit tip.You've been warned. For "world famous", you think they would have figured this out.
