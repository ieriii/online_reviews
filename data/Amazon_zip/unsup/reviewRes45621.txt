I think I just expected so much more... The place was nice, but didn't take my breath away. Came here on a Wed nite with a fellow yelper. She was waiting at the bar, and the bartender seemed very nice. The hostess was very accomodating of us, giving us a booth in the back rather than a front window table. We split the artichoke cheddar dip which was cheesy goodness, but the portion was smaller than it looked (it was a big plate but shallow). Came with lots of crostini that went unused b/c not enough dip for them. Then we split a BLT which was good but the peppercorn mayo was too peppery, making some bites barely edible. The coleslaw was medicore, and so was the pickle. We also shared some lemon dessert which was pretty good, but the shortbread seemed tough for her to break up and resulted in some slingshotted around the table. The service was friendly and good. I thought some of the items were a little pricey though.  5 stars for the SideCar, which came in a sugar-rimmed martini glass. I love my SideCars, and this was a really good one. I would go back for that alone :)
