the bounty: mojitos- the original version and a red version. i prefer the original but both will get you drunk (which I constantly test on my visits) baked goat cheese-delicious, but needs more toasted bread things (ah, crotinis i looked it up). is it bad to just start spooning it into my mouth. i might have done that. the grilled calamari-tender and nice smoky flavor. empanadas-quite tasty...but had better, but i can't remember where. damnit. someone tell me. cuban roast pork-super tender and lots of flavor. the yuca fritters are great. i could probably eat a basket of them. honey jalapeno pork chops-holy sweet jebus these chops are HUGE. trying to go drinking after eating these puppies is a tough affair. stick to shots. thats all you'll have room for. almond crusted halibut-flaky yet nice and meaty. i'd eat more but have no room due to pork chops pistachio crusted chicken-my old standby. juicy and flavorful. its like pseudo-fancy comfort food. i am considering becoming a part time dishwasher so that i can steal the recipes. ps-plenty of free easy parking on ravenswood (just past the viaduct).
