I ordered my first pizza from here this week and it was pretty good. Not out of this world, but not bad, hence the 3 star rating.  I had a 14" thin crust with sausage and pepperoni. The dough and the sauce were a bit bland for my taste. I guess you cant change the dough problem, unless it was a bit thinner and was able to become just a bit crispier. The sauce was just lacking any sort of tang or (i can't believe i'm using this word) pizzaz. Perfect amount of cheese and toppings though, and the 14" was definately enough to last me more than one meal. I would order from here again definately. I'd like to get a pan or stuffed pizza, the only reason I got thin crust was because that was what seemed to be recommended on here. And, again, it was good. Didn't blow me away but wasn't bad, hence my willingness to order again. Oh, also, my roomates girlfriend was there a few weekends ago for a wedding shower or something or other and she said they did a good job.
