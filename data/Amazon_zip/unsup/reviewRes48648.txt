After all the fuss getting a reservation, my expectations were a bit too high. We went for brunch, and that may have been a mistake. $11 for two tiny red-wine poached eggs on sourdough toast with a smattering of prosciutto? The ingredients were fresh enough, but I wasn't wowed enough to order it ever again--and I was still starving after I ate it.  I was particularly bummed that they were out of my first choice: Fried Chicken with Grits. (One would think they might make more of an effort to stock enough ingredients for the one dish on their menu that isn't pork?) One saving grace may have been the Concord Grape Coffee Cake, which was moist and divine. I wish I had enjoyed the food more, as the atmosphere (minus the odd, out-of-place sweatbands sported by some of the waitstaff) is fantastic. Specifically, the little individual dark wood bathroom stalls may be the cutest things I have ever seen. And the hosts and waiters really have their game down--efficient and polite without being snooty or annoying. I may go back for dinner/drinks, but I can't say that my brunch experience allows me to recommend Publican (yet)... REVISED: decided to give Publican another try, and this time they had the Fried Chicken & Grits. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait...greasy, fatty chicken in a batter that was light & falling off the chicken, as well as way too heavy on the sage. The grits were good, but seriously, who could mess up grits? My friend had the gigantic pot of mussels, which were lovely...moral of the review: stick to the pork and seafood!
