Stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend and was very happy with the hotel, the service and amenities. Location is great (right off the Grand-Red stop of the L), so easy to get to and close to a lot of great restaurants and activities. Wi-fi was a little slow, but there is a business center with 4 computers that you can use (for free!). Yes, it can be busy in there, just go during random hours (2am is a good time) and you're golden. Definitely would stay here again and recommend for anyone who is looking for a little extra room to spread out.
