Alright. It's time Las Tablas gained a star. Went with a huge group over the weekend, and the service was top notch! Our meals were delicious, I still have mad love for the Aborrajado (seriously, going to start making this at home), and whatever drink I had (something tasty with dark rum & blackberries) was sooo good. I just wish it were BYOB on the weekends.
