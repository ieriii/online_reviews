horribly horribly horribly SLOW service! we sat in the "lounge" area which is a very narrow row of leather booth seating mixed w/ wooden bleacher seats. it is towards the back along the wall. it was so narrow that every time a server delivered drinks to the table next to us i had to get up from my bleacher seat and make room. was i at a baseball game? the service was slower than molasses in january. our guy came over 3 times during our 3-ish hour stay...and our drinks were continually left empty. so sad. the drinks were, however, quite tasty...i just wish i couldve sampled more of them. i will not return to this bar. cool aesthetics tho, but that coolness doesn't over-shine the sloooooooooooow service.
