OMG I love deep dish pizza! When I visited Chicago, it was recommended to us that we try the pizza here. My husband and I ordered a medium 'Special' deep dish pizza which had sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions. After a LONG 45 minute wait (we were starving and it was 9:30pm), our pizza arrived. It was the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. It was a slice of hot cheesy, greasy goodness! Definitely a must try if you're in Chicago.
