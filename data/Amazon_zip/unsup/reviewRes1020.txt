I had to do some photos for a website here and decided to go on a Monday in order to at least try some food without waiting the typical 2 hours as most do on the weekends.  After 20 minutes in line, I finally made my order of the Anna Kendrick and a Chicago style as well to compare. Let me just say that I'm a BIG fan of hot dogs and as far as food goes, I will try anything at least once. Having said that, I would be more than happy to wait in line any day for Hot Doug's! I have never had a hot dog as smokey and snappy as the dogs I had here. Absolutely delicious! I didn't get a chance to try the duck fat fries but one day I'm sure.
