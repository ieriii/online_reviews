I am not worthy of giving Alinea a review. Our experience was by far exceeded in every absolute sense of the word - and in every absolute sense of the experience: touch, taste, sight, sound, scent. If you're worried about the cost, don't waste your time. Money is mere child's play in this realm. I would gladly pay twice as much for the experience we had.
