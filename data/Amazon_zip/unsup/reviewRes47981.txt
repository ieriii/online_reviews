I went to the Publican for the first time last week and I loved it! The have Tito's vodka (my favorite) so they won points with me right away! Let your waiter help you figure out what to order because the sizes of the dishes vary widely and, depending on how many people are in your party, you may need more or less of certain items. I found that the simpler dishes like the chicken (to die for), the pork belly (so good it almost made my cry), and the corn (who knew corn could be so good) were the best. My husband got the chefs selection of oysters and said they were good but not the best he had ever had.  Waiter was super friendly and helpful. Dinner went long...3.5 hours but I don't know if that was because the waiters thought we wanted to sit and talk or if The Publican just offers a leisurely dining environment. I would go there again in a minute! Loved.
