My girlfriend choze ZED 451 as our dining place for New Years Eve. It was a fabulous selection. We felt like ZED would be similar to Fogo de Chao, and it was, but it was different in several ways, too. First, I must say that I love Fogo de Chao. ZED's food selection topped Fogo's, at least on this night, due to the addition of a Raw Bar (unfortunately, this was a New Year's Eve addition, as I understand it, and not always available) which included two of my favorites: cold crab claws and raw oysters. The claws were good, but the oysters were THE BEST I've ever had. Other bars included a different twist on your typical salad bar, a soup bar, a combo bread/fruits/cheese bar, and a dessert bar that was tremendous! I haven't even commented on the main course! The meats were very tasty and cooked perfectly. From the prime rib to the roast duck, from the blackened catfish to the salmon, to the snapper...all very delicious...and each very different from what you might receive at more traditional restaurants. But my favorite was the BBQ pork. Needless to say, I got my money's worth.  The atmosphere was a step up from Fogo de Chao. It was romantic...somewhat quiet...definitely classy.  Beer choices were very strange (not the usual choices), but I enjoyed my choice immensely. My girlfriend said her Cab was excellent.  Our waiter, Jacob, was awesome. Very attentive...very helpful...enjoyed having conversation with him. He was a definite plus. I can't wait for my next visit to ZED451. It won't be too far into the future. Oh, by the way...I must also mention the fact that ZED451 provided door-to-door shuttle service. This, too, was much appreciated.
