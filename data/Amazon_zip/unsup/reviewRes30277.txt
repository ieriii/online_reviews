The bar in the evening is usually too crowded to function in, but every now and then a bunch of space mysteriously opens up, usually after 9. The margaritas are real (not made with mix) and not overly sweet. The food is always excellent, though the menu is depressing because it has too many references to goat (or did the last time I could bring myself to look at it). Six stars for the jicama salad, which comes in a parfait glass and which I assume you are supposed to eat with your fingers like french fries--I did, anyway. Really good, and absurdly healthy, which shouldn't matter but sometimes it does, obscurely. The perfect bar food, reinvented. The space itself is gorgeous, and while I suppose purists would be offended by the decorative use of sacred objects, I just appreciate the nonmuseum opportunity to look up at the ceremonial animal costumes on the wall, especially the jaguar one, which eventually reminds me to pay the bar bill and get home to feed the cat.
