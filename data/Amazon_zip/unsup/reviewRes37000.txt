We went to visit this place it was mentioned on Dine, Dives host Guy from the food channel They have a unbelievable variety of beer on draft. I ordered the sausage and bean for appetizer The sausage was not bad, but the white beans were under cooked. The corn dish was fantastic with that sauce. I had the pork chops, it was good , with the trimmings.. Fantastic pickled peaches.. My Friend had the brisket, he claimed it was good (not unbelievable like Guy claims), but rather dry. I tried it, and compare to my Texas experience, I had better. The have a cool bottle for tap water drinking..
