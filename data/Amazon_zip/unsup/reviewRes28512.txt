I went for dinner two weeks ago as part of a "I live in Chicago but I feel like being a tourist" day. We were lucky enough to walk right in and get seated at the "kitchen view back bar". No wait! And our water was always full because the "kitchen" was the beverage station. They'd just peak through the ferns and fill our water from the back. The more margaritas we had, the more entertaining it was when we caught them sneaking out more water. One disappointment of the evening- no salsa! I love the frontera salsa and eat about 3 jars a week (I love the guajillo and tomatillo the best) so I was really hoping for some to start the meal. I think Rick's is a little too classy for the free chips and salsa routine.  Everything we had was great, but I think that the highlights were the ceviche and the fish of the day main entree. We ordered the ceviche trio- the white fish was my favorite by a landslide and the calamari was pretty good, but I really didn't care for the sweet flavor of the tuna ceviche. I ordered the steak for my main entree- it was good but I think I ate more of my date's fish of the day. I believe it is usually a meaty-type white fish. We got chicken in a yellow mole in masa boats that were very simple but delicious and unique- kind of how everything was. Very enjoyable and special. When I go back I will definitely get the ceviche again, but I will skip the sampler and just get the white fish. I would also get a fish or seafood entree as Master Rick seems to excel with those. I will also only go for one appetizer so I have room for desert! Thanks Rick- love ya!
