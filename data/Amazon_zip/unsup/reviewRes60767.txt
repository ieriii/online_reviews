This is hands down my favorite breakfast place in the city. It's pricey but totally worth it!I love how they tweak their dishes to give traditional recipes an edge .The nuski (not sure if this is the correct spelling) bacon is so great I order it every time I go along with a soy mocha, which is delicious as well.I highly suggest you try it if you are in the area!
