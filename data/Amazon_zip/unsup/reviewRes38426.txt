I've been there in the past and enjoyed the food. So when I found myself back in Chicago, I wanted to order some Giordano's pizza and have it delivered. I called the restaurant to order. The girl on the line was really rude. When she said something garbled that I didn't understand, I asked her kindly to repeat it. She smirkly asked me whether I understand English ???  Note that this place knows that they don't depend on repeat business so service is not their top priority. Yes, food is great, but there are plenty of other places where you can get both great pizza and good service. Never again for me.
