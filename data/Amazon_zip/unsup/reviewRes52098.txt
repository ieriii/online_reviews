One of the items on my agenda during my recent trip to Chicago was getting some of that Chicago deep dish pizza. We headed out to Gino's East and there was a line wrapped around the corner.  Once we finally got in, we ordered the appetizer sampler and a Gino's East Supreme Deep Dish Pizza. It takes about 45 minutes for the deep dish pizza to be made and about 30 for the thin crust I believe. I also overheard that you could do half and half with the toppings.  The appetizer sampler came with mozarella sticks, spinach sticks, and calamari and two dipping sauces: marinara and cocktail. The spinach sticks were good. I never had it before and it had good flavor. On to the pizza. So I guess what differentiates Chicago deep dish is that the cheese goes in the middle and everything else (sauce & toppings) on top. Way too much cheese for me. I couldn't even finish the pizza. I brought it home and did snack on it later that evening. The overwhelming amount of cheese wasn't so bad after it had cooled and hardened. I am a big fan of cold pizza just as much as hot pizza. So if you decide to come here, be prepared to wait, both outside, for a table, and inside, for cooking time.
