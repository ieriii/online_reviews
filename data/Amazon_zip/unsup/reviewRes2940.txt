It's a high 5 stars before I went to Alinea. I'd give the food 4.5 stars but 6 stars for their service. Atmosphere and decoration are good. I always like the contemporary/modern style. I went there twice and the food were good specially the desert cart. I ordered the collection menu both time. Good things they change the menu every season. If you close your eyes and taste the food, you can tell what season it is. Service is top notch. All servers are nice and professional. Everytime when we lean forward and about 1" detached from the chair. 2 servers will come and move the table and pull the chair for you. Overall experience was great. I'd recommend to others. It worth for the price and you won't expect less.
