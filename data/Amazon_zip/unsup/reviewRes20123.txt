XOCO...I heart you! I would move from California to Chicago just for you (and Frontera Grill). XOCO is great anytime of the day. Hit up XOCO for some empanadas in the morning and wash it all down with a delicious chocolate cappuccino. Or swing by around lunch time for some tortas and a curiously spiced chocolate hazelnut cookie. Caldos (soups) are available after 3 pm. Of course, when bitten by that dessert bug, you can always get some freshly fried to order churros and some chocolate frozen yogurt to dip them in. Rick Bayless is a true master at layering flavors and spices. Even a casual eatery like XOCO serves up sophisticated and absolutely sublime flavors. Every bite blew me away. And at such an affordable price, my only regret is not having XOCO as my corner cafe.
