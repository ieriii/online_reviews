I have been to Piccolo Sogno a few times now and hopefully I can make it back while the weather is nice to have an evening on the patio with a few more bottles of wine. I have pretty much sampled the entire menu. I'm always a fan of soup and the fresh mozzerella was amazing. I enjoyed all of the pastas, duck, chicken, and thought my fish was just a tad over done. I did a sample of all of the deserts with a group of friends and I do not mind the small portion, so my butterscotch shot was the winner.
