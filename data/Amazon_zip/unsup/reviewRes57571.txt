Good: - Free valet parking - Attentive staffs who do clean your table periodically - Food price is reasonable (not for drinks)Bad: - Crowded, crowded, crowded - I guess it's a plus for many people then, but I do prefer quite place that I can have normal conversation, not having to talk loudly. - No free refill for fountain drinks (seriously, $2 for each glass of 2/3 ice and 1/3 coke?) - The family style option is awful (I chose #1), the quality is extreme mediorce. - The roast lamb leg has a taste of something else (most of you here probably have not tasted that something else, and I don't bother to mention it, if I do most of you will puke. Yeah, I'm an Asian, I did eat weird thing) - Incorrect food description: In the menu they have Dolmades and Meatballs. Let me correct this, you got ONE piece of Dolma and ONE piece of Meatball. No plural there. - I don't even have Karidopita for desert even though it's on the menuI have no clue why people rated this place so high, Yelp failed me this time. I would have rated it 2 stars if the service was not good enough.
