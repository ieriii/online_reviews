I came to The Gage again for dinner tonight and I decided I needed to give the place an extra star for good all-around food since there are so few options in the Loop. Our server was nice and very attentive, helpfully pointing out that we might have a "french fry overload" since we ordered the poutine with our Gage burgers (which already came with fries). I knew that I had to have the poutine, so I switched my french fries for a side salad. The poutine was ok. I wish they had left off the elk ragout and added more cheese curds! The elk was a little too gamey for my taste and though I like the gravy on poutine, I don't like actual chunks of meat. Our burgers were good though, same as last time. Very juicy and way to big to eat cohesively, so we ended up eating ours with silverware. The side salad that came with my burger was even better, with raisins, grapes, and lots of blue cheese. Though stuffed, we decided to split the "coffee and donuts" dessert. It was a good choice - little donut holes topped with cinnamon sugar mixed with little balls of fried chocolate ganache, all poured with a coffee syrup. Delicious and great for sharing. Our waiter was really good and non-intrusive, but the busboys were sort of like vultures, hovering over our table every other minute to take dishes away or check our water glasses. Oh well. Anyway, I had a great time, and it's a solid choice for dinner.
