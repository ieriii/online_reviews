Yay!!! I can officially upgrade my rating!!! So, the second experience here was far better than the first. I fell bad that I dont remember our servers name because he was amazing. Mike? Chris? Sorry I dont remember. He came around to greet us and grab our drink order and I was not sure which wine I wanted but gave him a couple of references. He came back a couple of seconds later with one for me to try and it was PERFECT. On the first try, good job.  He was definitely more knowledgeable about the menu and so much more enthusiastic about it, which can make all of the difference. He suggested their grilled cheese of the day which was great, a really great suggestion. Other than that, it was basically a repeat of the food we had before. For desert we added the Affogato, it was so yummy. I think I could have had one or two more.   I would definitely suggest going here later in the evening, I think that is when they have their A-gamers on.
