I went here on a cold, snowy night and was welcomed by the cozy, warm atmosphere. Some people call it crammed, I call it well-packed. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a nice booth in the back. I have a thing for big menus- meaning I like them. I enjoy having lots of options, although some of the odd names I could do without. If I were there with kids they would have loved that so I will let that slide. I had the soup and salad bar which was very tasty. Though not the best salad bar, it brought back good memories of salad bars from the past with the wide array of offerings. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich and that looked very tasty. The fries were unique and like fresh potato chips in my opinion. Our service was attentive and friendly. Overall, RJ Grunts is a nice option when you feel like american food plain and simple. No frills, but the service and food you expect of a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. And I must say that going in the winter is prime time if you want to feel like the cozy atmosphere is a plus.
