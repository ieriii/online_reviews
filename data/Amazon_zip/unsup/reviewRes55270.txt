This place is a meat lovers paradise! I normally try to go for lunch since it's half price. I steer clear of the chicken (not that its bad, but I'm there for steak). Their salad bar has a huge selection for you to choose from, unlike any other I've ever seen. Everything is really good especially the lamb chops. Just writing about it makes me want to ditch work and go downtown!!!! Very, very good and the service is exceptional!
