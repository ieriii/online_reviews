Going out on a limb and gonna say that the meal I just had at Brazzaz ranks in top 10 all-time.. this place is seriously no joke. The salad bar is complete with ceviche, seared tuna, bbq shrimp, crisp lettuce and insanely fresh vegetable sides including south american flavors.. this is a 2-3 trip salad bar and really could be dinner alone... Typical brazilian steakhouse where the servers cut dozens of cuts of meat at your table in addition to fresh pineapple, chicken breast, shrimp and cuts of sausage.. I had a bit of the few cuts and all were mouth watering... as funny as this sounds, even the bread on the table was insane.. kind of a croissant meets cheese danish mixture... I went ahead and ordered, what turned out to be, the largest Australian Lobster Tail I have Ever Seen.. EASILY 3 lbs... they cooked it in butter and garlic sauce.. I have been eating australian lobster tail since the age of 8 and this is the BEST I have ever eaten.. bar none.. Would I go back?... well first, I'm going to sleep off the food coma and spend about 3 hours in the gym tomorrow morning, but after that.. I'm heading back there tomorrow.. for lunch!
