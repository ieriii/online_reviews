Note: this review only pertains to the 25 cent oyster special We went into Shaw's last night for their 25 cent oyster special from 3-6. We arrived around 4 pm and there was about a half hour wait for a table at the oyster bar so we decided to try and grab seats at the bar. We ended up waiting about 10 minutes and 2 tables opened up. Hooray! The server at the bar immediately asked us if we were in for the oyster special and asked if she should put in an order for some oysters. A few minutes later, we were happily eating a dozen oysters each, bread from their bread bowl (3 types of bread, all pretty good), and sipping on our martini and beer. We ended up eating 1 more dozen each for a total of 4 dozen between the 2 of us. The oysters were pretty fresh (which surprised me because at 25 cents, I wasn't expecting much). Some of them though were oddly creamy... there was a milky liquid in them which kind of weirded me out. But this was only about 1 or 2 of them in each dozen. So, overall still pretty good. Here's some 411 for all the 1st timers: 1. The oysters are 25 cents each but you cannot choose the type of oyster that you want. The 25 cent special only applies to the one that they are serving during the special. See #2 2. Half off all other oysters (so you can still sample the others at a decent price) 3. You can order 2 dozen oysters at a time
