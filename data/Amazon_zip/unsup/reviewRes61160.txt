I used to love this place but now since they remodeled and more white people go here. The service is bad. The waitresses are just rude and look at you like you dont have the money to spend there. Its just bad when your own race looks at you that way and treats you that way. This has happened to me more than 2 times. They have become over priced and they are becoming bland in flavor.
