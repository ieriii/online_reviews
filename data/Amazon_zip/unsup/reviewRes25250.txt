This was great deep dish, and it will be your favorite if you like the caramelized crust. Personally, I like more savory crusts. I recommend making reservations and/or placing your order while you're waiting. We were seated upstairs in the back room, which was quite loud/ had more of a rowdy sports bar environment... but the other upstairs room was a lot more mellow, so might be worthwhile to request specific seating if this matters to you. It was definitely *too* loud for me.
