Yeah- might as well add my review to this admirable mountain of praise for Noon O Kabab. All Hail! It really does deserve it, they have super tasty Persian food. The menu is not very extensive allowing Noon O Kabab to specialize all their dishes. Everything is fresh and full-O-flavor. The dill rice, my oh my, so tasty! Check out their website for the complete menu and nice sideshows of the restaurant and a "Culinary Gallery" to make you hungry. The only thing that detracted from my visit was being seated next to a table of morons. Three insecure real estate agents talked at the top of their voices about nothing "blah blah open house, blah, mortgage rates, blah, my wife's cooking is terrible, blah!". Received phone calls (ringers set to ridiculously loud and allowed to continue several times so we can all benefit from the "hilarious" novelty ringtones) and accepted the calls on speakerphone! Transcript follows: Table of morons- "hello, guess where we are?" Caller- "am I on speakerphone?" Morons- "Noona ka- wha the, what's this place called? waiter!" Caller- [silence] Morons- "Jealous we are here?! You are not here with us! You are so on speakerphone!" Caller- "you guys are idiots" [hangs up] Sorry to derail the review, it was a good reminder for me to silence my phone when in a restaurant. I think new parking meters have been installed, everywhere! Pay attention to where you park or your dinner will get expensive in a hurry. This place is great, eat here!
