Food is fantastic. We loved the hamachi crudo and burrata - yum! Cocktails are excellent, but service takes forever (at least 20 minutes for a glass of wine). Service was definitely friendly, but odd all around. Couldn't get the guy's attention to order a drink and, then, another gal kept interrupting us in the middle of conversation to check how things were going... But only when we had full drinks and food. We weren't rushed, which was great, but the service level/intensity was inconsistent. Really cool space, but the music was odd. Although I enjoy country music, it seemed really out of place (and distracting). Not sure what was up with that?!?
