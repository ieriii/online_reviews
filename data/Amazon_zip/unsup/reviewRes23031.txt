Got taken here for my birthday lunch. So, super big fan cause I didn't have to pay...YAY! However, the food was awesome!!! Fantastic Saganaki....Check! Dolmades....Check! Lamb Meatballs....Check! Spankopita....Check! Feta Cheese....Check!  Super duper good food...I love how you can create your own combo with all the popular Greek dishes. Wine was good...service was A-OK!  I usually go to Santorini's....I'll mix the two up going forward. Very pleased!
