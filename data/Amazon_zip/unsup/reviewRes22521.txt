A few weeks ago, Greek Islands redeemed itself after having poisoned me that one fateful night in January. I figured I could employ my mercy in revisiting the supposedly-famous Greek establishment in Chicago's Greek Town.  This time, no food poisoning. And the food was delicious - though, I must say, I was NOT a fan of the flaming cheese. I did, however, indulge in the fantastic broiled swordfish shishkabob among many other deletable dishes. Grilled octupus and Melitzanosalata were two of my favorite appetizers.  Now, the dessert. Still no food poisoning here but DISAPPOINTING. We ordered the chocolate cake the Greek Island Special... and both were TOO sweet and just tasteless. My dining companion and I agreed that we should've ended our meal with the entrees and then walked down to Artopolis bakery for dessert. I'd come again for their seafood. But not for dessert, for sure.
