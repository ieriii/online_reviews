I've been to Frontera several times and have never been disappointed with my meals. The food is delicious and the service is helpful and friendly. I recommend their raw oysters, which are served with a couple of sauces - a tomatillo habanero mignonette and a chipotle garlic salsa. Fresh limes and bottled hot sauces are also great with the oysters. My favorite entree is the Carne Asada A La Oaxaquena, which is a rib eye steak that's marinated in spicy red chile, wood grilled, and served with black beans, sweet plantains with sour cream, and guacamole. I love this combination and have ordered this meal quite a few times. I also tried huitlacoche for the first time at Frontera. They were in enchiladas - the huitlacoche and roasted vegetables wrapped in fresh corn tortillas, topped with a tomatillo sauce and melted Jack cheese. It was a great vegetarian option. Of course, the margaritas are fantastic. And if you still have room, the desserts are excellent as well. This is one Chicago restaurant where the hype is well deserved.
