Shopping at Fox & Obel is like being on a treasure hunt... you never know what kind of tasty treat you're going to come across. If I lived closer, this is where I'd shop all the time -- but it does have free valet.  The cafe is amazing too. A perfect stop with friends after a yoga class or before a movie.
