I love the Green Mill every time I am there. No matter the night. This place is what legendary nights are made of as it is party of so many legends. Located in the historic uptown area where Al Capone used to hang, the Mill was once in the entertainment center of this city--Uptown Theater, Aragon, Phoenix and a Dance Hall that rivaled Radio City. There are even underground tunnels and secrets to go with those, but more on the bar... The drinks are good--they'll rock ya, but are not expensive. The wooden bar that snakes around long toward the stage and around the corner is amazing. There is even a small raised piano stage behind the bar. If you can snag a booth those are comfy and if you want to hear the music work your way closer. Sometimes since the booths are big you can share and make new friends. This place can get packed pretty much any night (it is a trip to go in during the day). Oh and the bathrooms are really to the back right up almost on the stage. I have seen and heard some great music here and as some reviewers mention they can jam late. Thursday nights they still pack a 16 piece swing orchestra up onto the stage. However what I have been to the most, dozens of times, is the Poetry Slam.  The Slam founder Marc Smith (his site: http://www.slampapi.com/) is often still the one who leads the Sunday night festivities and they are cool and eclectic--Incorporating and open poetry read, a feature poet (usually from out of town) and then the Slam where poets sign up to compete as judged by the audience for 10 bucks! I have slammed here and watched slams here and nights can be electric, especially when it is packed and the poets rock. It can also be fun when the poets suck as the audience is known to heckle. If you are in Chicago looking for something cool and unique get yourself to the Mill and hope you can get a seat.
