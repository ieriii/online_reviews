Mmm. Comfort food. You don't even need to read the rest of this review because if you like hearty southern food, you just need to go. Now. Stop reading and go.  (Ok, if you must read, you must.) First off, no idea that the decor was going to be so....nice. Yet, it still felt homey and warm. Our server admitted that he was a little overextended (my words) but my hub and I were in no rush and if you have ever been to a restaurant in the south, well, you know "slow." We started with the pulled pork grit cakes and the shrimp and crawfish bisque. Both were delicious though one more pinch of salt in the soup and it would have been overkill.  I had the chicken fried steak and my hub had the ribs. His ribs were tasty but we suspect they were boiled because the bones came completely clean. His fried okra was also overbattered. But, alas, who doesn't love fried anything? Speaking of fried anything, my chicken fried steak was fantastic. Oy. So good.  It was served with a white gravy, crazy amazing mashed potatoes and greens (which were forgettable. I really didn't order chicken fried steak with my daily allowance of vegetables in mind.) (Sidebar: it was served with white gravy and on a recent episode of Throwdown, the Queen of Butter and Mayonnaise, Paula Deen, tells Bobby Flay that real southern chicken fried steak is served with brown gravy not white gravy. Take from that what you wish.) Lastly, we had the red velvet for dessert. The cake sucked. The icing was heavenly. Because my heaven is made of cream cheese icing.
