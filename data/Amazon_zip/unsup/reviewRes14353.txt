Bacon fat popcorn. Really that is all I should have to say..it's amazing!! Came here for lunch during the week after deciding to stay home from work one day. Service was good and so was the food. The hubby got the pulled pork sandwich which he said was "amazing" and I had the chicken sandwich was also really good. And again, the bacon fat popcorn, I mean what genius came up with that? A must try!! Will definitely be back!
