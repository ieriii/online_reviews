I'm late to the party, but I finally made it to Hot Doug's. Always frightened away by the lines, I came on a random Tuesday off. We waited about 20 minutes, not bad. I liked it, but honestly I like Franks n Dawgs better... is that wrong? I think it's the bread. Toasted lobster roll beats nondescript hot dog bun any day of the week. Also, I wish they melted the cheese onto the dog instead of serving it cold. I had to try the foie gras dog, which was as rich and fatty as it sounds. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was recommended by Doug when I asked him to choose between that and the Elk sausage, and it was good but didn't blow me away. My friend had a delicious Chicken Rosemary sausage. Their fries are handcut and served in huge portions. Drink refills are free! So yeah, it's really good. But I'd rather go to Franks n Dawgs (which had no wait) and sit on their backyard patio. Glad I went though, it can now be crossed off my Chicago bucket list. Oh, and Doug is as genuinely nice as everyone says.
