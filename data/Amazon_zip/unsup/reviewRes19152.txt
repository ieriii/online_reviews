Two words: fail. overrated. Went today for lunch to avoid the long lines. Started off with the empanada, churro, hot chocolate morning special while we waited for lunch to start at 11 am. Empanada was the highlight of the meal - flaky and tasty. And everything went downhill from there. The churro was hard as a rock. Tried to cut it into two pieces and one piece went flying into my girlfriend's face. I think it had been sitting out for awhile or something. Started lunch off with guac which was disappointing. It was a tiny cup and there was NOTHING special about it - not worth 5 bucks. Got the Ahogada torta and the Pork Belly Vermicelli Caldos. Both were suggestions of the server there. Ahogada was dipped in this tomato soup that was way too salty. The Caldos was this soup with noodles and pork belly . . again the soup was way too salty. Both soups were too salty for me too finish. The vermicelli was almost like the japanese buckwheat noodles and tasted misplaced in a Mexican dish. Pork belly was crispy and pretty good.  40 dollars for 2 people. I walked out with huge buyer's remorse. I don't write very many reviews on Yelp. The last one I wrote was on my dentist because he is the sh*t. I had to write one immediately on Xoco because it was such a huge fail.
