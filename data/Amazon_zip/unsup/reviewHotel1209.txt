The Hyatt at McCormick Place was the second hotel that I stayed at during my recent visit to Chicago. I was unsatisfied with my previous location and was in a rush to check into the Hyatt. Although the regular check in time is at 3pm, I explained my situation to a front desk girl at 8am and she quickly found a great room for me. I settled into my room shortly thereafter.  The corner room that I was given had all of the regular Hyatt Regency features like the cushy bed, pillows, textured wall treatments, stone bathroom floors, etc. These features were on par with the two previous stays that I've had across the country this past summer with HR so I can say that HR is of consistently decent quality. The main difference that I found at this Hyatt was that there was no concierge present during the whole duration of my visit. Rather, the guest services helped us out and were our de facto concierges. Our concierges were helpful with recommendations because there are no nearby eateries unless you count the Connie's Pizza and McDonalds located deep in the belly of the McCormick Center.  Taking a cab is essential to get a good impression of the city no matter what hotel you use. Although the HR has a free one way shuttle (leaves on the top of each hour), it only makes three stops: the museum campus, water tower and Navy pier. All of these stops are great taxi pickup spots, you can get closer to your intended destinations. Thankfully I ended my stay in Chicago with the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place. I've learned that I can depend on them for great amenities and customer service. I'll look forward to staying at another one in the future.
