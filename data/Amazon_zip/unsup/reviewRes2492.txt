Yes! This was probably the Best Hot Dog I have ever had. And, I would go back if I am ever in Chicago again. Here are a couple tips: 1. Make sure you go hungry because you will want to order everything on the menu. 2. Try to find out the time when there are the least amount of people in line. Yep, that's right there was a HUGE line outside, and it was below freezing outside when we went. We waited almost an hour. (reason for only 4 stars and not 5) I just had to prepare you. Still, like I wrote, "Best Hot Dog", ever. Oh, and the cheese fries were pretty darn good too.
