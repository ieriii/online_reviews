Deep dish pizza in Chicago is a must. Of the different deep dishes that I've tried over the years, Gino's distinguishes itself from other deep dish joints in Chicago. The standard pie in which I compare all other pies is the Denino's Italian sausage pie, which is a simple Neapolitan pie with Italian sausage alone. It's easy to compare different bread texture, taste, and the mixture of tomato/sausage/cheese aroma. Gino's pizza, compared to this particular pie from Denino's, is similar. However, because it's cooked for such a long time there is a lot more butter/olive oil on the bottom of the bread. Compared to other deep dish pizzas Gino's uses less salt overall, which I enjoyed very much. They also give a choice of patty or crumbled style of sausage topping; I recommend that you go patty. You get more sausage that way. Only three stars from me, just because I like NY Neapolitan style better; for advocates of deep dish pizzas, this joint is a must try.
