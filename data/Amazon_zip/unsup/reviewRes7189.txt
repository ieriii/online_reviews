Went here back in Feb. and got the same thing I got before, the lobster pasta, something "Aragosta"-This time round it wasn't that good- I think the pasta wasn't cooked enough b/c there were so many pieces that were like slime, piles of yellow goo-I just picked out the firm pieces, but honestly I didn't taste a lot of lobster, mainly riccotta cheese- Menu is a little limited, large portions though-If you get on their mailer you will have coupons coming for life-I expect a little Italian place like this to wow me with unique dishes that have me coming back, I tried this place for the second time and it will be my last-
