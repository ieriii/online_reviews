We have so many Great Steak Houses in Chicago and surrounding suburbs, but I think Ruth's Chris is in most people's top 3. The atmospere is classy, and the food is superb. The steaks - filet mignon, t-bones just melt in your mouth. But I can't stop there, I must give a shout out for there lobster bisque too! One of our pride and joy restaurant, get way to end your day after shopping on the magnificent mile!  Superb service all the time! Just simply marvelous, darling!
