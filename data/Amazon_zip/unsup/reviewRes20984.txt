I went to Coast recently after a recommendation from a friend. The tables were spaced far enough apart to create a great atmosphere for a romantic dinner, especially with their BYOB and no corkage fee policy. We ordered four rolls and loved them all but the White Dragon stood out as our favorite. We had the sampler special for dessert which included a tempura banana with chocolate sauce which was delicious. Coast lived up to its lofty expectations and was very fairly priced compared to other area sushi restaurants.
