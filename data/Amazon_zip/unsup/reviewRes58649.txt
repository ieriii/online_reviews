I am such a fan of this cafe and wine bar! I've been the the 3rd Coast several times, and always leave satisfied with my meal and experience. The best part about this restaurant is the combined cuisine and ambiance. The service is great, laid back but attentive. Meals to try: the Mediterranean Salad (green olives, feta cheese, fabulous citrus oregano vinagarette), the Turkey and Brie sandwich (melts in your mouth), and Diablo's Tacos (super fresh ingredients like cilantro, cabbage, onion, and amazing spicy salsa). I will go back again and again, I recommend the same to you!
