This place is tasty! The vibe was that of a speakeasy (which I am definitely a sucker for) and the food was so rich (but not too rich) and delicious. To start we shared ham & cheese fondue with toasted sourdough & fried farm egg. Put an over easy egg on anything and I'll love it, but the presentation on this was perfect- the egg was plopped right in the center of the fondue, cooked just enough so that you can avoid salmonella while getting a swirl of cheese and egg in every bite. For my entree, I went with the equally heavy and delectable oven roasted pork meatballs with anson mills stone ground grits & thyme brown butter. I'm pretty sure we ordered dessert as well, but I was too full to notice, I happily rolled myself back to my hotel room and swore not to eat the next day. But it was definitely worth it.
