So let me start by stating that I am a "lover of the pig." With that being said I had the opportunity to dine at this fine establishment with a couple of friends last night and waked away feeling pleasantly surprised and utterley dissappointed. The following applies to what made my stomach smile: 1) Yummy....pig platter! (They have the best pickled tongue...give me a pound of that between to slices of thick bread and I'm a happy camper) 2) Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic....ohhhhh so good! 3) Milk Braised Pork Shoulderwith Mashed Potatoes....the meat was tender and melted in your mouth. 4) Fried Halibut Cheeks....anything fried is good! In terms of what I considered utterley dissappointing....... I would recommend not going there on a Saturday night becasue our party ended up waiting for 2 hours! I will have to say the hostess staff was extremely apologetic and served us some appetizers while we waiting. Also, when dining at any establishment I bellieve it is proper etiquette for the the server to introduce each entree to the table. We had the pig platter and a 3 cheese plate selection and had no clue what was being served to us.......I don't like playing the guessing game when dining. Overall, I would recommend to defintiely dine there but try to stay clear of of the weekend rush
