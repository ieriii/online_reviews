truly italian. the owner locks sight of you at some point during your visit not to size you up, but to remember you for next time. it's a place with a heart. they want you to feel like family, the good and the bad. the waiter will tell you if he's had better days and exactly what you can't miss on the menu, according to him. they don't cut the pizzas and rightly so, the middle of the crust gets soggy faster than your mom's mood changes. my only complaint is the expense, considering it IS pizza.
