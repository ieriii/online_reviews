The hotel itself, including the restaurant and top-floor bar were great but I have an overall negative impression of this hotel because of the terrible customer service. The employees would rather chat with one another than help address my needs. When my key card stopped working repeatedly, the girl at the front desk actually rolled her eyes at the fact that she had to reset the card again. When we ordered breakfast up to the room, they brought me a mug for my tea that had dried out coffee at the bottom. When I called to say they brought me a dirty mug and only decaf tea, they did not return for over 20 minutes when I just had to leave to make it to my meeting on time. When I called to say not to bother with the replacements, they didn't even apologize for the mistakes or inconvenience. I will never stay at this hotel again.
