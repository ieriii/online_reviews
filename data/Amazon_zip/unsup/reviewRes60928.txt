We got there early to try some of their wine flights, which had several different choices. When we sat down I ordered the Monk fish and it was excellent, plus I asked the server to pair the fish with a wine and he brings over a Malbec. At first I was a little unsure about the choice, but after tasting the wine with the fish it was a great choice. The only downside of the night was where we sat. The restaurant was large and open, when we got there it was about half full and we sat in the middle of two tables where I could extend my arms and touch both people at those tables. We might as well sat at the same table. Besides that I would go back but definitely request a more private table.
