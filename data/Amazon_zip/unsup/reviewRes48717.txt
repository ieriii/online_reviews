OVERRATTED. Many foodies i know have suggested this place, and i don't know why. I now think less of them and take their suggestions with a grain of salt. the only reason i give two stars is because of the beer list. it reminded me of really a bad culinary school menu. We went in with a party of six and ordered over half the menu to share. Service was on point, but lacking any character what so ever, so did the food. Souless and bland country cooking. Yuck. I will never go back. Instead i suggest the Gilt bar. Those boys know what's up. If you are into pale white and tasteless, please by all means this place is for you.
