I like this place so much that I break my 2 "I will never" statements about buying food. I Never #1 - I will never go get cash special for a restaurant. They should take credit/debit cards. For Hot Dougs, I will ATM it without even blinking, I never #2 - I'm not going to wait in a long line for food. This is Chicago and there are too many places that have delicious food. For Hot Dougs, I break this rule except when it's below 0 and that's where I draw the line. The line moves Ok - but it's is so worth what's inside. Ok - now the inside.... it's the Mecca of encased meats. A dozen or so celebrity named sausages.... my favorite is the Marty Allen - Beef, Pork, and Garlic, Grilled....with my favorite toppings and a side of Duck fries! Damn... I've made myself hungry.... Then there's the specials - They've got a specials menu that's about as large as the regular menu, but it's headlined by a Celeb of the week, and a game of the week. The selections are amazing, and totally worth straying from your normal favorite..
