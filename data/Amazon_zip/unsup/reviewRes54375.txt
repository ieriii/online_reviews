Made a reservation at Pequod's for my birthday and the staff was more than accomdating for all 15 of us. The pizzas took a while to come out, and they actually forgot to put in our one thin crust we ordered...but absolutely well worth the wait and they took off 50% of the pizza they forgot about...I actually almost forgot the negative experience because I enjoyed the food so much.As for the pizza, it's amazing...from the crispy, caramalized cheese crust to the delicious sauce and endless toppings..it's perfection on a plate. The pizza differs from Lou's or a Gino's, which is much appreciated! It was so refreshing to find a place like this, and not too far away. I will gladly return again and again!
