The space is nice, service very quick, staff friendly. But this was definitely only an ok place for me. The biggest issue is the food. When you advertise as a bbq place, I expect, rightly or wrongly, legitimate bbq. I had the appetizer flight with the pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket and was pretty disappointed. As others have commented before, the chips they give you to start are too dry and seasoned incorrectly and somewhat gross but that's all there was to eat while waiting. The meat...well, it was dry and insufficiently pulled and then the brisket was just chunks of steak. The meat was an okay quality, but I expected brisket, not steak cut like I'm at chipotle or a small child. The meat hadn't been properly marinated, none of the juices or flavors were in the meat - it seemed like they were trying too hard to make bbq fancy and in the process, removed what makes bbq good. The bbq sauces were also a disappointment. The spicy one had such a small amount of spice that we tried it multiple times completely plain, trying to identify what would justify this as spicy. The regular bbq sauce had to work instead, and it was way too sweet for me. The fries were actually pretty good. The other problem is the acoustics. You end up having to scream to be heard, and not because the place is so crowded or noisy. They just didn't bother to fix the space - this seems to be a common theme at new restaurants lately - maybe they think it adds to the appeal to have to shout all night long, but it just becomes ridiculous at some point. Personally, I wouldn't go back.
