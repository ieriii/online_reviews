I have to be the contrarian on this one. Unlike the 500+ people who had yelped about HopLeaf already, I had never even been there. The 2 stars is for the mussels that just wasn't that good. I had the Belgian beer version. Maybe next time I will try the curry version. My friend had the tuna nicoise sandwich special and it was good . The frites and aoili that came with the mussels were good. So HopLeaf, I wil be back!
