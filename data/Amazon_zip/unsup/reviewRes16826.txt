I am told the decor is quintessential Jerry Kleiner. Since I am acquainted with neither Kleiner nor his decorating predilections, I cannot comment on that. Though the decor was very lively- if not a wee bit over done- so that must be Kleiner's signature. 'Nough said. On to the vittles! On that note Carnivale does a sound job. We dined here last week with a group on a work related function. So it was a round of cocktails, apps, main courses and desserts. We sampled the menu from beginning to end. I was actually impressed. We started with a sampling of ceviches- which were fresh and well seasoned in relation to their inherent flavor. Score on that point. For the main course I had starters- jumbo shrimp and a beet salad. The shrimp were jumbo in every sense of the word, and the beets (red and yellow) were presented with a nice selection of goat cheese. I also sampled some of the skirt steak a colleague ordered and that was fantastic too. Usually I am not a steak person, but this was excellent. Desert was a sampling of cheeses. All told I was impressed and would return with a professional or personal crowd.
