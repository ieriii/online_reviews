I came with high expectations, and I might have liked it better if I had come for brunch. As it was, however, I wasn't enthralled by my dinner here... Food: The antipasti plate of assorted meats, cheeses, flatbreads, and vegetables was a decent size, was well presented, and was quite good. My entree of scallops and roast brisket, however, was unimpressive. The scallops were quite oily (buttery?) and salty, and about half of my portion of brisket was fat and gristle. At least I did like the pea puree on which the brisket was served. Service: Lacking. Our waiter was friendly enough, but seemed to be in a daze and unable to answer some pretty basic questions about the menu. Ambiance: As others have noted, this place is upscale casual. It was busy the night we were there, but it wasn't noisy at all. Price: A little high (entrees between $20 and $30), befitting the ambiance and the supposed quality of the ingredients used.
