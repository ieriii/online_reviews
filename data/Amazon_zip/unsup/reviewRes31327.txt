Other reviewers have pretty much covered it, but I'd just add the following: The bone-in ribeye was amazing. If your waiter tries to up sell you to the 33oz cut, pass on it. It's good but very expensive and way too much food. The lobster mashed potatoes were good but not worth the price. Save your money and stick to other side dishes. Overall, I'd love to come back. We had a great meal here.
