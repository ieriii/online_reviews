My experiences at Pequod's have continued to be great. I've brought a few friends here who otherwise are not deep dish fans and made them believers. Pequod's is in a league of their own when it comes to deep dish. The carmelized crust sets them apart...more of a "crunchy" than a "so much cheese I'm going to die" experience when you dine here. I love bringing friends to Pequod's and blowing their minds. I have tried the thin crust and don't think it's anything super special, but I am willing to endure a 45 minute train ride + 15-20 minute walk completely out of my way for this deep dish and I think that says a lot. On the odd occasion when I do drive, parking can be a hassle. But it's worth it for this place.
