I have stayed here for a weekend here and there with my boyfriend at the time....the second time we stayed here we came back from dinner and drinks to find our door barely open....we checked out the room and everything was fine, nothing missing, but I promptly called security in a rage. Turns out the lock deal wasn't locking properly and after having maintenance come up, past midnight and totally tipsy I might add, he said he couldn't do anything right then that the mechanism would have to be replaced. They upgraded us to a fairly decent suite after I ranted and raved....I felt this still wasn't sufficient seeing that I could have had some very expensive Louis Vuitton and other designed merch snatched out of my room due to their "malfunction" and we wouldn't have any time to really enjoy a suite because we were leaving early the next morning....I complained to a manager at check-out and he was kinda flaky and said well I guess next time you come we can upgrade your room then and I asked well how can I prove you promised me that and he said "I will put a note in your account"...right, I am sure you will buddy. Needless to say, we never returned. The hotel bar however carries Tyku which is a delicious Japanese liquor that pairs great with sprite. The hotel otherwise is decent, but desirable because of its location right off Michigan Ave.
