Both from experience (simply wonderful food) and reputation, hosted a small birthday party there. Food was uniformly excellent - guests ordered from the menu, and every item was a delight. Not so delightful - being crammed into a corner in a room complete with low ceiling, a large, noisy group, and an inept waiter with attitude. Could not converse with our guests, ears still ringing form the noise two hours later, etc. Although reservation noted that event was a significant birthday, no notice taken by restaurant - not even a candle in dessert. Wine list is excellent. Waiter was useless - no help with ordering and inattentive in serving it.  The review is a mix of five for the food and a one for this experience.
