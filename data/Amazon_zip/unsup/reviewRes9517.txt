We went here last night for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We had been to the Le Colonial in San Francisco and loved it, so decided to give the Chicago one a try while we were there. For some reason, I remember the SF LC being a bit more WOW in terms of flavors, but we and our guests loved it all the same!! What we ordered (4 people): Appetizers: Shrimp Beignets -- delicious, but I expected a true, funnel-cake like beignet. It was more of a shrimp wrapped in wonton to me?? But the shrimp was so plump and delicious, and the dipping sauce was SO YUM! Mussels in Saffron Butter sauce -- omg, probably the best mussels I've ever had. We tried to get more bread out of the waiters to dip into the delicious buttery sauce...but they were a little sparse haha.  Entrees: Ginger Duck with Tamarind -- yum! but no sides, so be sure to get some (definitely recommend the grilled Japanese eggplant) Filet Mignon with shrimp rice -- THE BEST ENTREE AT THE TABLE. Ssoo tender and flavorful. Shrimp with Asparagus -- ssoo flavorful yet light! My friend cleaned her plate it was a perfect entree! Desserts: TOTALLY RECOMMEND BOTH: Banana tapioca and banana wonton. The service, ambiance, and food were just lovely! A perfect place for birthday dinner or a romantic night!
