Review is for the Happy Hour (4-6pm everyday, in the Oyster Bar). 1/2 price oysters!!! Need I say more??? I got the Chef's Choice Oyster Sampler, which came with 6 different oysters (2 each, for $12 at Happy Hour) and went to seafood heaven. What a fun way to sample their variety of oysters at a very, very reasonable price. Also enjoyed an amazing bowl of lobster bisque, possibly the best I've ever had (tip: get the bowl instead of the cup, for $2 extra it's almost 3x the portion size). The calamari was DELICIOUS as well. I also must rave about the Watermelon Margarita, which was tasty and secretly strong. Loved the old school vibe of the Oyster Bar too. A somewhat older clientle but we didn't feel out of place at all (the two of us are both in our 20's). Service was good but felt a little pressured to order more at times. Would definitely go back!
