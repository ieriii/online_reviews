If you've never tried Indian food, then this is the place to go. If you have tried it, then this is the place to go to experience it in an excellent environment and with perfect ingredients. And if you grew up on it...well, I have nothing to suggest, as you're probably better able to judge than I...but I sure as heck love this place! Too good.
