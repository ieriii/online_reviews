I came her with my visiting parents after being referred by a friend. And I can't wait to go back.  Briefly... -The appetizers were good, but not what left me with fond memories. -Everyone except my mother LOVED their entree. My father ordered the whole snapper and it was finished before any of us got a taste.  My mom's dish seemed over-cooked in general. She was happy at the end of the night since we all shared our dishes, which she agreed were outstanding. -Even the side dishes we ordered were delicious. I had no idea eggplant could taste so good! -The service left a little to be desired. Our server was never around when we needed him and it took some effort to get his attention.  I can't wait to go back and order the Bouillabaisse. It was delicious and true confort food. I wanted to crawl in the pot they served it in. Yummmm.
