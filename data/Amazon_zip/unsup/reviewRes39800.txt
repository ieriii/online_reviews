I'll admit the food is pretty good, but the service is absolutely unacceptable. Last time I went with a party of 15, we ordered food and some beer at first, and they said we had to order more otherwise they wouldn't serve us. I understand that we're a large party and they don't want to serve a table that is just sitting there. I told her that's fine. Give us a couple minutes and we will order more. Then she said no get out and kicked all of us out. What the hell kind of service is that? I can't order more in a few minutes? America pays for service. . . .
