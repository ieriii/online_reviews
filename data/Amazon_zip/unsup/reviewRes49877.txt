Saw the 2012 NBA finals game 3 here. Solid choice to put a TV outside. It was just loud enough to hear the game but not distracting to talk to friends, if you want. The summer breeze adds toward the experience. The drinks were kind and the staff was friendly. Another good place to watch a sporting event. Can't tell you about the food though. Will be back...for Game 4.
