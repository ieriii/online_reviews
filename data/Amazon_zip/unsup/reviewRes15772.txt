So tasty. This is my favorite Italian place, and we always bring out-of-towners there. It's great for dinner with friends but nice enough that we went there for Valentine's Day. No matter what you order, it's going to be amazing, but if you want something truly world-changing, get the Gorgonzola stuffed (or asiago stuffed) gnocchi. It's in this creamy tomato sauce with a dollop of goat cheese in the center. It's so rich that it's hard to finish, but it reheats well. Mmmm...
