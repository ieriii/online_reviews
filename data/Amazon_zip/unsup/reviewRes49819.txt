We came here the last night of our trip on a recommendation from the Concierge at our hotel. It was walking distance, so that was a big bonus. I was on the verge of a cold at this point, so I wasn't able to fully enjoy the experience, but I still enjoyed this place. We ordered the "5 cheeses you can't live without," but personally I didn't think they were that fantastic. Perhaps it's because I know as much about cheese as I do about wine which is not much so maybe I didn't fully appreciate the cheese as I should have. The two appetizers we ordered however were absolutely fantastic. I should have written this earlier so I would have remembered exactly what we ordered, but this seems like the type of place that changes it's menu seasonally so maybe it wouldn't have mattered anyway. I liked the dishes we ordered because it was a unique mix of flavors. The plates were small and with the cheese plate it was the perfect amount of food for two of us. We had already eaten a little appetizer before we went, so otherwise we probably would have had to order at least another dish.
