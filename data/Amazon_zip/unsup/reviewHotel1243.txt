stayed for a conference. hotel was decent, got a nice room on the top floor with an amazing view of the city and lake. that was a nice perk. however, this place is just way too big. it takes forever to get anywhere.  they have a concierge service counter, but twice there was no person there! that was a little annoying.  this is a good place to stay if you are trying to avoid traffic such as the chicago marathon. close to downtown, but still has open access and open roads.
