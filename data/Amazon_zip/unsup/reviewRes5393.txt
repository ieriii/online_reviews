This place was absolutely delicious and I actually visited it 3 times in the span of 3 months, that's how much I loved it! The service has been great every time I've come and the food has been absolutely delicious! My favorites include: the pork braised milk shoulder, the eggplant caponata with goat cheese, the asparagus and hazelnut salad, and an amazing lamb dish! Oh and try to save room for dessert!! I've tried the sicilian iris (kinf of like french toast filled with ricotta and chocolate chips) and the Festa di Santa Lucia Crema (Farro & Ricotta with Chocolate Sauce). Both desserts were really good, though I prefer the farro & ricotta because it was just so unique and like nothing I've encountered anywhere else and it was almost... light? The thing to remember about this place is it's tapas, so order a couple of things and then order more as you go along! Most of the meat items are really rich and heavy (and delicious) but jsut keep that in mind so you don't over do it too much! Also, it's a very good location and thus gets full really fast! Either get there around 5/6pm for dinner so you don't have to wait or come for a late dinner at 9pm.
