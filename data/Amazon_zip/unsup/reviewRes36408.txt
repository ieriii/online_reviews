At first I was skeptical of this place because it has japanese and thai, which is kind of like places that serve tacos with spaghetti. My friend wouldn't stop raving so I gave it a try, and I'm glad I did. Their crab rangoon is some of the best I've had. They are smaller little bite sized ones. I always get their veggie tempura maki rolls- they come in either asparagus tempura or sweet potato tempura.  Yummy and delicious! Other cool thing is that they deliver pretty quickly. Last time I got my order within a half hour.  I agree that it is a little expensive but it is worth it.
