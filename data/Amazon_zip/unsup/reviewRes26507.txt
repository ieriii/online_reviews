The first time I experienced Vietnamese food was in small family restaurant outside of Seattle where I tried Pho (Beef Noodle Soup) and it was amazing. However, I'm not sure that "Simply It" lived up to that first experience. The staff was great and friendly but I thought the food was bland and so did the rest of my party who all had distinct dishes. In case you are wondering, I ordered the "Coconut Beef" and rice but it just wasn't that great. The rest of my party ordered the "Lemongrass Beef" and the "Seafood Noodles" and all had similar experiences.
