Granted it's not in the most happening neighborhood, but I was surprised to find it so dead on a Friday night. I absolutely love the decor--such a cute, rustic, eclectic and homey feel--and we were greeted instantly by almost every server we walked past. Ironically, service was a bit spotty and we had to ask for our check a couple times, but all in all it was positive. I wish I could give them more than 3 stars, but I wasn't so enamored with my Ahi Tuna BLT. The bacon was really tough and dry, so much so that I couldn't even eat it as part of the sandwich and had to tear it apart separately. The open-faced bread & egg were also a bit weird. It certainly wasn't the most ladylike thing to eat :), and I couldn't properly enjoy all the components together because it was so bulky and messy. I give them props for trying such an unusual recipe, but probably wouldn't order it again. My friend & I were happy with the Huckleberry-Orange-Chocolate Parfait, which was great for splitting and quite delicate in flavor. If I find myself in the area again, I'll definitely give some of their other entrees a try.
