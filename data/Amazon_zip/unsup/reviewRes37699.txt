Okay -I should preface this review with "I am vegetarian and a non-beer lover." However, I did enjoy Hopleaf - to an extent. The bar can and will be very crowded on weekends but fortunately my friends and I were able to locate a table to seat 12! Unfortunately, the waitress was *very* inattentive. Most of our meals came out in sporadic epiphanies and some friends were finished with their dishes before others, while still more had yet to order. When I was so privileged to actually converse with the waitress, I choose the squash-cauliflower tart. Yes, I know it sounds pretty gross - and it was. It was like apple pie sans apple filing and stuffed with mashed potatoes. My friends did enjoy their mussels & duck reubens, which were devoured as others (friends who had not ordered) looked on with vacant hungry stares. The friends also loved the beer selection. Personally, I just enjoyed my friends and my glass(es) of red wine but I think next time I will eat before I drink here.
