My wife and I stayed here on St. Pats weekend 2009. The lobby area is nice but I started to get a feeling of doom as we went through the hallway and stepped in the tiny elevator. I said to my wife, this hotel is small but quaint. Our room was exactly that, small but quaint. I wasn't expecting huge or modern. I was expecting current tech with nostalgia. Our room was fitted with a CRT tv (old style SD tv) and a small fridge (unstocked). We had a radiator for heat, purple tile in the bathroom and an old tub with a shower curtain.  The location is excellent for exploring the Wrigleyville area. Bus 22 will take you up and down Clark for $2 a trip. (don't be scared of the bus). The Inn offered a nice breakfast included with the fare. I thought the bed was comfortable and the room temp was fine. I opened the window before going to sleep, but had to close it by 1AM due to the street noise. The price is a little high for the location, but in a pinch you will not be disappointed. I will not be back unless the area is booked.
