Ah Hot Doug's. What can I say that hasn't already been said? For one thing, I'll give you a secret worth it's weight in gold...call in your order! Yes, I know it seems revolutionary but if you pick up the phone and talk to Doug directly you will be able to bypass the line and pick up your order in 10-15 minutes tops. Even on the busiest days. Want another tip? My favorite dog is the Bratwurst with sauerkraut and brown mustard. The fries are also good and come in generous portions. Yay for Hot Doug's!
