Since moving to Chicago, I've been kind of a pizza slut. I've hooked up with Giordano, Gino, Lou Malnati, Eduardo, Pizano, Sarpino, and regrettably Papa John. I wanted it all kinds of ways - deep dish, thin crust, it didn't matter. But then I met Pequod's. The kind of pizza place that makes an honest woman out of you. The love affair began with caramelized cheese crust and the passion is kept alive by, well, caramelized cheese crust. Because of the bond I feel with Pequod's, I felt confident enough that the pizza would wow my out of town friends and give my Chicago-based friends an alternative to deep dish. Pequod's did not disappoint. I was able to make a reservation for 15 people on a Saturday night 4 days prior to the date (just an FYI, they will charge your credit card $25 if you don't show up for your reservation), which impressed and relieved me. It was extremely hot in the restaurant - I'm guessing that 90 degree temps outside and constantly running pizza ovens aren't helping the case, but I would've appreciated a little extra AC so my white shorts didn't become translucent with sweat. Would I let a little perspiration taint this review? Not hardly. Thankfully our waitress kept the pitchers of beer coming and saved us all from dehydration. The pizza was delicious, as I knew that it would be. Everyone at our table earned clean plate awards, even if some (myself included) needed some extra prodding to eat another piece. I enjoy the fact that the pizza isn't as heavy and cheesy as other deep dishes tend to be. That doesn't mean that we didn't need to be rolled out of there, because we did, it just means that I didn't have a cement brick of cheese in my stomach post-meal. In addition to being tasty, Pequod's is cheap! Relatively speaking anyway. If you're not drooling after reading all of the Yelp reviews about the deliciousness, then maybe pizza just doesn't do it for you. And if that's the case, then I feel sorry for you because you're truly missing out.
