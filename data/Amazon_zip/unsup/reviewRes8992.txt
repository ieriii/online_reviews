Very good Persian food. I especially like the bread and the goodies that come with it - parsley, radishes, other greens, and cheese. The kash-ke-bademjan appetizer was memorable - roasted eggplant pureed with onion, garlic, mint, and kask (aged dried yogurt) topped with caramelized onions. The bomieh dessert and tea are great!
