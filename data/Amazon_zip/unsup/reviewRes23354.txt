Are you looking for a laid back and relaxed atmoshpere? What really stands out to me is that you are never rushed. Quite honestly it feels like your in a European cafe. The crepes and Turkish coffee are out of this world. Be careful on the coffee it really packs a punch. Whether you are in the mood for something savory or sweet this is definitely one place to add to your list.
