Must agree with my friend Laura A. on this one. Sabatino's is as good as it gets, for value oriented, Italian-American fare on the north side. $80 (w/ tax & tip) got us a bottle of wine, and each a cup of soup, salad, pasta, half-chicken entree, and a coffee... and a mini-pizza to start! The atmosphere is very cozy, with lots of small rooms and little nooks. They had a classical guitarist and violinist walking around serenading tables. We would have preferred to sit at the bar, but every seat was taken on a Wednesday at 6pm!! I'll be back.
