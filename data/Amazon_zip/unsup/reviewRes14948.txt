This place truly deserves 1 star for food and maybe 2 for decor, since it's kind of a blast from the past. The menu boasts seasonal, but I clearly had canned vegetables in my fettuccini primavera. At least this was edible. My husband got a grilled chicken dish which he basically moved to the side. Our server noticed that my husband repeatedly rejected each of the offerings placed in front of him, and proceeded to berate him! I found that kind of funny at first, but it got old quickly. I wonder if the people who eat here just go for the nostalgia? I appreciated the large, fresh bread brought to the table, and the pizza bread was tasty in an after school treat kind of way. Avoid the shrimp soup--super salty and fishy without much flavor profile. They do have live music if you show up later than we did (around 9). Maybe that would be a fun show, but the food is just not up to snuff.
