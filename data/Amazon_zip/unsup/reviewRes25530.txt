What could be better for our 3-year anniversary dinner than to drown in fondue? Ahhh, such a blissful death. My man's fondue virginity was quickly snatched as soon as the 1st course of cheese, apples, bread and grapes came along. Cheese, being my most favorite food on earth, was re-filled for my dining pleasure. The dinner could easily have ended there, however we had the surf & turf arriving. Then dessert and complimentary champagne. Before dessert, I went to the bathroom and did 20 jumping jacks to digest food/make more room.  Yes, the restaurant is dimly lit, the service is impeccable and the aromas will permeate your clothes and skin. However, there was no live music the night of our feast, which was too bad as we would've been seated right next to the flamenco guitar. All in all, a delightful and filling evening.
