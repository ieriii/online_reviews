Sorry, the wait just isn't worth it. It's great, just not worth a 2.5 hour wait. I followed the advice of a kind yelper, and went with a friend and we each bought 2 different dogs then cut them in half to try 4 different dogs.  BLT hot dog -- the best thing I had, and rather underrated compared to it's fancier cousin (see below).  Foie Gras hot dog -- fantastic Andouille hot dog -- ok, nothing to write home about Blueberry infused Venison w/ marscapone (sp?) cheese -- skip this. It's not "infused" with blueberry, if it's covered in blueberry sauce. I appreciate the adventurous idea -- it just doesn't work. Duck fat fries -- good, but honestly, not THAT special. They are only available on fri/sat -- check the web site. So if that's key, make sure you go then. If not -- the line may be a little more tolerable during the week, I'm not sure. Someone on here said s/he felt like it was a little overrated, so that people could justify waiting in line for so long, and I have to agree. I would say go early early early, go once, and get the BLT dog. Very very friendly guy and staff, but I just can't say I'd wait that long again. Note: It closes pretty early, and we thought we wouldn't make it, after waiting for 2 hours. As long as you are in line when the place closes, you'll get in -- they send an employee outside to stand in line and be the "cutoff person".
