After living a few blocks from Le Colonial for 3 years, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. We were not dissapointed. The ambiance is definitely the best part, very romantic and pretty inside. I'd love to go back for drinks upstairs, definitely a younger crowd up there and a very cool atmosphere. Our food was solid- the duck and a shrimp dish (that was REALLY spicy and I don't think it mentioned spice on the menu). The tuna tartare appetizer was also really good. We also got dessert- a macaroon thing with icecream. The macaroon was formed into a cookie shape and was rock hard on the outside. I thought I was going to break the plate by trying to get a bite with my spoon, however I still managed since I love dessert. The only downside was that the waitstaff was overattentive. There is nothing worse than a guy that comes to your table to fill your water glass after each sip. That was a little annoying, but our server was great.
