I dont give 5 stars as a rule, but this place is really there. I have been lucky enough to go twice so far and can say it is a really nice steakhouse. Steaks are every bit as good as any I have had in Chicago, if not better. Seafood towers are awesome, the bisque is mandatory for bisque lovers, and the sides are as good as elswhere, Wine list is terrific, service was excellent. Neither night did anyone have room for the butter cake, maybe next time! Glad it was on the company card tho :)~
