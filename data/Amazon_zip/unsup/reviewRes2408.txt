I'm so glad I live walking distance. It's pretty awesome that you can go during the week and get practically right in. That's the key, otherwise you are waiting for an hour or more. But Doug Sohn is one of my heroes. The habanero jack cheese that he uses on numerous different compilations is outstanding. Not sure what else to say, just make sure you have cash and if you're not adventurous you can just order the Chicago dog with all the fixin's as it is one of the two best in the city (with Superdawg probably winning that title with the pickled green tomato). Outstanding.
