hooooomyhotdoggoodnesssssss!! when caty k. & reese t. were in town, they insisted we visit hot doug's- and i thank them for it. im going to skip to the good stuff- the dogs. i had the salma hayek, which is a little bit spicy and crazy delicious. friends brought back a variety of dogs and we passed them around to taste them all! my favorite was the salma, but the mountain man was a close second. chomp chomp. i am an absolute sucker for anything w/goat cheese, so the mountain man made me very happy! like caty k. said, there was a heck of a wait on a tuesday at 11am- so i cant even begin to imagine what it's like there on the weekends. if you can, go on an off time...but at some point, if you're in chicago...you should go! its the most inventive, delicious hot dog place out there!
