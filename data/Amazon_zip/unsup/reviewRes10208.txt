Great food, atmosphere, staff and wine list. This place has only been open a week and it's already amazing...can't imagine what they'll improve over time.  The hostess was extremely nice- I was there w/my dad, (who doesn't like to wait much past the reservation time and has high expectations when dining in Chicago)...and although the place was packed- we were seated on the gorgeous patio w/in 5 min. of our reservation.  The service was a little slow, but they made up for it w/attentiveness (dad dropped his napkin and had a new one w/in seconds).  Everything from the wine (nice, affordable chianti) to desert (creamy, boozy, berry goodness) was impeccable. Highly recomend the caprese salad, tri colore salad, spaghetti, and veal bolognese...and obviously the aforementioned creamy, boozy desert:)
