This is probably more of a 2.5 star kind of review - and this time, it is the husband thinking it was worth 2 and not me. I knew what we were in for in terms of the "no menu, 4 course Sunday deal for $45". And really, for the money, it is not a rip-off. The service is great - totally friendly and non-pretentious. But, the food is just not that spectacular. Course one - Salad - cuttle fish, octopus and lobster with heirloom tomatoes in a yuzu citrus type of vinagrette.  Course two - Soup - chilled cream of zucchini with aoili and a homemade rabbit sausage nugget on the side with some fennel and some crispy leeks. Course Three -Main - pork chop in a cherry port type sauce with some root veggie nuggets and a sliver of beef tongue and two sweetbreads Course Four - Dessert - bubblegum plum rice pudding (pink and tastes like gum) and a bubblegum plum cobbler. The salad was the best course for me. The soup was just flavorless and off-putting (sausage nugget was good). The pork chop was just a dried pork chop and I am not a fan of organ meats or texture-laden tongue trying to "fancy" something up. The dessert was okay - but REALLY sour - like try adding a little sugar once in a while - this was like lemons!!  Plus - no bread on the table and NO beverages other than water AT ALL!!! I understand this is a BYOB, but soda, lemonade, ice tea, come on. You're missing out on more income there! Fancy it up and serve some nectar with spritzer and charge the $5 you charge for a cup of coffee! And - the set-up coming in is weird - you stand in the center of the seating area (The place only holds about 20 people total) and are just "on display" until an employee can seat you. I didn't feel ripped off in terms of money, but I was definitely let-down in terms of food. When your own waitstaff admits to the patrons that they don't eat things in 3 of the 4 courses, maybe you should take note??
