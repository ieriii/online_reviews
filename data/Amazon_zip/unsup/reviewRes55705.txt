The food was decent but nothing to rave about... especially for the price. I went with a group of 6 people and here is the census: I had the lobster fettuccine (noodles were undercooked) and it was pretty good but slightly bland, however there was an ample amount of Lobster which was nice. Two other people had BLT sandwich's which they said were very good. The rest of the group had the all u can eat bbq ribs... complaints were as follows, the ribs were very dry, one rack came out cold and the sauce was good but not anything to get all excited about. We also had soup and appetizers, which when we ordered the soup everyone had asked for a cup and they brought bowls which was a $2.00 difference for 6 people which added another $12.00 to the bill. We weren't thrilled, especially since they automatically added 18% gratuity. Overall I would recommend other places to eat... Taste of Peru on Clark was excellent and very reasonably priced. Also Tony's Burrito Mex on Damen and Belmont is quite good for Mexican.I almost forgot.. the seating arrangement is terrible here! It's one of those places where the tables are 4 inches from the other people eating and you feel like you are eating with strangers. Very awkward at times, especially if you sit next to a loud person/group and they have no manners (which was our case). Also one person in our group continually got bumped by other people and wait staff because she was in the pathway to the bathroom.
