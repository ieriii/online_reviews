This was possibly the best delivery experience I have had in Chicago. Not only was the person who answered the phone helpful with my order, but extremely patient with me when my phone reception went sour. And to top it off, the food was delivered in the time frame that they gave me, and delicious. Sweet potato maki to die for.
