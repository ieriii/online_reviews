Not only is the pizza fantastic, every time I order delivery, I am so pleased! The person who answers the phone is always ON IT, polite, friendly and professional. The delivery people are the same, polite, friendly, bringing delectable pizza that is to order and the right temperature...Piece has made its mark in Chicago since it arrived, and I'm glad it's here!
