Saturday, August 30, 2008Review of terribly rude service from Calo Ristorante located in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. My partner and I have patronized Calo Ristorante on many occasions. Calo Ristorante in my opinion has flavorful Italian cuisine at a reasonable price with mediocre service. However, on this particular occasion the managers' service skills were not present. My partner and I were viewing the menu posted out side of the restaurant before entering. The manager was walking into the restaurant and proceeded to hold the door open for a female patron and let the door swing shut behind him knowingly aware that my partner and I were directly behind him. We proceeded to open the door and walk in to the restaurant to be seated. The manager pretended not to notice that he had just shut the door in our faces as we were entering behind him. We ignored the incident and asked for a table for two. The manager proceeded to escort us to the loud noisy bar side were live music was playing. When I asked for a table on the other side of the restaurant he replied with all sorts of excuse's when there were clearly plenty of tables available for us to sit at. We declined the table and decided to eat else where. I am astonished at how simple it is to treat customers with dignity and respect and how difficult it is for some employees to perform this task. We have patronized Calo Ristorante many times, however, we will never consider entertaining the idea of having dinner at Calo Ristorante ever again. There are too many restaurants in the Chicago area to choose from with much better service and food for us to spend our money at.I thought you should know,Edgewater resident
