There are so many things to cherish about the Tru experience that it's hard to know where to start. But for those who often feel like good service is dead in the states, here is someplace that can show you the stark difference between eating and dining.  You are warmly received by name as if they've been expecting you because you always show up at that time and date. Graciously you're shown to your table and seated like a perfect lady (or gentleman). Almost instantly two servers arrive on opposite sides of the table, in perfect sync and begin pouring bottled water into your glasses (reaching the top at the same moment) then stepping back - as if in a dance, only to melt back into the background.  The food is amazing. You can feel the various layers of flavor unfold as the food dissolves in your mouth. The seasonal offerings are unique and inspired. Despite all the courses of food, I didn't feel overly full or uncomfortable. It's a luxury to dine this way, so don't come in a hurry expecting to get in and out quickly. But why would you want to leave?  The desert carts are just over the top, and the presentation of every little thing is so artfully done, that you haven't just enjoyed a good meal, you've enjoyed a good evening.
