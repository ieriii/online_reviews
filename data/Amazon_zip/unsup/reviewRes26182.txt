Simply It was just simply great! My girlfriend have been here a few of time and couldn't stop raving about it, so a couple of weeks ago we meet up there for lunch. First thought - nice little place, nothing too fancy, very comfy and cozy. The owner/chef, Uncle Tuan as he told me to call him, went table to table to check on his customers. He was very friendly and nice. Not enough restaurant does that nowadays, you'd be lucky to get your server's attention long enough to order an ice tea. He actually sat down and chatted with us for a bit. We started with the Shrimp Papaya Salad (#45) and it was amazing. I love the chili lime garlic dressing that they used, it was very refreshing. Then we had the Pineapple Calamari (#62) - O.M.G. BEST CALAMARI I HAVE EVER HAD! The seasoning was prefect, and it wasn't too crunchy like fries or soft like rubber, it was just the right ratio of chewy to tender. Then came the Simple It's Beef (#71) It's basically a filet mignon on top of a bed of salad, sounds simple but it tasted so good. If I knew they put steak on salad, then I would've had more salads in my day! I had Vietnamese food before but not like this. Simply It does it right, I'll definitely be heading back there soon.
