The Chicken soup is honestly some of the best chicken soup I have ever tried. A large chicken soup and a big container of rice will run you about 9 dollars. The chicken soup had these massive chunks of chicken in it. It was wonderful!  The people who work here are great and really nice to me. They rock. I guarantee this- You will love the chicken soup!!!! (steak fries are good too.)
