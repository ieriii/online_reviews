absolutely fantastic. saw tony priolo do a demonstration with dirk flanigan at Chicago Gourmet and we just had to go to his restaurant. of course my mother was with me and flagged him down and i was mortified as she snapped away. but whatever. the food was really good and the space was awesome. wish i had found out about it before it gets too cold! because of my mother's oppressiveness, he sent out a taste of their parm & arugula flatbread/pizette. amazing. i had the antipasti sampler, my dad had the calamari (some of the best i've had in a while), and my mom had the griglia mista. all of it was amazing. it wasnt completely outrageous money-wise either. i will definitely going back. and i am going to buy the 'piccolo sogno' olive oil and balsamic for my mom for xmas!!
