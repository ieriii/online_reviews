Oh my god! I love this pizza. I had driven by Spacca Napoli 6 days a week for 8 months before finally trying it. I have young kids and my husband makes really yummy homemade pizza. We never go out for pizza. We finally made it when we needed an early Saturday lunch in Ravenswood with 4 adults and 2 kids. We got there as it opened. No waiting, and I think that is the secret. If you can ever make it for lunch..... I have been on weekday and weekend for lunches and found few other people in the place. I am awed by hot quickly the pizzas are made and cooked. *Fast is good for a 2 year old and a 4 year old*The staff and restaurant set up are very friendly to kids. They can watch the pizza in all stages of the making, and at least during the lunch hour it was easy to do. The crust is a light, thin crust, followed by a whole range of very fresh toppings. My favorite: a white pizza with buffalo mozzarella; arugula, salt and olive oil are added once it is done. One warning for those who don't love fresh mozzarella; we ordered a bunch of different pizzas and all had some version of fresh mozz. Great for me, but not everyone likes its texture or the way it melts.
