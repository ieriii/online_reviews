Meh/garbage When we were first reading our menus I overheard someone complaining about their meal at a table near us. At the time, I was embarrassed for them. Turns out, we should have listened and left. We were really looking forward to eating at the Gage... Up until this point, our meals had been fabulous (publican, purple pig, bandera, Lou malnottis, etc). Sadly, this choice turned out to be a colossal disappointment. When we left, it felt as though we'd lost $150.00 in Vegas. We had the escargot, the asparagus and morels, the fluke (appropriately named), and the tofu. All were underwhelming, to put it nicely. The food lacked flavor and was bland and boring. We both found ourselves to try to compensate by adding salt and pepper. No luck though. At the end of the meal we were laughing at how remarkably bad it all was. The wine was delicious. The server was fine except she was the person who recommended the fluke dish. Perhaps their meat dishes are better? With all the great restaurants in Chicago, it sucked that we managed to pick a bad one.
