On the plane coming from Orange County, CA to Chicago a man recommended this place to me. My friend I was staying with happened to live a block away so we checked it out. I'm so glad we did. Pequods pizza out of all the pizza places I tried while I was in Chicago was the best hands down. What made it so fucking good was that there pepperoni had a nice quality feel to it and sauce was incredible. But the real kick in the teeth was the caramelization at the end of the piece of pizza. That was like the desert. I cant even begin to explain how good that was. It was so good that we went 2 days in a row to Pequods. I also learned that you can ask for extra caramelization so when I come back to Chi town you can find me in Pequads drinking a ice cold pale ale. CHEERS
