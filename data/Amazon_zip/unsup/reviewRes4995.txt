Being a family of Middle Easterners, I was a little timid anout heading into this establishment. We stopped at the door and looked at the menu with some reservation as none of us ate pork and worse I have shellfish allergies to make life furthermore complicated. The host and the wait staff were super nice and friendly although lunch time was long past, they welcomed us in and showed us the dishes that would agree with our dietary restrictions. Our waitress was wonderful. She guided us through the menu and made some great suggestions. The food comes in small portions and is great for sharing. Everything that was laid on our table was fresh, well prepared, delicious, sinful but oh mi god so good. We ended up eating more than we planned but this establishment went out of their way to make our afternoon late lunch a delight. Add to this impossibility of impressing my mom who is a total Coco Chanel Reincarnate, and having her smile and praise the food and you have yourself a culinary success moment! I can see this space getting crowded fast. It is a small restaurant. The prices awe not cheap but the food is well worth it. The restaurant is strategically located on Michigan Avenue. I highly recommend for lunching / dining with friends and colleagues whenever there is some ice to be broken -- this is the place. The music and the ambiance is a bit bar- ish. So romantic date destination this place is not as you will most likely fall for the wait staff or the food and leave your date feeling neglected.
