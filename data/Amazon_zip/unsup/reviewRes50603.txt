I had never heard of Big Jones until I went to the Green City Chef's BBQ. The bbq was pork galore, but their pork belly dish stole the spotlight. With that in mind, we had planned on catching dinner there sometime. We were on our way to M. Henry for brunch when we saw Big Jones and decided to give it a go. When I think of the name "Big Jones" I imagine a bbq shack. However, the restaurant was actually quite nice. It's the perfect spot to take your parents, in-laws, date or girlfriends. They started us off with warm complimentary beignets. Yummm!! The orange juice was also exactly the way I like it: fresh, pulp-free, and not too sour. Eggs New Orleans and the 2 egg breakfast w/crawfish fritters were both really tasty. The crawfish fritters reminded me of fried risotto balls. Next time, I'd try the fried green tomatoes. Some of the egg dishes are pricier, but those dishes contain steak or crabcakes. The back to basic options runs average brunch prices and the portions are huge. It's not on the menu, but you can order a short stack of pancakes on the side. The pancakes were really fluffy. The thing I love about this place is how everything tastes homemade and fresh. When I asked for jam, they brought out fresh raspberry preserves. This place is comfort food at your finest.
