What a great find. My Chinese friend took us here and pre-ordered the duck several days before. It was sooo good. We had the duck served 3 different ways, including in fried rice. We ordered one more dish on top of that, and had plenty of food...including enough for leftovers!  They allow you to bring your own liquor, so our friends treated us to a nice Chinese liquor with the meal too. I can't remember the name, but you can't get it here in the U.S. It was similar to vodka though. So feel free to bring alcohol when you come!
