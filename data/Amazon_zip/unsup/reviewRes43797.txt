I am giving this place one star for someone like me. I like big breakfast where they have many choices ....Milk and honey does not have omlettes or Sausage. This is a major yuppy overpriced undersized hangout that I personally do not enjoy... Not a place for me, although I did go with a 2 girls and they did like it...
