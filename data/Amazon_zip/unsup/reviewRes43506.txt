yummy yummy i had the deep dish and it was great. warm when delieved (although it usuall takes 75-90 min). i do agree with lana though, the order guy is always pissed im calling the pizza place to put in an order. weird but i laught it off. the cheese is high quality and great toppings, veggies are fresh. a must
