Still the Sybaris of Restaurants... The first thing that hits you upon opening the door - the oily, fishy smell. The same odor you take home with you, and can only get out of your clothes after taking your clothes to the cleaners. Seriously. Almost had an oil accident, with the oil popping uncontrollably. Oil splashes on clothes, and on the mirror next to the table. Terribly unromantic. And the bloating caused from all the oiled food wasn't terribly romantic either.
