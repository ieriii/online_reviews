Don't really have anything bad to say about this place just wish they had staff that spoke a little better English. I understand this is in Chinatown but we started coming here because the Chicago Reader said it was #1 Chinese place in Chicago. They understand everything from the menu but when we ask for something extra or spice it sometimes comes out wrong, but this won't stop us from coming here, we love the food!
