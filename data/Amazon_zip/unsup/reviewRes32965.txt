I've been coming here for 11 years now and they've maintained consistency throughout the decade. The falafel is without question one of the best in the city. The spinach and meat pies are awesome and the fish and lamb are okay. But the falafel is something to "write home about". I'm a red meat person all day and their kefta is pretty good. Their falafel however is great and for under $5, you can't get that much fresh food anywhere. If you haven't been there yet stop being a dickhead and go eat there.
