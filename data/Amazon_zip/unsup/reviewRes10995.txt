Shhhh. My friends not on yelp don't know this, but I secretly sort of dread going to this place. I mean, it's in Wicker Park, so it must be 'hip'. And it's so popular that you're packed in like sardines -- always a good sign, right? I feel like this is Chicago's counter-culture reaction to the infamous deep dish. Sorry, but the thin crust here just isn't that good. I do recommend their appetizers though, and I hear they have decent beer. Service is lacking -- they never refill your water. Wassupwiththat?? We're not ALL pizza + beer folk.
