Well I had the pork belly soup the other day and I thought it was just okay. I felt it was lacking a little in flavor and it was slightly over priced as far as a bowl of soup goes. I have been there once before as well and I guess I feel the food is good but I don't think I would go out of my way again to stop in. I do enjoy the ordering system and the fact that customers can order soup now for lunch. The churros were nice and the salsas they make there are delightful.
