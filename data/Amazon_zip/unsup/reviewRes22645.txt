Really good, authentic Chinese food -- fun atmosphere, inexpensive. The maitre'd was demonstrating Kung Fu in the alley while we waited for a table -- he's a hoot! They ran out of clams so we couldn't get the dish we were looking for; the octopus dish we ordered was overcooked, so the octopi were pretty tough & chewy. Seafood hot & sour soup was great, combination fried noodles very good. A little tough getting the order & communicating because the waitstaff speaks very little English and, well, I don't speak any Chinese. For us it just added to the fun, but just be warned this ain't no trip to PF Chang.
