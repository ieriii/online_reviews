We went to Sunda just after it first opened with a group from work. Honestly I was not expecting much, but the waitress was good and just kept bringing yummy things out. The Peared Sake drink was one of the best drinks that I have had in a long time. The food was not outstanding, but the scene and the drinks were right on!
