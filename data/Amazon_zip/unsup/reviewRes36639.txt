The cafe has a beautifully modern decor with large tall windows and simple sheer curtains, high ceilings, hardwood floors, elegant chandeliers, and a variety of nice paintings and photos on the walls. It happen to be a nice sunny day when we were there. There is also a large bar area at the end of the cafe. We shared the pancakes with strawberries and bananas for $10.95. It came with 3 pancakes and the strawberries and bananas were fresh. It came with butter and maple syrup. The presentation was very nice and it was absolutely delicious.  If you're not a big eater like us, it was perfect for 2.  The coffee ($2.50) was okay, I've had better, but my partner liked it. I got a glass of skim milk ($2.95) that was excellent. It may have been organic milk, but I should have asked. They have quite an extensive smoothie and juice bar, but it would have been too filling to get breakfast and that too. I saw other customers who ordered the omelet and frittata and the portions were large! A great place for breakfast with nice decor. I will definitely go back again and try the other menu items.
