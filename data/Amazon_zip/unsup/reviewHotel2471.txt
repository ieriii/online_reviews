Yes it's got a lot of history, but I guess with that history and time comes a lot of stink. Seriously, our room stunk, we were next to a kitchen (I think) but it smelled like a kitchen at an old folks home. PLUS, we were put next to where I SWEAR the St. Louis Rams were staying because they were LOUD late at night, and early morning. Room was old, bathroom was old, I was just not impressed at all. I was hoping for more with the money I paid.  *****The worst part? The heater never worked in our room. That is not a good thing in Chicago in December. It is a good thing we spent very little time in our room, or I might have been more displeased.  Room service was overpriced for what you get too. ****The one cool thing about this place was getting to see the room that was used during The Fugitive with Harrison Ford. So history and all that - isn't always what the hype makes it out to be.  I will go back and give another chance, but next time I will make sure they put me in a newer, more recently done room.
