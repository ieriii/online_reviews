I really enjoyed this place, but wow did I feel intimidated by this pizza! Of course, in my visit to Chicago, I had to try Chicago style pizza, so two friends and I bravely visited Giordano's. We were then in food comas the rest of the day, but it was definitely worth it. Leftovers were even good the next day, back in Cleveland! My only complaint is a personal preference. Like pumping my own gas, I just would rather choose my own slice of pizza, so when the server dished out our pizzas, I wasn't necessarily upset with my large slice, but I would have preferred to choose a smaller one :)
