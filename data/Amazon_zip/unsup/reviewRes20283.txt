I really liked this local sushi bar! It had always been the default "go to" place for sushi. Because it is usually such a long wait to be seated, we would do carryout though. They were always very fast and accurate with the pick-up orders. And the food was very good as well! The last time I ordered from there, I got home and bit into an oshinko roll, only to hear and feel a very large crunch! It was either plastic or glass. Little pieces inside the roll. I called the manager to let them know...not so much to ask for my money back - but to alert them there were somewhat dangerous items in the food prep area....the person who answered the phone seemed very concerned, however, the manager did not care. She offered to refund my $4 vegetable roll, but said she didn't know what else to tell me after that. Maybe apologize? And then go check out the kitchen for sharp broken bits of inedible items!!
