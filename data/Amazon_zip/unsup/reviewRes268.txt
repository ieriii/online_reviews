Alinea is a one in a lifetime experience, worth exploring. If you have one meal on earth, let it be the tour. Alinea is a distinguished restaurant with minimalistic charm, the facade is understated, but as you walk through the front door, down a long corridor to doors that slide open, you are greeted by a smiling host/hostess. Without a reservation, don't expect to be seated. And make your reservation well in advance, they typically book up to two months ahead. Alinea offers two menus, the tasting (12 courses) and the tour (24 courses). Both menus can be paired with wine by their master sommelier, Scott. Each course is innovative, inventive, spectacular and unbelievably arranged and presented. The inventive techniques applied, from creating foam, pureeing vegetables, grilling meat on hot stones and freezing with liquid nitrogen.  From the gentle presentation, the unprententious atmosphere, to the exquisite timing, Alinea is the epitome of dining excellence. Never did I wonder about a nuance of my experience, anticipation of my desires were satiated.
