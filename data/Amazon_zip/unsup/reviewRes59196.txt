Insanely good. I had flashbacks sitting in little Guandong holes eating the best BBQ i've had outside of China. Seriously, their BBQ pork is no joke and doesn't pull punches.There is something to be said about a place that has a wait for a table for 2 close to 45 minutes, but instead you can choose to spend a cool sawbuck and walk out with Pork/Duck combo over rice in less than 5 min. This place is true to it's bones and easily the best in the area... I haven't had their Peking Duck (with all the accompaniments) but I have had some over rice and it's delicious.They take reservations so don't hesitate! However, how is this restaurant closed on a Thursday night??!!
