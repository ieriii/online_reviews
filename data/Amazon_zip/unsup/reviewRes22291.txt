I've been here twice - sat outside once in the summer and last week in the now enclosed heated patio. Both experiences were great! Food was delicious - I loved the vegetarian burrito! The fact that is BYOB works out perfectly with the Red and White Wine Shop right across the street! We ran out of wine during our meal and were able to run back across for one more bottle. The super friendly staff was ok with us lingering over our last bottle of wine long after we finished our meal. I will be back :)
