A terrific place to go on a date with someone who's not afraid to try different foods. This place gets crowded quickly on any given day, but it is definitely worth the wait! How can you go wrong with plantains in any form? You just can't! Each dish has it's own unique flavoring and is very filling for the price. Do bring cash though (it's a cash only joint) and make sure to save room for a tall glass of Horchata (delicious cinnamon-y drink!).
