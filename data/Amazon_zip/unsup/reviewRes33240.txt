So, I want to try this place again, but I thought I'd post something anyway. We went on a week day, so there was no wait, around 9:30 or so. The staff was very friendly and helped us out with a high chair and what nots. Craaaaaving Eggs Benedict, I decided to order the veggie benedict, knowing that I'm not entirely sure how I feel about poached eggs... It was OK. I ended up only eating one of the eggs, the other I slowly moved off of the muffin and ate the muffin. It didn't look properly cooked, and raw egg whites are scary! The potatoes on the side were great, and the fruit was just okay. Melon is such a cop out, and the grapes weren't very good, plus, they put it all on one plate, thus I had holandaise sauce on my fruit. Ick. I also ate a few pieces of their pancakes... YUM. They were delicious, so fluffy and warm. I'd like to have one of those things again. All in all, I'll try it again, sans poached eggs, and try an omelet. I'll report back!
