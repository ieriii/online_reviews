Yeah this place is great. The apps ended up being better than my entree but still easily a four. Best service I've had from waitress in chicago but bus boys were a little too quick to take our plates. We fended them off a couple times but got too into conversation and they snatched them before we knew it. Drinks good and creative without being odd just to be different. I'm sure I'll be back good spot. Brussel sprout salad and oxtail potstickers really good.
