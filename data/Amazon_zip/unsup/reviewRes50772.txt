So, I heard about Wishbone before I moved to Chicago so I was looking forward to checking it out. After going I really give this place 2 1/2 stars. Now I don't put much stock in places outside of the south that server southern food but again I heard that this place was really good.  Errrr...it was just okay. I could not wait to order the cheese grits and let's just say after I put much salt, I don't normally use a lot of salt, and pepper the grits were still just okay. The service was good and it was crowded so I will assume that others don't really share my views.
