I think Piccolo Sogno is fantastic! We had a wonderful meal and everything we got was so fresh. The service was amazing and I really enjoyed the ambiance. The restaurant seems very laid back and low key, but you won't know it from the food. We started with the caprese salad which was something I usually never order at a restaurant. I agreed to order it after my dinning partner and sever convinced me it was the best. I was more than amazed when I first tasted this salad. It was outstanding, the ingredients were so fresh and I don't think I have ever had mozzarella that simply melts in your mouth. Everything from the pasta to the meats were all great. I plan to go back here soon!
