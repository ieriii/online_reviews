I was here a few nights ago for a birthday dinner with some girlfriends. We split the roasted vegetables, cheese and prosciutto platter for an appetizer and I got the short ribs. Everything was AMAZING! The food is always great here but the ambiance on the outdoor patio makes this a gem in Chicago. My one friend said it was a perfect place for a romantic dinner or to bring out of towners. I agree!
