I saw a ghost today. I came here for lunch with a long-time fan of Big Jones and fellow southerner from across the panhandle. I was blown away.The ghost I saw was my Grandmother, because the lunch I had really took me back to the holidays and summers I spent at my Grandparent's in Savannah when I was a kid. I swear the cornbread was all hominy flour because it doesn't get that delicate and crumbly when there's wheat flour in it. I seriously haven't had cornbread like that in years, not at all sweet (that's what honey and jam are for) and totally soft and delicate like cake, more so than bread.I had the oyster stew special, and their take was more New Orleans (my friend thought it was spot-on) but what took me back was the supremely fresh taste of the oysters simmered in cream with salt pork. And rich. It really had Grandma's kind of love. It came with toast and grilled frisee, which isn't something she would have done, but she did have a thing for cooking what mom always called "weeds" like dandelions and wild chicory. It was the freshness that did it.I did sneak a sample of some cheese grits, and I will just say, you have to go to the deep south to get anything like that. Spot on!I guess it was all simple food, and I can't say much about the decor or the service, everything was fine, but I felt really warm from it.I looked at a Brunch menu and saw they do Fish & Grits, which is the next thing I want to try, and the Shrimp and grits.
