What a wonderful culinary experience. Last night, a group of us were able to make it for a late dinner. We started with their guacamole and salsa with homemade chips. The guac was tasty, but the star was definitely the salsa. They serve two varieties with the green being a tangy roasted tomatillo. For dinner, we started with their ceviche trio. All three varieties were tasty and served beautifully. For my money and if i were to do it again, I would have a full order of the Frontera ceviche as it was probably the best ceviche I've ever had. For our main dish I had the beef tacos al carbon. The meat was remarkably tender and tasty, served with soft corn tortillas and guacamole. In a way, I can't believe that I "settled" for fajitas, but after I put the first taco in my mouth, all doubts melted away. Our table split three desserts and they were each amazing. The Pay de Queso y Chocolate (Oaxacan cheesecake tart) was sublime. The Budin de Pan (blueberry bread pudding) was rich without being overpowering. The flan was perfect. The icecream dish was served with some type of wicked crumble that had us fighting over crumbs--literally. Desserts alone would be worth the trip and wait. And of course the drinks were phenomenal. I had the aguas frescas with a shot of something and the margarita. They were worthy of a top destination bar in terms of quality and originality. Simply amazing. Thanks, Rick Bayless.
