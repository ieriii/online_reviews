Vietnamese comes to Lincoln Park. And attracts families. With little kids. The food is good as is the service, but for traditional Vietnamese I'd recommend heading a bit farther north. Loved the avocado wonton (think Chinese crab rangoon but with creamy avocado - I could eat several of these suckers) and the shrimp spring rolls (light and fresh). A big bowl of Pho Bo (beef pho) is perfect on a chilly evening. If you're looking to get your fix for Vietnamese food this is a solid recommendation in the neighborhood, I'm just not sure I'll be rushing back here again so soon. Don't forget BYOB!
