My girlfriend and I loved Mastro's. The server (Griffin Greenberg) that waited on our table was excellent, very knowledgeable with his wine and entrees. The entire management staff was very friendly and treated us like regular guests. I will be frequenting this restaurant. If you enjoy a great bottle of wine request that Griffin is your server when you make reservations. 5stars!!!!!
