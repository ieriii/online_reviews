SO MANY BEERS. overwhelming really. but good. The only thing I don't like is that when you walk in, there is rarely a place to sit. So it's that awkward "where do I stand for a minute while we wait for a seat" kind of thing. And I'm really terrible at that game. And they're all so cool--either cool or really pretty or smart, or worse all 3. So get in there, look confident, and if there's no place to sit, "no big deal ya'll, I'll stand!" Good food, too.
