Wow, what a disappointment. I've been trying to get into Frontera Grill for months and had very high expectations. I ordered the sample platter which was pretty good, but ordered the Chicken Mole Enchiladas and they were, well, bad. Even the rice was bland. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I would rather go to Chevy's or the fast food Mexican joint on the corner. So, so, so disappointed and very sad about the experience. But, I do want to be fair and say that our waiter was fantastic.
