This is a gread, laid-back brunch spot. You stand in line to order and pay and then take your seat and wait for the staff to bring it to you. Although it's always crowded, I've only ever had to wait for a seat when I wanted to sit outside. The smoked salmon bagel and pancakes are both perfection, but the crab cake sandwich is pretty bland and too thick. That's all I've tried so far, but their entire menu looks yummy and filled with interesting choices. The coffee is delicious - a requirement for any brunch spot (Intellegentsia).
