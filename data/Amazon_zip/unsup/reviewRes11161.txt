DELISH!!! They have red velvet pancakes!!!!  =) ANNNNNND banana OREO hotcakes with warm vanilla bean creme and chocolate creme anglaise! Goodness gracious! I'm in love! If that weren't enough of an incentive to visit this place for some breakfast lovin'... THEY HAVE MIMOSAS!!! Black raspberry and grapefruit, and raspberry and pear mimosas... yum! I fully heart their menu! But their prices are a bit steep especially for not being downtown. Parking kind of sucks with the construction and expensive meter parking that plagues the entire city... and the service wasn't amazingly friendly but at least it was competent.
