Oh Tank, how you've changed after being on Check Please. I'm happy that you've become successful. However, I'm very disappointed that you've raised your prices, decreased your portions and no longer serve flavorful, AUTHENTIC Vietnamese dishes. Upon our last visit, we were surprised by the new, hip square plates and the newly revised menus. You've lost a lot of your Vietnamese regulars, but as long as you can get Vietnamese food newbies through your doors who wouldn't be able to tell the difference between pho broth that had been simmering for hours and broth made with boullion cubes, then more power to you. It doesn't bother us that you've compromised on your dishes to accomodate the Western palate, as we have so many other choices up and down Argyle and along Broadway. It's OK, we'll forgive you. In the meantime, you keep serving up your sub-par Vietnamese food so that as we walk past your window after a great meal at Le's Pho, we'll just entertain ourselves with the sight of all those poor souls you've managed to sucker into trying your lackluster food.
