Best/freshest skillets, and fruit plate around, tempting daily specials, and awesome healthy juice drinks. They have one of the largest selections of veggies used for their juices and skillets. The skillets are loaded, almost overflowing with the best tasting and freshest veggies available at most of the breakfast spots I've visited. They even have wheatgrass shots. Just shy of a 5 star rating for two reasons:1. Hostesses have been know to be fake nice to boarderline rude. However, the experienced, friendly, knowledgable servers make up for this.2. A few things I've had have been mediocre: crab cakes and fritattas (too much egg kind of tasted like a bad omlette). Plus, they don't have whole wheat pancakes. Don't be discouraged by the long wait, the food comes quickly and the service is execellent! They all seem to work together to make sure customers are happy and they are very thorough and always double check to make sure they have your order. Great ambiance for a breakfast place too!
