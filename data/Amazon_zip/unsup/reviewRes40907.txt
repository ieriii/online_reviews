The serving size here is ridiculously large. I don't think I've ever been able to finish an entire bowl of pho here, but I'm always too hungry to just get the pho baby. Haven't been able to try the other dishes, but my brother has found... creepy crawly critters in his food. I have yet to experience anything of the sort, but just knowing that and my germaphobic tendencies is a bit scary.
