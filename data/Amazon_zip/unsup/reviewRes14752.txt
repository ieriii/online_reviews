I just absolutely dig this place. Definetly old school supper club feel. The decore is horrendous, but love it. Food is great. Try everything. I have yet to be dissapointed. Veal, chicken, gnocci (sp?), LASAGNA!!! Everyone must get the Lobster and Artichoke Morney Sauce as an appetizer. SO good! They could literally serve the sauce by itself. SO rich, and delicious. Almost like a hollandaise, but way better. With the lobster and artichoke hearts, just the perfect play on flavors. Wine list is easy, and the best bottle on the menu is a Ruffino select $66. THERE most expensive botle is $66, I have spent more at Olive Garden........and it is absolutely good. They present it like the gold wrapping it is in. Like a gift from above! P.S The last time we were there the server was hammered. Probably 65 years old and plain drunk, but still on it. Some may not like this, for me it worked with the whole feel of the place.
