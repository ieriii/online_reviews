Monday evening around 6:30pm. About 20 minute wait for 2 people, which isn't too bad compared to the other stories I've heard.  Overall a really great dinner. The restaurant is really unique, easily missed on Michigan Avenue, but a great find when you know what to look for. It's a great combination of sophistication and unique-tasting dishes. It reminds me of tapas. The best dishes: wagyu sirloin and pig platter The pig platter (a little bit of every cured meat) was absolutely amazing. I didn't have any idea what most of them were by looking at the menu, so we ordered all of it and were able to try it all. I couldn't get enough of the flavor of all of them. It was perfect. The pork shoulder is as amazing as everyone else said. The presentation wasn't as great as the other dishes, but it was the memories of the holidays. The mashed potatoes that came with it was quite amazing. The wagyu sirloin was the perfect amount of crispy flavor on the outside and juiciness and red meat on the inside. The potatoes were also very flavorful. This was the second time eating wagyu beef, and I'm definitely a fan! The pig ears was good, but not exceptional. Growing up eating Chinese-style cooked pig ears, I was expecting something very different. Too much salt, but definitely interesting combination. The kale and egg in this dish were well cooked. The calamari was really good. I loved the combination of calamari and vegetables. It was quite refreshing. The prosciutto bread balls was nothing particularly impressive. I couldn't really taste the prosciutto, so it kind of ruined the expectation for me.
