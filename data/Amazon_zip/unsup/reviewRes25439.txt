It appeared to be a good dessert spot but they had run out of some of the baked goods that we had wanted to try. Ordered a latte here nstead, but it wasn't worth the calories I would waste on it, and dumped it out. They serve alcohol, so that's a plus, and they are open late night. I would like to try it again since it seemed so promising but I can't offer any good review based on my experience to date.
