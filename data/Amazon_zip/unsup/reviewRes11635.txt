Yes! If you're going to make breakfast all yuppified and fancy, THIS is the way to do it. The menu options are creative and also delicious. Everything is punched up with such a sweet-tooth sensibility that most of the breakfast items could double as desserts. Everyone seems to be complaining about the wait, but when I went there wasn't one at all, though I think it was a weekday. Still, if you can't be a man and get a real breakfast at a real diner, this place is worth the wait because it's the best breakfast of this style that I've encountered in Chicago. Oh also, I should add that I recommend this place over its South Loop counterpart---that place WAS insanely crowded, with a much less pleasant atmosphere.
