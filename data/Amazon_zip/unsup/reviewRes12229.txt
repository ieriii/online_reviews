I've been here several times, with bigger groups and small groups. While you can expect a wait most evenings, this is a great place for groups. They take reservations for groups of 10 or more. They have great beer that's made in the restaurant. If you're feeling adventorourrs, I recommend the white clam and bacon pizza.
