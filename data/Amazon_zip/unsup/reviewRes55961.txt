I have mixed feelings about this place - because our experience was somewhat lacking, yet it really does have a lot going for it. It definitely has 'ambience.' It's charming and intimate, if not just a bit on the cramped side. Parking is good if you park on the side street nearby. They offer a decent selection of pastas, although we were a bit confused with our waiter's explanation of the homemade vs. out of the box choices (and the difference in cost, at least according to him). In fact, our server was the worst part of our dining experience. He was impatient, distracted, and at times, downright rude. At one point, he actually walked away as my husband was still speaking to him. We literally had to ask someone to send him back to our table, which clearly annoyed him. When I asked questions about how certain foods are prepared (since I have several food allergies), his answers were all over the place, and at times, his visible irritation with my (very necessary) questions made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Regarding the food, my entree was okay; nothing special - and somewhat over-priced. My husband ordered some sort of seafood pasta - which he thoroughly enjoyed. Bottom line: I think we would give them another try, but we'll definitely ask to be seated in someone elses section to avoid a repeat performance
