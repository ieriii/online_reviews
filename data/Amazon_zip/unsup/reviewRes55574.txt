Wife loves this place. I get swashbuckled into waiting 45 minutes for a table here about once every other month. IS the food good? Yeah. I'llshovel it in as shamelessly as the next guy, but i'd be just as happy with no wait at a diner. Chocolate stuffed, gold crusted pancakes with dancing leprachaun garnishes can only be so good.
