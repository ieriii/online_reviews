I travel quite frequently for business and I have to say this is one of ht eworst hotels I have ever stayed in. The rumor is Al Capne stayed there and apparetnly they have not renovated it since he was there. The carpet was stained, the plumbing ran all night & the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. The wireless internet did not work. There was also a really long line to chekc in. The gym was somewhere in the basement, but I never got to see it because you had to go down some creepy stairs. I guess that is what you get for $180 a night in Chicago during the week. On the upside, it is close to Millenium Park & THe Art Institute if you are there for fun.
