We ate here about 4 or 5 years ago and the collections were fantastic. The food was well prepared and intriguing, the caviar staircase was the highlight of the meal, and we felt satisified at the end of the meal. Now, they are trying to compete with Alinea and Moto and everything is foamed, dolloped, and the portions are miniscule. I had two courses in my collection that were two of the worst things I've ever eaten in my entire life: Artichoke Consomme with Caramel(!!!) and a lovely piece of sturgeon ruined by being soaked in mushroom tea. My partner and I were starving when we left and have no intention of ever returning there again.
