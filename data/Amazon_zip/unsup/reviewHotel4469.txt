A throw back to a better time in America when people were not so obsessed with lower prices and costs. Fantastic atmosphere and lobby. Very good service throughout and I loved the bar in the lobby, which seems to jump during the evening. The room was newly decorated but kept the older walk in closet, which i appreciated. Make sure you do not get a room by the service elevator as it is quite noisy during the day. The restaurant was pricy for breakfast, but very nice for dinner. I suggest booking around the corner for breakfast as there are plenty of places on the same block. Also check out the Berghoff down the street, which has a great bar.
