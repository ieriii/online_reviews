I'm writing this review as I'm laying in the Hyatt bed right now. Mind you, it's 3:45 pm in the afternoon, and I feel no desire to get out of bed anytime soon.Their bed is probably one of the comfiest things I've ever slept on!!! This is a massive hotel right in the middle of Chicago. I got a great deal online and could not be more pleased. The only drawback is that they charge for internet, but if you "like" them on Facebook, there are sometimes free internet specials. Also, their business center is closed at night so that's also kinda annoying. Otherwise, nice large room, wonderful location, perfect location. I would highly recommend this hotel! ----------------------- UPDATE: I just received the sweetest gift of delicious toffee candy and a sweet card wishing me good trip from the Hyatt about 30 minutes after writing this review. Yes, I'm still in this amazingly comfy bed. It is certainly the little touches that makes this a great hotel!
