I love Superdawg, they have great food and the best drive in anywhere. If you haven't been, you've got to, it's a place you can only go in Chicago. The first time I'd ever been there was in high school, I wish that I had gone when I was a kid, it's such a cute place. They have vintage looking boxes their food comes in, they're kind of like happy meals, but for adults! Give Superdawg a shot, it's definitely worth the trip! I also like their twitter account, they're very engaging and nice!
