I came into Alliance in search of a substitute for my beloved pumpkin cookie, star of a now defunct bakery in my hometown. The cookie here wasn't an exact match but it was worth the $2 I paid for it. The service was friendly, they have a ton of seasonal coffee drinks as well as caramel apple cider, and seriously if you can't wait til Christmas time for a gingerbread latte, you can get one here. Everything in here looks delicious. Mmm sugar.
