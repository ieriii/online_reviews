I have to agree with some previous posters here that they pack the place way too full. This is the type of bar that I want to enjoy by relaxing and having some great beer, very hard to do when I cannot move and there is a weird person jammed right in next to me. The bartenders have never been super friendly to me, maybe they are too busy? The beer selection is obviously fantastic and all of the apps that I have had have been good to.I will make it a point to come here on a less busy day and rereview ....
