Now we are talking MEXICAN! This place has the best tacos sabinas. These tacos have the right amount of "Spicy"in them and a delicious fresh flour tortilla which is unusual for me since I dislike flour tortillas. Trust me when I tell you, you will not find tacos like these anywhere else. The skirt steak, guisado the res and menudo are fantastic! They also have a great breakfast. I've only had one bad meal here which was the flauta dinner. Something about the corn tortilla they use for this meal isn't right.
