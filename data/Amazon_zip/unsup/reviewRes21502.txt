BE AWARE! LONG ASS LINES!! If you want to take to go, they will only let you do so after 3pm. We waited for an hour in line, they wont even let you order the food until a table opens up. Menu: limited if you dont eat pork and all the soups are not offered until after 3pm. We ordered the 2 different chicken tortas gunthrup and milanesa, both good, not amazing. Also the guac and chips were good. Dessert: Churros 3 for 3$..best churros I have had outside spain, and thats a big comment to say, because I am verrrry picky when it comes to churros. The hot chocolates are extremely rich, best to get one and use as dipping for churros. I had the chocolate cafe con leche, decent. conclusion: Coming back for the churros, but not the food if there is a line.
