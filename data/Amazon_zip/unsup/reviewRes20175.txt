This is an Irish pub, but not your run of the mill pub, it's a little more high class than the Guinness pounding, whisky swilling, fish & chips pubs that we all know and love. But what else do you expect from a pub on Michigan Ave.   I just stopped in for a quick bite, had a Irish coffee, and we shared a heaping bowl of mussels. Based off the first look I'd definitely go back. Though be warned, with the higher end fare comes higher prices.
