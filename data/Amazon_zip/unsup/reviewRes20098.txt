I felt like a tourist in my own town as I waited in line for lunch. The two groups ahead of me were taking pictures and asking questions about the ingredients on nearly every item prior to ordering. The wait on a Saturday wasn't too shabby, about 10 minutes to order and another 5 for food delivery. Split an order of chips/salsa, Cubana sandwich, and Cochonita Pibil. A very solid meal, in terms of quality and flavor, but not especially memorable. The bread on the cochonita pibil was rather dry and crusty. I think that the vibe at Frontera Grill is a lot more lively and the food is more vibrant and delicious. But I appreciate the layout and decor of Xoco, and our servers were friendly and polite.
