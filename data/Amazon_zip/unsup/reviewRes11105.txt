This place has 800+ reviews so I am not going to break any ground here.  I loved the beer samples - 3 oz pours for a buck gave me the ability to try several and decide on my pizza sidekick. Ended up with the Pale Ale (the name escapes me at the moment).  Excellent - reminded me of my current favorite Euphoria which has a good deal of hops which pairs great with pizza. On to the pizza, went with two individuals to have leftovers - white pizza with clams and bacon and a red pizza with sausage and mushroom. The red was average. I found the sauce to be too sweet for my liking and the pizza was boring.  The white pizza rocked my world.  This might be the best pizza I've had ever.
