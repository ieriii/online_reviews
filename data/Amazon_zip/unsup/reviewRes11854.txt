oh what fun!! during my trip to chicago, the bf and i needed a place to catch up with 20 of our closest chicago friends (we're so popular). one of our friends recommended piece. living on the left coast, i was anxious for some REAL pizza.  i was a little taken aback by the reservation process. the staff was ADAMANT about having an accurate number of guests for the reservation and that a certain percentage be on time. they called twice to confirm. dang! i was so nervous about losing our reservation. but all was fine! piece delivered!! tons of options and all were delicious! my favorite was the white pizza with chicken and artichokes. damn that was good! only disappointment was the lack of selection from the in house microbrewery. there were many beers on the menu that i wanted to try, but for some inexplicable reason, were not available. oh well. guess i'll just have to show up again some other time!
