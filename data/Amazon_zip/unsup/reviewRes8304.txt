I've eaten pizza in the heart of Naples, Italy over a dozen of times, and this place comes pretty damn close to perfection. Of course, the ingredients may not be as fresh as those in Italy, but the oven, fabulous. The pizzas really had an authentic taste. My mother, a fickle Italian woman who does not enjoy eating at restaurants was even impressed, and cannot stop talking about how great the pizza was. They even serve San Benedetto Ice tea....AMAZING
