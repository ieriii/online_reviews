I am on a greek kick today and reviewing all things mediterranean. I really like artopolis. It is a neat little place to grab a nice lunch or dinner with friends. I've been to greece, and the atmosphere does hold fairly true to how little cafes are there.  I really like the sandwiches here, especially the grilled veggie one with the greek cheese served on the most amazing bread. You can substitute the side of pasta salad it comes with for these wonderful potatoes as well, which i highly recommend. Also, try the rice pudding! The service can be hit-or-miss here, but it is in greece as well, so i'm going to write that off as them trying to be authentically greek.
