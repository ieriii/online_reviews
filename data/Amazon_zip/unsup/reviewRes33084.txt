I really like this place. It serves a host of cuisines not just from Romania but from all over Central and Eastern Europe. We walked in on a Thursday late evening, thinking We would just try out the http://restaurant.com coupon, try the food, and gtfo before they get mad at us for dining in too late on a weeknight. However, the owner made sure that we felt very welcome to his establishment and indulged us with banter and humor. I ordered the borscht soup and smoked salmon for starters and short rib goulash and the schnitzel. They were all hearty and excellent. I won't profess to be an expert but from my travels through Hungary and Czech rep. the goulash (or at least the sauce) seemed authentic to the region. The schnitzel was pretty ok, but man o man the borscht soup was bomdotcom! And the smoked salmon not too shabby either. We were definitely the last customers there, but the owner didn't pressure us to leave and he was thoroughly accommodating. He seemed actually delighted that we would come try his restaurant based on the http://restaurant.com coupon (instead of the usual annoyance thrown your way when you present it). On a sidenote, in entrance area there's a bunch of pictures of the owner sometimes with famous Chicago personalities and sometimes with his other small-business ventures from the past. I think it's refreshing that the owner is proud to be a significant part of the Chicago community. I would def. come here again even w/o the coupon. That's how enjoyable the experience was for me.
