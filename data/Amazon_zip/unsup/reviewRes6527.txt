I know this place is a chain so it loses points for authenticity, but I love this place! I have gone here many times with my family or dates and have always been happy with it. The place is always crowded, so I recommend making a reservation at Open Table. I also always get the filet medallions which you get to top with such things like cheese or potatoes. Yum!! I also love the sides-huge baked potatoes, fries, etc...Going there is always a nice treat.
