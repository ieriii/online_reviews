I love the chicago diner! it is probably one of my most favorite vegan places I have ever been to! both times I went I was living on the road with work, so delicious vegan specific food was often hard to come by. Chicago diner's food is delicious and totally affordable. I've brought my omnivore friends and they loved it too. Service is always very helpful and patient. I would say that if you gave up meat because you dislike the taste of meat, some of these dishes might not be for you. Their chicken fried steak fooled my meat eating friends. But there are non mock meat options as well; their mac and cheese was wonderful. Cheesecakes there are a must. I like that they have raw options as well. if you're on a road trip and could swing by chicago, or just want an excuse to go to the windy city, this would be a reason for it.
