appetizer: fried yucca with mojo (garlic oil) it was so much better than 90 miles' fried yucca with mojo! lunch: rib eye steak casado & costa rican sandwich both were very good. steak was perfectly cooked, super juicy and super tasty! cabbage salad was awesome. i hate eating with my hands because oil and messy food makes me want to wash my hands a billion times throughout meals BUT this sandwich was well worth it. :) drink: OATMEAL SHAKE! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS OATMEAL SHAKE! although i have to say, i can't compare to any other oatmeal shake since this is the first time i've ever had it. it is sooo good. soooo addicting. i want it right now. i would give irazu 10 stars if i could! i just wish they had one closer to downtown. boooo. :(
