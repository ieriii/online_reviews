This is yet another eatery in my neighborhood that I frequent several times per week. I love their tomato soup -- I don't even LIKE tomato soup, but I crave theirs! Other items on the cafe list that I order often are: the turkey/cranberry/Brie sandwich (I add avocado), the farmers' market salad, the Cobb salad (w/o bacon), and OF COURSE the oatmeal raisin cookies (which have pieces of apple, currants, and raisins in them). I go to the market section for F & O for their organic fruit, fruit salad (in the takeout case), and hard-to-find ingredients for the few-and-far-between times that I actually cook. I've used their catering department for picnics and parties, and I've always been extremely pleased with the level of service and helpfulness I've received from the staff.
