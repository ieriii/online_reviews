I have never tried the pizza in Naples so I can't comment on authenticity. However, you can certainly taste the quality of the ingredients, everything from the flour to the prosciutto. I tried the Prosciutto E Rucola, Salsiccia, and Bianca Con Bufala E Rucola. I like generosity of toppings but I thought the amount of arugula was overkill.  The slices were quite doughy and floppy. To wash it down with my new favorite beer, Menabrea birra, was splendido!
