We only had to wait 30 mins for 3 of us on a Friday night. Tasty brews kept us waiting happily as our appetites built. We were seated at a high-top and promptly were served a pitcher, which was a pretty good deal around 15 bucks. The mixed green salad was excellent, maybe in part because of the 3-beer buzz, but I think mostly because of the candied pecans and gorgonzola! The pizza came exactly as we ordered it with an interesting half/whole topping combination. A medium was good to share for the three of us and it was mighty tasty. It's pretty smushed and noisy in there, but a couple more beers and it would have been just fine. I'm looking forward to a repeat on a Saturday night with live band karaoke!
