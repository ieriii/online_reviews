Total experience: 2 stars Churros: 10 stars The line was long at 10:30am, and the whole process of ordering and getting seated was much less efficient and more confusing than necessary, but presumably they will work that out. Manager and cashier were friendly, which helped. Gunthoro chicken sandwich had a nice flavor, but way too many onions and the squishy ingredients slid right out of the hard crunchy bread every time I took a bite, making a big mess. But then came the churros. In case you don't love churros quite as much as me, let me give you a scale: 2 = churros at the fair or a street stand. Sad, frozen pastries that have been reheated and are overpriced, but that you occasionally buy anyway in a fit of delusional optimism or out of a desperate need for carbs in which anything made of dough and dusted in sugar will do. 4= costco churro. Fresher. But just a pleasant pastry, as opposed to the delectable delight that a churro could be. 8 = fresh churros in Mexico. You watch them get fished out of a vast pot of boiling oil. Sprinkled with sugar, and put into a brown paper bag that quickly turns translucent with grease. Your delight in the deliciousness is slightly tempered by the knowledge that this is really, really bad for you. 10 = xocos. These had all the freshness of Mexican churros, without the grease. And, bonus, in addition to granular sugar and cinnamon, they are crusted with little pieces of Mexican chocolate for extra flavor. Truly, truly amazing. Rick, open a churro window. Seriously, that huge line waiting for food and a place to sit, how many of them would happily fork over their cash for a quick churro? You could serve churros as fast as you could scoop them into a paper bag, and have so so many more happy customers every day. Churro window. Seriously.
