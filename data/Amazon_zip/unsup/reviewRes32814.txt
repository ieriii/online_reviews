Demera was my first exposure to Ethiopian food, and I LOVED IT! The food was well prepared and full of flavor. However, the service was so incredibly bad that I can't give Demera more than 3-stars. I was with a party of three and we arrived for an early dinner, there were two other groups in the restaurant and three or four people working the floor. We waited and waited to get our water refilled, it took forever to order, and we waited an eternity to get our check and for them to take our money. It's such a shame that great food was overshadowed by horrible service.
