In the mood for pho and near Viet town? If so, this is definitely one of my favorite pho places in the area. My wife loves pho and introduced me to this corner place. I've come to use their lovely bowl of pho as the standard in which I compare all pho noodle bowls.  Unfortunately for the area, parking can be difficult and this place can also get really busy. Fortunately, the service and food comes out relatively quick. I must admit, it can be somewhat uncomfortable in here being that the table setup may have you seated very closely. Overall, they give you generous portions of all the sprouts, mint leaves, jalapenos you will need. They also have all the right sauces for your bowl. There have been too may times where restaurants have been stingy with either of those side ingredients. That is not an issue here. This place is awesome during cold Chicago winters. A bowl of pho will hit the spot!
