Really good food. Huge portions. Every main is about $20 which is a little high for the location. But then we get the bill.  They charge for splitting plates. $4. Where are we? Skokie? Who still charges for splitting plates? My girlfriend and i split a portabello appetizer and a special gnocchi that was stuffed with pesto and cheese. Both were good but the gnocchi was so big that we still took some home. They don't charge a corkage fee but charge for splitting food, who is running this place? The opening bread was also a touch stale.
