Forget everything you think you know about Ravenswood and Montrose, because this place certainly shattered my expectations concerning diners. First, this isn't a diner. Not really. A diner isn't a cosy little nook with seating for less than 20 hungry folk, and emphasizes burgers, fries, milkshakes, and may even have a soda-jerk. Glen's is nothing like those, and for that, you can thank the gods. Glen's is all about fresh, whole-grain bread, fresh-squeezed orange juice from some top secret source he'll never reveal, hashbrown pancakes, complementary imported crackers, and fish. Fish adorns their specials menu, two chalkboards on their West and East walls detail several slightly more expensive lunch or dinner items such as pepper crusted tilapia, grilled tuna steaks, perch, and so on. It never seems the same twice, and there's definite variety here. All of the other menu items are great, and there's no doubt each has a history of why it's on the menu, but Glen really wants you to order some fish. Several signs say so, touting the health benefits, freshness, and quality of their ingredients in this regard. The skeptic in me says he does this for profit margins, but judging by the afore mentioned orange juice and other subtle touches, I'm pretty sure that isn't the case. But I've never been let down here, and considering the rest of the restaurants along this strip of Montrose, it really is a diamond in the rough.
