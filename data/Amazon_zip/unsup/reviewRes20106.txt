Coast is close to my house and I've been going for a number of years. Since opening they've expanded and have a very busy following from across the city. The dining room is very comfortable especially for meeting friends. It's a little dark but it's a good darkness meant for ambiance.  The sushi is good but not the best in the city. It's the best in the neighborhood which is why it has a good following. Give it a try one time and see what you think.
