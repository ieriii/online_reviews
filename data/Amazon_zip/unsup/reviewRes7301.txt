I had Osso Bucco for the first time here. It was phenomenal. Service was wonderful, all the staff are cool and helpful. Chef Anthony was very gracious and likable. Sapori's food was delicious--appetizers, both entrees, and the desserts were so wonderful that I couldn't stop myself no matter how full I was. I'm going back to Sapori the first chance I get.
