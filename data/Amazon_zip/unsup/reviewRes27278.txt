Overall: Good & inventive food, nice ambiance, average service, creative menu (handwritten by the chef with wine pairings for each plate), but bad drinks! They need a new mixologist. The "bread" you get here is popcorn! Every night, depending on what they feel like, they will serve different flavors of popcorn - we had curry popcorn, and it was amazing! If you go to the website, you'll notice that it has popcorn, and now you'll know why :). We ordered the beef tartare, cheez it risotto, gnocchi.. Gnocchi was hands down the best, and we could have skipped the beef tartare.  I ordered the pork prime rib, which was the best entree of the night! It was HUGE (think porterhouse huge), and it wasn't overcooked! It was tender and juicy on the inside, and I loved the grits and collard greens on the side. The big surprise though, was that it was glazed with a root beer bbq - what a pleasant surprise! Others ordered the beef short rib stroganoff; short ribs were tender, stroganoff was ok- overall dish was just average. The hubby had a fish, and it was just bland and boring. Another person was vegetarian, and they were able to whip out a very nice polenta/vegetarian dish.  We were stuffed and opted out of dessert. Chef Graham Elliot was actually walking throughout the dining room during service chatting with the guests. I had the pleasure of taking a picture with him - he's so humble and personable -- which is always nice.  Sure, this restaurant isn't perfect, but I do appreciate that Graham Elliot is innovative and incorporates everyday snacks in his food, and makes it tasty! I have two upcoming dinners here, so am excited to try more.
