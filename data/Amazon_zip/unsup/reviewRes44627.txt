We walked down to Alliance Bakery after a yummy lunch at Smoke Daddy. They are about a half block from each other and I am a dessert-freak, so my hubby suggested it and I happily agreed. Um, it was kinda weird. The front window has beautiful cakes and made me want to talk in. It was a Sunday afternoon and the cases were a bit picked over, so I struggled with what to order. Wish I had read Yelp ahead of time and tried a macaroon! Anyhow, I ordered an apricot almond pastry and a cranberry bar of some sort. Both were okay. Neither were fabulous and I don't think I will go out of my way to spend $7.96 on two "meh" pastries again. Also, the staff was a little off...I can't really explain it, but it wasn't that warm, fuzzy feel that I usually get in a bakery. Thanks, but no thanks.
