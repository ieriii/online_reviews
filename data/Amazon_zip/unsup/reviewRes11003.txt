I attended a birthday party at Piece and I've also been there on a weekend night to witness live-band kareoke. This place is huge, and pretty cool. The pizza is thin and crunchy. (I'm not a pizza expert but I think it would be best defined as New Haven style because of the white pizza with the availability of clams.) The topping list is decent, but mostly with traditional choices. I tried several different normal toppings on both the red and white pizza styles. Both of the pizza styles were awesome, which are available with different cheeses. I've also tried the goat cheese appetizer which is awesome. The beer is a category all of its own. There are many great choices such as Top Heavy Hefeweizen, Worryin' Ale, Disfunctionale, Golden Arm, Wingnut, etc. They have won numerous brewery awards since the opening of the restaurant. The beer is a huge reason why this place is so awesome. There are also growlers available for $15. The live-band Kareoke on weekends is awesome, they do a really good job with the covers. I've heard the Talking Heads done pretty well here. This is also good place to watch football at, especially with big groups of friends. It's not really a good place for a romantic date since it's really big and loud. In all, definitely check it out but watch out for huge crowds of people on the weekends.
