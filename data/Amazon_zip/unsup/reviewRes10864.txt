I was visiting Chicago all last week and my friend says we're going to this place called Piece. I'm down. Pizza and beer. Bring it. I had the Drunklweizen which was really tasty. When it came to the pizza, I had no say in the toppings. They chose mashed potatoes and bacon....on the pizza. It was pretty good.  Like thanksgiving dinner on a pizza, kinda.
