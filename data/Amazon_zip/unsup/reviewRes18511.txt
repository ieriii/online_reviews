Pretty sure this is new but they now charge an $8 fee if you split plates. Their dishes are HUGE so we always split. The waiter is usually accommodating and will waive it if you order some appetizers. We had a table of 4 girls, and ordered 3 dishes and he didn't charge us. But there's no way that one person could finish a plate - they are almost meant to be split amongst groups.
