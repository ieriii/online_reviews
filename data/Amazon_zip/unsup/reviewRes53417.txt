Never did I think that foie gras belonged on a hot dog, but here I stand corrected....and full. It's too bad I don't live in Chicago or I'd go back until I had tried everything on the menu.Hot doug's is awesome. It's one of the single greatest places I've ever eating. It pulls no stops in making your food delicious yet cheap. There's always a long line, which tells you something, but getting your food doesn't take long once you're in there. Doug himself is a really nice guy (I recognized him from watching the No Reservations episode). The food is awesome: I had the duck hot dog with foie gras, the Sonoran, and the Buffalo one (it was filled with blue cheese and deliciousness). OK, i shared these with my fiance, but they were all amazing.My only recommendations if you go to Hot Doug's are:1) bring a book/phone while you wait in line2) order 2 hot dogs for yourself3) order the duck fat fries4) Consume5) Achieve nirvana
