The BEST place EVER to eat pho. I am Vietnamese and have been eating it all my life and every new city I go to, I eat pho because I can't get enough of it. This is the only place in Chicago I can go to to get my fix. I frequently get Pho cravings and my husband tries to take me to other places in Chinatown since it's closer to where we live, but it never is enough. I always make a trip here the very next day to satisfy my craving. I've tried other pho's in the area and none are as flavorful as the ones here.  You'll most likely have to wait to get a table and/or sit with strangers but it's well worth it. I dont think I've tried anything else on the menu except pho so I can't comment on the other dishes. If it wasn't so far, I would seriously eat here every other day, if not every day. warning- pho to go for some reason is not as good as in the restaurant. Food- the best pho anywhere, even in Orange County. Price- Great Service- eh, but the food makes up for it
