the good: there is nothing really good about the place. the bad: there is nothing really bad about the place. I'm sad to say my food was a disappointment. i felt like i wasted my time and was dumb enough to believe the hype of this place. the service was excellent and our waiter was attentive. he may have been the best part. but don't take my word for it you may have a better time and you may like the food. i was just disappointed and i like eating, I'm not a foodie or have ever worked with food but i like eating and like trying new places and i do feel a bit bad for writing a review like this but i like eating good food and i sure didn't find it at the Frontera Grill.
