My very generous girlfriend took me for my birthday last weekend and I couldn't have had a better time. Prime 112 in SoBe is the only other place I've had actual Kobe and TRU certainly didn't disappoint. A5 Kobe topped with foie gras is about as decadent a dish as you can create. Everything after that is a blur, but I would recommend this as a "dining experience" rather than simply a meal. And for the price, I suppose it had better be. Splurge a little, go to TRU at least once in your life, but do yourself a favor and wear a proper jacket and tie. The kid dressed like Harry Potter two tables over looked like an idiot.
