If you're looking to clean out your system, but you don't want to splurge on a colonic, then come to Nuevo Leon! What was up with the spice levels the day I was there? Up was up with the spice levels - like really high up - too high up - like to 11. We came here through a chance recommendation from a friend (or I thought he was a friend?) while we were walking around 18th street hungry. It seemed like everything I got had big, parboiled chunks of bright green jalapenos, which, sorry to break it to you all, is not what's on the menu in any of the many cities in Mexico where I've had delicious meals. The whole conversation of our table turned to the ridiculous heat of our food: "They could charge $10 a glass for horchata here and make a killing!" "Jalapeno chopper here must be the worst job in the world!" "Check my forehead, I think I have a fever." "Please God I hope that fire truck coming here to save me!" This is the type of tourist trappy Mexican restaurant serving up a combination of boring and ass-hot Mexican-American fare. On the positive side, the food comes quickly (wait, maybe that's not such a great point?) and the soup they bring out for the begining of the meal is pretty good. Tina B. always says - "Abundance of peppers fills the spot where great cookery is not." These are my words for you to live by. There are several other places that are way better in Pilsen even and I can think of about 10 off the top of my head right now throughout the city that are just way, way better.
