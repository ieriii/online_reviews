busy, busy, busy. almost always. it can be quite a wait on the weekends, but well worth it. the ingredients are very fresh and all the dishes are prepared from scratch and with love. I had the crabcake sandwich with chipotle mayo and shredded lettuce on baguette bread. The crabcake was a bit dry, but very very tasty. The homemade potato chips are perfectly crunchy and not too salty.  I really enjoy the atmosphere of this place. Sunlight tends to filter in spreading across the tables, and there are always fresh flowers in little vases. The Milk n Honey granola is to DIE FOR. I eat mine with soymilk.
