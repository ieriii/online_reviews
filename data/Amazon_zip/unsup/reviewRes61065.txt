This place is a wee bit overrated. I think Yuppies like it because it makes them feel adventerous to eat slightly spicy food. Anyway they have odd hours so call ahead to make sure they will be open when you wanna go. They tend to leave the door unlocked when they are closed for their mid-day change over, and then tell you in a snooty manner that they are closed. One of the waitresses (probably from Michigan) even had the nerve to stick her tongue out at me. Needless to say I am bitter and I'll NEVER set foot in that place again.
