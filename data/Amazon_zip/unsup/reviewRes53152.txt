Until my buddy Rick C. invites me to his mom's house for dinner, I'll have to say this some of the better Cuban that I've had. My fiance and I each enjoyed Ropa Vieja dinners. The beef does have some chew to it (it's not quite melt in your mouth tender like braised short rib), but it is pretty tasty. I even dare say that it tastes better the next day (assuming you have leftovers) after sitting in its own juices for another night. The dinner also came with a well seasoned side of black beans, as well as fried plantains that were sweet and perfectly caramelized. I personally like to eat the plantains in the same bite as the ropa vieja to get that sweet-savory combo. My only complaint here is that the side of plantains isn't as generous as I'd like. We also enjoyed a sweet, creamy cup of Cafe con Leche, and their Bread Pudding, while very dense, was able to satisfy my sweet tooth.
