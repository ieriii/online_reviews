Really quite good innovative tapas. Great mix of quality traditional fare with fresh takes on old standards. Highly recommended - especially if like me, you're tired of most of the Chicago tapas fare which is so-so at best. As far as comments on service, I'm baffled. Maybe it's because they wore black put some folks off? Our waiter was attentive and professional and made some genuinely good suggestions; no posing at all. I was also sensitive to this from other comments and every table nearby seemed to be having friendly, helpful service - back waiters not bad either...  I was also impressed that they seated us promptly at 9:00 on a Saturday evening. We had basic Jamon Serrano, Chorizo (both classics and well done) with the bacon-wrapped dates (very good). The Barramundi was superb and the pork belly sublime. The shellfish Croquettes were also a nice alternative to typically denser and heavier croquettes. I also highly recommend the Catalan spinach which I wouldn't normally have ordered if not for the recommendation of the waiter - a nice surprise. The Butifarra (homemade sausage) was deftly seasoned - piquant without being overpowering. To top it off, the chocolate Croquette dessert was really amazing. I also have to give Mercat credit for a substantive and moderately priced wine list offering many options by the glass, half carafe and larger, all at very reasonable prices. The half-carafe option also let's you mix things up a bit and try various wines. Highly recommended. 4/29/09 - Changed my vote to 5 stars after seeing Arco De Cuchilleros averaged to 4 stars rating. in NO WAY should diners confuse the quality of the two....
