I was in town on Business and my boss who lives in Chicago brought us there for dinner. It was definitely unlike anything I've ever had in a Pizza. We tried 4 different Pizzas and they were amazing. The owners told us the story about how they met in Brazil and where the recipes came from. The food was so good that we got Pizzas delivered to our hotel room the next couple of nights too. Can't wait to go back and support a solid local business like this one.
