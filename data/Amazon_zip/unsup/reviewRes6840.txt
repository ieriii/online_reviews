I went in here last night for dinner, and could not have had a better meal or better experience. Lee (the GM) and Brian (our server) were just absolutely wonderful. I am vegetarian, so I had the fried green tomatoes (omg, yummy) the poblano cornbread (outstanding) and mac and cheese (best I ever had). They have a very impressive selection of bourbon as well, I recommend "Q". My BF had the wing appetizer, and he said they were the best wings hes ever had. I will definitely be back here.
