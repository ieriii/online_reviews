This place isn't huge but I'd say just about every dessert they have is absolutely delightful. I love the Michelle! It's rasberry, PB, and a crunchy bottom all covered in chocolate that is superb. My cousins love their macaroons. I know a lot of people including my sister who have gotten their wedding cake here. It's very beautfiful and delicious all at the same time.
