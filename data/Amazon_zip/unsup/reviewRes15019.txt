This is a really cool speakeasy. Nothing too secret about it.  I love the whole concept of it being a very very social lounge. It's quite spacy and I do appreciate the unlabeled bathrooms. There are 3 of them, all for sharing. Haha, males have to wait, too. They have a very unique drink menu but I could only order a beer, since I had previous experiences with drinks that were not to my liking. The beer I ordered was a pale ale but it was very harsh to drink. I could have ordered a better drink, but it's alright because I really liked the environment and service.
