This the the place where I first tried sushi and had to admit to all my friends that I was indeed missing out on something. I will say that I am somewhat spoiled in having such a great place as my first sushi experience because all the other sushi places I have been to have not been as good as Coast! This place is BYOB (like many sushi places in Chicago) so that is pretty awesome by itself. The only appetizer I think I have ever had here is edamame but make sure to eat it quickly since when it gets cold it is how you say "uhhh not-a sooo goood". I really like spicy rolls and Coast delivers. Spicy Tako, Spicy Sweet Potato, Spicy Tuna and VOLCANO all are delicious. Make sure to get fresh wasabi to complete the spicy experience. For dessert, make sure to try the Mochi and get the "Red Bean" flavor (its good, trust me). As for ambiance its a pretty relaxed atmosphere lots of groups, lots of people on dates, lots of chatting. Definitely the best sushi place I have been to in my life so give it a try.
