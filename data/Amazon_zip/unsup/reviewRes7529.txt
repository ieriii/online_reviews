I ate here quite a while ago, and don't remember why I didn't write a review at the time. I'm prompted to do so today because in the mail came a gift certificate with a hand written note from the chef (a photocopy of a hand written note, but still) thanking me for my visit. How sweet! In today's economy I think it's all about the customer service, and a chef actually taking time to write a note is just awesome. As for the actual restaurant, it was equally wonderful. Again, don't know why I didn't comment at the time, because it was really, really great. For some reason that I don't remember, possibly the fact that there was a longer than 15 minute wait, we got a free appetizer - bruschetta, a classic, but only good if all the ingredients are fresh, which they were this evening. The ambiance was nice, it's a fairly big space but divided into smaller rooms so the feel was intimate. I read some other reviews and see that other people took home leftovers - I remember my entree being so delicious that I ate the whole thing! Pumpkin ravioli - it was mouth wateringly scrumptious. My friend had pasta as well, gluten free, btw, which she also devoured - no doggie bags for us! We were however, too full for dessert, which was unfortunate because I think for checking in on yelp we were entitled to free espresso. Next time! A presto, Sapori!
