I think this is a classic example of over-hype and menu has a bigger bark than bite. We sat outside and were left alone most of the night. Service was very mediocre, but the patio is quite nice for al fresco dining. Definitely go out there! Ambiance was good, quiet evening on the patio perfect for a romantic dinner or a nice night with friends. Boyfriend went with the Honey Jalapeo Pork Chops which are marinated, grilled, then baked to perfection and served with sweet potatoes (per a Yelp recommendation). These were two of the largest pork chops I have EVER seen in my life. I am pretty sure steroids are somehow used in the production of these pigs. They were delicious as described. The skin is VERY difficult to cut through, however the meat is quite soft. Just be prepared for a workout. I went with the Blackened Duck (Boneless breast pan seared, oven baked & served with a pasilla portobello mushroom sauce, jalapeo mashed potatoes & sauted seasonal vegetables.). The mashed potatoes were the star on this plate. The portion of duck was tiny compared to the pork chops. I was hoping for a crispy skin that I love with duck, and I just didnt get it here. Dish was overall ok, but I would try something else next time. I would take the L - right off the Irving Park Brown Line.
