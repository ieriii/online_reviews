Best deep dish and thin crust in Chicago. I discovered this place by word of mouth I haven't stopped going. If you like a sausy deep dish with a crusty cheesy edge, then you have to try it out. If you are a meat lover on your pizza, then you have to try the sausage. Although the place looks small on the outside. There is plenty of room for a large gathering upstairs.Whether you are a local or out of town-er, you have to stop by and try Pequods.
