With many mexican restaurants on the north side, it can be hard to distinguish. But the food here has always been great. Whether I order chimichangas or tacos. I guess the thing that separates this really from the others is the exceptional service. They are very friendly and love repeat customers. But they go outta their way to make everyone comfortable.
