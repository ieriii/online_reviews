Did you notice that almost every negative comment about this place starts with something like "I'm not vegan or vegetarian, blah, blah, I like steak or whatever..." Why are these people even reviewing a vegetarian restaurant if it's not their thing? Why are they even going to this place if they'd rather be stuffing their fat faces at McDonalds?? I know a lot of non-vegetarians that love this place, but maybe it's because they aren't going there expecting to get a steak. I wouldn't go eat at an Indian restaurant if I hated Indian food, and then go on Yelp and talk about how I totally despised the food because it was, well...Indian. This place has been the same vegetarian restaurant, in the same location, with the same owners for over 25 years...and they get busier and busier every year. That says a lot right there. I have travelled all over the U.S., and eaten a lot of vegan food over the years and The Chicago Diner is still my all time, hands down, absolute FAVORITE restaurant! And yes, vegans and vegetarians like to eat things that resemble the real thing sometimes. We didn't all chose this lifestyle because we just can't get enough salad. Some of us chose to live this way for ethical reasons, but that doesn't mean we don't miss all that comfort food we grew up eating. It's wonderful to have a place like this for exactly that reason, comfort..... i say f*%k a salad, I want a Chicago Diner philly cheesesteak! Vegetarian or not, do your tummy a favor and EAT HERE!!!!
