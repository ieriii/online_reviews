So I took my girlfriend here for Sweetest Day (shuttup, I like these Hallmark Holidays). She always wanted to go because she is a Food Network addict and one of the chef's loved the pork rinds here. Pork Rinds eh? Being Filipino and hearing my dad chomp on these heartattacks-in-a-bag made me curious, "How gourmet can pork rinds really be?" Also, we heard there was always a 3 month RSVP Waiting list. Eh? So she had no idea we were going there. No signage, no big ass logos to claim "THE PUBLICAN". We entered and she saw an article hanging no the wall and finally knew where she was and she was in shock. We entered the dining area and it was amazing, loud, and very communal. People were sitting on long benches close to each other. Pig paintings everywhere. Dimly lit. The waiters had cool hip flannel uniforms - they were very friendly too. We ordered the pork rinds, mussels, pork belly, and had some bread. Delicious stuff. If you're hungry, you won't really get full here, but if you're a flavor nut - go here. I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly but the mussels and the pork rinds were actually fun and pretty darn tasty. The price wasn't bad either. I was expecting to shelve out $200+. I think our dinner tabs are getting less expensive. My girlfriend tells me that it's because I don't order alcohol anymore. She's so smart and I'm so....balllllllin!
