My man and I live just a block away and are fixtures here and I have always said that the Nueske Ham sandwich would probably be on the short list of my all time favorite foods. After last night-I need to make room for another. The chef has changed up the menu a bit-don't worry, the ham sandwich is still on the menu, but there are some new items for fall-one of which I tried-was the vegetarian entree-the squash wellington-Squash wrapped in a delicious pastry and AMAZING sauce with a side of brussels sprouts. This was hands down the best meal that I have ever had at Hopleaf. Just unbelievable. Now I have yet another reason to go back to this place.!!! A++++++ Everything is just done right here!
