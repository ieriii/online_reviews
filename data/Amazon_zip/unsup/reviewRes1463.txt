I've been coming to Hot Doug's for about two years now and I've never been disappointed. Sausages and hot dogs seem to be a pretty consistent item and Doug is almost always at the counter so they run a tight ship. I think this isn't so much a hot dog place as it is a sausage joint and no one else does that here in Chicago. Selling polish sausage as well as hot dogs doesn't count either. They have the standard chicago dog which is pretty good but I've had equally good dogs at Byron's and Portillos. However their thuringer and andouille is a constant staple for me. The thuringer alone is a meal in itself because of its size, flavor and nap-inducing greasiness (I mean that in a good way). I made the bold move once of ordering the standard dog, the thuringer and an order of duck fat fries. If you've ever seen the "itis" episode of Boondocks then you'll know what I'm talking about when I say i definitely had the itis after that particular lunch. I struggled to stay awake on the drive home and barely made it to my bed twenty minutes later for a good long nap. I've never had the game of the week sausages because of the price (usually $6-8) but its good to know they're available.
