We have been to Geja's several times and it is always a wonderful time. The food is excellent, the service the same. The entire staff is helpful in explaining the menu items and how to cook each of the courses. The waitstaff makes sure you have everything you need without making you feel rushed. Drinks are replenished as needed without having to look for staff. It is a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion, or just enjoy a dinner with friends or family. Because it is a small restaurant, I would recommend going early (we had reservations for 5:30). We were seated promptly and the restaurant was relatively quiet.
