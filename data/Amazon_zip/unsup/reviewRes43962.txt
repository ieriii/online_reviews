I came here for restaurant week...but after seeing all of the different cuts available..we went rouge. I went with the 24 oz porter house steak w a side of au jus sauce. It was delicious! For an appetizer we had the fried calamari which was solid. For dessert i had the Pistachio ice cream sandwich which the waiter described as f@cking good. He did not lie...it was one of the best desserts I've had. Anyhoo...the service was great, and so was the food. I highly recommend Kinzie Chop house.
