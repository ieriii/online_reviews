I have had many lovely meals at Anteprima---a wonderful spot for special occasions of any kind. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the food is unique and always delicious. They always highlight fresh ingredients and have an interesting specials roster every day. From the homey and intimate decor to the menu where every item is a good choice, this is one restaurant that never disappoints.
