Wow. Start to finish wow. The menu was creative. Its broken down into 4 sections of gastronomic girth, light fare to full dinner. This allowed us to try several items. The fondue was spectacular with bread. The fried zucchini was a nice take on veggies. The soup special-simple and elegant. It was the Pork chop that stole the show. Lightly breaded with bacon powder and beef cheeks with endives. Best pork chop I've ever had. Everything about the place had this perfect to a T finish. The waiter was very professional and walked us through the menu very ably. If you like to eat, this is a fantastic place. If you just need cheap sustenance, you might not appreciate this place.
