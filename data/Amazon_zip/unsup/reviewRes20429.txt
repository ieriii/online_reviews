Coast Sushi opened in 2003, and the food is a direct representation of its longevity. Consistency, consistency, consistency. Every time I go, I order the volcano and the white dragon maki and every time, I'm reminded of why Coast is my go-to sushi spot.  I'm sad to say, however, that the service has been slipping. Without asking, our server ran through the specials and opened our bottle of wine before our entire party had been seated. It was clear that he was simply just going through the motions. The lack of initial couth was one of many offenses throughout our meal. The problem, Mr. Spikey-Haired Server, is that there are a million flash-in-the-pan sushi joints just waiting to show you up. And in this case, they could achieve that with mere eye contact and a smile. A functioning brain would be a perk, of course.      My instinct is to continue going to Coast, but next time to offer on-the-spot critiques. The risk? Any proactive behavior carries the weighty concern of behind-the-scenes revenge.      Therefore, the new plan is to air my grievances with management on the way out. With so many unemployed people in Chicago, there's no dearth of available servers out there. Perhaps enough complaints will result in a few deserved pink slips. If anything, it will put a little power back into the diners hands.
