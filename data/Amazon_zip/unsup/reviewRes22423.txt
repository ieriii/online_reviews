I really hated to give this place 3 stars, but I felt I had to. First off, the food was bar-none delicious, no question there, but our service was a little bit lacking. We ordered egg rolls to tide us over, but the food took easily 30-40 minutes. I understand that the service is typically slower but for two people we didn't order anything too crazy and watched at least three groups of people come in after us and finish before we received our meal. However, back to the food! Wait aside, the food was excellent, and definitely worth waiting for. We tried the crab rangoon, and it came out hot and fresh, probably the best ragoon I've had in a good while. We also tried the garlic pork, cumin lamb, and the spicy pork. All were delicious and we had plenty of good leftovers to take home. The location is really clean and nice, but has very little room for waiting and doesn't take reservations under 6 people. If it's a busy night be prepared to bundle up as you might have to hang out in the cold for a bit.
