Shaw's is a steakhouse specializing in crab instead of beef. Like any good steakhouse, here you'll find top-of-the-line protein, good liquor, excellent service, huge portions, and astounding prices. I am not a glutton nor a carnivore and generally abhor steakhouses. Shaw's is a better choice for me, but if you prefer prime rib to king crab I might suggest one of Chicago's fine wood-paneled homages to the disassembled steer. I thoroughly enjoyed my martini and the service, in particular when the server fitted us each with a disposable bib. But I can't overlook that the food was merely decent. I ate some cheese bread, a caesar salad, and a seafood sampler plate. The first two items were fine, though not memorable and a bit too salty. The seafood plate was fresh food killed in a sea of butter. I didn't hate it, but I didn't finish it either. I suppose I should not have been shocked that the bill for 5 people ran to more than $600. My supper was about a half-share of the total. With the right visitors from out of town, on an expense account, I would return.
