Great food at dinner last night and excellent, friendly, well-informed service. The chef emphasizes locally-grown, seasonal products so the menu changes regularly. We ordered a mix of specials and staples from the menu; each was worthy of a return visit. Try the "Coffee and Donuts" for dessert. Hard to explain but worth a visit in itself. It's a lively place so ask to be seated in the back if you're planning on in-depth conversation but the energy and enthusiasm of guests and staff makes for a great evening.
