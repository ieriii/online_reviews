While most rave about their deep dish pizza here, the thin crust might be one of the best in Chicago. The Scene: 2 floors. Bottom floor is a bar type atmosphere...with a bar and tables close to each other. 2nd level more spread out. This place gets very crowded. expect to wait...possibly an hour at times. I have been seated right away during the week but the weekends can get very busy especially being right accross the street from Webster Place Movie theatre. Food: The thin crust pizza to me is one of the best in the city. Cracker thin type crust while the toppings are placed on top of the cheese to give a perfect char to them. They also have a deep dish pizza which many like as well. You will also find many appetizers and salads on the menu. They also have a good bar selection. Staff: Fairly attentive. Never really had a problem. Check this place out if you want a great pizza. Again, you will wait to be seated, and you will wait awhile to get your food. Check it out!
