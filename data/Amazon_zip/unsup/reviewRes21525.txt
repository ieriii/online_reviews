The food here was delicious. 5 of us went for dinner - so I tried a bit of everything. Seafood cocktail red and green - both delicious. Super light, flavorful. Guacamole was good, nothing spectacular, but solid, as were the salsas. I had the carnitas bowl, which was great. I also really enjoyed the Woodlands mushroom torta. Desserts - churros and soft serve w/ salted caramel were both amazing. I cannot wait to go back for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.
