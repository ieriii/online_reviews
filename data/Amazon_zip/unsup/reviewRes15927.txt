I had no idea this place existed but a friend raved about it and now I'm raving! From the outside the bar looks like an abandoned building, with Post No Bills painted on the drab wood doors, then you enter and long velvet curtains shield the bar from outside noise and create a feel of luxury. We got a nice intimate booth in the back. Luxury drinks with homemade syrups and ingredients are their specialty. I ordered the Daisy 17, whiskey, grenadine and the waitress squirted a flaming orange peel over the top. It was excellent. So many other drinks await my palate I can't wait to get back!
