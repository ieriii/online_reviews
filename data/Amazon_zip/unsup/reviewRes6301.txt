If I have one regret is that it took me so long to go to Wildfire. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. I appreciate the classic tunes that they play throughout the restaurant and their menu offerings are fantastic. I stopped by Wildfire last week due to a long work day and was very happy with my entire experience. Even dining alone, I felt very comfortable seated right in the middle of the restaurant and received excellent service. The waitstaff was very friendly and attention and their menu selection was very diverse in price and offerings. I will definitely be making return visits to Wildfire (and bring a date or friends next time to enjoy with me).
