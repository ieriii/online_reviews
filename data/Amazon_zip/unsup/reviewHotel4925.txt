Tea is a rip-off!Seating in the Palm Court is incredibly uncomfortable. Tiny sandwiches and pastries are mediocre and unmemorable. Water for tea is not hot so flavor of tea does not emerge in brewing. Basically $30 plus tax for a scone, a piece of banana bread, a couple of small bites of lackluster sandwich and pastry, and lukewarm tea. Just about the worst tea we've ever been to.
