I was so looking forward to this place, as I had heard so much about it. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. Maybe the mistake was ordering the 3 course meal instead of the nine, but that's not really an excuse as far as I'm concerned. There should not be a difference in quality depending on what size meal you order. The service was great and the presentation was fantastic, but the food was just OK and there was not enough of it. I am 5'4" and 120lbs and I could have used more food. And let me just comment on the dessert. Celery root cake? Seriously? It tasted pretty good for celery, but it was not the delicious dessert I was expecting. And it was beyond tiny. Bottom line: I will not be going back. The only saving grace is that it is BYOB so I didn't spend a whole lot on booze. I will stick with my favorite prix fixe BYOB in Logan Square (which I will not name) for a tastier, more filling, but just as beautiful meal.
