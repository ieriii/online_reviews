This is probably the fining dining experience I've ever had. From the moment you walk in, the entire staff is there to serve your every need. Tables are pulled out so you can easily sit down. The staff is more than willing to help you get to the bathroom while replacing your napkin...and that's before we even talk about the food! The sommelier had a fine list of recommendations that perfectly complimented their menu. The scallops, salmon and lamb were all out of this world not just in taste, but in presentation, too. I'd highly recommend the prix fixe menu. The selection and quantities were grea, not to mention the additional courses that came unannounced. With the quiet atmosphere of pure professionalism with the spectacular service, it would be tough to ask for a more perfect evening. From the welcome to the waiters who worked in perfect synchronization who were also more than happy to hail a cab for you, Tru provides an unforgettable dining experience if you're okay with paying a bit more for it.
