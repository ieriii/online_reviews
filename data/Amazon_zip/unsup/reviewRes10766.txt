I honestly don't think I've ever had as much sugar in one sitting as I did when I had a tower of Bongo Room French toast with chocolate sauce, chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and candied raspberries. It was super delicious, but my teeth literally were hurting and I started getting a headache less than halfway through; as a result, I didn't finish my meal. (As a reference point, I will pretty much mainline sugar so me not finishing was kind of a big deal.) For my future meals at Bongo Room, I'll talk my dining partner into splitting a savory dish and a sweet dish. Will also come armed with Advil.
