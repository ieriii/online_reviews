Came across a show on Food Channel yesterday talking about this place so decided to give it a try. I love spicy food so went with the suicide wings. Sauce was definitely on par on my heat index but the chicken was average at best. It was a bit over cooked making it drier than it should. When that happens, most of the juice from the chicken is gone and can't blend with that amazing sauce. Kinda like eating chicken jerky drowned with hot sauce. But looks like they have other interesting items on their menu. Will definitely give them another try next time to see if they deserve an improved rating
