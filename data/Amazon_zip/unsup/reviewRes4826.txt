Nice modern cuisine with small plates best shared. If you want a simple formula for how much to order, go with the following: Per 2 people= 3 cheese selection, 1 salad, 1 smear, 2 a la Plancha. That should leave you filled and happy. Cheeses: Went with the Delice de Bourgogne, Truffle Tremor, and Podda. The Delice is a French cow's milk cheese very similar to a soft bree. It's really rich and creamy and was an excellent choice as our soft yet flavorful cheese. The Truffle Tremor was my favorite. It's earthy yet absolutely smooth. Just a nice mix of truffle thrown into a goat milk cheese. Last but not least, we wanted a hard so we went with the Podda. Basically a straight up dry and Caramel-ly cheese. At the end of the meal, we were glad we had gotten the 3 cheese selection along with the dishes. Brussels Sprouts: I wasn't too excited about ordering this dish, but was glad we did. Basically the brussels sprouts were finely shaved(they probably used a Mandoline) and then pancetta cheese was mixed in with it. Pretty simple, yet flavorful dish. Ricotta & Pork Neck Gravy: This was probably my favorite dish. It's almost like a tomato marinara sauce mixed with a flavorful ricotta and really tender pork neck. I didn't know what to expect when it was under the "Smears" section, but was glad we went with this. If you've tried the marrow, go with this one the 2nd time through. Italian Sausage: This was supposedly the chef's sausage dish. It had a lot of flavor, as do most sausage dishes(considering fat content) but it wasn't really anything special for me. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: This was my second favorite and it seems to be a hit with almost everyone who comes through Purple Pig. It's basically a very tender braised pork shoulder paired with mashed potatoes. Honestly, i would have liked to see this dish with something not as starchy, but it's still really good. Maybe the chefs could pair this with some quinoa? Overall great meal. Would come back again.
