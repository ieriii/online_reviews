My review should be taken with a grain of salt. I've never actually eaten _IN_ the restaurant so I won't be talking about their service or staff with the exception of the hostess. Spacca Napoli is our Friday night special. It is almost to the point where I don't need to look at the menu for change. (hey when you find something that works why mess with it?) I probably should one of these days. In the event that they run out of an ingredient. Oh yeah. The pizza! It is "...out of this world..." good. For us lazy folk who can't wait 30 minutes for a seat our really good meal is served in less than fifteen. What you get is the Neopolitan style pizza which is a hit or miss for some (this being Chicago and home of the deep-dish) I have no intentions to start a pizza style war because there's enough bellies for them to co-exist in Chicago. Someday I will venture out of the comfort zone but now I'm afraid the service will have to live up to the food which is -lets face it- tough.
