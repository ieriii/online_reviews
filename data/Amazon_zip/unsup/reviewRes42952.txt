What a nice hidden gem. We are huge pizza lovers, and this definitely is towards the top. The dough isn't too thick and there's actually food on the topping and not just cheese. It is kind of hidden in the middle of nowhere, so we hadn't seen it before. The owners couldn't be nicer. PIzza was delicious. Garlic knots were to die for. We ordered 2 pizza's and took home leftovers. Just as good as leftovers. We will definitely be back to try more flavors.
