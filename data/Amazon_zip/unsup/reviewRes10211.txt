Three words: Rude delivery drivers. My friends and I ordered a pizza that came to us in about an hour and when we opened the box the pizza looked like it went through hell. I called immediately and asked for another pizza and they told me that it would take another hour. So we waited for the pizza and the delivery guy bangs on my door. I open it all cheerful, he hands me the pizza and asks me for a tip (rudely). I told him that I paid him tip for the last pizza (that wasn't even our fault that it was turned over) and he says, "Well maybe you should go to a cheaper place because you can't even tip the driver," and leaves. I will not be ordering pizza from Piece again. Rude. The second pizza wasn't worth the 2 hour wait.
