FRESH FRESH FRESH! This place is great for both lunch and dinner. The lunch special has so much bang for your buck! I had the Lemongrass Chicken which was chicken sauteed with FRESH peppers and jalapenos, served with fried rice, and a roll, also a small soup and salad, AND fresh squeezed lemonade (unlimited refills), AND a small plate with some fresh fruit (orange slices and pineapple) all for $9. The food was phenomenal, the chicken was all white meat, the green, red and yellow peppers were delicious, and the jalapeno gave the chicken just the right amount of kick. Dinner is still very reasonable. The Ginger Mahi Mahi is sent from the GODS! The cream cheese/avocado won ton is a great appetizer. We went with a large group and I sampled everyone's food, and everything was yummy. The Pineapple Tofu, and their Chicken Sandwich are also fabulous. The baguette the chicken sandwich is served on is so good, and the fresh cilantro with the juicy chicken make this excellent. Also BYOB, no cork fee! Also, Also they split the check any way you want it. They provide great friendly service!
