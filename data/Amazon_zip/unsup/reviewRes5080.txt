I was visiting a friend in Chicago and she said I had to come here. It was a good thing that my friend and I came early. This place gets packed REALLY fast. Even though we had an early dinner we still ended up sitting at the big table (it's a huge table, counter height, that you share with other customers). The cauliflower, deviled eggs, roasted bone marrow smear, milk braised pork shoulder, and affagato (their cinnamon soft serve with espresso) were all amazing!  Their butternut squash and sicilian iris were good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. AND I loved our waiter, Lukasz...very hospitable. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I will definitely return. Yum-my!
