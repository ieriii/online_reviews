this place is great...but i guess next door is better...the restaurant is very nice 1 star for that but i just felt bad for the server coz she only one tackling all the tables... i know how it is when there's only one you and you have to deal with more than 30 customers...so i have nothing against the service...however, food wise, it's not bad but maybe just coz i tried some other thai restaurant i wasnt too excited about the taste at all... maybe if i pick something else next time i will give them 4 stars or even 5 stars, maybe i didnt like what i ordered ...i will give it another try...ill say next week.
