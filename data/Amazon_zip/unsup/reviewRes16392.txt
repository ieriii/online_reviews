Extensive menu, decent parking, great ambiance and at a great price for the location. Plus, I can't give it a bad review; my fiance has fallen into a deep, profound love for the place. Last time we were there: We started off with two orders of naan with a bowl of Tamatar Ka Shorba, which is essentially the best tomato soup you will ever have. Dip your naan in it, go ahead - it will blow your mind. We had the lamb rogan josh and the mixed tandoori grill plate - both were delicious, and there was enough leftover for a meal to take home.
