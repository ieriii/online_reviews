we got the 10 piece chicken wings with seoul sassy and crisp BBQ sauce and some fries and a drink. the wings are HUGE and realllly tender and juicy i was kind of surprised cuz it said they dont use any GM chickens and dont GM chickens usually taste more tender?? cuz theyre fat. anyway, both the sauces were super good i couldnt pick which one i liked more. i dont usually eat too much of the skin when i eat fried chicken but it was just so super good i couldnt help it i ate like all of it. im pretty sure my arteries are now coated in a layer of cholesterol now though. the fries were pretty good too but i think maybe its just cuz i havent had fries in awhile. there was barely any seating and instead of napkins they just put out rolls of paper towels which is super ghetto but whatever. they have a bathroom but its only one so you cant just go wash your hands at any point you have to kinda just use their cheap paper towels to try to degrease your hands.
