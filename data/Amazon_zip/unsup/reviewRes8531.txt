I thought the pizza here was really delicious! We had a group of about 11 and had to wait a little while for a table, but the wait wasnt too bad. To make up for the wait, they offered us a complimentary pizza. It was a mushroom pizza that was fantastic! I shared the Prosciutto e Rucola which was really fresh and full of flavor. The prosciutto was a little too salty for my taste though. Next time I'll choose something without prosciutto. I'm usually a thin crust kinda gal but the pizza dough here was so fresh and airy. I really liked it. Overall the experience here was great. The servers were great as well.
