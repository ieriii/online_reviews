If I told you that your Bonsoireee tasting menu would contain: geoduck (Google it), smelt, tripe and cashew cheese...I think you might be running for the door like we should have. Instead we got suckered into a tasting menu because we wanted to try the restaurant under the new ownership. Unfortunately it was a total dud for us, and we will not be going back. I am willing to try just about any type of food if it tastes good, but the bizarre ingredients selected by the chefs really missed the mark. To make matters worse, we did the wine pairing and it was just as bad. At least four times the waiter apologized for the food or wine stating "yeah, it's not for everyone". I didn't finish two wine tastings because they were bad, and this comes from a lush! :) The sake pairing was flat out awful. The worst sin of all regarding the wine pairings was they had some of the smallest pours we've ever had at a restaurant. Not cool. There were a few highlights, including "thai style" ember roasted carrots, the aged muscovy duck and foie gras semifreddo but these weren't enough to carry the meal for us. One last lowlight. When we left the restaurant we were trying to grab a taxi but the location is a little off the beaten path so there were not too many taxis going by. We would have expected the restaurant to offer to call one for us but no luck. Just then one of the wait staff came running out of the restaurant and we *thought* he was going to say he had called us a cab. Instead he handed us an invite for an art show at the restaurant. Uh no thanks! #servicefail
