This place is fantastic. It's a small place inside but in the summer the owner told me he has table's and chairs outside. I decided to try the Cubano sandwich, which is ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickles, mustard served on white bread. It is pressed and served hot. When I took the first bite of my sandwich I was blown away. The blend of the different meats with the cheese and pickles was great. There was so much flavor to the sandwich I couldn't but it down. The owner probably thought this was my last meal before the electric chair. Plantain chips accompanied the sandwich which were very good. I treated myself with a early Xmas gift and ordered a strawberry tropical shake. This too did not disappoint, great flavor. This place has a very laid back feel to it. The music that was playing only added to the enjoyment that was had. This was my first time experiencing any type of Cuban food, it definitely will not be my last either. I am looking forward to my next visit.
