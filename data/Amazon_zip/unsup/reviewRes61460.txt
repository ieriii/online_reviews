Yes, one of my favourite places on Devon. Best thing, it opens till 5:00 and sometime 6:00 AM. Very simple decor. I tried this place when it was first open on western by Devon and loved their Tawa dishes. Chicken Tawa, Beef Tawa, Chicken Tawa Rice. Very reasoanable prices, food is real authentic and flavorful. Be prepared to have some spicy food.
