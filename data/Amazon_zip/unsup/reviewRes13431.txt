Oustanding hand-pulled ales, especially the Golden they were pouring this past weekend. The pulled-pork / cheeseburger combo is evil - I leave swearing I won't get another, I get there and cannot think to order anything else. The Spanish mussels were outstanding. More bread was needed to sop up the juices. And I always get a growler to go for my brother...
