Fantastic food. Definitely try the squash ravioli - it was to die for! Tiramisu was also HUGE (size of my face, literally) - could barely finish half a piece. Service was excellent. They accidentally dropped my take-home order so they cooked up a new half order for me! Amazing!! A little hard to get to if coming from the Loop, but worth the trip.
