holy hell this restaurant is amazing! The food is excellent, the service is great, the atmosphere is relaxing and upbeat, the waitstaff is courteous, well versed in the menu, and fun.  The first time I ate at Bonsoiree, I was a little anxious that the prices would break my pocketbook, but No! It was a Wednesday, and my friend and I both got a 3 course prix fix for $25 bucks apiece. The duck comfit over parmesan risotto was fantastic and was exactly as you'd want it--it had the most perfect crispness to the skin and exact degree of richness without feeling fatty or like too much.  The second time I went I had the skatefish with cactus fronds and holy hell again; I had NO idea what to expect but left soooo satisfied. Plus the deserts are almost beyond imagination Try the chocolate hazelnut mousse dome, OMG! I go more during the weekday versus weekend, as it is a small space and reservations for weekends are muy muy hard to get. So if you want a weekend date, plan ahead and call for reservations a few days in advance.(That should be obvious for any popular intimate restaurant, I think). On the weekdays, you can step in without too much work. They are very accomodating.
