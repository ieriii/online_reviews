Ugh! I don't Get how people say this place is great! well, this summer i went to superdawg with my fiance, we got a cheeseburger and the "orginal" superdawg. When I bit into the cheeseburger it was awful! it was so dry and nasty! I don't find whats so special about this place the hotdogs taste no different then the ones i get in the store.and also the radish taste like S***! I personally think this place sucks!-thats just my opinion.
