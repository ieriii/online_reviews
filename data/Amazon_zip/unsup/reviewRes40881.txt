The tacos here are absolutely amazing! There are three locations all right next to or across the street from each other so, depending on the time depends on which one is open. The food is cheap and so tasty. We had the carne asada, chicken, barbacoa, and chorizo tacos and all of them were fantastic. Wouldn't necessarily recommend the chorizo as enthusiastically because it was ground (we were expected chopped) with wayyyyy too much paprika but that could have been an accident - we will maybe try those again one more time. The other tacos and burritos were delicious and are served with onions and cilantro on top - nothing fancy, just authentic and flavorful. I will highly highly recommend!
