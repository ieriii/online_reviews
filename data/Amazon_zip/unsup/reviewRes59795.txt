"Arties" as me and my friends call it, is one of the best pizza places in chicago. The crust is always buttery and great. The sauce is really good too. I've never had anything other then pizza at Arties, but I would be willing to try something else. It's just too hard for me not to order the pizza every time!Ive eaten there and delivery and both staffs are nice.
