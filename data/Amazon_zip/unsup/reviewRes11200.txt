Everyone I know who's been here highly recommends it! I tried piece for the first time this week and this is now my favorite pizza place in the city. They have the elusive white pizza plus a plethora of topping to choose from. The pizza is thin crust and HUGE. Ours had a strong garlic flavor and was so good I already want to go back for more! Pizza came out fast and the staff was friendly, but we went on a Sunday, and I could see how this place could get packed on Friday, Saturdays, or game days. If you haven't tried this place GO!
