I just ate at Garcias before catching a movie a few blocks down. My first impression was that it was a quaint little Mexican restaurant, however it all went downhill from there. First, there was the cheesy Enrique songs playing over and over. Second, the chips that we were served were stale and definately sub-par for a Mexican restaurant. Third, I ordered the two-taco dinner with Rice and Beans and received tostadas instead and they forgot my rice and beans. The waitress was very polite when I explained the mistake, however this did not make up for the fact that I only had 10 min. to eat once my rice and beans were brought out because I didn't want to miss my movie. My boyfriend ordered the burrito with Ranchero Sauce. It was HUGE and could definately be split in half. The Ranchero Sauce and cheese that it was smothered in was the best part. Overall, the restaurant is a cheap eat but there is definately more authentic Mexican restaurants around.
