This is now my favorite Indian restaurant downtown.  The lunch buffet was incredible, though a little pricey so it gets only 4 stars. This blows the other buffets out of the water.  So many choices, all of them delicious. And then they surprise us with some tandoori chicken hot and steaming right at our table.  We went to lunch kind of late. 1:30 PM or so. So at most buffets you might expect stuff that's been sitting around a bit to long like some naan maybe that was made hours ago and just microwaved and some lukewarm dishes in chafing dishes. But not this place. The naan came out freshly baked, and the food was hot (temperature), fresh, and soooo good!
