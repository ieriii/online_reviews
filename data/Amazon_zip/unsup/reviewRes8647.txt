I've never been to Italy, but if this is what pizza is really like there I'll go. The owner was handing out pices of fresh provolone to the folks waiting. It was a 45 minute wait for a quick bake, but so what? They are kid friendly and families came as well. Our salad was tasty, and large enough to split with some of the freshest green olives I'd ever tasted and a mildly sweet balsamic vinaigrette. Our pizzas were just as good, and our waiter friendly. I would go back.
