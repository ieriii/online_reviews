if you don't want to wait (no reservations) go for brunch! get there when it opens. lots of foodies and crazy people waiting outside. we tried going to xoco but they stopped serving "savory foods" so we went to frontera instead. you will not be disappointed. the drinks are small and expensive but we got the hot chocolate - yum!
