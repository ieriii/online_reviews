A couple of things before I review. My boyfriend's dad is from Cuba so naturally we like to check things like this out. He's been to the other location before. He is already a fan. Also we came here with a big group. It was a birthday party and we were having cocktails before dinner. That said there was a bit of a wait before we were seated. That kind of bums me out when you have a reservation. BUT its BYOB and they have that area in the back to hang out and wait. Plus it was Saturday night so they're forgiven. This place is HUGE. I mean I thought it was just a few tables but it just keeps going and going. We were seated at a big table. I think there were 11 of us total. They were great with waters and the easiest was to order just a bunch of stuff for sharing. Then it was a parade of deliciousness. Empanadas, tamales, shrimp things, fried things. All yummy! I'd had the guava & cheese combo before but this place does it really well!! They were good sports for 11 people. We had a total blast and no one left hungry. I can't wait to go back on a smaller scale with just my Cuban boyfriend.
