Nana is not just for brunch anymore! This Bridgeport organic restaurant is also serving dinner. Street parking and no waits on a weekend are a very good thing and probably won't last for long before the word gets out. As much as I LOVE Nana for brunch, dinner service still needs some work... Small kinks but they were definitely noticed at dinner - room temperature tap water on a warm night doesn't go down so well. Ice is nice! Bread is also good. You don't need something special...just a small loaf that is cut into thick slices (sandwich bread also doesn't need to be on the table after noon). The food was delicious and fresh, just as you'd expect. I loved my chilled beet (borscht) soup as well as the roasted chicken. I'll be back soon but I think I'll wait a bit longer to head back for dinner after they've got things running smoothly. Knowing the folks at Nana that won't be too long. For now dinner is BYOB too.
