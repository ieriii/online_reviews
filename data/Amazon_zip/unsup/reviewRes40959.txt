In my 49 years of life and my travels across this great planet, I'm so thrilled to know that the very BEST Burritos in the World are at La Pasadita, here in my hometown of Chicago. Their secret marinade sauce for their steaks are incredible and one of the toughest rides in the city is when you drive by their place on Ashland. They surround you with two on one side and another on the opposite side. A clever tactic that smothers you with the smell of char grilled meat as you pass by causing you to swerve your car and find a parking spot, so you can chow down at their place. The Chile Rellenos (stuff peppers) are mouth watering and man.. writing about this is getting me hungry. I think I'll stop by the new La Pasadita, that was setup a few blocks from my house! Curse Them!!!
