Once again.....love my Rick Bayless. Food is SOOOOO good! Know that this place gets insanely busy and you might be waiting for awhile. Also note that ever since he won Top Chef masters that tools from out-of-town like to congregate here and do things like "take pictures of the menu". All that aside, if you can ignore that, this place is golden:)
