I guess you can't judge a book bye its cover. If you see the sign above the restaurant, you'd think this was one of the 1000's of generic quick serve burrito joints. I can't imagine this sign has been updated since the 70's. But it is indeed a nice little dark lit, sitdown and relax type of restaurant. I absolutely agree with most and say the service is excellent. Very friendly and attentive staff. The menu also has a pretty good variety of food. I was thoroughly impressed with the food, just maybe a little disappointed that the mole was a little bland for me. The chips were pretty average, not served very warm as I would have expected. Overall though, definitely up there as far as Mexican food in the city goes.
