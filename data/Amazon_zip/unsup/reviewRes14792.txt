Incredible, reasonably priced beers. Wonderful burgers. Great ambiance. It does get very busy here... but its worth the wait. Not really into the bacon fat popcorn but I haven't liked it anywhere I have tried it. As far as breweries in Chicago go, this is surely one of the best- their bottoms up wit is my favorite regular beer here. Tastes as fresh as it is.
