The first time my dad took me here I saw a bunch of people waiting outside a line and first thought that came to my mind was "Why is my dad taking me to an unemployment agency?" But then I realized the people I saw looked pretty well off and a bunch of yuppies. I LOVE Hot Dougs. I look forward to every week when I do laundry because my dad comes back to the laundromat with something from Hot Dougs in hand. I have yet to try their duck fat fries (my dad always goes on Thursdays so I always miss the days they have it) and their special games (I've been too scared to try them but I will soon!). I'm already salivating just writing this. My boyfriend thinks it's overrated and my mom is not much for hot dogs so this place is me and my dad's special place. If you live in Chicago and has never been to Hot Dougs, you are seriously missing out.
