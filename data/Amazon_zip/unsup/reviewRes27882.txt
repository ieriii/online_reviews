I went to Graham Elliot yesterday for my anniversary and am still conflicted about how to rate it. The food is excellent. We had the scallops and the tuna for appetizers, the lamb and the ahi were our main courses and we finished it off with the chocolate ganache. Graham Elliot's problem is not the food but the lack of it on the plate. What is up with the tiny, pretentious portions??? I am a small woman - I really don't need a lot of food, but Graham Elliot took the modern dieting trend to the next level. I can't say I was hungry at the end, but three courses and $150 later I didn't expect to even have to consider being hungry. It reminded me of a "Friends" episode when Phoebe says (with a British accent) "I ordered the salmon appetizers, but I can't see it, I can't see it!"
