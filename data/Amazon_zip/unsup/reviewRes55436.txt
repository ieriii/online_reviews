Really bad service! Our waiter was condescending and extremely awkward. Will probably not return just based on the service (that's how bad he was).  My cousin loved her meal (lamb) and my truffle quiche was just so-so. The Lithuanian bacon biscuits were interesting, I like the taste but the texture of the biscuit was a little off. Loved the decor!
