A place like Hop Leaf speaks for itself in the amount of people who review it. A LOT of people know this place, and A LOT of people could be here at any given point. It's because it's a really fun place to go.  The beer selection here is daunting. You can get anything from a basic brew to something that comes in a special glass that looks like a beaker and is held up by a wooden holder (quak is good stuff). There's really nothing like this places beer menu, and they present it in the most casual of way, you will not get that snob feel from. The food? The food is awesome. Get the muscles, get two things of muscles with the frites that come with and go home happy. That with a couple beers is a meal! If you're of the type to want a full course, go with anything. It's all fresh, filling and comfort good. From the Duck Reuban to the Sausage platter. Sausage platter's mustards are deeeeelicious! You get the vibe here of a real Belgium bar but with that lovely American touch. I wish this place was closer and that if you get there at 7 you got a hour or more wait, but it's always worth the time and travel. If you're lucky, you can get a table upfront, but if you want the dining room, I've waited over an hour to sit. I really do love this place, as it makes you just feel good. Better with a group of 6 or less, Hop Leaf is an excellent bar/restaurant.
