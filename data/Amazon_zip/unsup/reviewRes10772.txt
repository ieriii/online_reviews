I've been to Bongo Room a few times. My boyfriend and I went on Sunday just before they opened. The line had already formed on the sidewalk. Luckily we didn't have to wait long. Service is a little slow (granted they had just opened and the restaurant was filled within 10 minutes so I will be a little forgiving). They have a very interesting menu and some day I will have to go here when I'm craving something sweet. Their pancakes and french toast look (and smell) amazing but I have always gotten something savory. My biggest criticism is that everything is overpriced. My smallest criticism is the little bowls filled with crappy ultra-pasteurized creamers on every table. It just doesn't match the quality of the food. That's something you see at crappy diners. How hard would it be for them to give customers a small container of cold, fresh cream with their coffee?
