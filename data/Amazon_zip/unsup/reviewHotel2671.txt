I stayed here for a night and had a terrific experience. Upon arriving, the doorman and bellhop immediately made us feel like we were in store for something special. They were friendly, talkative, and didn't try and rush us out of traffic. Our car was whisked away and we were 'welcomed to the James'. Valet: Free in and out privileges - although we walked and cabbed it everywhere that weekend. The lobby is modern yet calm. (Turned into a hopping night spot later on.) There were problems when we were checking in. We didn't know if our room was under my boyfriend's name, the promoter's name, or his agent's name. The girl working the front desk was very patient with us and we got to the bottom of it. Whoo HOO! Free room upgrade because 'ours' wasn't ready yet. I don't quite get that, but I'm not complaining. Side note: I love the luggage display by the elevators.  The rooms are fairly minimal but extremely comfortable. We had a problem with the shower drain not draining. Called the front desk. POOF! Someone knocked on the door about 5 minutes later, did his business (not THAT business), and our shower was fixed. Bonus stars for the Kiehls bath products! We were suppose to go for dinner with the group, but everyone else had jet-lag. Dinner cancelled. We opted for room service. Why leave the quiet luxury of this room if we didn't have to? I got the cob salad. YUM! And HUGE. We could have split it. Room service delivered quickly - food came about 20 minutes after we called. I didn't even have time to realize that they had forgotten our 2 ice waters when POOF! again. Someone knocking at the door. After a long night out, it was a welcome treat to return to my little abode.  And HOORAY for late check out! We lazed around in our bed fit for a king, ordered more room service, and left around 4PM. I would recommend The James to anyone.
