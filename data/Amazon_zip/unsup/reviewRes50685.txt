Yummy (pretty much)! I've got family in Texas and have been visiting there yearly since the day I was born. I remember those breakfasts as a kid as I certainly don't get them here. Texas supposedly does everything big, especially BBQ and southern breakfasts. This reminds me of that every time I come here as this establishment specializes in Souther cuisine. Today I came by for a hearty breakfast. It's got that southern hospitality feel to it and based on the quick glances of my surrounding tables, everyone was getting their South on. Grits, Cheese Grits, biscuits, gravy, bacon, Jambalaya omelettes, Southern benedict. etc. Of course it isn't as good as your grandmother's cooking, but this is the closest you'll get all the way up here. I don't make it here often, like I do Southport Grocery, but it's a nice spot to visit bi-annually. The staff is prompt, polite, and friendly, & they have impeccable timing too. On another note, the couple to our right was going on and on about Sarah Palin's new opportunity on Fox News. For 90 minutes today I was in a Red State. Too bad the Red State weather wasn't waiting for me when I walked out. Come to Wishbone for a nice change of pace from the everyday. Then go straight home and take a nap. That's a four hour package that no one can resist and you'll thank me for the suggestion afterward, I promise.
