I've come to Chicago the past four summers. Each year I make it a point to eat proper deep dish pizza at least twice while here. This year, it was Gino's turn. I have to say, it was the worst of the lot. Not awful pizza, just not as good as elsewhere. My wife and I had the cheese and sausage. Simple. The sausage was good, nice taste of fennel. Sauce was a bit too acidic though. Too much of a bite that really didn't compliment the sausage and cheese. But what troubled me most was the crust. It was too mealy. I applaud the idea of adding corn meal into the crust, but it wasn't a help to the pie.
