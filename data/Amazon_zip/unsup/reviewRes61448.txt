I love the seafood noodle soup and lau thai hotpot from here. I love the fact that it is open late and they have good vietnamese food. The springolls are fresh and the duck rolls are yummy as well. This place is very convenient for me because it is near the area I reside in. The staff is friendly and attentive as well. It is a great place if you are craving pho or vietnamese food around the Rogers Park/ Lincoln Square area.
