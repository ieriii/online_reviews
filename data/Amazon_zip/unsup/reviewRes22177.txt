Unfortunately, the more often I eaten here the less I have liked Lao Sze. On the first visit a few months ago, our dishes were delicious. However, with every delivery (or visit) we've found that each new dish we try is less appealing than the last. Lots are just unimpressive and the only reliable superstar has been the Ma Po Tofu. Overall, it's time to try another restaurant in Chinatown.  Also, table service is frustrating sometimes - servers go MIA often and communication can be tough. Sorry guys.
