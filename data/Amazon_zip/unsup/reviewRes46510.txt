RJ Grunts you have never let me or most likely anyone down. It seems like every time I have had been at RJ's I have heard Santana's "Black Magic Women." Which is cool because that is back when Santana didn't make songs with overrated musicians. The salad bar is by far the best one I have ever experienced. One time at Ruby Tuesdays I saw a women sneeze right into the garbanzo beans. GROSS! I tried both the cream of spinach and the mushroom barley and they were really tasty. I also had their buffalo wings which I prob would skip and just continue with their amazing chicken tenders. Also, their burgers are awesome. 5 Stars for the salad bar and the great service with a smile!
