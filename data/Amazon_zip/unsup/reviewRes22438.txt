Taste: 5 Value: 5 Service: 4 Situated in Chinatown, this place has great authentic Chinese food. We went there on a weeknight and they were almost near capacity. I could easily see it being packed on a Friday or Saturday night. We had the Mapo Tofu, green beans, garlic spinach, and whole steamed fish. If you're going to get the fish, let them know early. It takes 15-20 minutes to prepare. All the dishes were fantastic. They had piles of spinach and green beans. The Mapo Tofu is authentic (has some numbing feeling). And the fish was cooked to perfection. The bill was reasonable, and the waiter did well by recommending a different style of preparation on the fish. I look forward to my next trip here with friends to enjoy a delicious Chinese meal.
