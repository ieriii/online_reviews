I can appreciate Xoco because after beginning culinary training in my youth, and hosting a 26-part PBS series called 'Cooking Mexican' in the seventies, I dedicated over six years to culinary research in Mexico, culminating with the publication of my 'Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico'.** Wait... I didn't do those things. Rick Bayless did. And thank goodness for that, because it allowed the confluence of events that yielded Xoco's opening last year. And that allowed me to experience the Ahogada sandwich. "Ahogada" literally means "drowned." Yes, my wood-grilled pulled pork sandwich was fantastically seasoned and fired to crunchy delicious perfection but it was also cut in half, with the middle ends "drowned" in a shallow bowl of a thick tomato-based spicy salsa. The sandwich halves pointed up like twin obelisks, and when the item was served to me, everybody nearby in the restaurant looked on with awe at how fantastic the sandwich looked and the presentation was. I have only had this sandwich once (so far) but it is rapidly contending to join the list of my top 10 favorite sandwiches ever. In addition, the guacamole at Xoco is fantastic, as well as liberally peppered with chiles. The cubano sandwich is solid, if not awe-inspiring. It is also worth noting that they've got about six different kinds of "hot chocolate," including one I found to be an amazing novelty that was mixed with ancho chiles. Hot chocolate with a bite! Yes, it works. Xoco has quite clearly considered every aspect of its service and cuisine. The dining experience is full of individual flair and makes you feel intrigued at every step forward. I have rarely experienced this much of a "wow factor" at a place that was under $15 per person for a full meal. **synopsized from wikipedia
