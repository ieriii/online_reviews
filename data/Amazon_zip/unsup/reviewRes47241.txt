I've never been to Kuma's and we were excited to go. Called Kuma's and they wouldn't quote a wait time over the phone (annoying), but hinted that it was well over an hour. We went to Kuma's and it turns out the wait was over 3 hours. Ridiculous and ridiculous that they couldn't tell us over the phone. Menu looks awesome. Tons of ridiculous burger combinations to try. Plus Mac and Cheese? Holy crap! So what if it's kind of a Kuma's clone. We sat down immediately, no wait and the staff was awesome. Rammstein was blaring and they were playing an entertaining concert DVD on half the TVs and sports on the rest. I hate metal, but it all worked really, really well. Got the Jailhouse Rock (Bananas, Peanut Butter, Bacon) and was a bit nervous. Bananas on a burger? Opted for Mac and Cheese as a side (would it be on par with Schubas?) and also got fries. Burger - Thick, juicy, awesome. The banana and peanut butter with the back was mindblowing. I immediately decided I needed to come back again after the first bite. Fries - soft, thick, but not steak fry thick. Phenomenal. The mustard sauce they serve with them is amazing too. Mac and Cheese - great as a side, but not as good as Schubas. If I'd gotten it as an entree instead of a burger, I'd be pissed. In the future I think I might just get fries as a side, though both fries and mac and cheese was an absurdly awesome treat. One day I will hit up Kuma's, but seriously, I can't imagine it being SOOOOO much better than Lockdown that it justifies having to dedicate an afternoon or entire evening to getting a table. Lockdown is freaking awesome. I will be back soon.
