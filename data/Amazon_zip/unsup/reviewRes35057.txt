This is the seafood restaurant you go to if you like for people to remember your order and share with you the best items on the menu based on YOUR pallet. That what makes Shaw's near and dear to my heart. The service is wonderful...the food superb every visit. They have the consistency thing down pack! Oh and did I mention live music in the cafe area of the restaurant?! It's just a good feel.
