Before writing this review, I read many of the one here under and I wonder if I went to the same place. I check the address again and it is. I am really disappointed from my experience yesterday night. I'm not a fan of the small menu of this place (I already had a bad experience at the Bryn Mawr one:. 6 pastas and 6 main courses, most of them are very similar, so or you like it or you like it). The best part are probably the appetizers. We had a late reservation and we were put in the worse possible table, between the kitchen door and the back door that was constantly opened, with freezing air coming in, but this is not the real problem. We were rushed by our waiter that probably had better things to do, since he kicked out a 4 people table and a 2 people table that came after us and left before us (we left just after 11, not that late). My real disappointment was my "pesce alla livornese", that is a delicious recipe, simple but tasty with olive oil, crushed tomatoes, capers, garlic, olives, olive oil and something else. It was a long time I didn't have this dish, so I ordered it, thinking that since they have such a small menu, they are pretty good at that. They brought me a tilapia with a lot of onions on top and a mild sauce similar to a vodka sauce all around. I really can't believe it. I was hungry and I was just enjoying the nice company of friends that I didn't see for the whole winter, so I let go. They were ok (not happy) with their food, so I didn't care much. The dessert was pushed quickly and I hate when the check is dropped on the table while I'm still sipping my espresso or still having the dessert. I'll probably get back since it's an easy place to go and many of the people I know think they have good Italian food, but I won't make it a suggestion.
