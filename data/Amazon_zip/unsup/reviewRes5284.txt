First, I must admit something. Over the last two weeks I've realized that I've been doing my Yelp reviews on a somewhat random scale, so I've started using something called the Burrito Calibration. Meaning, how many Chipotle burritos is this worth to me? Due to this recalibration, Purple Pig gets 3 stars. The food was decent for something that sits between two tourist traps, but the horrifying service I received the second time around left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth (figuratively speaking, of course). Visit 1: With friend J, 9 pm on a Friday Cold March day, 20 minute wait, promptly seated inside on one of their big communal tables. Had a few plates, none of which were particularly awe-inspiring but were definitely inventive (like the pig's ear). Marrow was not that much better than my mother's (why, I am Chinese, thanks for asking). Cozy atmosphere and great service more than made up for the slight let-down in food. Visit 2: With friend M, 5 pm on a Sunday Cold September day, told that there was a 45 minute wait for indoor seating, so we chose to sit outside. Food was ho-hum again. I had the white bait this time which just tasted like a blander version of calamari. The neck gravy, I'll admit, was better than average. But that didn't save the whole experience of me freezing slowly from waist down due to the fact that the server took THIRTY MINUTES to bring us a check. At the end we had to flag down the busboy as he was clearing our plates.
