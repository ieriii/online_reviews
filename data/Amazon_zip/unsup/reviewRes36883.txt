I've never been here when it wasn't crowded and once you eat here you'll know why. I've tried the red velvet pancakes and a skillet with chorizo sausage and avocado and they were great. An added touch is that when they are extremely crowded they offer complimentary coffee that is very good. They serve a special maple syrup that is a little skimpy for my liking but it tastes really good.
