Let me start by saying: "I don't do buffets" My other half, on the other hand, LIVES for a buffet. We walked in and his eyes lit up - he said "this might be the best idea you've ever had!"  ZED451 was perfect. This is not a buffet, this is a dining experience. You get to try a much or as little of everything as you want - AND we got picked up at our hotel! The shuttle driver also informed us he could take us somewhere else after brunch! If you're not a meat eater - the harvest tables will keep you happy - you might be disappointed by the chef selections...meat eaters, read on!  My best advice is to take it easy with the harvest tables to begin - you can always go back later! We went through together to "Divide and Conquer" so to speak. We also skipped the fruit (a first for me) - since you can get that anywhere.  The Pannetone french toast and brussels sprout caesar salad stood out from the Harvest Tables. When we returned to the table we found a tomato-basil fritata, BIG cinnamon bun and cajun-maple glazed bacon waiting for us. I don't like bacon - this was something I'd eat! Cinnamon bun was served in a mini cast iron pan, and was to die for - wished we could have ordered another and taken it to go! Tomato-basil fritata was one of my favorite parts of the meal!  Then came the chef selections - again, divide and conquer, and you can always ask for more were something to keep in mind! Bourbon ham, turkey, buffalo chicken 'n' waffles, 48 hour marinated sirloin, salmon, crab cake benedict, sausage...YUM. Both of us agreed on the sirloin as a favorite chef selection.  After some deep breaths, and serious thinking, we went to the dessert section of the harvest tables. My hunny said his favorite was something he would have never picked up - Raspberry oat bar! YUM! All in all fantastic service, amazing food, interesting atmosphere, would recommend to any carnivore looking to try a bunch of different options! Be prepared to be full for the rest of the day!
