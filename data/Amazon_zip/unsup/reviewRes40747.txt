Do not make a reservation here unless you are absolutely positive that nothing in life will come up such that you have to make a last minute cancel. Their policy is to cancel 24 hours in advance or you get slapped with $100 fee. Ok, that's fair. I made a reservation for my 3 yr anniversary w/ the bf on 4/20. I called to cancel on 4/19, but because these people never pick up the dammmmnn phone, I left a voicemail. I call back the next day to confirm they've received said voicemail, and the host assured me that I won't get a charge.  Well surprise! they went ahead and charged me $100 anyways. It gets better, I call them to let them know they've made a mistake. No answer. I leave voicemail. No call back. I call again. same story. This place is very unprofessional and very inattentive to customers it appears. I originally had plans to make another reservation on another day, but I'm not sure I will get any service at all.
