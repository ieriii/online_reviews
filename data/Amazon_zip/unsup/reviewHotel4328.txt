Went here for Afternoon Tea yesterday and had a very nice time. I loved sitting in the lobby, as the ceiling and surroundings are so beautiful. The jasmine pearl tea was delicious, as were the scones. These scones were delightful and the best of the foods presented. The sandwiches and desserts were fine but nothing I would readily seek out again. I may come back, as this was a fun and relaxing experience.
