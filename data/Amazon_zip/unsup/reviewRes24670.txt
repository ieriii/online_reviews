I really, really like this place a lot. This is a very romantic place to take a date, but it can also double as a fun place to go with friends too! Geja's is great for all occasions, especially the occasions when you have a bunch of money in your wallet. Good food comes with a price! As a note, some people seem to be bothered by the darkness of the restaurant, but I dig it. If you happen to dislike dimmed lighting, prepare accordingly and read your menu by the light of your cell phone. :)
