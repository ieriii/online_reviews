People of Lincoln Square, you have almost too many Thai choices. Within spitting distance of the Western elevated you have Spoon, Oscar, Opart, and the little place on Leland competing for your pad thai order. Opart Thai is fantastic for dine-in or delivery, because they will make things as Gringo or as "bring it on hot as hell" as you wish. I recommend the Tiger Cry and my husband thinks their Tom Yum soup is medicinal as it cures any ailments. The curries are the hottest around if you like that kind of thing.
