Sort of underwhelmed, overall. Service was excellent -- thanks Steve.  Upstairs dining made me feel isolated, it was dark, gloomy and seemed like it was stuck in the 80's, but to this end, we were informed it was just remodeled and a huge improvement of the previous decor.  Huh?  They make you aware that steaks are cooked at 1800 degrees and served on a 500 degree plate -- what does that mean to me? Not much really, other than Steve pointing out steak does not get cold throughout the meal. But, well, okay, that part makes sense.   So, I should order steak, right?  More on that. We each order this all in one bundled RC classic which is salad, steak, side dish and dessert in one. I ordered the ribeye, which, giving them the benefit of the doubt, I expect and want some marbling in a ribeye, but connective tissue/rubber band type material just took away from the experience -- I just could not eat it, 500 degree plate and all. Plus, we both ordered our steaks "medium." My husband stated that his filet seemed over overcooked and mine seemed undercooked. Then, they asked, and we mentioned we were celebrating an anniversary . . .  We were each expecting the dessert/cheesecake that came with our individual all in one dinners, we got a complimentary house dessert to share. Huh? What happened to our individual desserts that were part of the package deal? My husband said not to mention it.   We paid and left.
