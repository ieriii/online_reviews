So...I've been here twice because I can't possibly bear to deal with the wait this place usually has (on the weekends). And honestly, I don't think it's worth the wait. Yes, the breakfasts are creative and tasty...if you like SUGAR & YEAST for dessert, oh I mean breakfast. Smores pancakes, Oreo Cookie Flapjacks, Key Lime Cheesecake Pancakes? I personally can't handle that much crap that early in the morning and need some substantial basics. And I haven't tried an omlette because I think it's hysterical that they charge $8.95 for an omlette with a whopping choice of 2 ingredients. I will say you get a hell of a lot of pancakes. I couldn't finish the pumpkin, white chocolate, whatever else, god only knows what I was thinking, flapjacks that I ordered...and I can pack it in. But for the basics? I'd say the two-egg option is totally worth it...for the potatos alone. mmmm...i think they're red, and cooked with herbs (and porbably loads of butter). Anyhow, I probably wouldn't complain about the price so much if the atmosphere wasn't so annoying. On weekends, it's so packed, that your guaranteed to have someone's ass in your face while you're eating, if you're on the ground level. And on the weekdays, it's so quiet that there's bound to be some loudmouthed, egotisitical, inconsiderate moron ruining everyone else's conversations. The services is so, so...I guess depending on who you get. I don't really feel like they care about the customers, and I really don't like being served cold coffee. Seriously though, if you can handle a lot of sugar in the a.m. hit this place up. Otherwise...head to Milk and Honey where you'll wait just as long, and have a few less asses in your face, but eat much better food.
