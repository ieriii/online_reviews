I love love love love this place !!! My Korean friends took me and my BF. ahhh we so want to go back. They brought a hot grill out infront of us and we cooked on it as we eat. the beef came with lots of side dishes which i never tasted/seen before. but they were all so great. oh also, you can have lettuce to wrap the meat. try it ! it is fantastic! the best restaurant ever! If you wonder, there are lots of non-korean people there. you do not have to feel odd if you are not Korean...
