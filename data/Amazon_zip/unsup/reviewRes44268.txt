The cakes at Alliance are beautiful sculptures. Every single time I walk by their storefront, I linger in front of the window with the Louis Vuitton handbag cake. Admit it, I know you have too! I tried a lemon bar because it's my own personal gauge of goodie greatness. Outcome? Success. I've sampled a slice (or 8) of my friend's birthday cakes over the years and always manage to smuggle a piece home, even if I have to wrap it in a napkin (is that the tacky equivalent of plastic left on a sofa?). Oh well, then I'm a perpetrator. And the cafe next door is perfect for getting work DONE. It's definitely not social hour so move along if you're feeling Chatty Cathy-ish. Yep, like Colleen C says, it's indeed a library sans books. I love my lattes here and right this very moment, I'm enjoyed hot tea that tastes like liquefied Jello. Sweeeeet.
