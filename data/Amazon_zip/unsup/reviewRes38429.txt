This is stuffed pizza, folks. Some may not have the appetite for it but, man alive! Delicious, freshly baked (expect to wait about 45 minutes). Went in the Summer of 08 with one other person - we ordered the small and had about half left over, so make sure to come hungry. We ordered a pepperoni and green olive pizza - best pizza of my life. Their caprese was not bad either, firm tomatoes, and generous mozarella slices.
