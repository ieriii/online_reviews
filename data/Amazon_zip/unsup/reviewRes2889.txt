Basically, the best food and service my husband and I have ever had. From the first course to the dessert tray they bring around (which is complimentary - so don't feel bad for trying everything) the food was delicious. The flavors were out of the ordinary, but complimented each other perfectly. The service was second-to-none as well. The wait staff was knowledgeable and extremely friendly. The sommelier was spot on with his recommendation for both myself and my husband. If you are looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion (dinner will be an expense) this is well worth the dining investment.
