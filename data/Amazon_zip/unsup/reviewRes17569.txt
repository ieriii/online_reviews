I live in NYC and thought I'd check out how Chicago Indian food is....AMAZING! I can actually say this was one of the best Indian restaurants of my life. We had the Vegetable House Special that had Palak Paneer and Chickpea Curry. We also ordered the Tandoori Chicken. The food was packed with spices and flavor, not too much, but just enough to give it a great kick. I think many restaurants have a hard time finding the balance, but this place does it perfectly. I may have been in a food coma after I ate here, but that's because I couldn't stop shoveling food in my face. We realized once we sat down, that there's a buffet they have for lunchtime. Will have to check that out! The only con was they were playing the cheesiest elevator music. When I come to an Indian restaurant, I want to hear Indian music :-)
