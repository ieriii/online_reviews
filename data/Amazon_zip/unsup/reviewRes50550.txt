Amazing Brunch! - yet not not for the faint of heart...or stomach for that matter. I was a little apprehensive to try a southern style brunch spot, especially after a long weekend of indulging in lots of food and drink. I also am not a girl who grew up on grits & creole & cornbread; needless to say, I was not sure of what to expect. We were immediately sat at a table, although I must say we were not there in prime brunch hours (probably around 2 pm). The waitress was the sweetest thing EVER and responded to my many questions & weird looks with grace & aplomb. She did her best to "describe" grits to me and even brought me out a sample to try before I ordered.  The menu is an interesting read and I must say the Bayou Twist on menu items was intriguing (read: blackened catfish, savannah shrimp omelette) so I figured I would order off the home specials. After 15 minutes of carefully deciding EXACTLY what I wanted, i felt confident ordering the NC Crab Cakes. Welp- of course that was the ONLY thing on the menu they didnt have. The waitress suggested I try the crawfish cakes instead. EXCUSE ME?! You want me to actually eat crawfish?! She repeatedly assured me that if I didnt like them, I could have whatever I wanted. (Oh girl! You just won yourself another star!!) I loved em. So good! and now my palette is grateful for this new addition to its long list of 'loves;.Crawfish: who woulda thought?! The boy also swears by the Red Eggs and loves them so much he won't even order anything else. All in all, a great spot and they will definitely see me back there soon.
