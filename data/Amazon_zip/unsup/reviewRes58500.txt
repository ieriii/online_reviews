I came in here for lunch on a thursday afternoon. (I was getting a bit tired of the things they offered in my neighborhood) The biggest concern I had with going to Lincoln Park was the pricing. however Simply It defied that idea! Soup, salad, lunch entree, lemonade and fruits at the end of my meal. Amazing! All for under 10 bucks too! Show me any other place that does that much food for under 10 dollars in Lincoln Park and I'll be astounded.It was so good that I came back for dinner that night with a group of friends. The dinner was also amazing. I tried the Simply It's Beef and it was absolutely astounding. The beef cubes were just oh so tender and all of my friend's meals were delicious as well.I'm definitely coming back here for lunch more often and dinner as well! Great value, and great prices! Keeps my stomach and my wallet happy.
