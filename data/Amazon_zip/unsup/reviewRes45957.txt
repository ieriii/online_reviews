Try your hardest to get seated in the "special" room. Then try to get a nice window seat. It's fun, romantic, casual, special... all at the same time! It's especially nice when the Christmas lights are still lit. I work backwards when I dine here. I first look at the dessert menu, choose one that I haven't tried yet (come to think of it... I think I've ordered every single dessert on the menu... my favorite is still the beignets (sp?)), and then find an entree that will sit well for several days in my fridge as the portions here are ridiculously humongous. The view, the food, the service (fun waitstaff), the pomegranate bellini ;-P makes for a fun dining experience. Great for taking out-of-town guests to dinner! WARNING: Ladies beware. The floor here is suuuper slippery. Make sure to wear a heel that can grip the floor... or make sure your body's prepared to land on it.
