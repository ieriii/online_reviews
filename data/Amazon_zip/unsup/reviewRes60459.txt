I had a couple of drinks at the bar tonight. They had the tvs on but no volume. Since it was 11 years after 9/11 and there was several news programs on about it. I asked if they could turn on the captions.The bartender and manager said the owner doens't want the captions on. Wow, on another anniversary on 9/11 and another immigrant pushing us around. I was told they only put the captions on for special and gay event.s. As a disabled veteran and on 9/11 I have to ask myself what serving and what those brave souls gave on 9/11 what it is all for. It must be horrible to put the closed captions on, unless it's for gay and special events.
