Dearest Carnivale, You are everything they say you are. Always full and overwhelmingly hip, large and vibrant, energetic and fun, with great drinks, amazing desserts, and wonderful service, you are truly, a jewel in the crown of fun Chicagoan dining experiences. Then why, dear heart, do you force me to give you two stars? Why is there nothing on the dinner menu for me, dearest, the vegetarian? Why, dearest C, do you condescendingly offer me a plate of masa cake, as if I were the only vegetarian on earth? You are not, sweetness, a grill of sea-food. You are not, oh-mecca-of-the-hip-and-fashionable, a house of steak. You are not, even, darling, a joint of barbecue!! Why then, beloved, do I need to steer clear of your doors as a vegetarian? It is with regret, then, light-of-Chicagoan-dining-life, that I state, Micawber-esque in my misery, that I am she who will not return, that I am she, the woman so aptly named Moi. PS: I'll give you five stars for customer service, beloved C. Your executive chef contacted me after this review and asked me what he could do to better the menu. I love that C. I do. Eagerly awaiting menu updates, The Vegetarian Girl. PPS: There have been menu changes!! Stand by for an update!
