This place has my heart! The cuts of meat are all great there is no difference in the cuts of meats at lunch and dinner which is a bonus to it's counter part. I love the polenta cakes and cheese bread . I am a rare/medium rare meat eater and I have yet to be disappointed they always seem to get the cook temperatures right. The salad bar is very fresh and replenished often. it has a variety of greens, dressings, cold cuts, and a vegetables. The service staff is very attentive and knowledgeable and if there is a cut of meat that you like all you need to do is ask and they'll send it over. All in all 2 very enthusiastic thumbs up! good times had by all
