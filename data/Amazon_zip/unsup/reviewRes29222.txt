The Pasta Bowl is a great place to go if you are craving some hearty, filling food. The portion sizes are generous, the prices are reasonable and the menu isn't limited to just pasta. They have sandwiches and great salads as well. The atmosphere is cozy with tables just far enough apart so that you don't cross conversations but close enough to create a warm, family feeling. There are daily specials if you are at a loss for what to try, beer on draft and a full bar connected next door. My pick is the Cranberry Gorgonzola Salad with grilled chicken on top, it's piled so high with toppings, I sometimes consider asking for extra lettuce.
