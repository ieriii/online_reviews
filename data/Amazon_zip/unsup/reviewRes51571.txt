I've had better Mexican food. This place is good in a pinch, but I'd rather go to a simple greasy hole-in-the-wall place (with better prices) for a good authentic taco that'll really hit the spot. The chorizo is often too salty, the steak is chewy and fatty, and the chicken is kinda flavorless. And if you order by phone, expect your order to be messed up. But I have a hard time talking bad about the place too much, because the owner and staff are really friendly and will probably fix any mistakes if you bring it up. The place remodeled recently and is really nice looking with huge windows that open up to the nice main drag of Lincoln Square so that a certain area of the restaurant feels patio-like, which is nice. But other than that I can't even say much for the atmosphere. The rest of the place is large and open with a bunch of tables lined up kind of cafeteria-like. But if you're in the Square and want Mexican food, this would be the place to go, as any other place to get good Mexican food is a decent walk away.
