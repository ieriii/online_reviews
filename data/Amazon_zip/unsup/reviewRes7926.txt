You know it's good when a Yellow Cab rolls up, Kelsey Grammer steps out and greets the owner with, "We just couldn't stay away!" I do love a trip to Spacca Napoli. The pizza is always delicious, and the serious Italian mixes of flavors and toppings are delicious. I prefer the red sauces to the white pizzas, but don't mind changing it up every once in a while. Great selection of wine, too, and a lovely little patio for a summer evening. It's a little pricier than my usual trip for pizza, and I do find the crust to be a little bit chewy for my taste, but I keep on coming back to Spacca because it tastes so good. And if it's good enough for Frasier, it's good enough for me.
