Love this place, even after managing to fall flat on my face walking UP the long flight of stairs from the ladies' room. Clutzes like me beware! First impression: What a well dressed and snazzy lookin' crowd! Second impression: What? You're booked until 11 PM in your regular dining room but we can get immediate seating in the lounge? It looks more intimate and comfy anyway! Third impression: Wow these drinks are good! (Hence commences to fall up stairs). After enjoying a delicious and refreshing Bee Sting and 10th Generation at the bar, we ordered the steak tartare appetizer, paris mushroom truffle pasta and oven roasted pork meatballs as entrees, and then a side each of the blackened cauliflower and smashed red potatoes. The steak tartare was downright delicious, with the creamy egg yolk perfectly complimenting the savory capers. Makes me want to take a bite right of a cow. And the fact that they put a whole bottle of Sriracha sauce in front of you? I can't help loving it, I'm Asian. The pasta was good, although I was still recovering from a truffle-where-no-truffle-should-belong incident a few days before, and the cauliflower was delicious with its acne-inducing oiliness and crispy blackened carcinogen-ness. While the restaurant remained packed the entirety of our dinner, the layout and romantic lighting still afforded us a feeling of privacy. It's a rare restaurant that can accomplish the perfect trifecta: leaving us full, happy off of stellar food/drinks, AND with our wallets full. Gilt Bar did all three!
