Oh Piece how you tempt me. There are things that I can't stand about piece and things that I think are great. Not a fan of the pizza. The sauce is so acidic you end up feeling piece for days on end. The set up is very secluded..the room isn't connected, its just a bunch of tables and it always seems crammed and at the end of the day it's a sports bar. The beer however is awesome. They brew their own and the names and flavors are really inventive. Go there for the beer but leave soupy pizza, sports and ball chat to game days with the guys.
