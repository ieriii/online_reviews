One of things I miss about DC is the spicy Ethiopian cuisine. Demera fills that gap in my Chicago diet. Go for a messob combination plate to sample multiple dishes. I am a big fan of the yellow peas, roasted beets with carrots, and lamb tibs. Try a spiced Ethiopian tea to wash it down. Mmm. Brilliantly close to the Red Line Lawrence stop and the Green Mill.
