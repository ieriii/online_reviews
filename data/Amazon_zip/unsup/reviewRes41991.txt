Great food & great cocktails, gorgeous interior, somewhat slow service. I went for a girls night out and had a really enjoyable time. The place is beautiful, sexy even. When I arrived I took a seat at the bar & was greeted promptly. Before I could order, my friend arrived and we were seated right on time for our reservation. I later wished I had ordered that drink after all, because it was a while before we saw our server & then the 1st round. Luckily the service picked up slightly after that. Most importantly in my book, the food was excellent. The ham & cheese fondue was met with great acclaim by my friend, and the gnocchi were lovely. It is pricy, but I didn't feel the portions were skimpy. They aren't enormous by any stretch, but rather the portion size your food *should* be. The drinks were very good, too, and as well-presented as the food. We tried several cocktails and enjoyed them all thoroughly, but we'd have preferred to get them a little more quickly. I'd definitely return for another night out with friends or a date.
