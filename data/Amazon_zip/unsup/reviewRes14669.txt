I was really excited to go here. My sister and her boyfriend are in love with this place. Myself, i cant say no to empanadas or papa rellanas. There are quite a few Cuban and Hispanic restaurants in Florida, and I have to say they are ALL better than this place. The beef in the papa rellanas (it's a ball of mashed potato with meat in the middle then deep fried) was watery and had a sour flavor. The empanada was perfectly bland. It was a really cute place though. oh and IRON BEER! mmm.
