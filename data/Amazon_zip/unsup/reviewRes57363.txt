I thought I had lost a dream sushi restaurant when Shushido closed and then found out that Coast had opened with the same chefs! I highly recommend this sushi restaurant. Prompt service, excellent quality fish and desserts are nothing to sneeze at! I highly suggest the spider roll, the rainbow roll , the dragon and my favorite of all THE VOLCANO! My partner had the shashmi platter which was filled with delicious cuts of fish, while I had the teriayki chicken. I was quite full but could have easily been forced to eat more! The desserts were quite chi chi but very delicious.
