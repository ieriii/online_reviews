Chicago q is an absolutely fabulous experience. It begins with the gentleman at the reception desk, the wait staff, the server and then of course THE FOOD! Blows every bbq establishment out of the water. We were four people, each having something different. Every dish was to perfection. Dessert (expresso ice cream with peanut brittle and choco. sauce) yummmmm! Even the staff....professional, attentive.... If there were more than 5 stars, this would be the place. BTY, don't forget to try the bread and butter pickles!
