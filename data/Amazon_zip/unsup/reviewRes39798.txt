FABULOUS. Friday, 1:45pm. Not busy at all. Jane, our waitress was very cool. Black Maple Hill 16 year. $30. WELL worth it. The PBR breakfast ( WITH the PBR thank you very much! ). Some AWESOME bacon ( Nueske's ) , and what DO they do to the scrambled eggs to make them so damn yummy. Great taters too. Had the house Evan Williams after the PBR to end it all off. My pal had the pork belly cubano ( judging by his silence during mastication he enjoyed it). He loved the Old-Fashioned too. I WILL be back. Gotta try that bone marrow......
