I've been to Blackbird and Avec, and both have not impressed me. My expectations were non-existent, and it seemed to actually go below it based on the items we ordered. The setup in there seemed interesting; communal dining, while along the perimeter, there were little dining 'compartments' to be away from dining with strangers. We were lucky to have one of these. Our server was extremely friendly and nice, which is a plus. The Spicy Pork Rinds were already ordered by my cousins with their beverages, and while I'm not much of a rinds fan, it was alright - salty and far from being it spicy. From the menu, we ordered oysters as a 'Chef's Selection' - there was a garlic water sauce with minced garlic, and the each of the oysters from a different region had a different taste. The Bouchot Mussels were really disappointing since the size is what you find in Chinese hot soup (they were tiny as a fingernail); the broth was nice and salty, and was good with the complimentary crusty bread. The whole Farm Chicken was just so unappetizing with the herbs - it seemed the ratio was way off, and the crinkle-cut french fries were all soggy from the chicken juice; this was literally the worst roasted chicken I've had. Ever. The raelotte, which was a sweeter version of potatoes, little pickles and cheese was alright - probably the most manageable dish of what we've ordered, but more of a sweet dish vs. savory. The tasting of all the Three Hams were not that impressive; you could get a package of prosciutto from the local grocery store and call it a day - I was intrigued by the 'goat butter,' but it literally tasted like shortening. We also had some scallops, and the flavor was lacking, and only 3 were served. This place is definitely overrated, and probably the worst of the three I've tried. I definitely won't be coming back! Parking could be found around the area, but the restaurant is so not worth it, so it doesn't matter!
