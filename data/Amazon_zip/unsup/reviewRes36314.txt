At the risk of making this place even more popular than it is, I will give my first impression. Got seating right away in this crowded place at 9:15 am on Memorial Monday. By 10:00 am the line was out the door. I know why. The menu is full of 'those' selections that all sound like you want to have a taste of each one. I had the Emerald Isle, a corn beef hash skillet with swiss cheese on top. I also tried Wheat Grass Smoothie (with Mango and Orange). Both were truly great. My wife had the special French Toast which was 4 stars versus my 5 star meal. We are very excited to have found this place and even more excited that the food lived up to our expectations.
