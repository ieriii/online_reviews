Great margaritas-the raspberry was awesome! They seemed strong to me! Chicken was great as well as the chips and salsa. The chips were a little salty.The service is excellent. We were sat by the door which was drafty and as people left they offered to move us away from the door. At first I thought this was a very small restaurant and then I realized there is an additional dinning room off the side. Was a little more expensive than some Mexican restaurants in the area but overall was a fun time.
