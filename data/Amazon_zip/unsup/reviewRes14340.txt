Well, I loved this place. I've been in the mood for a good burger and fries for a while and this place had both. Consider me well satisfied. My soon-to-be-married buddy suggested this as a start to bachelor party number 2. We showed up around 7:30 and were told that the wait for a party of ten was going to be an hour. We said cool and hit up the bar to try a few of their beers. I started off with the Bottom Up Belgium Wit, their Belgium wheat beer with coriander and orange. It was really, really good. Light with a hint of fruit, exactly what I was hoping for. As we waited, the staff kept us updated on our table and were able to split us up into two neighboring tables of five. They were all really cool and you could tell they were doing their best to accommodate us. Great service all around that night. As we got our menus, the first thing I saw was the bacon fat popcorn. You had me at bacon fat. This bowl of popcorn came loaded with pieces of bacon and shredded parmesan. The bacon fat was also definitely there too. Great beer and bacon fat, so far so good. For my meal, I went with the Farm burger. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, with roasted beets and a fried egg. Awesome. You get a choice of sides, I went with the fries, my buddy grabbed a salad...sucker! The fries were also really good. I've been let down a lot by soggy, crappy fries, so I loved these. I washed this down with their Coup d'etat beer. Recommended by the waitress and delicious. My favorite of the the ones I tasted that night. Everyone enjoyed their dishes, they tried the pulled pork burger, the chorizo pizza, the lamb stew, and the workingman burger. All got thumbs up. Had a great time here and looking forward to coming back.
