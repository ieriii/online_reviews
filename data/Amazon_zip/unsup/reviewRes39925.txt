We went after having read the bad reviews about the bad service so I supposed my expectations were of that. But because we went with that knowledge we had a great time. It was more "no service" rather than "bad service". I think the language barrier makes it hard for good service. We didn't even get a How is everything? Can I get you anything else? ... It's one of those places where if you don't ask you won't get because it's just not a service oriented restaurant. But the food definitely makes up for it. I feel full just thinking about it. We ordered the Korean beef and Marinated pork for our main meats. The soup, rice and all the sides was more than enough for two people.
