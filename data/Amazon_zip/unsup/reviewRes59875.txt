I had a recent business trip to Chicago and was recommended to dine at Kinzie Chop House. Being the only person I sat at the bar with a very friendly bartender Nicole who's was very charming. I asked for recommendations and she pointed right at the steaks! I had the Filet with the broccoli cheese fondue and it was awesome! Nicole and some staff that I saw seemed very outgoing as well as friendly, I felt very welcome. I would differently recommend Kinzie for the food and Nicole for the charming. Great Place!
