Skip the line. Go inside and sit at the bar. There were seats available from 6 until after 8. If you like deep dish pizza, you'll love this place. They do everything right at Gino's, but you pay for it. A pizza dinner with beers came to $70 with tip. Get the salad with house dressing. If you read my other reviews, you know I often skip salad dressing. This dressing was sweet and a little bit tangy. I loved it.
