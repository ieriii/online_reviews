I'm a girl who loves Pho! And shoot, I know my Pho! Hands down Tank Noodle makes the best Pho in Chicago. It feels like it's always packed. The wait and the hustle and bustle make the noodles taste that much better. The staff (army shirted and always friendly) is awesome. They know what good service means. I find their broken English charming and cute. Depending on how hungry I am, I usually get #39 (large bowl of Pho) or #40 (regular bowl of Pho). When I'm feeling adventurous, I try the other dishes. Their boba (smoothies) drinks are quite delicious too. I would argue it's comparable to Joy Yee's boba drinks. The only downside to this restaurant is that it's always closed on Wednesdays. UGH! Otherwise, Tank is one awesome place.
