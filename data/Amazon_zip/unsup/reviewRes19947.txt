A solid four, creeping towards five-dom. Nice atmosphere, with good lighting and a few pleasant Irish brogues among the waitstaff; just ever so slightly too loud for unstressed conversation. This is my first experience with a "gastropub" (I'm pretty sure this translates to "English/Irish/Scottish food tweaked for American tastes", but that's fine with me) and our food was delicious. Even the complementary bread was several steps above your typical dinner roll - some sort of sourdough thing going on there. The risotto was wonderful: lightly cheesy with onions, kale, and roasted cauliflower thrown in. EXCELLENT vegetarian option in an otherwise meaty menu. And the food came out quite quickly - always a plus when you have a rather late dinner reservation. :) My dining companion's food was not quite as tasty, though still good - while the goat cheese tart disappeared quickly, the squash with applewood bacon was taken away unfinished. I am generally pretty suspicious of more expensive places, but The Gage was impressive. It's Restaurant Week, kids! Get out there and take advantage! Can't beat the location, either, right smack across from Millenium Park. Impress your Chicago-visiting friends!
