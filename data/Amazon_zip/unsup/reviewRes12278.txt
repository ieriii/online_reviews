I really love Cafe 28 although I haven't been there for a while due to a stint in CA. But when i lived in the hood it was my favorite place for just about everything-- Dinner, drinks, dates, brunch, whatever. I have always had amazing service-- entertaining but unobtrusive at the same time. My only gripe (and its not enough to deduct a star) is that unless the menu has changed a lot lately there wasn't a lot for vegetarians...which is fine now since i now eat some meat-- but i remember being a little disappointed in the lack of options for me back in the day-- although the options they had were delicious and kept me coming back. I say bravo for cafe 28!
