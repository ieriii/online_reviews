Love it as a bar. So-so for a restaurant.  The wait staff here is absolutely excellent. I had 3 beers tonight all picked out by my waitress and they were excellent! (i'm having trouble typing correctly they were so excellent :) i had the ham sandwich that everyone raves about and i liked it, but I don't think it was worth $10. My husband had the beef brisket which was good as well, but not worth $12. The couple next to us had the steak frites ($18) and it looked awfully rubbery. However, the mussels (which we didn't have) looked excellent and the beer was devine.  We went on a monday night (date night for us) and the place was still packed, but in a good way, so i can imagine the craziness that may ensue on a weekend. All in all, i like this place, but i may skip dinner next time and eat somewhere else in the neighborhood.
