I've been here a couple of times now and thought it was time to YELP about it. I'm a fan for sure! The food is delicious. We've ordered the chicken tikka masala, the cocunut cream sauce chicken dish, various parathas, butter chicken and a spinach/cheese ball side dish. All were delicious. Also, the samosas and fried cheese/chickpea appetizers are wonderful. The waitstaff has been friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is lovely and the location is great. Now, if I only knew about the buffet...
