My series of exceptional Publican dining experiences continues! We went last night to celebrate my birthday/Halloween. We made reservations for fourteen, and the Publican seamlessly increased the reservation to fifteen when we got an extra the morning of the meal. Our waiter was very helpful in assisting us order for the entire group. I mean, we pretty much ordered everything from the meat side of the menu. The meal, as always was exceptional. But, really, the reason for the update is just to mention that The Publican gracefully and easily accommodated our large party. The service did not suffer for the size of the party--it was as doting and friendly as usual. And, in spite of leaving stuffed to the gills and filled with enough drinks, the bill still came to right around $50 per person. Honestly, The Publican is making a really strong push for my favorite Chicago restaurant...
