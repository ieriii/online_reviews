Hands down, BEST deep dish pizza in CHICAGO! Perfect amount of cheese and topping, sauce seasoned to perfection the CRUST, better than all the other place. Atmosphere, exactly what you expect for a Italina chain pizzaria. For BEST thin crust please see Pat's Pizza (Lincoln Park/Lakeview) or Piece (Bucktown).
