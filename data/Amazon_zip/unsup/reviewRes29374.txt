Let me just say, I go to this place EVERY time I visit Chicago. My family there knows that when I come to town, were all going out to Chicago Diner. Why? They do americanized vegan food better than anyone. The have a mock Ruben sandwich and it is amazing! Note for the vegans, get it without cheese, though they have veggie cheese, it's better with none. The setan wings are awesome and I have even tried to recreate these at home, though haven't quite got the breading down. The nacho platter is also amazing. Really I don't think I have eaten anything here I didn't like. I must mention as well, they have a heck of a good beer menu. Many local brews and a lot of craft brews. Though I found out on my last visit they can no longer server beer on the patio due to some Chicago regulation BS'ery. Anyways, this is a must visit if your in Chicagoland area.
