After waiting for two hours to be seated, I was really excited to dig into some authentic Italian. I'm new to the "small plate" version of Italian (they seem diabolically opposed to me?), and after a two-hour wait I was pretty hungry, so perhaps that created the perfect storm here. We ordered the ravioli and were brought ONE RAVIOLI on a large plate. Okay, it was a larger ravioli than normal (size of a fist), but seriously? Nine bucks for a single ravioli (no meat, no sauce)? It was not terribly tasty, nor was the rigatoni. Very average all around. I will recommend the butternut squash salad, and the ambience was pretty nice once we sat down, but I left hungry and disappointed! Not to mention cash-poor.  The $$-rating is deceiving! Beware: VERY small plates!
