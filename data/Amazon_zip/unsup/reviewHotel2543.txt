Here's the thing: This is Chicago. It is not Manhattan. It is not South Beach. It is not L.A. It is not Paris. This is Chicago. So I need the over-entitled and under-exposed people at Victor Hotel to understand that. I know from "exclusive" clubs. And you, Victor Hotel, are not an exclusive club. You never will be, and you need to stop acting like it. I've only been here at the invitation of younger (that is to say "20-something") friends for birthday celebrations, and to a time, I regretted going. It's like a bad scene from 1994, with unnecessary lines, a ridiculous cover and bottle service, and the ever-elusive "list". Here's my thing: I don't stand in line anywhere. And that is not pretention, it is the truth. I happen to work in a profession that has afforded me access to "exclusive" places -- much better than Victor Hotel. So, I don't stand in line. And I definitely don't stand in line at a bootleg club in the industrial district in what we're now calling the "West Loop." My other thing -- I do not beg to get in. If I tell you that I'm on the list and drop the name we both know and agree is the contact, let me the hell in without a shakedown! Maybe if I was in my 20s and never lived outside of Chicago, I'd think it was a hot place to be. But I know the kind of bad fruit these folks are selling and I don't want it. The last time I was there, I was so worn down from standing in line (because my name mysteriously disappeared or was never on "the list"), conceding to paying a $20 cover (because my name mysteriously disappeared or was never on "the list"), and trying and failing to get table service replenishments, that I couldn't even enjoy the DJ. I was too irritated. I paid my respects to the birthday girl and kept it moving -- knowing that I wouldn't set foot in this joint again. I'll leave it to the kids who still enjoy it because they don't know any better. And I'll keep partying elsewhere with grown folks.
