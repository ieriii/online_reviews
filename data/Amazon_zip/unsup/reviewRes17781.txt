Carnivale is very large and colorful, so it's a fun atmosphere for either a group dinner (you can be rowdy and it's totally fine) or a first date where you don't want an awkwardly quiet setting. I've been here several times in both of those contexts, and while I like it, it just isn't that memorable. I literally could never tell you what I ate the time before and never leave thinking "That was amazing." I guess other people like it because I keep getting invited to dinners here, but I personally am ready to move on to other restaurants in Chicago... especially for Latin fare, for which I think there are better offerings!
