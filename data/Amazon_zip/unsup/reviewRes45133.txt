With recommendation from friends and the high rating from yelp, we were a bit underwhelmed with Anteprima. My dinner was pretty good, zucchini flower, lobster ravioli and seared scallop. I would give my dinner 4 stars. My hubby's dinner was a total disappointment. The pasta dish, orecchiette with spicy lamb sausage was way too salty even though the pasta was very fresh. The wood grilled spare ribs has no flavor even though the meat was tender. Maybe the chef was having an off night?!?! The saving grace is their $29 prix fixe price along with the nice alfresco area and service.
