i absolutely loved everything here. It was a quiet setting, great service, amazing food, and perfectly paced. We ordered two apps and a bottle of wine, delicious. Then our two entrees came out, delicious - I remember I got the shrimp and grits(think I still get the taste in my mouth...yum). Deserts were great too.
