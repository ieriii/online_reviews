Hmm, I don't think I particularly cared for the atmosphere at Grand Lux. It was a little too loud and not a very intimate dining experience by any means. Service was friendly and attentive. The food and drinks were actually pretty good as well. I ordered fish and chips which was made with tempura batter. The fish was very fresh and the batter crunchy and not too greasy. My mai tai was pretty yummy and my husbands mojito...which I polished off for him, he's such a lightweight, was a bit too sweet but all in all a good attempt. I might go back to Grand Lux for a brunch or a lunch but I prefer a more cozy atmosphere for my dinner options.
