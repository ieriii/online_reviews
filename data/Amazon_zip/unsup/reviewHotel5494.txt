I rented two rooms at this hotel last April when I had some girlfriends in town and we wanted a fun night out in the city. The location is the most attractive feature of this hotel. I agree with all the other reviewers who said the bathrooms need to be remodeled. The beds are not comfortable either and I agree the hotel should purchase new ones. The worst part was, even though I paid their ridiculously high rate for two rooms we could not get into our rooms until 3 hours after check-in! A huge pain when traveling with a group of women who want to get dressed for a night out. The hotel gave late check out to a hockey team in town to play the Black hawks so all their other guests checking in had to suffer. The lobby was filled with pissed off guests who felt that since they were not professional athletes their reservations were not important. I would not stay here again.
