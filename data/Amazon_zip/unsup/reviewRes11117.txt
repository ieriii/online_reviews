The following review is courtesy of a traveling San Francisco yelper: I woke up Sunday morning starved. Famished. Hungry. The previous night was an amazing Tiesto show, and after three solid hours of dancing (and only a few hours sleep), brunch beckoned. My friends suggested this spot in wicker park, mentioning something about their famous chocolate french toast. After a night of dancing, I'll eat anything, even something this far outside of my normal eating routine. Wow. I'd go as far to say Top 5 breakfast of all time. Right on par with Levende, Kate's Kitchen and All You Knead back home. This french toast was unbelievable, stuffed with cheese, topped with chocolate syrup, sliced bananas and even more shredded chocolate. Just out of this world. The mango/strawberry french toast sounded exceptional as well, and fortunately my friend got that, and we shared. Not as good as the chocolate one, but still amazing. Chicago is a great town. If you go, don't miss this spot.
