I made my reservation online, and showed up on the wrong day. The staff was great about it and we were able to be seated immediately at the sushi bar. The food and service were both very good, but the standout is clearly the ambiance, which was pure sex. There is of course better sushi in Chicago for a lower price, you're paying for the see and be seen vibe.
