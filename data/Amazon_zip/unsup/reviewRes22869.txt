I'm kind of torn here by this place. As much as I like the uniqueness of the food featured here, I'm pretty much always dissapointed by the customer service here. The first time I dined here, they were short staffed (by only one person according to my server), so as a result (and I'm not kidding here) my & my friend's meal took about 50 minutes to arrive, after I asked the waitress why the it took so long, she half-heartedly apologized and that was it, a better restaurant would've comped us in some way I'm sure as has been my experience. I "tired" to dine there on my birthday last summer, but after waiting a few minutes in the crowded area by the cash register, no one really even acknowledged our party at all (maybe they thought we didn't want to eat there, but just hang out instead?), so we just left. Other visits where much better in terms of service, but I NEVER will go to this small place on a busy night, and I mean never, for a variety of reasons, they just can't handle crowds at all. If they could just up their customer service/response time (perhaps moving into a bigger location would help), I think this could be a truly wonderful restaurant. Taking Credit Cards would probably help as well I think. And just so I don't sound entirely negative, the food is very good, refreshing homemade beverages are available and the prices are very attractive....for me, putting up with slow service/long wait times kinda makes the experience not as much fun as it should be.....
