The wait in line SUCKS! That is literally the only bad thing I can say about this place. From the beer, food sauces, choices everything else is, as usual for Bayless, awesome. If you are there and you like your food hot, definitely ask for some habanero sauce on the side. Yikes! just a dab and my lips were numb for 20 minutes. Nice job again Rick.
