I couldn't stop eating from the moment I sat down! I went there last night with a friend and her family who are long-time customers. The food was really delicious and the staff was incredibly friendly. You get a soup and a salad with each entree and the pizza bread in the beginning is amazingly delicious. Definitely a local crowd. The decor is nothing to write home about but that is what an old-school italian restaurant is all about, right? If you want a good ole's italian meal then head to Sabatino's where the service is friendly and the prices is right.
