Its the Cheesecake Factory's twin. The only difference is the Grand Lux might be the better looking twin. The menu is just as extensive as the Cheesecake Factory and the only main difference is the desserts. There's a variety of options whereas CF only has cheesecake. The pasta with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, and basil is phenomenal and is a perfectly light pasta dish, if you're looking for your favorite carb without the full stomach at the end. Grand Lux is a lot bigger than Cheesecake factory, and the two times I've been there, I haven't had to wait. If it's a weekend you're probably better off coming here. The view of Michigan Ave. is awesome, and the ambiance is warm and inviting. Also be prepared for huge portions, third world countries hate us because of restaurants like this.
