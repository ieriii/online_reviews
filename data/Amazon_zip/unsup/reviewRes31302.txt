For a more detailed review, please see my review of the Pinnacle Peak location (Scottsdale) which we have been to multiple times (namely any time we are in the area). For steak or seafood Mastros is far and away the best restaurant out there. Top notch service, only fresh (never frozen) steaks/seafood. Just talk to your server and ask him/her how long they have been with the company and that alone will tell you. Plus, how many restaurants have the manager call you the next day to ask how your experience was. By far the best steak/seafood restaurant in Chicago. But like I said on my Pinnacle Peak review, you pay for this type of food/service. But its worth it!!!!
