It was disappointing compared to my first dining experience. The psychedelic salad was too frou frou for me - not enough sustenance. I didn't get the flavor combinations either - it all basically equated to one bite.  I would've been okay with it if it was off of the dollar menu, but unacceptable as part of a pre-fixe. Then the salad was followed by french onion soup. Again, another miss. The melted caramelized cheese and crouton are usually my favorite part of French onion soup, but instead, we got a rolled puff pastry shell with a hint of cheese...? I didn't get it. Why mess with such a great thing? The scallops, foie gras (that we added for extra $$$), and the pork were all amazing though. Perfection. Excellence. It was also quite odd that the servers came by to ask our opinions on these three courses and not the others... The dessert, not so much. What happened to the dessert sampling we received on our first trip?!  Three misses + three hits + $160 = 3 stars I don't know, maybe my expectations were just high from my first visit, but course for course, I was utterly disappointed. Bonsoiree raised their prices since my last visit too, but hopefully, their next menu offering will be better...I'm keeping my fingers crossed!
