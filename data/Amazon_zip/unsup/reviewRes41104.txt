Almost missed Bonsoiree while driving down Armitage due to the fact that it had no sign outside and looked pretty nondescript... we looked at each other and were like, "Nooo, that can't be it!" But it was, and once inside it was small and cozy. We did the Sunday 4-course tasting, and the service was swift and courteous. They even took our beer without blinking. Hooray for non-winos! The first course was an endive and roasted pear salad, which was good, but the highlight of the meal was definitely the second selection, a creamy baked scallop dish. It was absolutely perfection. The main course of pork chops, however, was somewhat disappointing, since my boyfriend and I are not fans of pork... and well, it was not very flavorful. To finish off the meal, the dessert of banana pudding bread was also delicious. We were worried that we would leave still hungry, but we were both stuffed at the end! Overall, Bonsoiree was a good experience, but I sometimes wonder that main course was something besides that pork chop dish, if we would be raving that it was amazing. That being said however, we were under the impression that their "No Menu Sundays" was comprised of weekly designed "innovative courses" as promised on their website. After getting home and deciding we should return on a non-Sunday to order off their regular menu and avoid ordering something we disliked (like pork chops), we discovered that everything we ate was already on the regular menu. Oh well. Props to Chef Shin for creating 3 out of 4 delicious courses... even if he was feeling a little "non-innovative" that week!
