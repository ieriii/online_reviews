It is a very small place and not a good environment. I had a terrible experience at Sushi-X tonight. We arrived there at 6:30pm. After waiting 45 min for a table, their manager Michael came and told us to "go home" because there was no tables available, and 7pm was their cut-off time for their "happy hour". What kind of a manager sends their customer home? Amazing! Very disappointed!
