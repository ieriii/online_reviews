I really liked the open air atmosphere that this place offers. The problem with Greek town is I never know what to order. When this happens I typically rely on the waiter/waitress. The problem I ran into here was she was vegetarian and not set on one menu item or another. I ended getting a chicken sandwich, which was very good, but they used the end of a loaf of bread. My co-worker got a wrap and it came with fries, the waitress recommended the feta cheese on top of the fries which was an additional two dollars. When the food came out there had been cold feta which was sprinkled on top of the fries. He was extremely disappointed. Overall the entrees were good, but somewhat overpriced.
