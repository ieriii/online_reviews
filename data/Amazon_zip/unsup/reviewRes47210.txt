3 stars for entrees 5 stars for appetizers When they're good, they're great. ...but they can occasionally be a little inconsistent with the mac'n'cheese. I've never had bad service here, but I've also only ever been here at off-peak hours. I still very much prefer Kuma's for my "Burger in a Metal Joint" fix, but it is slightly less expensive to go to Lockdown. Also, my boyfriend is obsessed with the barbed-wire cheese dip! Thanks for being a great spot to kill some time!
