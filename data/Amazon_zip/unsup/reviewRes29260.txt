I've been going to this place for years and the Thai food has remained constant, constantly good. A menu that has over a hundred delicious selections ranging from healthy to ... and you will never get bored ordering something new or revisiting. You want it mild, a little bit spicy or hard core, they will accommodate. So maybe it is not perfect, they try.  They remodeled recently, a nice improvement and added a little more room, 50%. A lot of people come in for pickup and they also have a limited delivery range. BYOB with a conveniently located bar and liquor store in the same store front building. Across the street, city parking lot and Red Line Western Stop that can accommodate bicycle parking.
