my favorite sushi in chicago for several reasons: BYOB lets us spend more on sushi and save on alcohol they have a great setup for groups and have been very welcoming they deliver, and do it quickly the prices are very reasonable as well the waiters were really helpful on more than one occasion helping us decide on a combination of rolls that worked well together.
