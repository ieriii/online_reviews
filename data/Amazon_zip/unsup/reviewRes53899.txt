Went to the Purple Pig on Friday night with my girlfriend. When we got there around 7:30pm, we were told that the wait time was approx. 1 hr (note: they do not take reservations). We decided to get a drink at Watershed (Ohio and State) in the meantime. We went back to Purple Pig after about 45-50 mins, and were seated a bit early. The place is not as loud as other reviews say, and we didn't mind close quarters because the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. To start, we ordered a bottle of Cote du Rhone, which was reasonably priced, and the sommelier was hysterical (but knowledgeable). The first dishes we ordered were the roasted bone marrow and brussel sprouts. Keep in mind I would never have ordered bone marrow in my life had I not gone into this dinner with an open mind. The bone marrow was really good and interesting... the brussel sprouts were good, not great, kind of tasted like caesar salad. We then got the eggplant parm balls and the pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg. Eggplant parm balls were tasty, but a small-sized dish. The pig's ear was unbelievable - if you're thrown off by the fact that it's a pig's ear, close your eyes and pretend it's calamari. Probably the best dish on their menu. Afterward, we ordered the braised pork shoulder and prosciutto de parma. The pork shoulder was delicious, and the prosciutto was really good/fresh. When you're ordering, space out your dishes so that they do not all come at once. Things come fast out of the kitchen. Overall, the Purple Pig is easily the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago, and one of the best meals I've had in a long time.
