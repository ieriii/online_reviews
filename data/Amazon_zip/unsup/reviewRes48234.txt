My fiancee and I were in the neighborhood and decided to head on over to Publican late on Friday to catch a bite to eat. Our first time there (with a large group) we had an excellent experience. The food was great, the servers attentive, and the food was brought out in the correct order.  This time around there were some issues with the timing and the server which I was not expecting due to our fabulous experience on our first visit. Discretely, I spoke to the manager about the issues that they were having and they handled it just as a well run restaurant who values their customers would. We definitely would come back again.
