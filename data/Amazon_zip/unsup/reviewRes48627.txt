Being a porkaholic, I love this restaurant more than words can say. We went there for the first time tonight. I called first and the hostess said that she only had one table available at the bar. So we decided to head there anyway and sure enough, we were seated at a two-person table (vs a communal table). Yay! We ordered the pork rinds (so tasty), pork rillette (HEAVEN!), chef's selection of oysters (beautifully shucked with all oyster brine in tact), and the boudin noir/oxtail cassoulet (paradise!). We loved everything about all of the above dishes. I would order them all again except that there are so many more things that I want to try the next time I'm there. Max was our waiter but he had another new server-in-training who was very sweet but not as knowledgable about the menu. That will come with time, I suppose. Max was attentive, personable and reliable. He recommended a great blonde ale that was slightly fruity and sweet and he hit the nail on its head... St Bernard Witbier was just as he described. Their collection of beers is quite impressive although descriptions of the type of beer would be very helpful for us newbies. Everything is very tasty and it all is centered around the best animal ever, the pig! My hat is tipped to both chefs - Chef Huston and Chef Kahan! Uber-outstanding and all-around tasty. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
