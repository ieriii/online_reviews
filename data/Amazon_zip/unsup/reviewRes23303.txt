I really want to give them 4 stars, but I can explain why I gave them 3. -Food was delicious, but not the best I've ever had. -We had like 5 different waiters who were sort of impatient with us. At one point, three of them even argued in front of us, which was awkward to watch. -The food was a bit pricey ($10.95 for Mongolian Beef is the most I've ever paid for!) But they did give us a lot of food, which was a definite plus. I'd probably get something else from the menu whenever I go back. It's so hard to find good Chinese food, so I'll definitely come back and try another dish.
