3.5 Stars. Ok, I have been to La Pasadita many times and always forget which one I have gone to. But I believe this one (the sit down restaurant one) is the best. I do not think I have been to the one across the street. We all still wonder, " Why are there 3 La Pasaditas in a 1 block radius?" I usually only get the tacos here. Steak and Barbacoa. The Barbacoa was so tender and like a soft pot roast... yummy! I ordered the tacos with cheese since that is an extra...but then they gave me ones with only cheese. (It should have had cilantro and onion, too.) So make sure to clarify your order as sometimes there may be miscommunications. The tacos were filled with meat, so much so that I thought that one would be enough for my lunch! If you haven't tried the tacos here, it is worth going to and tasting a true taqueria style taco.
