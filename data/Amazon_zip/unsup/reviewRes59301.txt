Food. Great.  Price. Greater. Service. Needs improvement. I am a big fan of giving credit where its due and not just complaining. The ONLY thing wrong with this restaurant is the pace of service. Everything else is GREAT! The ambience, the FOOD, and the price. I am so glad that this place exists because its a grea go to spot when my friends or family are in town. Check it out if you can.  So good.
