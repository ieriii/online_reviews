If you like the Cheesecake Factory you'll love Grand Lux. It has the same type of menu, and same portion size so everything is really good and very large. I love their bread and they have awesome spinach & artichoke dip. They also have good strawberry daiquiris. Nothing like taking a break from shopping for a frozen drink.
