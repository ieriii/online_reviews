I was so excited to come here. I love eating plants! And spices...vegan cooking has to take advantage of cool herbs and spices, right? Color me disappointed. I ordered a sweet potato / curry / tofu burger, with cheeze, and I was really excited to taste something new and flavorful. New, yes, but only as flavorful as I imagine elementary school cafeteria food to be. The fake meats didn't interest me (if I want it, I'll eat it), but I thought the sweet potato thing would be delicious...and I could barely taste them. The cheeze (vegan for cheese) was a gross texture. I'm lactose intolerant, and was really hoping I had found a new at-home ingredient in vegan cheeze (UGH I hate intentional misspellings for effect). The vegetable saute side was really very good - covered in seasoning. If that side dish could be expanded to encompass the whole menu, I would have been a lot more impressed. And yes, walking through the tight kitchen is weird (what did that person just throw in the food?) - but the back patio is pretty nice.
