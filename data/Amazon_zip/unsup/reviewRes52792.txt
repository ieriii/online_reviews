I just moved into the area and am so glad this place is nearby. I had a dinner date last night and everything was absolutely delicious. We started with the tostones rellenos. I love the bowls made of fried plantains. The tomato sauce slightly overpowered the shrimp filling but it was still good. For my entree I had the Filete de pargo (Red snapper) which is something I will definitely order again. The portion is huge so I took about half of it home. It was still good even the next day. We sat on the back covered patio which was surprisingly warmer than it was outside. Looking at it from the outside you would never guess that the decor is as classy as it actually is. Love the murals and accent windows. I also appreciated that they had I Love Lucy playing on the TV. I mean hey, anything besides sports is fine by me. More attentive service would have bumped it up to 5 stars. It took a while to get glasses of water. Then they sat empty for a long time even though the bus boy couldn't wait to take our appetizer plate before I had even finished. Only a minor annoyance. The food made up for it.
