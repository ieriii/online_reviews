This place has some serious issues with its reservation policy (which is why I'm only giving three stars despite the spectacular meal & experience I always have).  I went on a Tuesday night and entered to find the entire lobby and bar area packed to capacity with people waiting to be seated. Long story short, we weren't seated until over an hour after our reservation time. I'd love to give them the benefit of the doubt that something went wrong this time, but the hostess says this often occurs when "we're overbooked or parties show up with more people than expected." I'm just thinking of the Seinfeld episode-- "You know how to take the reservation...you just don't know how to HOLD the reservation. And that's really the most important part." Once we were finally seated, the experience was delightful. The meat's amazing and service was prompt. I love the Strawberry Creme desserts. My advice--- go at lunch. It's rarely crowded and they'll actually honor your reservation time.
