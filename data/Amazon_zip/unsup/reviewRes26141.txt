I wish I could give it 3 1/2, but I'll bump it up because of the exceptionally good service. My boyfriend and I came here for our one year anniversary and it was very romantic. The service is wonderful, attentive and friendly. Our waiter did a great job of being attentive without being on top of us. The atmosphere is really intimate. I would go back, although it was overpriced. Fondue is always overpriced, though... and you really get a lot of food. Everything was really delicious and it makes a big difference that the oil was flavored with various herbs. My favorite part was the cheese fondue app.  I would come back, but I wouldn't hurry back. I think there is better food out there, but it is a very romantic and fun experience.
