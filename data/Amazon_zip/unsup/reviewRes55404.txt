Simply the best meal my wife and I have ever had. Original and daring, but totally cohesive. Among the highlights: seaweed appetizer, so fantastically tasty and complex as to defy description, and the halibut entree, seared to perfection, mixed with fresh herbs and too many other things to count, and delicious enough to convert a seafood hater. The watercress intermezzo nearly stole the show, and along the way the service was outstanding. Spot on ambience, including just the right music. This will be a future anniversary destination. Thanks Dale!
