I love this place and it's open LAAATE! San Soo Gab San is best with a group of friends. If you find small talk boring at the dinner table, then fear no more. You'll be more interested in the other aspects Korean BBQ has to offer: drinking, cooking your own meat, and experimenting (if you are unfamiliar) with the large array of side dishes. The restaurant is normally pretty busy, especially late at night, so the waiters may not seem as "friendly" as you'd hoped for, but I have never had exceptionally bad service here except for getting an untimely refill on my water. And yeah, there really is no decor whatsoever, but don't let that stop you from enjoying a fun and delish meal. My favorite dishes are the BBQ marinated beef and kimchi/bacon stew. And don't be afraid to cook your own meat. Even if you overcook it, it will still be good and I sometimes enjoy a charred flavor. I also use the lettuce to create wraps with the meat and just add in whatever side dish I feel like. There will be enough food to go around, so don't worry about wasting anything. One more thing...make sure you get a piece of bone to suck on after the meal. Bones preserve the best flavor!
