This place is great, full bar downstairs, great food selection at the restaurant, the after hours menu sucks but whos up at 4 in the morning eating Antipasta? USA Today everymorning, they have smoking and non smoking floors, the room was just quality. I dont think i have ever slept well in a hotel, this place changed my hotel experiences. It was awesome def. Recommend.
