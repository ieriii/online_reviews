The beer list is outstanding; I'll be back just to explore it further. The main reason I went, however, was to try the burger, which a friend indicated was "as good as Kuma's." This is not the case. The burger was small, not the temperature I requested, and I wasn't impressed. Particularly disappointing were the fries: I was really excited to try the Old Bay fries, but these were overcooked, dry, and not enjoyable. I'm willing to chalk it up to a bad night in the kitchen, and will try it again, but this experience was a let-down.
