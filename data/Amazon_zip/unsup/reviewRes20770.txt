I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Coast before! Like a lot of people, I really like the food here. Fish is pretty fresh and the rolls are good. Po' Boy and White Dragon are faves.  This place is ALWAYS crowded. It's very hustle and bustle-y so it's a good place to go to with a bunch of friends before a night out. Not sure I'd recommend for a quiet date or if you want to have intimate conversation though. It's also BYOB but they will charge for corkage fee. And unless you make a reservation, and sometimes even if you do, EXPECT TO WAIT! That's really the only place they lose a star for me. Other than that, go and enjoy!
