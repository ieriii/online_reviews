The star rating is for the restaurant ... which I think is the best Giordano's location in the city, followed by the Greek Town location. The pizza itself gets a five, and is my favorite pizza in the city. I'm not a fan of the "stuffed" pizza, which everyone seemingly goes for, but I have NEVER gotten a bad thin crust, from any Giordanos ever. Great stuff.
