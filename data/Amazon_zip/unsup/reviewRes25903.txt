This place blows melting pot out of the water. Yes, it's expensive but is well worth it for a special occasion. I ordered the beef and lobster dinner and it was everything I wanted and more. The sauces are next level and the perfect accompaniment to the meat and veggies. The cheese was next level and great with fruit. And toasted marshmellows to top it off! What a great night! The drinks were also wonderful.
