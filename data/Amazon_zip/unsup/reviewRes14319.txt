Amazing sandwiches...just really, really well done. I've had the Cubano (traditional Cuban) and the Lechon (pork, garlic sauce and grilled plantains) so far, and both were outstanding. Really good fries, too...unique crunch and flavor to them. The atmosphere is friendly and laid back, with very chilled decor and a nice outdoor patio. Nice assortment of coffee drinks, pastries and yerba mate sodas to round out the experience. Oh, and tasty shakes. Totally worth the hype.
