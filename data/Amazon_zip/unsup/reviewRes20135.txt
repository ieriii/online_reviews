Came here on my first trip to Chicago, to have dinner with my girlfriend's cousins. Ordered the pan seared ahi and a seasonal IPA beer. GF ordered the duck confit. She's a really picky eater who ordinarily avoids dark meat on poultry, and even she loved the duck.  Good food. Friendly waiter. Really crowded, downtown after-work vibe on a Friday night.  Would have liked to have had the chance to get more of a taste of Chicago nightlife, but maybe that's for next time.
