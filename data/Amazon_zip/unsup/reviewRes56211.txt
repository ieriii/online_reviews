This is one of the nicest cafes, bakery, desert place you will find in this area! If you are a desert person, you will LOVE their cakes! I am not even going to recommend any, they are ALL delicious! Plus, it is a beautiful decor, you can go anytime of the day, if you just want a coffee and a desert it is the great place to go and relax! The place has a very European feeling. Also, you can grab a bite to eat, they have a good menu, even though I haven't tried their food in a while! I am addicted with their deserts, so anytime I want to splurge I go there!
