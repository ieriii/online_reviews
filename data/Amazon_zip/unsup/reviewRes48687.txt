Very tasty indeed! It is hardly worth describing what I ate, because there is little chance that it will be on the menu when you get there, as they rotate it almost daily. The fact that they source from specialty and local farms really comes through in the flavors, which is nice. Its like eating a tomato or cucumber in a second country village that has been around for a couple hundred years. The service was great, and my cousin and I walked out of there spending only $55 each, were completely full, and a little buzzed. Great decor as well. Definitely one of my happiest dining experiences in Chicago so far.
