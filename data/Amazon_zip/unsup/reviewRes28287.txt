This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant hands down-15 years ago. I ate there recently for lunch, and have to say, it is not as good as it used to be. The amuse bouch/free app was appreciated and good. But our main courses were not so good. My friend had carne asada tacos and the corn tortilla were dripping with grease; very little cilantro and two pieces of onions. My Chilaquiles one of my favorite dishes (which i am always on the search for the best) lacked any flavor. I am grateful there were two types of salsa plus picked carrots& jalepenos that were really hot and spicy. Tortillas were also brought out for my Chilaquiles (which I never have seen before, and sort of redundant) The waitress was nice and fairly attentive for it being the lunchtime rush. I think they have gotten too well known and have lost their clarity and attentiveness for the food. So, Next time I'm in Pilsen I may search out a new place. Sorry Nuevo Leon but there are Many other mexican places and so little time...
