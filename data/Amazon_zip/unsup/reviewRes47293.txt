I'm hooked! Already been there 3 times since I heard about their awesome 1/2 off burger Tuesday special not long ago! And probably will make our Tuesday nights burger night, LOL. But seriously, the burgers are delicious, juicy, nicely done to your specification! My personal favorite is The Big House, since i'm a BBQ sauce and bacon fan, but other burgers are delicious too! Warning, if you're getting the Arson, make sure you can take the heat, or order the hot sauce on the side, it'll set your mouth (and your behind the next day, LOL) on fire! Still, super tasty, not your typical hot burger. There's def. a big crowd on Tuesdays b/c of the burger special, so if you don't want to wait long, go there earlier than 6:30pm or after 9pm. Space is fairly small, but with summer coming, I think they'll add some tables outdoor. They do play heavy metal music inside, but diff. TV screens plays diff. stuff, they play games too (just no sound) if that's what you're looking for. Personally I'm ok with the music, not a big fan of heavy metal but it doesn't bother me, or my experience at Lockdown. The service is nice, too. I didn't say great, but, not bad either.
