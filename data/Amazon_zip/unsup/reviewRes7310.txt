It's rare that you find a restaurant that absolutely, in every way, sweeps you off your feet. Congrats, Sapori...you've earned a permanent place in my heart and in my virtual & mental rolodex of places to visit again and again. You were, no question, simply sublime. Can't recommend going in on a Tuesday more. Every Tuesday, Sapori offers "Tapas Tuesday," which is exactly what it sounds like: tapas-style Italian plates. Such a great way to sample a number of different dishes and to get a real flavor for the true culinary delights Chef Anthony Barbarente creates. And this isn't a spaghetti and meatballs kind of place, either. You can expect decadence across the board -- anything from pumpkin-based dishes to those based around the most carefully selected seafood, meats, cheeses, and vegetables -- all finished with a masterful approach to both flavor and presentation. Portions are generous, both for tapas and regular entrees.  Aside from the unbelievable food though is the fact that Sapori doesn't leave a single detail unattended to. In fact, the ambiance and service was so exceptional that these things alone would bring me back. Live dinner music, a setting perfect for both a romantic date or a small group of friends, and a flawless approach to how a guest is treated from the second they set foot in the door...Sapori, BRAVO!!! Wine list is extensive, representing wines from all over the world but with a clear focus on different regions of Italy.  I seriously can't say enough about how absolutely amazing this place is and I seriously can't wait to go back...what are you waiting for?!?!?!
