I'm not a huge fan of the cornmeal crust BUT that doesn't stop me from eating Gino's pizza :) One of the best deals at Gino's has got to be their lunch specials. For around $7 you get a personal pan pizza, a generous salad, and a fountain drink. Depending on how much self control I have that day, sometimes I can make two meals out of the lunch special...okay, maybe that only happened once. Anyways, just a heads up, the personal pan pizzas are very "crusty" so if you are a fan of the cornmeal crust you are in for a treat.
