Delicious. I had been reccomended to go here so many times, I finally relented and was not let down.  Bright and sunny, clean and neat, not overdecorated. Food: Light and tasty egg white veggie scrambler, tried savory crepes for the first time in my life and LOVED them- gruyere cheese, spinach, portobello mushroom and some hollaindaisy sort of sauce on top and not only were they super yummy but they were also very light. I didn't fall in love with the honey cakes, a bit heavy and bland for me. But the friendly service, ambiance, food and whole package was awesome. The menu is huge be warned but you will not be dissipointed!
