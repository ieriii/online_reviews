Cheap, plentiful, bland Mexican food, very very boring, like you'd find in Wisconsin somewhere off the highway. My infant son dines better. This place is very popular and I don't understand why, except that the neighborhood has few Mexican restaurants of any kind.  I vastly prefer La Cabana de Don Luis, only a few blocks up Lincoln Ave.
