I didn't go here for buffet; don't know how often i'll be able to bring myself to eat wholesale food elementary school style... BUT! in terms of the food, i will say there's some nice hyderabadi biryani... by that i mean the rice is sufficiently hot and spicy to make you really know this place has a chef who's versed in spices, but the lamb, sorry, lamb, was dry and probably disrespected. It came with white sauce, which cooled the heat, but i'm not sure there was enough of it i also had naan (*great, but can a proficient indian restaurant mess that up?), samosas (nicely fried, lacked a lot of flavor inside--ouch), and some yum-yum paneer burhji (paneer is essentially hard ricotta, and for its texture and usage in indian cooking is absolutely dee-lectable). would agree with some sentiments that it's overpriced, cuz it is, but i will say, there is some solid true-to-form cooking going on here. i'll have to revisit sometime to dig for the golden nuggets on the menu. i saw "stingy" as one of the descriptors in one of the other comments, and yup, it could be considered that they are penny pinchers here--nothing wrong with that, indeed Russell Peters would find that to be a compliment, however, the most successful restaurants are stingy without making you feel that way because you would be completely sated...
