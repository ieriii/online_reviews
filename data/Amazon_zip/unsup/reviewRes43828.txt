It wasn't bad. It was average. Nothing on the menu popped so I ended up ordering a pretty basic salad that I didn't get to enjoy because my filet mignon came out way too soon. Between two people there were sides of risotto, sauteed mushrooms and spinach but there was nothing to distinguish them from any other steak house. In my opinion side dishes are a real opportunity for steakhouses to differentiate because they offer a lot of value for the money and allow people to enjoy a broad variety of tastes and textures by sharing. They almost make the meal, and for a very low cost. Though food was a little below what I'd expect from a highly rated steakhouse what ruined this experience for me was the poor timing with the food and the waiter who seemed more excited to hear that everything was good. Service should be more than... just... there and I eat out too much to get excited over food that is just slightly better than what I can make.
