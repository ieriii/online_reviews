I loved Geja's.  Because of: - Lighting (everyone looks beautiful in there. Dim, reddish lighting = a good thing) - Cozy, intimate interior (we got a booth, which felt like our own private little space) - Service (friendly hostess, great bartender (funny/chatty with solid wine recommendations), fast & attentive waitstaff) - Food (delicious, nice presentation, interactive and fun) We ordered the premiere dinners and they were served in 4 courses: Salads; fruit/bread + cheese fondue -OhMyGodSoGooooood; main dinners with meat + veggies; Flaming chocolate fondue with fruit, pound cake and marshmallows + coffee w/ fresh whipped cream.  I wished I wasn't so full so I could have eaten more chocolate, what a shame to let that succulent pot o' choco go to waste... I felt like Geja's lived up to my high expectations and I will definitely be back for another special occasion. This place is great if you're looking for something memorable and out of the ordinary.
