One word- delicious! My husband and I enjoyed a nice, romantic dinner at India House during our visit to Chicago a few months back while celebrating our wedding anniversary. Being a native of northern India and always craving some home-cooked Indian food, I was pleasantly surprised. After reading some reviews about this establishment, I was initially concerned. My husband and I always voiced some complaints about previous Indian restaurants we have dined at- our top observation was that most of the entrees at other establishments lacked seasoning and tasted very plain. However, as soon as we were seated by the hostess, we immediately observed that the atmosphere of the restaurant was not your typical Indian-style place. The ambiance was similar to that of a vibrant, upscale dining establishment. Dim lights, candles, and large, but cozy crowds of people (we dined there on a Friday night). A large selection of wines and a menu the size of a novel with a variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes peaked our curiosity. The spice level in the food was just about right. However, being the spicy food-eater that I am, I requested my dishes to be cooked extra spicy. The seasoning was also good. Not too much oil- just the right amount of seasoning to bring out the true flavors in the entrees. We tried the Seekh Kabobs, Shrimp Tandoori, Lamb Biryani, and some Garlic Naan. It's too bad that my husband and I live on the east coast.... otherwise, if we were living in Chicago, I guarantee we would be visiting this place every other week to get our fix for some authentic Indian cuisine!
