Today I was lucky enough to sample some birthday cake from Alliance. The cake was beautifully decorated in a nice green butter cream with a pretty paisley print. Inside, the cake was yellow with fudge filling. The cake wasn't too rich or sweet. Just the perfect balance! It didn't taste like the Jewel sheet cakes that I'm used to, yuck!! I will be ordering my birthday cake from Alliance this year! It's a big year, I will be turning the big 3-0.
