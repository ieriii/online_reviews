This place is great because it's so close to where out-of-town visitors already want to be. Every time family or friends come to visit, I suggest this place, and I've never been disappointed. The decor is noble, and service is always excellent (on a cheesecake factory level). The restaurant itself is MASSIVE, so the wait is never too bad (I would say 30-45 minutes max).  I always order the Schnitzel, which I've probably had about a dozen times now -- yes, it's that good.
