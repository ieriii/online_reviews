I have only been here for brunch, 3+ visits or so. The service here is always super friendly. I particularly liked my server on one visit. He was a bit larger fellow who took time to personally chat and get to know our table. He also talked us into getting a donut, but I was there with friends from out of town and it was kind of like one of those "yes" to everything kind of weekends. The beer prices are pretty standard and fairly priced. The bloody mary (it was actually a Bloody Lawrence) is one of the better ones I have had around the city. Obviously house made. Burger - All high quality ingredients. There is no way you could be disappointed by this belly buster Duck Hash - Pretty tasty and fairly rich. Although i'm not huge on eggs or duck. Boar Sloppy Joe - Pretty good, definitely worth a try. Chicken & Waffles - It's chicken and waffles, but the best damn chicken and waffles I've ever had. The quality of chicken along with the execution makes for some of the tastiest fried chicken I've ever had Mac n' Cheese - I would definitely pass on this. Looked good on paper, but did not live up expectations. I remember it as kind of bland and not cheesy enough.
