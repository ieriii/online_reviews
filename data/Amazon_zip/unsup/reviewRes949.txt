La has Pinks, DC has Ben's, Chicago has Doug's. To be fair I like Doug's better than either of the other two. The Chicago dogs are cheap and the fries are handy. You can get get gorged for less than $10. Yes the line makes you want to make like Wayne Brady and choke a bitch but you can't blame Doug's for being so lovable. That being said, I'm still a late night, post drink, bacon wrapped, dirty dog guy.
