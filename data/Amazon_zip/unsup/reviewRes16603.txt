Ha. This gets four stars just for being so out there. You walk through the plywood door, and stand in a hallway. In my honest opinion DON'T GO PEAK FIRST! Just stay and wait until you're through the line and get to see inside. It builds anticipation, or something. The drink menu is really extensive- I thought so many of the drinks sounded interesting. All the ingredients are insane: egg whites, house-made bitters, extracts, etc. I think it's definitely worth it for the creativity. Of course, it's expensive, but you're paying a premium for the fact that it's an in demand location, and because it's high quality ingredients. I think it'd be fun to walk down the street with a friend, not tell them where you're going, and then just disappear without telling them, and wait for them to figure it out (or pull them through the plywood door).
