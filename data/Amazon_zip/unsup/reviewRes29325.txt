Ordered their Gnocchi Aurora on a friend's recommendation. The green gnocchi was great, perfectly al dente. The white gnocchi, however, was super mushy, which was too bad because there was definitely more of the latter. Dish came in a marinara cream sauce with mushrooms, spinach, and chicken, but mostly I just tasted the sauce. I don't really like marinara, so I should have known better. The cream helps a little. I could hardly find the chicken. There was a sprinkling of tiny slivers of grilled chicken mixed throughout the dish. I still finished most of it, and was very full, so portions are good and prices are definitely lower than most Italian places, which is nice. But as far as the quality of the food/ingredients, it's a bit lacking.
