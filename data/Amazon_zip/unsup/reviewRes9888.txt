When we moved to the neighborhood, this used to be our go to place destination for good pizza, but quite honestly I think that it's a tad bit overrated for all the press it receives. The lines are always long anytime after 6pm most nights and the bar gets extremely crowded with everyone standing around waiting for their tables. I also hate walking by this place as there tends to be 10+ people outside the door puffing away blocking the sidewalk at anytime of the day. As such, when we do get Piece pizza, we typically order out and take it home since its so close to our place.  When we order from here, we usually get 2 mediums, cause who doesn't love left over pizza. Our typical order is the New Haven style with mushrooms and spinach, and our favorite red pizza with bacon and onions (trust me you won't be disappointed). On paper they also have a good Sunday special of a large pie (cheese only) and a growler of beer for $25; but who only wants a pizza with cheese not to mention that it's a huge ordeal to get the pizza and beer as you have to pay for it in the take out area, but pick up in the bar area from staff who don't really want to be helpful - so I no longer go this route cause its more a pain in the ass. It's a good local pie with decent microbrews, but I definitely wouldn't make this a destination eatery if we didn't live in the neighborhood. I personally would rather go to Roots Pizza down on Chicago Ave as I appreciate the taste of its malted crust and the offered toppings there are little bit more interesting.
