So taking the 'rents for breakfast and we chose 90 Miles. Lesson learned. This is not really the place to go for breakfast-y options. Although omelets are present on the menu, they weren't really "Cuban" style. So in an effort to put some Cuban into my egg white omelet, I added salsa, ordered up empanadas de ropa vieja, shared in some maduros, and sipped a caf latte. Will be sure to go back here and give it a try for lunch or dinner options, but pass on the "breaking-fast" and drive right by to one of the many other Chicago brunch options.
