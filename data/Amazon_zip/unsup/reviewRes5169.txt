A really fun dining experience! The atmosphere is bustling - it's a quaint space with tall communal tables that run through the center, smaller tables of two along the wall and additional seating at the bar. The staff really hustles around and seem to be very knowledgeable about the offerings from the menu. We were seated at one of the communal tables near the kitchen. The aromas that poured out of the kitchen were extremely enticing. Each dish that quickly whizzed by our table made it that much more difficult to make our selections from the menu. So many tempting options! Unfortunately, they were out of quite a few things we were hoping to try. I found this a bit odd considering it was a Saturday afternoon around 2PM. Oh well. We relied on the waitress' recommendations and she was practically spot on. I say practically, because she suggested the Prawns a la Plancha. Normally, I would be all about this, but with so many creative and intriguing options on the menu I was a bit disappointed with this dish. However, everything else we tried was pretty freakin' tasty. We sampled various cheeses, sipped a savory wine and let our taste buds ignite!
