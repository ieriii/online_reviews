First visit to Chicago and I had to make Gino's East a stop on the food tour. I never had an authentic Chicago Deep Dish and Gino's was awesome. I prefer thin crust, more authentic Neapolitan pizza but the Deep Dish variety is a nice way to switch it up. The cornmeal crust was different but paired well with the meaty and filling pie toppings. I devoured this pie. If I ever moved to Chicago, I could see Deep Dish helping me through those long, blustery cold and harsh winters. I left happy.
