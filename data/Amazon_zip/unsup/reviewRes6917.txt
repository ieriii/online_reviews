We chose this place for our NYE dinner based on the Yelp reviews. It was *good* but not as great as the reviews made it out to be. First of all, definitely not an "intimate" place to dine on New Years. We were seated at a table for two between two LARGE tables of partiers. Definitely didn't have the "date night" feel to it. My partner had the bolognese and I had the rabbit ravioli. Both good, but the highlight for us was the bread. Homeade and delish! I'd definitely like to come back on another night to get more of the ambiance.
