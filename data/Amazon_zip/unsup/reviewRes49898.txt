I went back to The Fifty/50 recently, and I would like to update the "service" portion of my review and add a "tip." SERVICE: Yes, our waitress was still your typical, cute sports bar waitress. But she was very good. She was alone; the place got busy, but she didn't miss a beat. She even apologized for not stopping by more often. Really? I underestimated you Ms. Fifty/50 waitress. You make me question my judgmental comment about all sports bar waitresses being "cute girls with dazed looks." TIP: The wings are best within the first 10 or 15 minutes of coming out of the kitchen. So factor this in when selecting your order size. We were a party of 2 and wanted 16 wings, so we ordered the 16 count. However, it's worth the extra $2 to order 8, then order another 8. The crispiness of the wings is a huge factor in their fabulousness (these are the best wings in the city! ... in any city!), and you lose it after 15 minutes or so. Oh, one more addition: The Wicker Park salad is a nice better-add-a-vegetable-to-this-meal pre-wing dish. It's not huge--perfect for one person; sharable for two who just want to feel less guilty about indulging in so many wings!
