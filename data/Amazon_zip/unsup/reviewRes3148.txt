This is what you're going to do: Friday night, get off work, school what have you. Grab a six pack of your fav brew from Apple Bite market across the street. Go to Crisp, get the Seoul Sassy wings and a side of onion rings. The food-gasm will last you the entire weekend/week... until the next Friday
