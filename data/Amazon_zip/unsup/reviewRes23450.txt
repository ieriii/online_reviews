I wouldn't consider myself an expert at Szechuan but will admit that this place knows how to prepare dishes. I've been here a few times and have tried different dishes and have tried to build my heat index palette to higher levels each time. The boiled Szechuan beef is fantastic but i will cautiously warn those with sensitive stomachs to beware!
