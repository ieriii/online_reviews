Whoo hoo, I get to be the 100th reviewer! Awesome! A group of us came here recently to celebrate a work accomplishment. I was immediately struck by the ambiance--bright and open and lively. And, I loved the HUGE pig paintings! I wasn't really a fan of the long tables, as it made it hard for all of us to interact. But, it was all they had. Now, this is not a place for vegetarians. There were a few people in our group who didn't eat pork, which meant their options were pretty limited. But, for those of us who did, it was a veritable piggy heaven. Different kinds of ham, pig ears in the salad, and ribs made my night. They had some great oysters and the seabass was perfectly prepared. The wine list was comprehensive and we had some great reds and whites. And, goat's milk butter, which is just the coolest.  I will definitely check this place out again.
