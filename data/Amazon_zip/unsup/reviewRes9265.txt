I've always wanted to try this place and I finally decided to go a couple weeks ago. I think people need to stop comparing this place to a typical Viet restaurant because everyone will then say, "Well, I can eat cheap Viet food at ____ for so much cheaper." Yeah, I love digging into a good bowl of cheap pho and spring rolls like everyone else but this place is French-Vietnamese and if you want delicious Asian food in an elegant romantic atmosphere, this is the place.  I was very happy about the quality of the food. We had the chao tom (shrimp wrapped around sugar cane) and banh cuon (steamed ravioli) for our appetizers and they were both fantastic. We shared our entrees family style and had the ga nuong xa (oven roasted lemongrass chicken), bo bitet tom nuong (filet mignon & shrimp over tomato rice) and the tom xao sate (shrimp and asparagus) which we loved the best.  I am still thinking about how great that dish was and how fresh and light everything tasted.  For dessert, we shared the fried banana wonton and added some vanilla ice cream on top (a must, in my opinion) and it was delectable.  I will definitely be back.
