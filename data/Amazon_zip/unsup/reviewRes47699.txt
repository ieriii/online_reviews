Zed 451 is in a class by itself. I love bringing people here from out of town or special events. I think they like me even more! The atmosphere is truly lovely. I always get "OOOHHHH and AHHHHH" when my guests come here. I look forward to coming to Zed everytime. The staff is truly wonderful. They are attentive. I have a shellfish allergy. I wanted a taste of the chicken and waffle. However, they had it on the same plate as the crabcake. The chef went back to the kitchen and made me a fresh one. Thats what I call personal customer service. The brunch is truly lovely. There's a wide selection of food to choose from with great brunch drinks. At times, you almost feel too full to get anything else. But the food just keeps coming. The brunch is definitely well work the investment. Zed451 sure does know how to serve up a morning crowd very well.
