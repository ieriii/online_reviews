Oh, Hopleaf... you're so good I almost wished I lived up in your neighborhood!  Wonderful atmosphere and delicious food and drink! I had this amazing warm cherry beer and the CB&J. It was a bitterly cold evening and it's like fate stepped in to make me feel all warm and cozy once again. Seriously, if you're feeling like having a bit of a nostalgic throwback to childhood with all the right twists to appeal to your adult palate... look no further!
