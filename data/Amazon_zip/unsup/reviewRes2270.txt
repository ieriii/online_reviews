This place was all hype. I liked it, but I didn't appreciate the staffs crap attitude and that it's 2010 and its cash only. I made a comment in line about it being cash only and the owner gave me an aggressive lecture about how I must not own a business (which I do) and I wouldn't understand how expensive it is to have a credit card machine. What I do understand is that he's already charging 8 bucks for a decent-at-best hot dog he can prolly take credit cards but chooses not to because cash only makes the taxes look better. This guy is an old school business owner who still thinks its 1980 where he can make short cuts and be fine. The place is okay but the line is not worth the wait.
