After all the rave reviews, I figured I might as well check this place out. I went in on a weekday, and STILL had to wait 20ish minutes (which, I suppose, isn't as bad as the weekends?) The service wasn't all that great, and it was REALLY loud. Sorry, but if I'm waking up for brunch, I would rather relax. The food was actually pretty good- I got the red velvet pancakes and pretty much fell in love. Basically, the only reason I would ever go back is if the place wasn't too busy... and judging by the rest of the reviews, I don't think that'll be happening anytime soon.
