Always good. Very busy usually but I've never had an extremely long wait or felt inconvenienced by the crowd - it's truly a testament to how quality the sushi is. The BYOB is such a plus considering the sushi is reasonably priced so overall you end up with a satisfying meal that doesn't end up being ridiculously expensive. They have a great version of a 'Mexican' Roll - which is my favorite but every time i go I can't shy away from "THE WHITE DRAGON" roll. Just do it.
