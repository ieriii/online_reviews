It started at the door: Reservation ?? Err, yes. How many ?? What time ?? - Well, not a good start really as they didnt make us feel welcome at all. The 2 of us got seated at a table for 4 - strange. Asked for sparkling water - that never arrived. The waiter did not explain the specials or point out any changes to the menu (something we overheard at the table next to us 2 mins later) - so we ordered a shared starter (spaghetti) that arrived promptly. Nothing special really - pasta was ok, but no spaghetti, but homemade we guessed. No parmesan offering from the waiter - who then filled up my tap water with ice tea accidentally, apologized and took my glass away. Took another 10 mins for a new glass to arrive. Both mains (salmon and pork) a bit overcooked. Sides small. Dessert ok - but was left at the counter too long so our ice cream arrived already melted. 2 secs after the dessert arrived the waiter came back to present us with the check we hadnt asked for - strange way to say "Time to go". And the place was not even packed. Summary: Ok italian food, but missing the loving touch/twist, fresh ingredients, nice patio , service crap. The place is loud and busy - nothing we dont like - but it just feels like superbusy and not "controlled busy". Def not relaxed or something, so not recommended for a first / romantic dinner date. We paid $100 for a shared starter, 2 mains, 1.5 desserts and 1 glass of wine - you can def get better deals for better food with better service and atmosphere.
