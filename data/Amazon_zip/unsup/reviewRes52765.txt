Such a happenin', neighborhoody spot for summer--or anytime you've got a hankerin' for good Cuban food. It took me a year to get there, but I'm sure to return. The patio dining is what Chicago summers are made for. I wouldn't advise just popping in on a whim, as the table wait time is typically an hour or so. Reservations are advised, and as we were warned at the door, it will be even worse when the spot on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (Food Network) airs in a month or so. While the indoor seating area is a small space and can be conversation challenged, the waiting area patio is fairly spacious. The walls are full of ecclectic art and profound quotes. Oh, and be aware that this is a BYOB establishment, although if you bring your own rum/wine, they will provide the other ingredients for pitchers of mojitos/sangria. What is left to be said? The food is quality Cuban vittles that don't gouge your pockets, the vibe is free-and-easy, and the Latin music playing overhead is a playlist worth stealing! I must go back for the live Latin jazz band on Tuesday nights.
