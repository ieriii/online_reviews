I'd give this place many more stars, but I only enjoy their food when I can get it. I just can't grasp why the "delivery area" changes. I have ordered from them before and they have delivered, when I call they ask if this is my name and my address because I have ordered from them before.  I called Sunday night, spoke with whomever picked up the phone (putting me on hold without putting me on hold). So now I can hear everyone talking in the back, and people saying I don't see why we wouldn't deliver there. Now a manager gets on the phone and tells me, sorry we can't deliver to you. Why? I've been delivered to before. Because we have to keep our customers happy....??? Wait what? I am calling just to talk and see how your Sunday night is going? Nope... I am calling for PIZZA!!! So when I said I wouldn't ever order from them again, guess what? The woman manager said OK. Guess you guys must pride yourself on customer service.... Thanks for the past pizza pies Pequods, but I am in the service industry myself and everyone I talk to about pizza will never go in and patronize your place again.
