They bring you every possible type of meat. You sit there like a glutton; drinking and talking about inappropriate dinner-table subjects (or at least you do if you go with myself and my friends). Once the meal is over and you have drank a few too many of their strawberry martinis you then exit the building, pile into Zed's complementary party bus (I am calling it a party bus, but they have some other -less accurate- name for it), and you tell the driver to step on it, 'cause you have other bars to hit. That's the game plan, follow it closely.
