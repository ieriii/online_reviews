I agree with everyone saying that this is one of the best places to get thin crust pizza. Although Chicago is home to the stuffed pizza, sometimes I really just want a pizza that has a good crunch to it, and doesn't feel like i'm eating a whole wheel of cheese. Upon arrival our IDs were checked by a guy to make sure we were 21, and if we weren't we'd get our hands marked by a giant X. For two people on a Friday night the wait was around 45 minutes. I expected this, but there's plenty of shopping around this area so it was no big problem. So after shopping for around 30 minutes, we decided to come back and there was a table ready for us. The service was pretty good, but we waited around 20 minutes for the pizza. I guess if they're making it to order thats a pretty standard wait time. But man, the pizza came out piping hot and it was delicious. As far as beer goes, I ordered a "Dark Bier", and while it wasn't as smooth as a Guinness, it was tasty and a top notch dark beer. If you're hankerin' for a thin slice, give this place a try. Reasonable prices, good specials, plenty of toppings for everyone to choose from.
