Let's see: delicious Korean BBQ. Wood decor and huge private picnic-style tables. Charcoal pots at your table. Open 24 Hours. This just might be one of the best ideas ever. All that's missing is a kareoke machine. I love coming here and getting the kalbi (BBQ pork or beef ribs), beef (bulgolgi), pork, (Dweji bulgogi), and chicken (Dak bulgogi) as the main dishes. Then sampling all the delicious Banchan (side) dishes. It combines everything I love about food: the sampling of different flavors, the delicious and hearty meat juxtaposed with the light side dishes, and the feeling that you are sharing a feast with your friends. This place is not really somewhere I'd recommend with one other person, you should go with at least 3 people. One of my favorite places in Chicago.
