I was pretty stoked about this place, but alas, I think if you made everything inside a Perkins metallic colored and charged 6x the price...people would like it more. The food is decent, but my god, it is so expensive. The waitstaff is pretty terribly disorganized too. I hope they improve as I'm always welcoming good food spots in my neighborhood.
