Every year we go to the Mexican Art Museum to see the Day of the Dead exhibit and then head over to Nuevo Leon for lunch. It has been a tradition with Christopher and I for many years now. Being wrapped up in the tradition thing, may cloud my judgement, but I really enjoy my annual trek to Pilsen. I love that it is crowded and crazy. I love the chips and the salsa and the cup of chicken soup they bring you, I love the ATM machine in the middle of the place. I love my meals as well. It isn't the best Mexican food I have ever eaten, but it suits me and the occasion quite well. Many of the Mexican reviewers have trashed the place, but it was a Mexican friend that first brought me here over 15 years ago and today as in every visit, the place was full of Mexican families, who all seemed to be enjoying their meals. I guess the nay sayers don't necessarily speak for an entire ethnic group, anymore than I speak for the Norwegians and Swedes. It is all personal opinion. So............ next fall, we will be back to look for parking, fight the crowd, slurp the soup, snarf down the meal and talk about everything we loved at the museum. After all, it's tradition!!
