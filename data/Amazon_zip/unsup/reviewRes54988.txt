Longman & Eagle was a surprise dinner for my husband when we traveled to Chicago to celebrate his 40th Birthday. So much of the yelp reviews are very true and on target. With so many wonderful food places to choose from in the city, I wasnt sure what his response would be. Longman & Eagle was an A++++ for unique food, atmosphere, and fab drink menu. My husband kept ordering and ordering items from the menu! We left wondering how to replicate the tartare which melted in your mouth. Waited for a table on the outdoor patio, and enjoyed people watching in Logan square.
