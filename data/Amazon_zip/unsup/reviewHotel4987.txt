This is the worst hotel 3 star I have stayed in in the past 10 years! It should be a 0 star. We stayed here because of the pool for the kids.The pool is filthy, has RUST & BROWN SCUM all over the edges and ladders and needs cleaning.The atrium smells. The continental breakfast is a joke-with vendor machine type muffins in plastic wrap. No restaurant either. No beverage or snack bar. No movies available on tv either. Pillows are more like a rock hard basketballs. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever used in a hotel and almost impossible to get an adult and child in there without getting banged by the door.The garage attendants damaged our car and they gave us the runaround for 2 days before we were able to file the report.I called at noon and asked why our room was not cleaned and was informed that this was not a regular hotel with hotel rules----it was the "Essex Inn" and was rudely informed that the room would be cleaned by 4PM. The hotel manager is never available.Poor attitude and poor management is the norm for this hotel.Save your hard earned money and stay elsewhere!
