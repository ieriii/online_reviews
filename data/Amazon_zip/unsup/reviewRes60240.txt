YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! My husband and I went here at the recommendation of one of his Brazilian coworkers and at first we were a little sticker shocked because the pizzas are pricey and we'd have to order two because I am lactose intolerant and would want a cheeseless while my hubby is all about the cheese. We continued to browse the menu and I saw that there was a 1/4 chicken meal that sounded good and my husband saw that they do pizza by the slice. We went for that and our dinner cost us only $9!! The chicken was as my husband put it, "BEAUTIFUL" - it was the most delish thing ever! The beans and rice on the side were also delectable!! Husband loved the pizza and we ever got free garlic knots since we sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen. Everyone was super friendly and we felt like we were eating in our buddies kitchen. The chef was chatting us up and making our mouth water with some of the other dishes they have. It was super warm and cozy and since it's right off the El - we'll FOR SURE stop here on a snowy night for dinner on the way home! TWO THUMBS UP! GO HERE FOR SURE!! OR order some of the pizzas for a party - that's what we're also going to do something soon!
