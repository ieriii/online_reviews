So it turns out that, upon further research, it was not the burger that made me sick on my last trip to Revolution. A seemingly innocuous detail that I left out was that my friend and dining companion ordered their Mussels. I tried one. It was nice. As I discovered last night, Mussels make me incredibly ill. So I apologize for part of my previous review. The burger didn't make me sick at all - the mussels did, through no fault of Revolution. So learn about your food allergies, folks, and then eat and drink up!
