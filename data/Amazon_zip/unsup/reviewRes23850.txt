Great spice and flavor. Service was good. The main guy in the room was entertaining. Had this military-like stern handling of the large crowds and line, but then could break into belly full laughter at any second. It was worth the wait, especially considering one can browse the nearby shops to kill some time. Food was the best Chinese food I've had in the city, but there are many other places I need to try out.
