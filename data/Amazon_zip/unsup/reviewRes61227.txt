We went here on New Year's Eve for dinner but the entire place was closed. Went back a few days later and was not impressed. I ordered the avocado burrito with melted cheese and sauce on top. The burrito was huge and full of avocado's. Great for the first bite or two but then it became way to much. A trace of beans were found but not enough to offset the avocado. The melted cheese was all congealed on the top and resembled a fried egg. I am not sure what the sauce was but the color was yellow, very watery and tasteless. Prices were good and margaritas too. I will go back again but just for drinks. Skip the food.
