When it comes to pizza delivery, this is my go-to place. It's programmed in my cell phone. Pizza arrives hot and fast and as I ordered it. So, why only three stars? They aren't always consistent with the level of deliciousness with the pizza. And should you decide to dine in, the service seems very rushed...even when it's slow. Beverage refills must be begged for and they are way too quick to take your plate away and hand you the check without even asking if you'd like anything else.
