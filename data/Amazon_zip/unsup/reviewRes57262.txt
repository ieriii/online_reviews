If anyone compares this place to Kumas they just don't know food; or should find something better to do than write reviews on Yelp! The space is a dump; the burgers and fries are no better than I can make myself (and I can barely fry an egg); and the service is non-existent. How in the world can you compare this place to Kumas?!?!? Did your mouth and eyes die prematurely? Come on people! We're living in one of the best food towns on the planet Earth! This town is getting diluted by people that don't have the same orientation for food as the people that have made it famous through creating it! Maybe this is another reason we're called the Second City (on our way to the Third, Fourth or Fifth)!
