Metal burgers? Yes, please! Don't be offended if it's loud. Service was A+ and so was the crowd. Order ANY of the burgers, and you're a winner (the electric chair is my favorite). This place can be anything from a one time experience, to you new 'comfy sweater'. Just go there, dammit, and I promise you'll smile at least 7 times.
