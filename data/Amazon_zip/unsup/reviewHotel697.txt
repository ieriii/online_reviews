I found this hotel surprisingly luxurious. Maybe it's because I had been living in a college dorm the past 7 months, maybe it's because I checked in at midnight and was exhausted, maybe it's because I had been having a stressful few weeks, maybe it's because this was my first time staying alone in my own hotel room and I treasured the privacy and freedom. I don't know, but upon entering my room, I felt almost as if I were at the Ritz. No doubt, however: this _is_ a very upscale Courtyard, despite being no pricier than usual. My room and bathroom were spotless and actually glamorous under the incandescence and the city lights, if that makes any sense. In the daytime, the room would look less relaxing. That's okay; I left early in the morning, anyway. Seriously, for $80 (weekend rate) and a free $15 Visa gift card (Marriott promotion), I was completely blown away.
