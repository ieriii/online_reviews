We frequent this restaurant on a monthly basis for the lunch buffet. I've been to Devon in search of good Indian food, but I always keep coming back to India House. It especially hits the spot when you want to sample it all, instead of the a la carte menu like most places on Devon. They have the full compliment of standard Indian buffet dishes including Chicken Tikka Masala. The Tandori Chicken does come out fresh on individual hot plates. The prices are reasonable for a lunch buffet ($15). Service is above average for a buffet.
