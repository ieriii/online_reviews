Good food, AMAZING service with a genuine smile, and unbelievable beignets. I'm talking mouth watering, eye closing, breath stealing beignets. I truly wanted to order more. In fact I wanted to order several more portions b/c there were four of us and I wasn't going to share again. Unfortunately everyone else was stuffed and I couldn't make them wait for a third dessert (we had the roasted pineapple upside down cake as well, DELICIOUS!). So instead I'm going again tomorrow with a different friend and again on Monday with the same group. Beignets here I come! Oh, yeah. I had the Sunday Night Pasta which was delish and enough for two more meals left over to take home with me, My friends had the Grand Lux burger, the chicken sandwich and the pot roast. The pot roast came with really good mashed potatoes and candied cabbage or something it was really really really worth it. The prices are not bad at all, I was fully expecting worse for what we ordered: a huge, shared appetizer (very tasty Asian Nachos), large portion entrees, beverages and two desserts for less the $100 + tip Update 12/28/09 I've been back to Grand Lux numerous times since this initial review and thought I'd do a brief update. GLC is still a favorite when I'm walking around downtown or meeting friends on the Mile. Or, if everyone is splitting the parking cost, even when I'm driving as I've discovered parking is a huge issue when you have a car. The food continues to rock, the service continues to excell. the wait continues to be long on weekends, but worth it. Ad the beignets, oh, the beignets. I've since moved to Indianapolis and friends and I have planned some of my visits back to Chi around the best times to hit Grant Lux for beignets. Need I say more?
