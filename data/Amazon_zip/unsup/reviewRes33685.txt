I went with my girlfriend to Yolk on a late Thursday morning as a spot before Target and Whole Foods. It was an easy walk from the Roosevelt stop and was easy to find with the bright yellow awning. We were sat promptly in a very modern-looking dining room which I can imagine is absolutely crazy on a weekend morning. We sat by the window looking out onto south Grant Park. Could easily see the Field and Shedd. We were greeted promptly and offered coffee. As previously mentioned, their menu is large - five pages long. Prices mostly in the $7.99 to $9.99 with $2.50 for coffee. I ordered the french toast combo with an extra side of fresh fruit. It was good, very sweet french toast, but nothing too special. Eggs were cooked well but the bacon was a little wimpy. The coffee was bitter. I think I would have ordered juice instead. Glad we tried it, but certainly not worth a wait in the snow.
