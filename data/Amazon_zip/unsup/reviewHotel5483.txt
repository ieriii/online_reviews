I'm not the type to stay in nice hotels. In fact Motel 6 will generally suffice; after all vacationing isn't for sleep. However, having been here for only 2 days I can already see why this place is as expensive as it lists. With a Internet ready business center, gym and a very attentive staff, you'd think you didn't need anything else. Well they have a swanky bar attached for some good night life. I was thoroughly impressed with the entire stay and would recommend this to anyone in the Chicago area.
