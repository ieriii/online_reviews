The short rib sandwich that I ordered was yummy. The texture and tenderness of the meat were phenomenal. The suckling pig sandwich that bf had was a-okay; wish it were more flavorful, and the habanero salsa that came with it was a bit too spicy for me. The churros were fresh and delicious, so was the hot chocolate. My complaint about this place is that they do not give out salsa for free. I have not seen or heard of this at any casual Mexican restaurants. Part of the fun with Mexican food is to have a variety of fresh, roasted, mild, spicy salsas that you can mix and match for spicing up your food. What's up with "these are not free, but I will give you one"? This place has its goods and bads. A little spendy for what it is, but I'd love to come back and try the soups (smelled wonderful, wish I had ordered that). However, I'm not sure if I have been convinced to dine at the other Rick Bayless joints right next door when I am back for another visit.
