We decided to go to the the Greek Islands for a friend's birthday. It was kind of a large party so we expected a long wait. Being local, I have been to this restaurant before a long time ago and enjoyed it, but it is clear that the restaurant now caters to tourists and out-of-towners. First of all, some of our friends are gay and the bartenders and the servers were incredibly rude to them. This upset all of us, but we decided to stay because it was getting late and we waited a long time. When we got our food after waiting for an incredibly long time, it was probably the worst Greek food I've ever had. Very dry, over cooked, and nothing special about it. I would have done better at home or if I'd gone to a local Greek fast food joint. In addition, they messed up our order and brought those orders out after another 25 minutes. Our server wasn't apologetic and so rude. When we got our check, we were charged for the orders they messed up. When our server came back to receive payment he argued with us about the tip not being 20%! He would be lucky to get a tip at all. All in all, after 4 hours, rude service, bad and over priced food and an over crowded restaurant I will never go back.
