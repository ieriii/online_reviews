I am upping my review of this from 2 two 3 stars simply b/c I love love love the location of the bar, for some reason going out on Kinzie underneath the brown line makes me feel mysterious, like I am more glamorous than I actually am bahaha, don't know why. Now onto the restaurant, I went on a Saturday night, was excited to go as I had heard good things. It was packed but we were still able to land a booth in the middle of the place in about a half hour. We did not stay for dinner, just did cocktails and appetizers. Oh, and I further caveat this review by saying I am not normally a fan of gastropubs as I really don't do meat unless it is grilled and served on a bun. We ordered the cheese plate, which came with fig and apricot butter. I am not much one for critiquing food as I am no chef, but come on how do you screw up a cheese plate. Even I know, you need a little nut action and some pricey fruit in there to make me feel like I am not an idiot for spending $15 for a couple dabs of brie, when I don't even like brie. Also, the booth/couch where we were faced the rest of the diners and was pretty uncomfortable (too low or something) I kept feeling like I was going to end up with a hunk of cheese on my shirt, but I managed to hold it together. Drinks were strong, so I give yet an extra star for that, and still this place only gets 3 stars. Hmm.
