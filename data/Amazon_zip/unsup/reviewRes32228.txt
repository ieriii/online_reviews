This is the first all vegetarian restaurant I've ever visited and have been back over and over. I've had some awesome meals at the Diner, but they are kinda inconsistent in the sense that one dish will taste completely different from visit to visit. That being said, they have a huge menu and usually several specials. The various tofu-scramble type brunch items are great, as are the Dagwood and philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  The cakes are often dry, but they more than make up for it with their amazing shakes!  They make their margaritas here strong, which is always a plus! This place is often packed and when you have a big group, expect to wait. The atmosphere and service are great though!
