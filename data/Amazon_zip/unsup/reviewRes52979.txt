I love 90 miles! We always have a great meal while listening to fun music in a festive atmosphere, either indoors or out. The servers have gone out of their way to accommodate parties we have hosted there, it's BYOB and we have even brought our own birthday cake. No corkage or plate charge either which saves a few bucks. We love their fish specials, plantains, yucca fries with the garlic sauce (Aaahhhh) and our kids love the chicken soup and shakes. Super nice place, fun, great patio, BYOB, friendly service, yummy food. What more do you need?
