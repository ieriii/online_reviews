If we are in the mood for a burger and a beer, we head to The Bad Apple. Their burgers are some of the best we've had in the city. There is something special about the flavor of those burgers that keeps reeling us in! The fried cheese curds are the perfect appetizer, creamy and delicious!Love the beer and cider selection (I'm a Crispin cider fan)! Great place for lunch order dinner!We feel very lucky it's only a block away!Kristen B.
