Wait, why haven't I written a review yet about my favorite sushi place?! Well, I'm going back tonight, so why not now. So, I'm not a sushi snob. I admit, I like the rolls with all the sauces, mayo, and extras on them. I also appreciate just the pieces. Here, you get a good mix of both. As everyone else said, the white dragon is my absolute favorite roll ever. Try the coast crab, also. Even if you are skittish about pieces, you HAVE TO order a piece of super white tuna. I promise you'll love it. It never disappoints. The thing I love most about Coast (aside from BYOB) is that it is ALWAYS consistent in every aspect.  Tip: Although South Coast is very good, it doesn't compare to the Bucktown location.
