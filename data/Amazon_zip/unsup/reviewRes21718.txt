Awesome, just awesome. Just like Rick M. stated, I wasn't going to write a review since there's 1000+ already there, but this place warrants it. I've seen Rick Bayless on TV and heard that he is very passionate about Mexican food, and this place proves it. It's not some fancy, $35 for a burrito place, it just does simple foods really good. Whatever the daily special is, get it. Some buddies and I are traveling in Chicago for work and someone highly suggested this place, great call. We got chips, guac and different but awesome salsas for starters. If you have a spicy lean, ask for the habanero salsa. We all got Tortas, mine was pork belly on crusty bread. It was porky, smoky, spicy, juicy, all at the same time. Then we closed it with very tasty churros, not "been roasting under hot lamps at 7-Eleven" churros, but right out of the kitchen churros, along with great Mexican chocolate drinks. You simply walk up, order, sit down, eat. Will come back again.
