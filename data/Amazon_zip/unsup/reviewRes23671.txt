This is my favorite restaurant. It's warm and comforting, with incredible food and friendly service. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. I bring EVERY out of town guest to Icosium. The food is phenomenal. The lamb stew and vegetable soup are both wonderful, and the cream of mushroom was particularly good, but I believe it has been discontinued. Sad. The Crepe Marrakesh is absolutely my favorite: sun-dried tomatoes, raisins, fresh mint leaves, spinach, caramelized onions, and cream cheese. It is just a little bit spicy, and the flavors blend together perfectly. A lot of people initially turn to the build-your-own crepe page, but I think that the restaurant has really nailed down all of the best combos. They know what they are doing. DESSERT. Even if you have dinner somewhere else in Andersonville, have dessert at Icosium. Every crepe on that dessert menu is going to be the best dessert you've ever had. Nutella and red raspberries is my favorite combo, but strawberry/kiwi and anything with banana are also good. The staff is fantastic. The owner is charming and sincere. The decorations are interesting. The whole place is just completely perfect.
