Forget for a second that this is a restaurant by the highly respected chef Rick Bayless. Try not to get caught up in the hype. Just relax, wait patiently in line, and let your guard down. When you do all that, you appreciate everything about XOCO. People can get caught up in all the buzz and miss the entire point about what XOCO is. Sandwich, soup, chocolate, and some pastries? That's it? Yep, that's basically it. But boy is it brilliant food. XOCO is meant to be minimalist (in menu), quick, and delicious. I guess the point is that Mexican street food - while simple - can be amazingly tasty. There is no fuss with his food here. It's all about the rich, authentic flavors in the food. At this price point, flavor is excellent. You must not skip out on the churros! Some people just get that and a cup of chocolate to go.
