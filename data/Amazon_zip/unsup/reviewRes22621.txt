Oh Tony, you genius bastard! How do you keep your Tony's three Chili Chicken so crispy! It defies physics. My usual lunch order. Dry chili beef to eat in and an order of Tony's chicken to go. For some reason, it tastes even better cold- it's pretty much the ultimate popcorn chicken. I open it up at home the next day to take one nibble, then find myself finding reasons to step back into the kitchen to grab one more piece, and this charade continues until I've eaten the whole thing. I've got several of my friends addicted to this same routine. Try it some time. Also, the big guy with an enormous pinkie ring that appears to be the manager is always bossing the staff in the most animated way as if he's Tony Soprano of Chinatown- it's really quite comical
