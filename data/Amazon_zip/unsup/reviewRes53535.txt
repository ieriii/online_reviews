Seriously...what is all the fuss about? I've routinely had better hot dogs in people's back yards, at BBQs. I went with 2 other people, and we ordered a wide variety of 'dogs so we could try many of them--not one was memorable. The 'dogs themselves are seriously lacking in flavor, and the startlingly neon green relish is totally void of all flavor. The only redeeming factor about the whole meal were the french fries--otherwise, this joint would be getting 1 star from me. Maybe it's just me. I'm an east coast gal, and I had the same reaction to Al's Italian Beef (also lacking in flavor)--which a ton of native Chicagoans implored me to try. In sum, I wouldn't wait in line for 5 minutes for these hot dogs, let alone the 1.5 hours we spent in line waiting for them. Hot Doug's is a Hot Food Failure.
