I'm not a banana fan but that chocolate french toast smothered with caramel and chocolate sauce topped with white and dark chocolate shavings and banana slices.... geez, it's a piece of art.  I love the fact you can ask for half portions as some of these dishes are ridiculously huge. Eggs benedicte, it's good but nothing special. I'd go for their more dessert like breakfast since they're just beautifully presented. Off topic, it's a brunch meat market. Put your makeup on and come talk really loudly like an obnoxious cheerleader while waiting for an hour on the street for Sunday brunch.
