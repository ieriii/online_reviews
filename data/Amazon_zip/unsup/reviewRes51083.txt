Hopleaf had an 1 1/2 hour wait, and we ended up at Big Jones. I LOVE this restaurant! I started with the crabcakes - they were really good. A little spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. For my entree, I had the Duck Confit Salad. It was amazing. There was nothing healthy about this salad, but it tasted so good, I can't wait to go back and have it again. I also enjoyed a summer rum cocktail - very refreshing and perfect for a summer evening. My husband had the pork bellies for an appetizer. It was actually only on the tasting menu as an amuse bouche, but they made it into a full appetizer for him. It was a great dinner, nice atmosphere, and a very short trip from Evanston, so I'm sure we will be back soon.
