i went up this past week and went to the diner twice. mmmm reuben and mashed potatoes. mmmm dagwood sandwich and sweet potato fries. also very nice to recognize the waitress from college and get hooked up. :) seriously, i heart this place so much. i finally checked out the outdoor patio area and it was very pleasant with lights strung across overhead. kinda puts you in a different place. anyway, in my last review i said you needed to get there an hour before you wanted to eat. this seems to be random. i think it may be easier to get in right away during the week and the weekends might call for more time to get a seat. even if you have to wait, it's well worth it.
