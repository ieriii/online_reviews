I've got to admit, I was super skeptical of a 1) gimmicky sounding, 2) new place in 3) tourist central Chicago -- but OMFG was I happy to be proven wrong! Seriously good food, with a sizable array of veggie-friendly options for those of us not so hot on the piggies -- which for a place with the tagline "Cheese, Wine and Swine," is a very welcome surprise! Given the trendiness factor, of course there are a couple brussel sprout (a la the new veggie hotness) options on the menu -- I tried the shaved brussel sprouts, which were cheesy, but different from how I've usually eaten these nutty monsters and just good. Eggplant caponata was classic, and came with some fabulous bread. But the salt roasted beets -- so good, I'm basically on a mission to figure out how to recreate the magic. Great, and affordable wine list with most options available by the half-bottle -- yes please! I can see this arrangement making some people very happy sitting out on the patio by the river this summer. And here's the real kicker: for the princess factor of this place, it's SHOCKINGLY reasonably priced -- like, I thought the check had already been split in two when I saw the grand total. STEAL!
