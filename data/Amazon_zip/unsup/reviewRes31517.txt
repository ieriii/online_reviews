This is one of the few places on the south side where you can go for breakfast/brunch and not describe the restaurant as a diner or family restaurant. The food was very good as was the service. The rooms were bright, airy and comfortable. I had the biscuits and gravy, the gravy was outstanding and was a duck confit instead of the usual sausage gravy. My wife had the omelet special and what she shared with my was good. We also tried the chicken sausage and of all the things we ordered it was the only thing that we wouldn't order again.  Overall I really like the place. It's the kind of place that if it were on the north side you'd have to wait an hour to get into for brunch (no wait necessary). You can take the parents or friends from out of town or go there when your not looking for the average 2X2X2.  BTW, they place is BYOB without a corkage fee, so this place could be a real winner for a Sunday mimosa brunch (you bring the Champagne and they supply the fresh OJ)
