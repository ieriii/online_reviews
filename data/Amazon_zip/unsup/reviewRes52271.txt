Came here while visiting an old friend who now resides in the Windy City. I asked her where a good place in the city to get a deep dish pizza was and voila, we went here on a Monday night for dinner. As far as my expectations for what a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza ought to taste like, this place delivered. Atmosphere was nice and pizzeria-esque, pretty much what I expected and service was prompt and attentive. As for the pie itself, it was very filling, backwards (dough, then cheese, then sausage, then sauce on the very top) and very tasty. Personally, I'm a thin crust person but I would definitely say that this place had the best deep dish pizza I ever had. My friend did not disappoint in bringing me here!
