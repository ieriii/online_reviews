Yum! I ordered the first thing I laid eyes on (the meat and gnocchi and asparagus) and literally cleaned my plate. Even slurped up a tiny bit of the bone marrow with each bite: it was so daintily placed on top of the entire dish that I couldn't resist! My meal was bursting with rich and complex flavors ... but somehow remained pleasantly unpretentious. Our group shared a slew of "bar snacks" ... all delicious. Even if you are not a particularly adventurous eater, I'd recommend sliding on out of your comfort zone here. They do it all (especially charcuterie) extremely well.  Service was friendly and knowledgeable; drinks were divine (I'd recommend trying their version of a Manhattan ... awesome)!
