OK...I am updating my post for this place. Last time I gave it only 3 stars.....this time I'm giving it 5 baby! Reason being...I have been here MANY more times, and the service seems to get better and better and the Sushi is AWESOME!!!! Seriously...so good that I crave it every damn week!! My first time here I didn't have the best experience, but, it was an off night and service tends to suffer when places are slower as staff is not as motivated. Anywho, I have been here about 5 times in the past 1.5 months and each time was delish.  A friend of mine and I went there about 3 weeks ago (on a sat night at 8pm and only had to wait 20 mins) and ate so much damn sushi we almost rolled out of there. When we left, $90 lighter in our wallets(a lot but TOTALLY worth it-4 rolls, 2 apps and desert, i think), we were totally in food coma and went home to pass out! Hah. The only downfall I would say is the new rule about the wine/beer situation. I guess you can only have 1 bottle of wine or 1 6-pack of beer per 2 ppl...and when we went, my friend liked red, so he brought a bottle and I like white, so I brought a bottle, and they couldn't be opened at the same time at the table...so that was the only bummer about that. My servers were great....cute blonde haired guy (Josh maybe?) who was very personable and then another cute blonde girl I had 2x..her name is Deliah or something maybe?? I dunno....but keep up the good work! I will be visiting again soon...HIGHLY recommend Dragon, King Coast Crab and the Spider rolls.....YUMMERS.
