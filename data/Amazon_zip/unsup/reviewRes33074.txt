Yum Yum Gimme Some!! 2nd time around experience was just as good as the first. Tried the Romanian Skirt Steak, it was absolutely fantastic, the steak was cooked perfectly! Our friend tried the Duck Thigh, OMG, so good! Owner made us feel like we were at home and even treated each of us to a crepe for dessert. Try the margaritas, oddly enough they are fantastic! Cannot express how much I love this restaurant and how highly I recommend you try it too!
