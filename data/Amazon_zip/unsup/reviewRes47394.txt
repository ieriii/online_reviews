Awesome burgers. Try the "Flight of Burgers" you get 2 of your choice and the chefs choice. All small size burgers. Add the baked mac-n-cheese... It's very cheesy! Good service. Drink specials... And half-price burgers on some days. Nice outdoor tables and a backyard patio! Comfy! Louder inside the bar playing heavy metal... But awesome experience!
