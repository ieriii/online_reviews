There's not much to say about "Art" except that it's the best stuffed pizza in Chicago, hands down. For Native Chicagoans: I dare you to find a stuffed pizza better than Art's Special. With spicy italian sausage, green pepper, onion, mushroom, flecked oregano, generous sauce (very important!), and buttery crust, I guarantee that if you try a piece, you'll never go back to Giordano's again. For Vistors to our lovely city: Make the trek to Art! Sure, it doesn't have the ambiance of Uno's or the prime River North location...whatever. But answer me this - would you rather be breathing down the necks of 150 other tourists at Uno or breathing in the delicious aromas of Chicago's best deep dish pizza? Art of the Pizza is the center of my pizza universe, and it should be yours too. Enjoy!
