What do I have to add? Not much that hasn't been said. But I did LOVE our server. He was so awesome and funny and sweet. Salad Bar. If you're like me, and love a truly amazing salad, you will appreciate the bar de salad. It's epic. Meat. MEET, the MEAT, fo real. I find the whole green card/red card to be so factoryish and piggish, but oh well. Watch out when you turn it to green, because those meat cutters be FLYING at you omnidirectionally with dripping slabs of MEAT. (For some strange reason, these men must be models by day. wow, they are sexy meatmen.) The wine cellar is entertainment in and of itself. Watch the pretty lady on the trapeze gracefully grab your bottle of vino. Even when she's not getting wine, she looks really awesome. cheeeeeezballs. Cheese balls? YES! Blobs of squishy, cheesy, bread. The most succulent little cheesy balls you will ever taste. I nearly hoarded the bowl of balls. mmmmm, ball bowl. Drooooool. Thinking of them distracts....me.... Oh, my one and only complaint, though quite a big one, is Hello Sodium! The meat is really really really oversalted. At first, you may not notice, because your taste buds are not yet overwhelmed. But by the fourth piece of meat, it suddenly becomes overpowering, and it almost made me stop eating! But really, no one needs this much salt. A few of the selections were nearly inedible. :(
