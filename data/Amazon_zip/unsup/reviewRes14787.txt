***WARNING WARNING WARNING*** If you plan on ordering the ropa vieja do not wear anything nice because you will probably get the grease all over you. Now with that psa out of the way lets get down to biz here. I will admit I am not familiar with Cuban food and what is good and what isn't good. But I will say the food here is fair. I ordered up the ropa vieja, sword fish soup, cafe Cubana and goat cheese empanada. Like I said the ropa vieja is a messy sammie but it was good and had red sweet pepper which totally made the sammie and I hate sweet peppers cooked but it worked with the sammie. The bread was soft but had just enough firmness to not fall apart from the wetness of the sammie. The goat cheese empanada was pretty good can't complain. Sadly though I don't know what the sword fish soup tastes like. There was a glitch in the new pos and the kitchen never got the soup order and the folk behind the counter didn't catch it. The cafe Cubana I thought was delish! It was sweet but almost had a subtle liquor taste to it. I do think that I will be back as there were other things on the menu that were calling out my name.
