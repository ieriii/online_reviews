No question, one of the coolest and most interesting restaurants I've been to. Definitely the mecca of molecular gastronomy, Achatz does an amazing job combining creatively presented and sourced food with palate pleasing flavors. There wasn't too much with the preparation of specific dishes that necessarily impressed me (ie, some of the best tasting dishes, like the hot potato cold potato or the black truffle explosion are not too difficult to make), but more just the thought that went into the creation and presentation of the dishes. Reservations, as you might imagine, are difficult to come by. I believe you need to reserve 2 months in advance, and call in on the first day of the month, two months before you plan to go. Service was top notch, and the food / experience was worth the time and money.
