This areas on the rise, or I'm just late to the game. Nanas a quaint breakfast and brunch spot (also serving lunch and dinner), located on a less busier part of Halstead, with an interior strait out of a high end kitchen advertisement in Bon Appetit. Plus, being this far south on Halstead keeps it less busy than some of the other breakfast hot spots in LP, WP, or DT. On a sunny Monday morning after a long Sunday attending a Bears game, 2 friends and I came in here in full Bears attire. We probably looked out of place or lost. What once was lost, has now been found. We were fortunate enough to find ourselves in good hands. Nana is family owned and using strictly organic products. Their menu will have you salivating and probably asking yourself, "OH NO! What am I going to order?!?!" My friend and I split their seasonal French Toast which was made with Michigan cherries, white chocolate sauce, and a cherry mousse filling. Wow was it good. I had their special of Steak and Eggs, with some wilted spinach, a type of reduction sauce, and a parsnip puree that nearly knocked me off my stool. My friend had a staple item that I tried a few bites of, their Nanadict. I see why they use their name in the dish, it's certainly something that will leave you saying Nana all day. The chorizo is house made, with a little kick. I make a poblano cream sauce (really easy) at home that's just like the one they use in this dish. Nana also has a stockade of fresh squeezed juices. Their juicer was down, booh hoo, but they had some OJ still on hand. Very good. They also make a phenomenal bloody Mary along with a very appealing list of cocktails. Me thinks I gotsta take the lady here for lunch and a few cocktails on the weekend. Nana is a perfect spot with a lot of quality food and drinks to offer. Friendly staff, attentive service, and a warm atmosphere. I Cant wait to get back to Nana.
