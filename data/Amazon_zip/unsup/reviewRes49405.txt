Nice atmosphere. Upscale yet casual. The wine flights are great and the server will even put a cheese tray together based on "I want mild flavor." I don't like the fact that one little piece of cheese costs as much as I might buy a whole package of it in the store though. The little cracker like sticks they give you when you first sit down are grainy and have caraway seeds in them....eeew. The bathroom was really clean and cool looking. Our server was nice and friendly. Although when someone at our table order the tuna entree it reeked....I wasn't sure that it should have smelled so fishy....especially since it was just seared...but I am really not an expert on that...just a comment.
