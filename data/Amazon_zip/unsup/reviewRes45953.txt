Grand Lux isn't miserable, its just pathetic. Why? Because it's just an overpriced Cheesecake Factory. It was created to be placed in Vegas because they wanted something more refined appearing than Cheesecake that had that special panache to belong in Vegas. If this is what it is I'm seriously disappointed. It might be intended to be a 4-5 Star but its not. I don't think it was discernably any better than Cheesecake for the food. The decor, sure, was done up a little better, and the prices were adjusted up a little bit. But the menu's are nearly identical. Why did I say I've experienced better? Because out of curiosity I had a dish here that's one of my favorites at Cheesecake Factory. It was served VERY differently in a manner which made it worse. Really you can't get shrimp scampi right? While it was was interesting, it was not at all what I expected (or what was described in the menu) nor leaps and bounds better then Cheesecake. I'd go back with people if they were going, but this place is absolutely not on the list of places I have a desire to return to. Is it horrible, by all means no. But for dressing itself up, it should be better. When you aim to be a higher end restaurant and you miss, you don't get any sympathy from me. Especially when you butcher a chain that I actually like.
