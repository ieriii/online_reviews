I was born and raised in Italy. Granted this fact alone does not make me a Pizza Super Expert but it sure makes me a connoisseur of great pizza. "Art Of Pizza" ranks as number 1 in Chicago. Simple as that. Beside the quality, I would applaud the price value & the quick service. True, the decor is bare minimum (but its clean!) Let's remember countless reviews on restaurants are based on 1, maybe 2, visits. Well, every food place can have a great day where the food is fantastic and many days when it's not so great..and viceversa. I based my review on the many, many visits I have paid to this establishment in the past few years. p.s. I never had Take Out or Delivery so I cannot judge it. But, for the love of Sophia Loren (Naples born) and all the Pizza makers out there, Pizza is not meant to be cooked then 'taken out" or "delivered". It's meant to be eaten there, once it's out of the oven. "Oh, they delivered it and it was a little soggy" or "I took it home, after driving for 30 min, & it was not really crispy'. Well... DUH!!!!!
