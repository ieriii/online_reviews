It's a tough call, and Caffe De Luca definitely runs a close second, but I'm going to go ahead and say it. Bongo Room is the best lunch spot in Chicago. The menu is perfect. Literally, every sandwich, salad and breakfast option is AWESOME. Whether you choose the Turkey and Avocado Club with melted brie and pineapple salsa, the bananna and nutella pancakes, or the eggs florentine, you are bound to find a winner. That's it really. It's all f-ing delicious, no flaws whatsoever. So what are you waiting for? GO NOW!!!
