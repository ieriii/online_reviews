When a birthday comes around, I order the cake from the bakery. It is so worth it. I definitely recommend the mango yogurt cake or the white chocolate mousse with a raspberry glaze. Most of the pastries are delicious! I've only been there once for dinner (had the Artopitas, which were good). It was a pretty relaxed environment and our waitress was attentive. I will mostly come here for the desserts/pastries/cakes.
