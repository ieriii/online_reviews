Store Review: Expensive treats is the best way to sum up a shopping experience at Fox and Obel. There is a wide selection of gourmet cheese, deli, chocolate, and organic foods (steak, fruit, veggies). The prices are significantly higher than whole foods in my opinion. They have a wonderful bakery section with a wide selection of desserts that include fruit tart and cheesecake. You can't go wrong with the desserts. Otherwise if you are looking for an expensive treat just check out the endless aisles of cookies and snack items that you won't find anywhere else. Pros- excellent dessert bakery, hard to find treats, expensive chocolates Cons- super expensive Hidden deals- Check out the fox and obel cafe for reasonably priced hot foods. Otherwise the grocery store is plain expensive without any good deals
