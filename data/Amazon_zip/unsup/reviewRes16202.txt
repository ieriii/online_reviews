I thought this place was pretty fantastic. It's not really a place to just go knock back a couple of casual beers, but as one of my companions noted, "This place would be the most money first-date bar ever." Fun little adventure just to get into the bar and then really elegant setting inside. Really great drinks - I had the Spring Sazerac (stiff, apricot, delicious rye whiskey drink), the Daisy 17, and the Hemingway Daiquiri (which was pretty spectacular). The drinks are clearly made with a lot of care, using housemade bitters and other subtle ingredients. It wasn't crowded when we went (6pm on the Sunday before Memorial Day) so I don't know, but I've heard that they don't let more customers in than seats. To me, that's a big win - it seems like wall-to-wall crowds would really kill the specialness of the place.
