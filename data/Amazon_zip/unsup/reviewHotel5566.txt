This revamped hotel has this kitschy 50s-60s/Mad Men thing going on. Not only is the decor all thematic, but all the staff are attired accordingly too! It was fun and made for a special stay.  I got a great offer off jetsetter and enjoyed the 1 BR Suite for under $200 a night. Plus, because my original room was not ready in time, was upgraded to a lake view, which had a calming effect, even if hard to view from the small windows. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom fixtures and toiletries tops. I can see why people have said the rooms are small -- and if I did not have the suite, I may have removed a star. I also enjoyed the cute neighborhood - a bit outside of the main city bits, but close to lots of fun spots, including Second City - another Chicago must. Plus, the park is just across the street.
