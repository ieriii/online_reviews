Went today after getting out of work early for Thanksgiving holiday. Just wanted a drink and a late lunch. Sat down right away by the bar and service was great and attentive. I got the carrot ginger soup and turkey on a baguette. The bread was awesome, not hard as a rock where it cuts your mouth. Turkey was fresh and tasted like it was carved. The french fries are amazing. Love the wine that comes in a carafe. You buy a glass but get so much more than that good for me!
