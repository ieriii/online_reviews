I have been going to Sun Wah for years, and didn't realize I have never reviewed it. For shame! Never had a bad meal here, or at the original around the corner. Fantastic seafood dishes, hella good Duck-LOVE the bao it comes with, Shrimp stuffed Tofu is so yummy. Service can get a tad slow when it's busy-but look how big the place is! So happy for them that the new location is working so well, and enjoy the "Specials" board when you first walk in, very creative! My only complaint is that the place can get REALLY cold inside, even when it's packed. Now I'm craving Sun Wah. . . .damn
