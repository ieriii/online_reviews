There are a couple of things I love about Glens: 1) Fresh fish every day! It is amazing. Large selection to choose from and they are delicious. The preparation is simple so you can really taste the quality and freshness 2) Casual Atmosphere - like a real diner - but with high quality fresh food 3) Cereal anytime, every day!! I've never ordered it, but I dream about the day I order unlimited bowls of Lucky Charms. Fast paced environment , good service, great food, delicious any time of day!
