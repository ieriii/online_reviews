Went back again last night with my boyfriend's annual gift certificate from work. This time, I had plain old filet mignon...absolutely delicious! My boyfriend had filet covered in pepper. He loved it, but it was way too spicy/peppery for me. Again, the mashed potatoes were amazing. The au-gratin potatoes were also completely delicious. They tasted like homemade mac and cheese...weird, I know, but amazing. The broccoli wasn't as good as I remembered it.  The appetizer we got this time--grilled bacon-wrapped scallops--also seemed kind of "blah" to me. But our dessert....oh man, our dessert..... there are no words. Warm pecan and chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. Seems kind of boring, but oh man, it was so good. Warm, gooey, chocolaty deliciousness.
