Wow. In a city with a million restaurants, this is the best one I've been to by far. In terms of great restaurants, this place was a triple threat: the food was impeccably done, the service was spot on, and it has amazing ambiance. It's your classic favorite italian restaurant. This, folks, is the reason you go out to eat: the experience. And does this place ever have experience! The ambiance is wonderful, the food is great, and the service is top notch. I just wish it was closer to downtown so I wouldn't have to drive as far to enjoy the place.
