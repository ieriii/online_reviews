Atmosphere, drinks, music - 5 stars Service - 1 star 5 + 1 = ~3, that's my math. We came in and let them know that we'd have a large group (aka we'll be giving you a LOT of money). They looked annoyed. The waitress finally let us sit at a large booth and pulled up some stools. Looking annoyed. This place is hard to find...part of the "allure" I suppose. Someone called for directions. My friend was talking to them and was rudely admonished by the waitress regarding their "no cell phone" policy and shooed out. If you don't want people to talk on their phone a) make it easier to find b) put up a sign alerting people to this "rule". The manager then came over and let us know that there are "certain rules" there. Um, what? Its a bar, no matter how your wrap it up, its still a bar. You are in Wicker Park, don't take yourself so seriously. Awesome place, but lose the 'tude.
