The beer is great, and they have some great priced beer, but the service was awful! There were never enough bar tenders when we went (we went a few times), and on one occasion they attempted to charge my husband more than the menu stated because he had had a few drinks. When he spotted the price difference, they said the price on the menu was wrong. He said he wasn't going to pay the price difference because they did not tell him about it when he ordered. They said he would have to give the beers back, which he did. The bartender then poured the drinks out in front of him. We have not been back since. I have talked with our friends who have said that the bartenders tend to be snobs, so it wasn't just our bad experience.
