Went there a couple of Saturday's ago. The interior was nice, and even on such a hot night the air felt pretty cool inside. Bottle service sucks, and should be put away. It just reinforces that while you may be making money, you really aren't the money, since you have to pay for a place to sit. Conspicuous consumption has never been truly cool. I don't think I'll ever give a place a review higher then 3 stars if I have to pay to sit down. It was crowded, but I would say the majority of people there were attending a black/white party in the back room. If it wasn't for that party, I think it would have been empty (except for my friends and I of course).  (edit) Since there was not much else in regards to crowd, even though it was a weekend, I'm going with 2 stars.
