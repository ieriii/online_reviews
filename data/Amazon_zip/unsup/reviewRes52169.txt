Apparently I did not get a good representation of what this restaurant does. I went for a quick lunch on the take-out side downstairs and ordered a personal pan pizza with minestrone soup. It was quick, and that's about the best thing I can say. The pizza was awful... I felt like I was in an elementary school cafeteria. The soup was actually quite good and I ended up eating that and leaving most of the pizza... So I'd suggest, judging from the reviews, that you skip the downstairs quick version and get what other reviewers clearly think is the excellent pizza upstairs.
