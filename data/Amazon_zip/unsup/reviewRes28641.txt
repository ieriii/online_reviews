I wish there were more stars. I have been eating pizza my whole life and I thought I had pretty much had it all. Pequod's blew my mind. The sausage! The carmelized onions! The size! I surrender to your gooey goodness! Sadly I no longer live in Chicago. But rarely does a day pass when I don't think about Pequod's. I shall return, and when I do. It's on. Big fan.
