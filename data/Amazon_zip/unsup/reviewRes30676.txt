I was able to celebrate my birthday dinner here on a busy Friday night. My waitress was also celebrating her birthday on the same night. I unfortunately forgot her name, but I really wanted to compliment her in this review. She spent the time to walk me through the whole menu and advised me on what I could order that was gluten free. There were plenty of options, and I appreciated her helpfulness!!  I was actually not feeling all that hot that night, so I went with the basic edamame and my own rainbow roll. It was one of the best rainbow rolls I have ever had. However, I did have a taste of a kobe beef appetizer that was melt in your mouth delicious. This place is definitely along the vibe of STK in Miami. A very young, hip crowd,,,borderline meat market. But, I was sitting at a table with 5 guys, and all the other scenery (aka, scantily clad chicks) allowed me to enjoy my birthday and little sushi roll in peace. They also brought me a beautiful gluten free dessert that was a mousse type entree made of coconut milk and served with raspberries. It was fantastic.
