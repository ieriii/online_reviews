I have eaten at Glenn"s more times than I can count and I am beyond pleased every time. Their arctic char is so astounding that you may actually question how such an amazing flavor can be purchased without making a deal with the devil, so the dish is aptly named "Char Diablo". The crab cakes are so good that Guy Fieri put this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives, and the smoked trout hash on the brunch menu is so perfect that it may bring you to tears. The service is always friendly, informed, and sometimes a little cheecky, and I may be a little biased in saying that Jules is my favorite server, but regardless of who your server is, you will always get the same amazingly delicious food. Their kitchen is so consistent in putting out the same incredible flavors day in and day out, that it is the one place I can recommend a dish and know that yours will taste the same as mine. I stopped there after work this evening to indulge in the all you can eat crab leg special (every Tuesday), and was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar since the tables are usually all reserved. While I was there I had a nice chat with some folks visiting from New York about places they should go to to eat while in Chicago, and that is why I came home to write this, my very first yelp. The all you can eat Alaskan King crab leg dinner( not that nasty little snow crab shit) is $34.99 and is of the exact same quality, if not better, than Shaw's Crab House, and gullet permitting, you get twice the crab for half the price . I have read another review that says they prefer that Shaw's cuts them open for you, but then they get cold if you are the sort that likes to eat slow and savor your meal. No matter how ya slice it, there"s no getting around the fact that if you live in the Ravenswood area, you need to be eating at Glenn's, and if you don't live in Ravenswood, Glenn's is definitely worth the making the trek to get there, just be sure to make reservations.
