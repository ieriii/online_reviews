Absolutely beautiful room and delicious food.  I'm a fan of the concept and find the prices to be quite reasonable. Service was generally good. The hostess, bartender, and runner were all excellent and friendly. The server we had was efficient but rather pretentious and off-putting, unfortunately. One example: she seemed annoyed when I asked her for a protein suggestion. My understanding is that this is a routine question to ask a server, but she apparently disagrees.
