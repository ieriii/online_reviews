I am Vietnamese and usually travel to Argyle for Vietnamese food. I moved into the neighborhood pleasantly surprise there is a Vietnamese restaurant right by me. I was skeptical of the food only because it's not in the Argyle area so I wasnt sure if it will really be authentic as most places claim. WOW - I am so glad my friends and I decided to check it out! Let me give you a run down on my favorite dishes I hope you try out.. The combination pho I can eat all by myself. I ask for fish sauce to add in it as I'm Vietnamese and everyone that eats pho will add that in, ooh and dont forget to add the veggies in. Makes it complete with hot sauce. There Bun Rieu takes me back to my childhood. My mom made this. It's so good and healthy. A very delicious dish if you are trying to watch your weight. I add fish sauce to this to. That is normal. Tonight I am having the caramelized pork belly and egg along with the stir fried spinach! Washing it down with their (hands down) best ice coffee.. If you plan on going to the Starbucks near by, skip it and try their ice coffee!  Their staff are super friendly which makes it even easy to want to come and dine there. I give this place 10 stars if I could. I am super happy that I finally dont have to travel to Argyle for authentic Vietnamese food!
