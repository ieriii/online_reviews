Um... ok. So, I'm tempted to utterly skew my entire review of this place based on the loveliness of the bartender's biceps. Shallow? Maybe... but - sigh - hold me, dear bartender. Why else should you come here (should lovely men not be your thing)? - Decent food selection for a bar (appetizers, sandwiches, burgers) - The nachos are pretty awesome (black beans AND romaine lettuce! The B. Family approves!) - SWEET POTATO FRIES! - Burgers can be served on a pretzel roll! Yay! - If you, like me, travel with a small herd of meat-haters, this place has a respectable selection of veggie options (soups, salads, burgers denuded of meat so that the meat-hater eats only the aforementioned pretzel roll) The Fifty/50 also masters the art of being both large and intimate. Yes, it's two floors of tables. Yes, there are large flatscreens showing "the game", but it was relatively uncrowded at lunch time, my family got a booth, and our lovely bartender/server man was very attentive. Music selection would likely be called "questionable" by someone with more taste than yours truly. I, however, kind of enjoyed the mid-nineties flashback.
