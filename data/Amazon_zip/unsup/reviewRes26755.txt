I had an excellent dinner & experience here last year. I even think I may have reviewed it and gave it 5 stars. However... On a recent 2nd visit, it was so nuts with the menu rules! I don't like being told what to do and be "challenged." I am just hungry for good food. Whatever, to make a long story short, and to cut to the chase, I was up all night with horrible diarrhea after eating here! FOOD POISONING IS NOT FUN especially when you pay a couple 100 bucks for dinner. Beware folks...
