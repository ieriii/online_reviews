I had dinner last Friday with my fiance. We were lucky to get there at about 5:30 after work and surprisingly got seated within 10 minutes. The service was excellent. We ordered two snacks: pork rillettes and a cheese plate, a scallops small plate, a cod entree, and a chocolate bourbon tart dessert. We were served something like an amuse bouche of fluke, I think, before the meal. After the meal with the check we were also brought a dehydrated, peppered raspberry bite on a spoon over cane sugar. They have a good selection of beers and whiskeys, as well. We loved our food, especially the scallops and the dessert. The waiter was knowledgeable and the busboys took care of everything immediately. We loved the food and can't wait to try the brunch.
