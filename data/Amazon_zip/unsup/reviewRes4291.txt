I have been to this place on and off for the 7 years I have lived in Chicago. I keep wanting the experience to be amazing, but it always kind of sucks.  Tonight, the bartender (the bald one) was in rare form and was utterly unhelpful and rude. I have seen him be awful to people before, so I couldn't take it personally. I suggest getting drinks at Fat Cat, Wild Pug or crew and then going to the Green Mill for the music.  This place is riding on its history. If it opened today, it'd be closed it a year.
