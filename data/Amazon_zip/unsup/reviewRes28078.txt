Being from Boston, I've always loved New York style (thin) pizza... But this is BY FAR my favorite pizza EVER. I LOVE THIS STUFF. I tend to get just extra cheese on mine, because I feel that any additional toppings take away from the buttery, YUMMY crust. And the burnt cheese, MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. I can't say enough about this pizza, it's delish! ;o)
