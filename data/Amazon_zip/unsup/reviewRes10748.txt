You may be headed here for breakfast/brunch, but don't kid yourself-- you're basically headed for ginormous sized dessert, parading as brunch. The pancakes are delicious, especially the pretzel pancakes with caramel and cream. The vanilla bean brioche french toast was also fantastic. The servings are HUGE, so I recommend splitting. Even on a weekday this place is busy, so be sure to get there early, and then try to do a few laps around the block to get ready for the pancakes.
