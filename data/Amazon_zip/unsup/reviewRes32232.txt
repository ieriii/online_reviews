I usually take service complaints with a grain of salt because I figure it depends on the night/server. I did find with my visit today though I had similar service issues. We went early, like 5:30-6:00, and were one of two tables there. I guess we caught them at a shift change, no biggie. But then our waitress kept disappearing for long amounts of time. Forget drink refills, forget waiting for the check to get to the table. We finally had to hunt her down and found her dancing. The food was new to us, but we really enjoyed the flavors. A good price for the amount of food and we enjoyed the flexible ordering style. The interior is really nice too, and we enjoyed the music. Just wish it hadn't of hypnotized our waitress away.
