I've had this place bookmarked to try ever since the Yelp Veggie Club hosted one of their dinners here! Finally made it out there tonight! Loved loved loved how warm and friendly this place was! And loved how vegetarian-friendly this place was! I'm not sure how Costa Rican food is much different from Mexican, but two noticeable differences: one good - the food was wayyyy less cheesy - and the other not so good - food was not spicy at all. The cheese empanada was the only thing we didn't like, otherwise the guac, tostada and burrito were pretty good. And of course, how can I forget mentioning the oatmeal chocolate shake - totally unique and exquisite!
