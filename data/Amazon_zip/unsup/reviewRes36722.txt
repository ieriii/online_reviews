I absolutely LOVE this place. If you are a breakfast fan, like yours truly, then you have got to try Meli. The atmosphere is so serene and nice, the service is always great, and the food is amazing. I am a fan of the omelets and potatoes. They have tasty coffee. Their fruit is always fresh and the hand-squeezed orange juice is to die for!
