a friend of mine took me here and i just fell in love. you walk in through this boarded up door, doesnt look like your typical swanky lounge door. totally hidden. you walk in and they tell u to turn off or at least silent your cell phone. they only allow so many people in. 1 butt=1chair.lol i felt like i was in alice in wonderland with the furniture. it was great. the first time you go , you must sit at the bar to see how they make drinks. it takes longer that usual, but that is because the mix everything, and add all these flavors, different liquors, and hand squeeze all the juices used. they do have absinthe and i drank it the 2nd time i went. I usually drink ketel sodas but not here. I just try different ones each time i order. I brought my boyfriend there and he can drink like no other. He said he's never drank 4 drinks and felt drunk. this is the perfect bar for him! we will be going back.
