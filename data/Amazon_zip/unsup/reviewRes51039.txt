I went there in the early evening on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend. We more wanted a big snack than a dinner. The waiter was really fantastic and gave us recommendations. We ordered a few hors d'oeuvres and split the fried chicken. The fried chicken was fantastic and we really enjoyed the crab cakes too. I'm really happy it's in the neighborhood... especially with so little good fried chicken to be found on the northside.
