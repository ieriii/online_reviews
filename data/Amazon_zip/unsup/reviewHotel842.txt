I really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel decor has a touch of elegance without being pretenious. We had a room facing the inner courtyard, so noise from the L was not a problem. The room was huge with a bathroom that was twice the size of a college dorm room. It even had a jacuzzi bath tub seperate from the shower. The location is perfect for traveling by train. It is a short walk from Union Station. It is also a short walk to the art institute, Grant Park, shopping, theaters, and restaurants. Ada's (the restaruant on the ground floor of the hotel) provides a quick and easy choice for breakfast or lunch. There is an L station around the corner, making it easy to get around the city day or night. I only have two complaints, both of which would not prevent me from returning. First, the room was a little warm our first day and night there. The rooms have an automatic system which turns off 30 minutes after leaving the room. I think we figured out a way to make it stay on just until the room temperature was better. Second, we wanted to watch a movie and relax but were deterred by the $14,95 charge for the movies. I might have paid 7-10, but $15 for a movie was a little unreasonable. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, although I like the http://hotels.com price for much better than their standard room rates.
