I work in the Mart, and this is the spot that we use to put up our customers or out-of-town coworkers. Its a big PRO that its attached via skywalk to the Mart, has a cute bar with a great view, and has its own restaurant. I also think they have been renovating the rooms. My word of advice if you're an out-of-towner coming for the weekend is that it is more of a 9 to 5 M-F kinda place and the taxi sitch can be a bit dicey after like 7 or 8 pm. While it may look centrally located on a map, its a bit out of the way for doing anything in the main hub on the weekend. That being said, they prob also have great weekend rates, and if you don't mind hoofing it a bit it could be a good deal. they also have tons of parking!
