Overview: OMG great Korean BBQ! Having lived in Korea for a year, I think I can say that this is very authentic - they even have obscure dishes like Bi Bim Naeng Myun (cold spicy buckwheat noodles), which I love! This is a great place for groups to share lunch or dinner. The value is good for the money and their bathrooms are really warm (I know that's weird to mention, but nothing makes me angrier than a cold bathroom with a cold toilet). A+++++++! Food: Order the beef kalbi! And the pork kalbi! And the samgyeopseol (really thick bacon) with kimchi! I have never been a big fan of bulgogi, but it was pretty good here. Like a REAL Korean restaurant, they bring you 20+ side dishes here, AND you can ask for as much extra of any side dish as you want (mmmmm fish cakes, cucumber kimchi, radish kimchi, spicy tofu nom nom nom)! And they give you rice and lettuce to wrap the bbq meat in, as well as two traditional dipping sauces (sesame oil with garlic salt and pepper and spicy bean sauce) to dip the meat in. I love to mix the different side dishes with the bbq and wrap it all up in lettuce ... soooo delicious. Bonus - you also get Korean miso soup with your order! Ambiance: Ok, so the restaurant doesn't look fancy or even well-decorated, but it's got the two most important things a Korean BBQ restaurant needs - giant air vents above the grills, and scissors to cut your meat and noodles with ... very authentic :) Just be sure to wear something you don't mind getting all BBQ-smelling. My biggest critique for this place is that it needs more surface area for the grill so I can cook more meat at one time! Service: The service is very fast - they bring out the side dishes within 5 minutes of you sitting down. While they aren't proactive about making sure your water glass is full or checking that you're doing ok, a little eye contact and telling them exactly what you want (more side dishes!) is all you need.
