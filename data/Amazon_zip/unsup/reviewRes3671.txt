There are already close to 600 reviews for Crisp as I write this and I'm pretty sure I can't top some of the great reviews out there. So here's the skinny: 1. Wings are phenomenal with an Asian twist to it. MUST TRY. 2. Don't want to get your hands dirty? Grab a Korean Burrito with delicious marinated beef. 3. Ask for a side of Atomic Sauce. Just do it.
