I went to the Gage for dinner on Saturday night and really enjoyed it! The good: The bread was really delicious--simple, but good. We also really enjoyed the crisp potato salad! The cheese and potatoes went well together and the greens were really fresh. We had the mussels vindaloo and I found them a little too sweet, though my husband enjoyed them. For our entree, I had the slow-braised lamb, which was delicious! My husband had the locally made sausages with the brie potatoes, which was quite tasty. For dessert, we shared the sweet potato cheesecake, which was really quite tasty, though a bit small. The bad: The service. Our server was not very efficient, and did not give us much information on the menu. Once we started asking questions, he did open up more, but he was definitely not the type of server you would expect from somewhere that charges $32 for pork chops.
