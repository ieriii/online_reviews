It's definitely about the food more than the beer at The Publican, and somehow the food didn't add up to more than the sum of its parts. Gastropub, this is NOT! It's a restaurant ... and the design is a bit much, honestly. First, the good: Potted Rillettes, fig & sourdough - just as it should be, though some kosher salt on the table would have made it better. Real bread! Sweetbreads, ramps, tangerine - rockin' dish, highly recommended! Citrus Salad w/ Beets - well dressed, though half the beets would still have been too many. Overall, quite tasty! The not so good: Sardines, preserved eggplant, yogurt - nope ... not even close. Sent it back. Oyster Plate - Oysters were fine, though just too cold ... also, mignonette is more than just vinegar & shallots. Wha? No horseradish? What am I, in the middle of the country? And who serves them on a pedestal? I'd go back for another try, but there's some hype here that the food just doesn't live up to.
