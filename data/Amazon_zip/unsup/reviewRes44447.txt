I used to have the pleasure of walking past Alliance every morning on the way to work. Even on the very few days I didn't go in, it was fun to take a look at the beautiful cakes in the window (the Halloween display was great) and the selection of treats is broad and wonderful. The staff is friendly and will come to know you if you're a regular. It's always nice to be greated by a friendly acquaintance handing you a tasty treat in the morning. They also have a jar of free dog treats for your best furry friend. Highly recommend it! P.S. Sorry to the person who had a bad experience with the eggplant sandwich. It's actually one of my favorites and one I've purchased repeatedly. The peppered foccaccia is superb.
