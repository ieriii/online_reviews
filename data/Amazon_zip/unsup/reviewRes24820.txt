Went there Saturday night to buy a cake for my dad, i love all the pastries they have :) We decided to have the cake in the cafe soo i was told there would be a cutting fee per person i agree and went to my table. 15 min later still no cake and its not like they had to make it it was right there sitting on the counter Ugh oh well we waited then the waitress forgot the plate and fork i mean really!!!. She never checked on us at all we had to flag her down to bring the check and she forgot and blamed her manager for not bringing it.. Finally she brought it with an attitude! but whatevers i wasn't gonna let that ruin my night. Definitely not the place to seat and it i guess
