Sunday night strolling on Damen and almost missed this little gem! Don't see how I could, really. I mean, the entrance and doorman were quite unassuming but there was some hidden innuendo that there's something cool stirring up inside. After IDs were checked and three curtain areas pulled aside, we were seated... on thrones! The venue almost felt like a vampire liar with medieval seating arrangements. It was quite dark and you'll need to use the candle light which was offered sparingly on the table. It didn't take long to decide. Their menu was very much organized to delight your whims. Expect to wait in between orders so bring your best conversational self for the night. Will go back for another visit.
