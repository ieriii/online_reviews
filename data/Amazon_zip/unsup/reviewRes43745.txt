If you're in the neighborhood and want breakfast, lunch or a cup of fancy coffee, this is a good bet. The food is quite good and the decor is light and relaxing. The food, while super yummy, is limited - there's a small menu and it barely ever changes, so while I really like their food it's also easy to get sick of it after a handful of visits due to the lack of variety. It also gets crazy busy during peak breakfast and lunch hours, when you'll often find the line out the door, and there's always at least 3 mammoth strollers taking up a lot of space. In the summer, there's an outdoor dining area, so that helps a bit. Overall, I'd say it's worth trying at least once if you're in the area. But I wouldn't go too out of my way to get here.
