I went here with some out of town friends bcs one of them saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and dives. I was skeptical, but went along for the ride and am sooo glad I did! We waited for our table at the green eye (great beer list) - our group of 7 was seated in about 45 mins. This is definitely not a place to visit if you are short on patience... once you're seated there is a lot of waiting on a busy sat night for your entree - but we happily drank our BYOB adult beverages and munched on starters to pass the time :) Here's the rundown- - Keep your meat order in perspective... we had a lengthy conversation with our server who talked us through the good and the bad. remember, this isn't gibsons, so you're going to be disappointed if you order a steak. chicken is a good option - it's high volume and fresher (and you won't be disappointed with the cut!) - guacamole - very good, but not amazing. - chifrijo - heavenly. mix it up into a mess and you will love it. - casado with chicken... super yummy Meal was crazy cheap since it is BYO. Our server was awesome. Definitely a great spot, I feel like a tool for not learning about it sooner.
