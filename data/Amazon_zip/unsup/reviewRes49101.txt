We went on a Friday night, it was packed and we expected to be waiting long after our reservation, but only waited 15 mins. The staff was helpful when recommending beers to pair with our food and also picking out the "best" off their menu for dinner. The oysters were terrific a must do even if you're not a fan of oysters.
