Obviously this is a date place. Don't even think about coming here unless you're with someone special (and looking to impress). That said, however, some of their tables place you very far apart from your companion, which blunts the romantic edge a bit. I have no idea how some people can possibly get a cheese, meat/vegetable, and chocolate fondue in the same sitting. What I usually get is the cheese/chocolate fondue for two (which comes with a salad to start), and we split a cheese plate. This is a f*ckton of food, and I am always stuffed. The salad is not memorable. The cheese fondue, on the other hand, is delicious. Purists may note that the ingredient mix is a bit different from what they enjoyed in Neuchatel (Geja's has a garlicky-peppery baseline to the gruyere and kirsch waltz) though I highly enjoy it. You dip in it various types of bread and fruit. The pumpernickel works especially well here. Be sure to make up some sort of game to play when one of you loses your morsel in the cheese ocean. The cheese plate is a good bargain (I don't remember what it costs but it is a very large portion of cheese), though some of their cheeses are better than others. Ask your server for the best stuff (ie the raw milk stuff). The chocolate fondue, is of course, delicious. Dark and cocoa-ey, not too sweet, and with the perfect dipping ingredients. Yes, you get to roast your own marshmallows, but you also get bananas, strawberries, angel cake, pineapple, and much more. So a dinner for two like the above, with a bottle of wine, could be done for under $100 w/ tax and tip (I think the food, tax, and tip alone would be around 70, so enjoy the wine!) A good deal considering the quality and quantity of food you get, plus that atmosphere.
