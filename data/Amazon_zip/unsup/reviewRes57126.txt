While the food was good, the service was worse than terrible. It started with the host and continued on until after we left.  I have never encountered such a rude server, who so obviously wanted my party to leave from the moment we sat down. She made it distinctively clear by dropping off no fewer than seven checks, starting from the time we were still chewing our dinner. She got increasingly annoyed when we continued to order drinks, and once we settled the bill followed us outside to show her outrage at her tip. Ironically, half of us didn't feel she deserved much of a tip, at all, we still put in more than we should. When she realized that she miscounted, and in fact was tipped well, she said oh and went back inside. Nice. Please avoid this place and give your patronage to one of the hundreds of Chicago restaurants who excel in both food, and also hospitality.
