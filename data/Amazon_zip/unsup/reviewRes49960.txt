I've been to Las Tablas twice in the past month - once on a Wednesday, and again on a Saturday. Wednesday night - dead. For a newbie the waiter recommended the skirt steak, and it did not disappoint.  Our Saturday visit had a few glitches, but overall, we were pleased. I had forgotten to make reservations, but called about an hour ahead, and the hostess put my name on the list (phew!). When we arrived, we were seated at one of the tables for four along the outside wall - good, but when the temp is in the low teens, they probably need a shade or something. We didn't have a "waiter" per se - as much as a guy who looked like a host who kept visiting. We ordered some plantains, then empanadas and one other app, all of which were good, but everything was pretty oily. When our dinners arrived (we all had the skirt steak) everyone was thrilled - mine was the only meat to be a bit underdone. I ordered medium, and got rare - but that's my only complaint. I could have sent it back, it wasn't worth the trouble. At the end of our meal, the server kindly came by, after giving us about 10 minutes to sit, and asked if we would mind taking our check, as there were many people waiting. Given that they fit us in, I didn't much mind - we retired to Witt's across the street for a drink - but I'd probably think twice about coming back on a weekend if I wanted to linger....
