The pizza here is probably as close to that served in Italy as you can get in Chicago. Wine is even served in the little glasses, just as one would get in a pizza place in Italy. It should not be compared to other pizzas because there is no comparison. I've been coming here with the bf (he introduced me) for probably 3 years now, and it never disappoints. The crust is delicious and always cooked well, and the wood burning oven creates a flavor that cannot be replicated. The ingredients are so fresh, we love the caprese, (he uses cherry tomatoes and bufala mozzerella), and I always get the Bufalina pizza and the bf always gets the Diavola. Soo good. Contrary to a previous post about the owner, he is actually wonderful. He loves what he does and wants to make sure that everyone who comes in leaves happy. He is always making rounds through the restaurant to ensure everything is flowing smoothly, stopping by tables to chat. He has a system and it seems to be working for him so far. Like any other good restaurant in Chicago that does not take reservations (at least on busy nights they do not), they will not seat you without your full party present. On nights when the wait is long (and if you get there after 6:30 on the weekends, the wait is quite long), he passes around a black truffle flat bread, and any time you come you leave with a mini cannoli.  I love this place. It is worth the trip, and worth the wait.
