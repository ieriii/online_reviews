THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. It's true. If what you love is the neighborhood joint with gooood solid food, this may not be the place for you. However, if you get tired of the same food, if you are adventurous with your food (not a picky, easily squeemish eater), and don't mind dishing 110 for a meal (plus, it's byob. what can be better??? i pay 2/3rd the price of the menu for wine at Alinea), then it's perfect. The food is GENIUS. I have been there five times (the most recent being this past Friday) and of 36 courses (I've done the 10 and 3 course), I have flat out not enjoyed only ONE of them. At Alinea, through the 13 course meal, I will always have 2-3 that I think just don't work quite well. Schwa doesn't have the attention to every detail Alinea has, but it's just so much more fun, unpretentious, and relaxing. They recommend you to bring a bottle of wine per person. They give you extra courses. They will share with you their favorite beer or wine that pairs well with a particular course. If you're in town for one night, sure, go to Alinea for the oh so comfortable, cushy arm chairs and impeccable service. But, if you're here for a week, don't miss Schwa for a fun, adventurous, wine-full weeknight dinner. My favorite item on the menu (that i hope they never get rid of) is the rootbeer maki. It's green curry rice with hamachi in the middle wrapped in a leaf that has a root beer-like flavor. On top is dehydrated tamago (fish eggs) with rootbeer soysauce for dipping, a rootbeer shot for sipping, and a side of pickled carrot (much more delicate than pickled ginger). It sounds weird, but SO AMAZING!!! Your expectations have to be realistic in terms of service and atmosphere. They play whatever rap/hip-hop is on the ipod. Tip: if you want to get a reservation, call them every 20-30 minutes around 11am-4pm while you're at work. just give them a dial and they'll eventually pick up.
