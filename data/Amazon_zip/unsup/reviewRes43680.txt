My first question was - are your steaks prime? "No" and I knew almost immediately that it wasn't going to be anything special. It really wasn't that good, though not terrible - and I wouldn't go back. There are so many awesome chophouse/ steakhouses to go to, why waste time here. I was pretty disappointed that none of their steaks were prime and the server knew very little about the meat. Sounds silly but when your spending so much on a good steak, I'd like to know it's the best available - not just some beef that I could buy at the supermarket. I'd say skip it and hit up one of many prime steakhouses in Chicago.
