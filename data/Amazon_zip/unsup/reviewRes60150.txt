I love this place. And it makes me really happy to see that they are doing well. The last time I visited, it was a Monday night and the place was packed: good sign. We were still seated within five minutes of walking in and our meal was cooked remarkably fast as well. We started with tofu spring rolls, which were so good my roommate got a second order of them for us to share. Then for the main course, I got a huge and delicious bowl of pho which included all of the "nasty bits" I love. All I can remember was tripe and this really tasty gelatenous thing. But the real winner in the dish was the thinly sliced beef, which was still medium-rare when it got to the table and had cooked all the way through by the time I finished it. So tender, so delicious. I can't honestly remember what my roommate got, but it looked good as well. They also serve this really delightful condiment plate which includes fresh peppers, bean sprouts, leafy herbs, etc. to compliment your meal.In addition, they have a new delivery service. Sold!In summary, I would recommend Tank Noodle to anyone. Go there.
