Took my lady here on a date last night and wow were we very pleased with our night out! As you walk in the restaurant is small with nicely set tables lining the room. The lighting was nice and dim, but not too dark as you can clearly see the people at your table. We were seated immediately as we arrived around 6:00 on a Saturday night. Thanks Yelpers for the advice of arriving early! (As the night went on the line was very long to get a table, we had to squeeze through the doorway lined with people. BYOB as everyone has stated with no corkage fee. We brought 2 bottles of wine and our first was opened in a very timely fashion. We started off with the calamari as an appetizer, it was very delicious and tasty. They also give you bread with your choice of spices with oil.  I ordered the Spinach Gnocchi Gorgonzola special. Amazing, I thought the gorgonzola flavor might be a bit overwhelming, but it wasn't and my dish was pretty much perfectly made. The gnocchi was top notch. My date had the tri-colored rotolo which she liked very much. I tried it myself and really liked the spinach and ricotta cheese combo.  Ended the night with Tiramisu for dessert, boy did that do the trick, very light and delicious. Prices weren't too bad, I was pleased with our bill at the end of the night perfect for the quality of the food and service! Waiter was very informative and attentive for the most part.  They dim the lights even more as the night goes on, which we thought was appropriate, gave us at least a nice intimate dinner feel. Wasn't too loud, although when we left the BYOB was taking full effect haha. Good times, will be back again!
