I was introduced to Nuevo Leon by a friend of mine that's been coming here for years. It's sort of a pain to get to (if you live on the northside like me) but the food makes the trip well worth the time. The soup is definitely a great start to the dinner. I usually get the enchiladas en mole, either chicken or just cheese. Growing up on homemade mexican food, Nuevo Leon is by far the most authentic mexican restaurant that I have been to. It is BYOB, but you can't beat finding a dinner anywhere else, or that tastes as great, for just 6 bucks. HIghly recommend.  Also, the validated parking is a huge plus if you are traveling from far away.
