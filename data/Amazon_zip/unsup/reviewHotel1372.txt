As with most http://Hotwire.com deals, we reserved a room and found out upon checking in that it was, indeed, a king-sized bed to be shared between four people. Aside from the cramped arrangements, the hotel was excellent. The hotel bar was expensive (as is anything in the Loop), and the ceilings were pretty low. My only other gripe was that the door to the bathroom was a sliding door, and left a rather large and awkward open space between the panel and the wall. Other than that, the room and hotel itself were very nice, and the location was excellent - right across the street from The Drake and footsteps from Michigan Avenue.
