I want to give The Publican 3 and a half stars because it is better than three stars but not quite 4 in my opinion. A friend and I had the bright idea to come here after gorging at Hot Doug's and drooling over crawfish sausage we devoured.  It was late afternoon/early evening and thought it would be a good time to go before dinner service for a little "nosh" if you will. The decor is really sleek and old school at the same time with balls of light hanging and a massive communal table that'll make King Arthur look poor. We opted to seat in one of the side tables close to the windows.  We started off with a dozen oysters without realizing that each oyster cost 3 dollars and up. I don't mind paying for a fair deal but I felt sort of shorted by the size of the oyster and the mignonette sauce that came with. It wasn't the quality that I was expecting and in between this our charcuterie plate took about 25 minutes to come out, from what I saw was a few items really worth calling a charcuterie platter. The sausage was flavorful, the beef shoulder was good, but I was really disappointed with the head cheese because it came out in this weird mash up looking thing. This set us back 21 dollars. The next item we ordered took another 20 minutes to come out which was the best part of our super extravagant snack and they were the mussels which I swear initially tasted a bouillon cube but I gave it the benefit of the doubt because they were very succulent and plentiful.  It wasn't a terrible experience and it wasn't a great experience. I try to steer clear of places that have so much hype built to it because I feel like it ends up being a lot of fluff and kind of hokey. I get it, pigs are awesome. And just because a place is known for one kind of meat shouldn't mean they should do everything sub par...just don't have it on the menu if you know its not going to be as good as the "pig."  We left craving the crawfish sausage from Hot Dougs still.
