Overall: 2.8 star overpriced mediocre-to mildly inspired cuisine Drinks: 3.5 star passionfruit frozen margarita - great passionfruit flavor, not that syrupy taste that passionfruit drinks tend to carry mojito (standard) - plenty of fresh mint and lime, refreshing millionario mojito (champagne) - bartender did not mess around, made this ultra-strong Food: 2.8-star arroz con mariscos (seafood paella) - delicious, saffron rice had well-balanced portions of mussels, clams, shrimp, chorizo, calamari. lobster broth added excellent flavor. chuletta (grilled pork chop, bacon-plantain fufu, caramelized onion broth) - nicely presented roasted squash - nearly stole the show as a side - well-roasted under Chihuahua cheese ropa vieja - not sure what the buzz is about - over-seasoned, way too salty/sweet, drowned out any complementary flavor the queso fresco and spicy mayo were intended to add. empanada de maiz - most disappointing dish, a sole empanda and a cup of bland vegetables should probably not qualify as an entree. ice cream cake - epic fail - colossal tower of tasteless ice creams (faintly flavored pineapple, pistachio, strawberry) wedged btw bland chocolate cake. Service: 2.75-star while service was upbeat throughout, took 20 minutes to settle bill. Ambiance: 2.5-star despite being seated in one of the private rooms, the overall noise level was still such that table talk was a shouting match. While Carnivale certainly has the space to handle large parties, plenty of preferred options in Chicago that execute superior cuisine / experience.
