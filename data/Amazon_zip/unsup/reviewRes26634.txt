Yummy... I came in one late night for a slice and couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about. But today I brought a friend here and we ordered an entire pan pizza. That's the only way the carmelized crust comes and it's the only way you should order your pizza here. This crust is fabulous. We got ground beef and mushroom on one half, pepperoni and green pepper on the other. Skip the ground beef and order pepperoni. They put the ingredients on top of the sauce and cheese and for me, this is an Absolute MUST! It keeps the ingredients from getting wet and soggy. I don't know who decided to do it the other way but pizza is not pizza with wet meat under the cheese.  The service here is fabulous. They get you served up fast and check back on you. You know, the way it's supposed to be done. You cannot miss the bathrooms. They are pointed out by a neon sign larger than the beer signs. I like that. I wonder, though, how many people still ask where the bathrooms are. Nothing special inside. Reminded me of my dorm bathrooms.
