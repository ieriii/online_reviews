With Rev I feel kind of like we broke up and are trying to stay friends. Previously this would have absolutely been a 5 star review for me, but the recent food menu change removed my beloved duck bruschetta (all the bruschettas got the axe). The duck pizza was also ditched. For me, I am happy with duck year round, but if you're shooting to do seasonal ingredients, how come other restaurants who focus on local ingredients do duck in the fall and winter and Rev only did it in spring/summer? Ponder that. Anyhow, the applewood smoked wings are pretty tasty, but they are no true substitute and they are a wee bit expensive. I do enjoy a few of the stouts and porters Rev makes though, so I will be back, but perhaps next time I'll just sit at the bar instead of ordering a meal.
