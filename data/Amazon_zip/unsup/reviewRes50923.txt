I came here for brunch with a girlfriend last weekend. The place is pretty big but was already crowded when we arrived at 9 AM on a Saturday. I had the crab benedict which was good but nothing too special. I also had the mango fruit smoothie which was really delicious. Service was good, and it seems like a great place to bring kids -- very family friendly. I would come back if I were in the neighborhood.
