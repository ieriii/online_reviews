Ruth's Chris makes the playoffs but not the World Series. No doubt, it's a fantastic steakhouse and I still want to find out where I can get my hands on a broiler that goes up to 1800 degrees. I had the Kansas City bone-in strip, au poivre. Because I got it au poivre I cannot attest to the butter sauce, but I can attest to the poivre. Delicious - right up there with the best steaks I've ever had. One point is deducted for the following reasons: The sides aren't quite as impressive as at similar establishments. At 8:00 on the dot, they switched the music from Sarah Vaughan who had been serenading us sweetly all evening, to some sort of club-type lounge music that didn't seem to fit as well as Sarah. Compared to other restuarants of its caliber, I feel the service was middle-of-the-pack (which means it's above-average service but not blow-your-mind).
