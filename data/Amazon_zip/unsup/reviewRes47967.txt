I'd like to counter-review the post below about the recent party. I was the planner of said party and although it did not go off without a hitch, it turned out to be a great party and everyone had a fabulous time at ZED451. I quoted everyone (on paper) $80 per person, which was before tax and tip and included drinks, desserts, and sides. We ended up drinking and having a ball well beyond our allotted time and were charged accordingly. The bill was a lot more than we expected and felt was fair so the managers worked with us to bring it down to a level we all felt was right. All in all we had a great time at this place and I would plan another party there. I may quote my guests more like $125 per person though, but in a large group for a rocking party, that's not so bad. The food was great and so was the service. Several staff members even followed up with me after it was over. Most of the problems we had could have been prevented had I been more clear with each and every guest. Sorry, guys! In a large party the communication is bound to be a little off. I will try be a little more clear in the future :)
