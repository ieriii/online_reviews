My wife and I love Ruth's. The veal osso buco ravioli with spinach appetizer is awesome. I have had both the ribeye and filet on multiple occasions, and both are delicious. The only complaint I can think of is that they got rid of the tuna stack, which my wife loved. She seems to still enjoy going there and downing the filet every time. The drink menu is pretty decent too, and there are some cool bars in the area.
