My husband was in town for a 2week project and this was the "recommended" hotel by his customer base on its location. He called the hotel to book the reservation and was routed to the 800 reservation desk. We could get the room for less but ended up paying $40 more per night and was told so we would have free internet and free access to the gym. When we showed up for our room and learned that there's a promotion going where you paid $25/night on top of your regular room rate and you would get free internet, free access to the gym, free breakfast and free calls for the entire stay. We felt we were mislead by the reservation desk and tried to talk to the front desk to add the breakfast to our package. We were told the 800 reservation center is a third party company they use so whatever the deal we get from them has nothing to do with the hotel. We were dumb founded by the remarks made by the front desk staff and felt although it is a decent hotel, we would not recommend to anyone.
