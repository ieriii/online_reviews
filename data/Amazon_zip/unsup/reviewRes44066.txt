Bumpity bump to 5 fabulous fish stars! Because I don't live anywhere near Wakamono, I haven't been back since my most excellent sushi experience in the spring, but I was at a friend's house in Lakeview last night and since I'm on this crappy diet, my dining out options are pretty limited. I can, however, have sushi (as long as it isn't the fried/cream cheese/mayo/tempura variety sushi). One quick trip to http://grubhub.com garnered the knowledge that my sweet, sweet Wakamono delivers! OMFG. Thank you, Grub Hub. You're off my shit list. We dove into the spicy tuna roll and the California roll. Yeah, yeah. I know. Not the most exciting options, but I know they're good and they don't have all of the "bad" sushi components I'm trying to avoid.  I dug the California roll (yay veggies), but the real star was the spicy tuna roll. Just the right amount of heat combined with a most excellent, non-fishy tuna made for pure sushi bliss. Wakamono also does a great job of making sure their sushi roll slices are bite sized, so there's no issue with the roll falling apart while you're trying to eat it. Sloppy sushi? No thanks! Finally, the take-out presentation was immaculate. Our fish arrived chilled, our miso soup was piping hot, the wasabi and ginger were in cute little tin foil packages and the soy sauce came in these teeny tiny little bottles. Much easier than dealing with ripping open packets of soy sauce, eh? Wakamono - I give you 2 giant sushi thumbs up!
