The food here is delicious! My favorite spot in chicago to get korean BBQ, as the service is not the same. The waitresses were really rude, I came in with a huge group of friends about 15 of us, thinking they would be happy as to money would be rolling in..they were really rude to us. When they brought the side plates to us they just kind of tossed then on the table. After receiving all the food, they never came back to refill the waters or even ask if we were doing okay. The food is great but service is bad.
