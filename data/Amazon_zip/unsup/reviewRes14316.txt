i LOOOOVE salt and you JUST DON"T give me any baby! WHY??!!! ok, i'm over it. 90 miles is good, cheap, cuban food that has an empathetic eye on its american clientele. nothing wrong with that; just give me a salt shaker. i picked up a bistec sandwich a while back and thought it was really good; all the ingredients melded into this hot, juicy, chewy, crispy yummyness. this time around, i got the lechon sandwich and it really needed salt. plus it lacked the juice the steak sandwich had. otherwise it was good enough to eat in its entirety. my husband's gotten the cuban & media noche and thought they both were perfect as is (gringo)... we've also ordered the yucca ("you-ka" not "yuck-a" .. eh, pet peeve) twice and love the perfect way they fry those suckers. but............. like i've said before, they seriously needed some salt (even my gringo husband agreed).
