Will definitely stay here again ! One of the cleanest holiday inn hotels I have ever stayed in! These employees I encountered had wonderful customer service and personality ! Always a plus! I didn't feel like I was staying in a chain hotel when I checked in. They gave me all info I needed at check in. Some hotels i have to call the front desk when I get to my room because they didn't give me the wireless internet access. I booked a 2double bed room.. Rooms are on the small side, but that is because the building was built in the 1930s hence the small rooms compared to other hotels. Loved my room. Bed was comfortable and warm in the Chicago winter. The window does have a bit of a cold draft, but with the heater on 75 at night and under the blankets I was super warm. Bathrooms. The cleanest bathroom I felt comfortable putting my bare tush on the toilet, and my bare feet in the tub. The shower tub had a mat on the tub floor which means they can remove it and sanitize for the next person ! I love how cute and chic the whole hotel felt. I will definitely stay here again, I'm looking forward to it. Con Jus checked out. Valet parking took forever to bring the car around ! We called before we left the room, checked out, and waited. And waited like fifteen minutes. It took valet a total of half hour to bring the car around. Valet ls $40. Self park at the same garage for overnight is $39. Next time id rather save a dollar +tip and park my own Damn car. Valet was not economically savvy after waiting forever to get my car it was not rush hour. The time I waited I could have gotten my own car and loaded up my luggage and been on my way to my flight !! The valet guy was not even apologetic for taking Soo long. The valet Is not apart of hi express its a different company but make it clear u would rather park your own car then deal with that shit. I'm on vacation. I want to enjoy what little time I have instead kg waiting around !
