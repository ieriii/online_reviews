I'm not from around Chicago, so I had to try at least one deep dish pizza while I'm here. This place was a 3.5 stars! Just ate it and had to write a review. Waited the normal 45 mins and ordered the Meaty Legend. It was baked on cornbeard and was quite tasty. I liked the crust. It was about $32 for a medium sized pizza with 6 slices. Good for a group of 3 or 4. One slice was filling enough for me though. We ordered it to go, but there was plenty of seating inside. It was a lot less crowded then Giordano's. There's a bar inside and has a very laid back feel. Not bad, but wish the wait wasn't that long.
