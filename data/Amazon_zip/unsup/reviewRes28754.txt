Okay, this place is somewhat more expensive than Spoon Thai, but it is now my favorite Thai in the city outside of Sticky Rice. We ordered everything Thai spicy, and it came perfectly spiced with chiles. We had: -Pla Koong: charbroiled shrimp salad. This was perfectly salty, fishy, sweet, and sour--I literally was spooning the sauce up off the plate. The shrimp were literally charbroiled, which really added some incredible smoky flavor. -Som Tum (Papaya Salad). We had it without the dried shrimp since I'm a wimp about those sometimes taste-wise. It was delish--whole pieces of chile, and again, a perfectly lime-y sauce on top of it all. -Hot & Spicy Catfish Sliced catfish stir-fried with Thai eggplant, green beans, basil leaves and fresh ground chili. Yum! I look forward to returning and having more of the spicy catfish dishes in particular. The server was sweet--it wasn't super busy, but she was great about constantly refilling our water since we were sweating our way through the (wonderfully) spicy food. So, while our bill was more than some other spots in the neighborhood, the quality really was so much better, and the flavors authentic--lots of liberal use of more expensive ingredients like fresh basil, lemongrass, shrimp. We'll definitely be back!
