This place is a gem. Every time we have been here the service has been wonderful. Ask your server for recommendations; they will not steer you wrong!!! A little pricy, but absolutely worth it! Our favorites are the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg, and you just have to try the Espresso over Toasted Cinnamon Soft Serve and Limoncello Creme for dessert!!!!
