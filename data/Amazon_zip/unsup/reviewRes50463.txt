Our server was pleasant and attentive so I'm giving Wishbone 3 stars. The food however was a definite "meh, I've had better". I had the shrimp po' boy. http://www.yelp.com/user It was uninspiring and borderline underdone. My friend's jambalaya appeared to have the trinity ingredients in it, but the flavor was missing and the chicken was overdone. http://www.yelp.com/user If I lived nearby, I'm sure I would make a return visit and try the brunch, but I won't be rushing back the next time I am in Chicago.
