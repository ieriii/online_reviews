Tortas at Xoco are what tortas at any other Mexican place dream to be. Cocinita pibil is the Mexican version of pulled pork and XOCO's habanero sauce serves as an amazing complement. It does not get better than this if you went to the Yucatan yourself. The added bonus here is that you don't have to worry about getting kidnapped or shot by drug cartels. The ahogada consists of golden roasted carnitas that are perfectly tender and chewy and drowned with an amazing chile de arbol sauce. As much as I wanted to, i could only try two of these tortas, for fear that I out myself into a food coma. For dessert, I recommend their fresh churros which are a taste of light crispy heaven. As if they were not decadent enough, you get a melted chocolate to dip them in. Bean to cup chocolate drinks are what I equate to hot chocolate on steroids. Extremely rich and chocolately, albeit slightly gritty, it is a chocolate purist's dream. In this case, milk is for sissies. I ordered the Aztec which had nice subtle spice notes of chile and allspice, just enough to give it distinction. If you can bear the slight wait, you will definitely be rewarded.
