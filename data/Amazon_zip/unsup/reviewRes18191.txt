We showed up at 4:45 pm on a Saturday night to try for a table for 4 at Frontera Grill. There was already a pretty long line so the first available indoor was 6:00 pm. Ordinarily that wouldn't have been too long a wait, but since we had our kids along we decided to go with XOCO instead. It was a bit stressful trying to figure out the seating situation but the hostess was kind and helped us find a comfortable spot. We ordered at the to-go counter and they delivered the food to our table. Rick Bayless stopped in while we were there. Nice touch. I heard he tries everything before it's served each night he's in. If that's true that's pretty cool. I went with the Carnitas Caldos. Said to be a meal in a bowl it was more of a spicy delicious soup. Very very good. But not necessarily mind blowing. The guacamole/salsa/tomatillo appetizer was great. We got a churro to go and it was very good too. Fresh and slightly doughy - tasty. Pro tip: They've got grilled cheese sandwiches and non-spicy chicken caldos for the kiddos. The bill wouldn't have been too bad if I hadn't sprung for a 22 oz 7% alcohol Goose Island Matilda beer. Said to be a beer for wine drinkers it hit the spot served in a chilled cocktail glass. Very cool beer. It felt like an upscale Chipotle in a good way. A perfect way to taste Rick Bayless' food. I'm glad we went.
