Do I have a really hard to please palate? After all the hype I've heard about this place (it was on the Food Network for its ice cream-less milkshakes for goodness sakes!), I was thoroughly disappointed. First, the free chips were way over salted and STALE (I'm guess chips aren't served stale in Costa Rico are they?) Second, I had a tamarind milkshake, which I barely took a few sips. It tasted wrong (and trust me, I know what tamarind tastes like having worked in Guadalajara Mexico for several months). Third, I had the chicken and rice dish and found it really bland. Plus, the whole meal left me thirsty for the rest of the day (which is usually a sign that there is MSG in the dishes...or maybe due to the oversalted stale chips). To me, it was spanish rice stir fried with some messily cut chicken breast and some frozen peas and carrots! The big annoyance for me as well is that this place only accepts cash, although the meal can easily run up to $15/person. Despite what other yelpers say, I actually found the service average to good - he was friendly and prompt, nothing to complain about. The atmosphere was simple and kind of reminded me of the Rainforest Cafe without all the darkness and the crazy animal background noises. Having said all this, I could give this place another try if someone was dying to go (what the hell, who can ever turn down milkshakes?)
