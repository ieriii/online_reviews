I went to Icosium Kafe' after seeing it on Check Please.It's small, but has a nice cozy feel, but the music was a bit annoying.The waitress was attentive without being overbearing.I had the Chicago crepe....I thought it was ok, it had way to many sun dried tomatoes.....I got the vegetable so to go along with it and the soup was pretty good. I also had a nutella crepe and that was amazing.I will be making a return trip to Icosium Kafe' but only for dessert.
