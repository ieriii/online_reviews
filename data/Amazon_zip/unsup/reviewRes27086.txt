When I first moved to Chicago i told a friend that I'm not into Pizza, he told me Pequod's would change my mind. He was more than right. Pequod's is the most delicious pizza i have ever had, and one of my favorite restaurants. I have tried a lot of the toppings but i go with sausage and mushroom. The sausage pieces are really big and really good. However the best part of the whole deal is the Caramelized cheese on the crust. Its scrumptious!! Being friends with a bunch of guys I eat pizza from a lot of different places.Pequod's is hands down the best pizza in Chicago. It is the only place I recommend to someone who wants a traditional deep dish Chicago pizza. My Roomie and I just moved a couple blocks from it, and that is a dangerous situation especially since i have discovered that they have a 5 dollar lunch special for a personal pan and a soda (or a Beer!)
