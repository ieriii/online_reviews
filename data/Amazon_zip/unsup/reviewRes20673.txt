Rick Bayless rocks. I've eaten here twice (would have been three times, but I went on a Monday and didn't realize it was closed then). The last time I had the Conchanita Pibil, which is slow roasted pork with some kind of habanero sauce in a french roll. It was friggin' spicy. One of my coworkers remarked that I needed to wear a sweatband...haha. The food is awesome. Locally grown, organic, etc. You have your choice of spring or sparkling water (for free!) on tap.  I've had the churros both time I went and they are amazing!!!!  The guacamole is ok, but I've had better. On the downside, they only serve beer, not margaritas. If you want to have a margarita, you have to go next door to Frontera and have one of their Blue Agave margaritas, which are really tasty.
