So cozy, great place for a date. Plus nothing tests the waters during the earlier dates like ordering plates of pigs ears (okay... almost like bloomin' onions, without the onion, with a fried egg on top... no cartilage involved) and bone marrow (interesting, for sure, make sure you eat it with all the accoutrement.) The milk-braised pork shoulder really was the best think we had. I wasn't a huge fan of the prosciutto balls, probably because I grew up in an Italian neighborhood with a deli that made a superlative version. These were just eh. Overall, I'd def go back. The service was great, and the dining experience is comforting - great winter spot.
