Finally, a Greek restaurant in Greektown that I can get excited about! Went with a group of 16 and enjoyed friendly, helpful service and outstanding food. The Katopita (chicken herb pie) was phenomenal, and the meatballs were simply to die for. My only complaint? Where was the "Opa!"? The saganaki arrived at our table with *no* fanfare, which, you've gotta admit, is really the best part about it. The food, however, was by far the best Greek I've had in the city. Flavorful, rich and downright perfect, I will return. And next time, I shall not settle for boring saganaki.
