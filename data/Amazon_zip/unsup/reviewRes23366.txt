So my friend and I visited this place for lunch. The waitress told me something was wrong with the refrigerator, and therefore, we could not get ice cream on our crepes. Alas, after hearing that, I should have run.  Food poisoning ensued after eating these crepes. Becoming violently ill and throwing up for 12hrs straight is a sure fire way to ensure I will never come back to your establishment. Also, it's terrible the establishment would just serve possibly contaminated food to customers knowingly. If you suspect food has been affected due to faulty equipment, don't serve it to customers. I will never return again.
