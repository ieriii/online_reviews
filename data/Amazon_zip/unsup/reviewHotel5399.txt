We had a very unpleasant experience with this hotel. We live in the suburbs and came down for an event and chose Indigo because we thought it looked unique. The front desk service was not very friendly and there was confusion checking in. We had two room reservations under one name. They double charged our credit card and we called to clear up the confusion, they double charged it again. It became such a mess that the credit card company contacted us and had to cancel the card and issue us a new one because they hotel had charged the card three separate times. The parking service they use which is city parking next door was not very friendly either. Overall the experience was not a positive one and we will never go back to Hotel Indigo.
