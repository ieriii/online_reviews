An update: so I've found my new regular. I used to always get the enchiladas suizas, but now I'll be switching to something else: Carne a la Tampiquena. It is a humonogous piece of grilled, perhaps marinated skirt steak (done perfectly), served alongside a heap of those magical refried beans, Mexican rice, guacamole, and (this is the best part, and why it's my new regular): a gratuitous enchilada smothered in mole sauce! As a side! The best of all possible worlds.
