The only complaint I can ever give about The Chicago Diner is that they took the wheatloaf sandwich off of the menu! It was my go-to for a looong time. I have never left this place unhappy or hungry. I always loved that I could come here for some good ol' comfort food. Vegan mashed potatoes and gravy? Sign me up. If you can tear yourself away from your entree' and save room for dessert, you have to try the chocolate cake. It's so good they sell them at Whole Foods all over the suburbs. I get them when I can for my birthday.Service has always been super friendly. (Even when my 8-year old daughter and I go alone. In other places we have been made to feel like crap and left unattended for long periods of time.)I can't wait to go again!!
