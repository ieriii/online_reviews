One of the best dogs in Chicago! =)I went here for lunch one day, and I come back just about 3 times a month! The service is great and is pretty quick, and the food is amazing! (From the Superdawg, all the way to the grilled cheese!) Maurie and Flaurie really got a good thing going for them! (I guess that's why they opened one in Wheeling, too!)Great resturaunt :)
