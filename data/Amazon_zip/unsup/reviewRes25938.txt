To keep myself from being redundant with other reviews, Imma get down to the nitty gritty. Paired my small pan pizza w/ith a couple 312 brewskies. + caramelized crust.-it really is INCREDIBLE. even tastier the next day. super buttery and slightly chewy to complete the perfect crust + ingredients are so fresh & I dig the choice of toppings    ** sausage - homemade, big cuts of peppery, savory meat :) mmm    ** canadian bacon- need I say more??    ** garlic- for extra kick    ** black olives, green and red peppers, mushrooms, onions, and basil. Thankfully, we were seated upstairs so it was pretty spacious and quiet. Our server could have been better. Think she was frazzled manning the upstairs room by herself. I did get a free 312 since she made a mistake on the order. Pequods lived up to its hype. Most indubitably. I'll be checking out Morton Grove location with parentals real soon. Gotta get it. Good. Now try to say that three times fast. gotta get it good..
