One of the best bowls of pho in the city. The beef brisket is amazing and the broth has the perfect amount of seasoning and is not too salty. The only thing to watch out for is how busy the place can get. Then again, that's a good thing as you know the food is fresh and lots of people come routinely to the restaurant.
