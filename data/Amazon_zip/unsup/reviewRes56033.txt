Delicious brunch offerings! Very crowded when I was there with 2 friends at noon on a Sunday. Impressed that we were called right away for a table to be seated--yet the place was packed. Not so impressed when we were sitting across from the grill--2 of us were hacking and wheezing for the next day from all the nasty grease inhallents--as well as smelling like the kitchen the rest of the day. Loved the food offerings and everything we tried. Tea-$6 not worth it. Ambieance nice. Tight spaces. But the food was great--omelettes, hash, pastries, & the toast was the best I've had in decades!
