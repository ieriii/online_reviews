I knew that I would love this place just for the fact that their sign is a whale with a thong on its head. What's not to love about that? But the pizza was yummy and it's close to the movie theater so it's a great place to eat before/after the movies. Really want to come here for their lunch special which I heard rocks but difficult for me since I work in the loop. They're also open late which is ideal for those late night pizza cravings.
