Great place for fantastic food and drinks. My only real complaint is the fact that it's busy, there are no reservations, and there's absolutely no place to wait inside. We also ended up next to some loud and pretty rude people, but that's not the restaurant's fault. The food was great. We had the arancini which was filled with ricotta and spring peas. Very good. We also had the whipped feta which was yummy, but a little too salty for my taste. The pig's ear stole the show. It was crispy and so delicious. I wanted to order another. We also let our server choose a cheese plate for us, and she did a very nice job leading us from the mildest to the funkiest cheeses. For dessert, we shared the nutella, banana and marshmallow panini (Wowza!) and the butterscotch pudding (underwhelming). Overall, the drinks and the food were good, and the atmosphere is lively and fun. I'll probably stick to weeknights for visits because of the crowds. Very fun place to bring your friends who love meat and cheese and wine.
