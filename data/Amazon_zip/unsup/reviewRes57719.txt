Great neighborhood place. You know you've found a great place when the line is out the door and no one wants to leave. Only bad thing: cash only.The food is cheap, plentiful, and some of the best Mexican food Chicago has to offer. The soups are fantastic, I love their enchiladas con mole con piccadillo. Maybe not an ideal first date kind of place, but if you love authentic Mexican - this is where you come.
