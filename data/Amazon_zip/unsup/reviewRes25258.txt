Recently dined here for a business lunch and was really impressed. I will say that if you are new to tapas this may not be enjoyable or if you are a vegetarian. I ordered the Hangar Steak Sandwich and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I will definitely return to try the drink menu. Service was great as well.
