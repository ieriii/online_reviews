My review on this place is 3.5 stars. I went there a few weeks ago for dinner on a Thursday night and it was pretty full, at least the primary area. They have an outdoor seating as well as another area in the other side which was completely empty but I think that area gets pretty packed for brunch coz we tried to book for Sunday brunch and we couldnt get in.  We had the roasted beets and house salad for starters. The roasted beets was interesting and delicious. I dont think theres much to say about a salad, im not sure if it was organic. For the main dish, my bf had the vegan lentil taco dinner and he really enjoyed it, it was a good amount and quite filling. I had the grilled hanger steak "chimichurri" and I really enjoyed it.  they even gave me some wild rice when I requested for it.  The service was ok but I wish they paid more attention to filling up your water. The waiter was not that engaging but who cares, I wanted to give a 10% tip but the bill wasnt too high, we spent 60 for 2 thats without drinks and no dessert. I would try this place again maybe do the soft shell crab next time or maybe do brunch.
