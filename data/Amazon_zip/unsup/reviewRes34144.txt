I can only comment on one thing and its worth letting you know about....salad bar salad bar salad bar. Shrimp, chicken, pita chips, and everything you could want. Huge selection. Its so delicious I crave it. Highly recommend. My boyfriend wants me to write, "he loves the lentil soup and falfel sandwich, he gives them 2 thumbs up. Absolutely a place to go!"
