This would be an easy 5 stars if you didn't have to sit on top of each other when the place was busy. The staff is fantastic as long as you don't mind a slight language barrier-- but it adds to the charm & authenticity. We've only had this be an issue once and it was easily fixed. The art on the walls is a bit strange and eccentric. It's local artistry, so once again, it adds to the charm. The food has always been great. It's a place where everything on the menu becomes something you order all the time-- everything's good!
