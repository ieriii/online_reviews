The burgers here give Kuma's a serious run for their money. I came here, was seated right away, and the next thing I know there was a delicious juicy burger I had just ordered in front of me. I ordered the Lockdown Warden, a certified Angus beef patty infused with bacon, leeks, garlic, shallots, stuffed with Merkt's Cheddar, then topped with fried leeks & shallots tossed in TRUFFLE OIL. Any burger with Merkt's Cheddar is a winner in my book. Pretzel rolls come standard. I substituted the fries for a side of mac'n cheese. I told the waitress I wanted bacon and green onions on my m&c....she told me that was standard unless otherwise ordered. I was even provided with Sriracha to drizzle on my m&c. Goddamn it was good....all of it....every morsel. You can customize your m&c order with tons of options to choose from...I even saw foie gras on the menu as a topping option. Also worth trying here is the "Prison Yard"...one pound of mussels braised in coconut curry sauce. It came with some nice garlic bread wedges, which was perfect for dipping in the curry sauce. The curry sauce was delicious. I have returned here for the mussels alone. They had several different craft brews to choose from. Hell yes. On a couple of my visits they had Left Hand Brewing Co's MILK STOUT on tap. Probably one of my favorite stout beers in the history of mankind. The ambiance: Metal. Though I am not a huge metal fan, I have a feeling I will be with the way Lockdown is operating!
