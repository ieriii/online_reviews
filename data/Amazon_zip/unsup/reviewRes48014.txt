The Publican was talked up for a full year to me before I was finally able to get back to Chicago and try it out. Needless to say, I was nervous about it - so many foodie friends raved about it up and down that I'd had an opinion forming in my head. But, on a trip back to Chi, I decided to give it a whirl. We made our reservation and headed in. Ambiance - gorgeous. I love the anonymous pig art. Why are you anonymous? I want you for my own house... Service - consistently good. Maybe not great, but good. I had one mix-up where I ordered an $8 beer and received a $30 one, but I realized it quickly and the server let us try a sample of the pricey brew anyhow. Nice! Menu - admittedly, this is not the most veggie-friendly place. But luckily, we have the Internet now, and one can check menus before coming to a restaurant. In doing so, one realizes that he or she is in for a major porktroplis/meatstravaganza. Drinks - GREAT beer selection. Absolutely excellent choices, quite diverse. Then, there's the food. The food that I consumed too much of, the food that put me in somewhat of a pork coma afterwards... let's not lie, my boyfriend threw around the term "meat sweats" in a half-joking manner. We started with spicy pork rinds (I HATE pork rinds. I LOVED these.), then moved to the ham sampler plate (I am still dreaming about that incredible selection... hello, serrano!!!). Moved on to the fried lake perch - easily the best I've had, and I lived in the Midwest for 23 years. Then - THEN - the porchetta. A massive undertaking of pork with a minuscule afterthought of tiny tomatoes (they were good, don't get me wrong - but let's be clear about who was playing the starring role in this entree). It was delectable, and despite feeling full to the brim, there was some gluttony that occurred on this fateful night. In other words, excellent, lived up to every ounce of the hype for me. A true foodie destination in the city, and worth making the trip for.
