I went to Indie for the first time today. I brought my four year old and my five year old for dinner. My daughter loved the crab rangoon's and my son enjoyed his fried rice. I enjoyed the best sushi in town. The service was amazing. I couldn't find my waiter, but the waiter for the table next to us offered to help with our request. That rarely happens. It was a long drive, but worth every mile.
