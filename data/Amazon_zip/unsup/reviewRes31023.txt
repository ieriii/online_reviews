Finally tried Sunda and I was not disappointed. Like others have said this is def a place to see and be seen. This atmosphere may not be for everyone but what a cool environment. I was surprised to see how socially oriented it felt with closely spaced tables and the long community table in the middle but chatting up randoms after a few drinks can be fun. Overall, I had a great first experience.  The bar area was a little packed with loud, drunk old douchers but thats what you get at a trendy place in the city.  I will be back very soon...I must have another Baked Snow Crab Handroll. The dynamite sauce in it = spicy sex magic
