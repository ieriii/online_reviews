Did not live up to the hype. Got there early and waited outside till they opened and was sat promptly as promised. Food was so so. Nothing special. I had the duck and son had shrimp. Adobo Grill is much better choice for the money. Service was good and the waiter knew about all the dishes. Will not be going back.
