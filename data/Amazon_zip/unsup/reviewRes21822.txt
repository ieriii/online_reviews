A word to the wise, my experience with Xoco was less than impressive on the food availabilty and customer service fronts. Me and my buddy decided to catch a late breakfast at the much heralded chef Rick Bayless's restaurant in downtown Chicago. We arrived at 10:31am on a Friday and were approached by an employee who informed us we had just missed breakfast and no food would be cooked until the lunch menu takes place at 11:00am. I've never seen this advertised on their web site or elsewhere...one minute tardy to the party and no breakfast, really? Really? We decided to order some Churros which were really good. My buddy, very nicely, let the lady taking our order at the counter know that we were disappointed that being one minute late on a non-advertised deadline for breakfast was a 'rule' and being so strictly enforced. The order taker, I use that term because there was no 'customer service' involved, said..."Well, you would not believe how busy we are between 10:30am and 11:00am". No empathy, no accommodation, no nothing. A quirky smile and "That'll be $3.45". So, first visit to Xoco was less than impressive. We'll try it again to see if our experience was an anomaly or business as usual. Really. Lastly, I'm giving it 2 stars for lack of service and food.
