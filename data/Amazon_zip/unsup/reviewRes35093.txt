One of my most favorite spots for my and my beau. The favorite is the Honey....OMG! Always start with the adamame, then the sushi of choice for the night. This place is a BYOB, so don't forget to bring your favorite drink. Staff is hip and always attentive. Of course you have to top it off with some fabulous mochi.... Sometimes they close the place for private parties but I totally recommend this place.
