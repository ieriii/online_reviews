I've been by Spacca Napoli several times when the patio and dining room has been packed. I was able to go with a friend yesterday before the dinner rush. It was raining out, so the patio wasn't open. We were seated right in the window. I will say that our server, I can't remember her name was void of personality. Never a smile, just flat affect the whole time. However, the food outweighed all of that. We shared a bottle of wine that was spicy and dry and wonderful. We chose the fried zucchini appetizer that was marinated in white balsamic with mint and basil. It was not the fried zucchini that I was expecting. It was served cold along side fresh french bread drizzled in olive oil. Despite being not at all what I expected, it was a beautiful appetizer. The balsamic wasn't overpowering and you got a mouthful of basil flavor followed by fresh mint. It was fantastic. For our dinner, we shared the Diavola. It was with a red sauce, fresh mozzarella, red pepper flakes and spicy salami. The flavors were amazing. The sauce was slightly chunky, which is my favorite. And the crust was chewy and perfect. I wish the crust had been a bit crispy, but it was still soooooooo good! The prices are affordable here. The ambiance is comforting and welcoming. I plan on coming back. I love a local little pizza joint like this.
