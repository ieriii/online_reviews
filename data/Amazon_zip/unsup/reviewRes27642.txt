Did you know that I finally went here? Yes, it's true. Long wait times be damned! This time we tried for brunch and finally got to test the waters, er, margaritas, er, wine. I need to tell you about this item on the Brunch menu - Huevos Estilo El Bajo. It's like a loose interpretation of eggs benny, only 100 times better than you could ever imagine. Do yourself a favor and eat this...if you can get in. The reisling kabinett is kind of amazing, too. I will say that I think the decor is terribly hokey, but that doesn't matter when eating fork-fulls of house made chorizo.
