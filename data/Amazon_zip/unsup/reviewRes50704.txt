I've been here for Saturday morning brunch, and overall I have to say that the experience was well worth the price. The food here is hearty but artful. Think of it as "Grandma went to Le Cordon Bleu." I left here feeling satisfied ... not just full or satiated, but with a feeling of happiness. Every aspect of the meal was well prepared, and the coffee kept me planted in my seat for longer than I probably should have stayed. Of course, the warm, doughy beignets didn't help either. Even though I've only been here for brunch, the drink menu looks spectacular -- enough to keep me occupied (and broke) for many a cold Chicago evening. I wish local bars were half so well stocked and mixed. A word to the wise, have patience if you go during peak hours (which is about at any time). The wait can have you standing in the cold, and the time to get your (delicious) meal agonizingly long. My only complaint was that the service was a bit lackluster, with my server almost timid about checking in (I had to work hard to catch his eye). Still, the food more than makes up for everything.
