Let me start off by saying I have eaten here many times over the past 10 years. With that said, I feel ever since Garcia's remodeled and became quadrupled the size, the food has suffered. I have tried several times since, and have been disappointed. I love the location and the margaritas, but regrettably, I wont go back for the food. The space when crowded is very loud as well. I guess I prefer smaller places where you can have a conversation without yelling.
