I've been here for a number of events and stayed here a few times and I must say, I am generally underwhelmed. The place is beautiful, that is for sure; a throwback to a time when fine hotels were majestic and grand and not modern and boutique: fresco ceilings in the lobby, gold trim, open bar and huge lobby.  The problem is twofold: it is aging and it is expensive for what you get. The rooms have a old feel to them, but they are still quite old and small. You don't get much room for your money and with so many great luxury hotels downtown, it is tough to make this the go-to choice.  Plus, the ample conference facilities means that the lobby is all jammed up with people from whomever the hotel is hosting that day. If you are going to stay in Chicago and want to blow ~$200/night on a hotel, I would stay elsewhere.
