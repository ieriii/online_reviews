Worth the wait! On a Friday night, you will wait about 30-45 min for a table. But the bar is ready to take your drink order while you wait for a table. The food is excellent! No complaints from out table - muscles, pork chops and pizza! The brew - one of a kind! This town was in need of a place like this! So refreshing!  The wait staff and hostess staff were attentive and friendly. I look forward to my next trip back!
