My 5 stars are based on the fact that I got hooked up with the Regency Club on the 32nd floor for $99. It came with free breakfast, free beverages, free alcohol, and free appetizers at night.- all in the club room on the 35th. The rooms were Asian-modern and came with all the amenities you can think of. The iron wasn't even attached to the wall! My only knock was the valet parking sucked and it would cost $39 a night! I would stay here again next time I come to Chi-town. The Hard Drive Club from what I saw was a sausage-fest, so keep that in mind!
