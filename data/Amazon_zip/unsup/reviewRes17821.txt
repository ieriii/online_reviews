As one who has eaten at both MOD and Del Toro, I was curious about the new use of the space, so naturally I had to check out the new joint behind those 'post no bills' signs. Do I feel like the concept is a bit gimmicky and a 'flash in the pan' concept? Yes, I do, but i it is a gimmicky and a 'flash in the pan' concept with wonderful drinks and service. I wasn't as impressed with the decor or the ambiance as a lot of the reviewers are, but my cocktail is what made the experience a positive one. I will definitely go back for another cocktail as those are impeccable and worth the money (and I'm usually not one for expensive fussy drinks, but I like do good liquor and was happy to see a menu of non-vodka based drinks). However, I find the whole mystique of the place forced. Go for the drinks, put up with the silliness. Silliness which sometimes gave off the vibe that it is a bunch of kids playing "lets be sophisticated, exclusive and cool", but really aren't. There were only two people ahead of me in line when I showed up, otherwise I wouldn't have waited to go in, nor do I suggest you wait longer than 5-10 minutes either. Honestly, the place only gets four stars because of the drinks, and it is because of the drinks that I'll go back, but the rest of the place just doesn't do it for me.
