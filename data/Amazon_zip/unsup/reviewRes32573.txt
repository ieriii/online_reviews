I really want to like this place as a semi-vegetarian living nearby, but the few times we've been here the food has been hit-or-miss. For example, we've experienced texture/consistency problems with a few dishes (food was too soggy or chewy). I guess I might still recommend for die-hard vegan/vegetarian or food allergy/special diet types. If you go in nice weather, sit outside on the back patio.
