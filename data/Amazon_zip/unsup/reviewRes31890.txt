I came here on a Monday night with some fellow veggie lovers, eager to give the place a second chance because I hadn't loved it that much the one other time I had been here. Unfortunately, I still don't get the raves, but maybe it is what I ate. I ordered the pulled "pork" sandwich, which had a consistency more liked Sloppy Joes and I didn't care for the BBQ sauce it was cooked in. I also shared a cookies n creme cake for dessert and was underwhelmed by that as well. Server was friendly but vanished for long periods of time.
