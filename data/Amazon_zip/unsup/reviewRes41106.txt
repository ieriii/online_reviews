Good Pho. My fave is the chicken....they give you fresh alfalfa sprouts, lime, slices of jalepenos (could have given me more than like 2 though seriously..) The only bad thing is it is always a zoo. Not a place for a date.  On the plus it is BYOB.  Sometimes you have to sit next to strangers which I am not a fan of. I don't want to hear their conversation as much as they don't want to hear mine. Overall it's good food, if you don't mind the zoo- plus, where else can you get cow penis?
