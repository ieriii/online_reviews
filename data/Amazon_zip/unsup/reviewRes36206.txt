There's a reason why the lines are out the door to get into this place on the weekends. I was lucky enough to be in the hood on a Tuesday, so I stopped in to see what all the hubbub was about, and oh man, am I glad I did. I had the corned beef hash skillet, and it was AMAZING. It's a little expensive for breakfast, but it's totally worth it.
