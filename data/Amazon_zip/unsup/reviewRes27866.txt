Not a fan of this pizza. I had been wanting to try this for a long time, but nervous about straying away from the good old standbys- namely Giordano's and Lou Malnati's. But on Saturday I was hungover and decided to be a little adventurous since I figured just about any food would help the situation. Not so. The carmelized crust just tasted burnt to me. I didn't like the flavor of the sauce, and there didn't seem to be much cheese, just crust. I also ordered the hot wings, not hot at all, mostly fat, and the ranch sauce has spilled in the container on the way over to me so the wings were already drenched with it and soggy. I understand wings are in no way their specialty, but all I was looking for was decent. I'm not going to make this mistake twice.
