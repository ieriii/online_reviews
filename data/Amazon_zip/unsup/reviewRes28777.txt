Two words: Gnocchi Aurora. (as many Yelpers have already claimed) Seriously, this has to be the best Italian place in the DePaul vicinity. All of the pasta is always fresh, and all of the food is always delicious. I wish they had a lunch special during the weekdays. Regardless, it's definitely all worth it.
