Stayed at the Hyatt Regency for two nights and two days. It was a nice hotel.  Pros: -The service was terrific here. They went out of their way to serve us and provide whatever it was that we needed from directions to restaurant recommendations to hailing a cab for us. The indoor atrium of the hotel is very large and very nice. It had a great bar that was packed both nights that we stayed. - Amazing views of Chicago - VERY comfortable bed and pillows - Flat panel LCD TV - Excellent location in the heart of Chicago - Several restaurants in and nearby the hotel, including Giordano's Cons: - Our room was out dated - Dated bathroom - Breakfast Buffet $22.00 - this isn't the Trump hotel - If you have room service bring you a case of Bud Light, it will cost $128! - No light switches, you have to walk across the dark room in search of a tiny lamp switch The only reason the I didn't give Hyatt Regency four stars: the room was dated and the bathroom needed a remodel. http://www.chicagoregenc
