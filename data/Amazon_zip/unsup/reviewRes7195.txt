It snowed that night and we showed up to dinner 30 minutes past my reservation on a Friday. The maitre'd (guessing manager too) graciously held our table and escorted us to the back where we dined on a lavish meal. I had heard from reviews that the rissotto was impeccable, which after the mean I must completely agree. My wife had the pumpkin pasta, which was excellent as well. I highly recommend both dishes. One thing to keep in mind is the portion size. The rissotto is enough for 2-3 people, whereas the pumpkin was a petite but tasty for 1. Throughout the meal, our waiter Mike and )Ricardo (the manager?) came to check on us. He and his staff did a fabulous job of making us feel special. We'll definitely be dining here again and with other friends. Highly recommended to share with friends. However, I'd not suggest a quiet romantic dinner for two - the place is bustling.
