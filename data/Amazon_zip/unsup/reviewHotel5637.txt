The Westin River North was the Nikko a few years ago. It was a very classy Japanese-run hotel. It is still a very fine property as the Westin, though the Japanese overtones are less prevalent. The hotel has a dark contemporary design, especially the understated lobby area. The rooms are very comfortable, and thankfully the contemporary design values limit the frilly and flowery touches. There is a Japanese garden along the south wall of the hotel, along a promenade hugging the Chicago River.
