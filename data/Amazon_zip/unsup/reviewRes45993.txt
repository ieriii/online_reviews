Totally reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, but without the cheesecake. The ambiance and the oversized platters! It was awesome! If you've read past reviews from me, one can easily tell that I'm a huge fan of deep fried calamari. Well, to my surprise, they served a Spicy Deep Fried Calamari Salad. Totally totally recommend, if you're a calamari lover like myself. It was pretty much like an asian salad, but with calamari. It was like a dream come true! One of my favorite salads mixed in with my favorite appetizer of all time. Ahhhhhh... Not to mention, it was considered as an "appetizer" salad, but yet, it was STILL huge, and also, INCREDIBLY SPICY. Good for me cause it was only $8. Another great appetizer must try are their asian nachos. Wonton chips smothered with chicken, peanut sauce, wasabi cream sauce, cheese, and green onions. I'm definitely going to try to mimic this concoction. Main Meal - Carameled Chicken with rice... Sounds kinda weird cause of the "caramel" part, but don't let the word fool you. It was very delicious!
