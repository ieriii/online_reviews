I love their food and drinks (chef is great about creating healthy choices) but service is just ok. I consider myself a regular. Once when we had a poor experience, the manager said when we come back she would "take care of us." So when we returned, we mentioned that offer and she acted puzzled and then when she finally recalled the offer, she just bought one juice. Not very generous hence I am not impressed with them in this regard. shrug.
