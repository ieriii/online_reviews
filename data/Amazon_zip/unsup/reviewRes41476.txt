If you are vegetarian and want good food for a special occasion, go to Green Zebra instead. I did the 7 course tasting (vegetarian) and it didn't blow me away, but I think the meat eaters thought theirs was pretty great so I guess they just don't have the vegetarian down. The dessert was the best part of the meal, but for veggies it isn't worth the 85 bucks.  Our waiter was annoying and it definitely downgraded our experience there.
