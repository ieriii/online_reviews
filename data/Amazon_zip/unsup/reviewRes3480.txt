Crisp is brilliant. Wings are amazing. For you health freaks and geeks, plenty of options with salads and boxes that rock for only $6. This place is impossible to beat for a lunch special.  If you live within a 10 minute walk, don't miss it. Buddha Bowls are outstanding. I have nothing but the best to pass on about Crisp. Completely Original. If you've read reviews that don't dig the Korean, I get it. It's not traditional Korean. It's sort of a fusion place, with burritos, chicken wings, a decent take on bibimbop. You really should try it at least 1 time and go from there. If you're into the style, it's a must go.
