I was expecting the chicken tikka masala to be more curry-esk but that's my fault. It tastes very similar to the appetizer they bring out but better. Mango ice cream is DEFINITELY worth getting! It's got a twist to it so don't expect it to taste like the haagen dazs ice cream. Tandoori chicken was very tender and delicious.
