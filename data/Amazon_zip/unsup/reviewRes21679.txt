A little pricey for a fast food style restaurant. It can be $20 a person if you get an entree item, chips and salsa, and a drink, but I think the food is worth the prices. My favorite torta so far is the milanesa, which is a breaded chicken concoction with delicious crisp bread. The sandwich has a little heat to it from the salsa and pickled jalapeno. I've been twice and its best to go right as the evening weekday rush hour begins, to beat lines and grab a good table.
