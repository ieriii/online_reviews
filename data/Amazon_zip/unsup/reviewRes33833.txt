I absolutely love this place. One of my favorite Italian restaurant so far. The wine was poured generously, the bread was super hot, the olive oil infused with basil. Shell pasta+ Parmesan cream sauce+ prosciutto +truffle oil=pure food bliss. Our server was awesome, very friendly and helpful, and the decor/ambiance were great. This would be an awesome spot for a first date because it's freaking AMAZING and really well priced.
