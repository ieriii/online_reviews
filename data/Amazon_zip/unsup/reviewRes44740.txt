Best stuffed pizza period. Tried that Lou Malnattis stuffed, but couldnt get the idea of the meat on top in a stuffed pizza. Also comparing the two, Lous crust was greasy and chewy, while Gios crust was fluffy and crispy. We usually order the stuffed spinach and sausage. Dine in we order the fried appetizer platter (I know not so healthy considering no one in my family likes mushrooms so I end up eating about 15 of them my self). Good thin crust also, but the stuffed spinach is the way to go
