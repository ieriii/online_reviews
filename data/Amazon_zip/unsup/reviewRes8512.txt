Traditional brazillian steakhouse. Although my love for this style of restaurant is fading dramatically, it's still fun every now and then. These restaurants were all the hype 5 years ago in the days of Atkins, but it's not a bad blast from the past every now and then. If you've never been - it's an all you can eat carnivores paradise - an unlimited parade of meats brought around and offered to you. Huge salad bar as others have indicated. All at a flat price. If you want meat, and lots of it - go! Vegetarians not allowed!!!
