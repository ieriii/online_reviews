Meh... I wasn't happy with the experience at all. I'll have to go back on a different day to give it another go. We went in on a Tuesday night around 11:30 and it was empty. It was kind of bizarre. I assume the bar is open until 1, so maybe people don't go out on Tuesday nights? The front windows were wide open (as if the patio had been open earlier) but it was about 50 degrees and freezing. Not cool. There was no place to sit on the main level of the bar to get away from the cold so it totally sucked.  There had obviously been an election night party in before us, but I don't think very many people came. It seemed kind of sad.  The service was OK - not fast enough, but not so slow that it pissed me off. We just ordered a beer and some Pepsi, so it shouldn't have taken as long as it did to get anything for us considering there were like six other people in the bar, anyway.  Blech I just wasn't happy. It was a weird atmosphere, the bar was empty and the music was BLARING. The selection of music wasn't horrible, but it was unnecessarily loud. I'll go back another time - maybe it was just a bad day. The menu looked good and they were still serving food at 11:30 that smelled delicious, so I'd like to go back and sample their nouveau American fare.
