Their delivery area is huge: Montrose/16th/Lakeshore/Palaski. Went here with a group of 14 in the back room. We went on a Thursday at 6pm and a line started forming shortly after we arrived. Definitely count on a wait for any normal dining time. Tight squeeze for a group. They created a prix fixe menu and we had about seven different dishes/apps and every one of them was delicious. It was only $20/pp and we were STUFFED. It's BYOB and there is a very cool wine/liquor store across the street. 90% wine, very small beer/liquor section. Our server was Costa Rican and told stories about the food, how it's prepared/served, and was an overall delight. Despite the crowded restaurant and size of our group, we were out in 1.25 hours. I can't have milk and wanted to peel my eyeballs out because I couldn't have the oatmeal shake. That thing is DELICIOUS.
