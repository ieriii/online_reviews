I went here for dinner the other night. It wasn't my first time to Superdawg but it was my first time with intentions of yelping. It was Friday night so I sparked the bong first and went to dinner. I got a dog and fries with a chocolate shake. It hit the spot. The hot dog was well cooked and seemed above average quality compared to most places. The trimmings were also good. The chocolate shake was delicious and highly recommended. Unfortunately it was cold out as I bet the drive in area is fun during the summer. Cash only unfortunately but they do have an atm on premisis.
