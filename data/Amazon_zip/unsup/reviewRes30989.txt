What to say about yet another "elite" steakhouse in Chicago a city that is busting at the seams with reputable establishments. Let's start with the positive: 1) Terrific ambience. Lighting is low and the bar in the lounge is very impressive and has a 50's throwback vibe. 2) The staff are very friendly and accommodating. 3) From what I could observe a formidable wine cellar. Now on to the actual meal itself... The menu was fantastic with all of the usual fare you might expect at any higher end steakhouse. (oysters, wedge, every cut of meat possible, a half dozen potato sides, etc) The waiter informed us that the steaks are 28 day wet aged. I'm a dry aged fan myself but i won't let that bias tarnish this review. I ordered the bone in filet (18 oz) medium rare. This steak was on the menu for $50. My GF ordered the petit filet (8 oz) which was $38. The steaks came out very fast. they were very undercooked. Mine came out rare and hers was slightly below medium rare. Although tender the meat was completely tasteless. There was no seasoning whatsoever. They didn't even offer any type of crust or side sauce to offset this blandness. The bill was way too high for such lackluster steak. Will NOT be going back.
