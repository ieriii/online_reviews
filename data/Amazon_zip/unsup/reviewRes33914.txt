Divine! Absoultely wonderful Italian food. The downfall is that its a very tiny restaurant... the tables are too close together and it is VERY LOUD. If you're looking for a nice, quaint place to dine, this is not the place. The food is outstanding and they have a great selection of beverages, but it is simply TOO loud. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes, we have great service, other times, not as great... depends on how busy they are. Regardless, if yo'ure looking for GOOD Italian food, Mia Francesca's is your place-- BUT don't go on a Cubs game night!
