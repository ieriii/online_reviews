This place is fantastic. It has been voted best deep dish 3 years in a row. You can always get a slice any time of the day. As for Jennifer B's review of good pizza... The fact she even mention's Chicago Pizza as being good shows her poor qualificatons to judge pizza. I have a feeling she is not from around here.
