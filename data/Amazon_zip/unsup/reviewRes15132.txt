Highly recommend the Of Grit and Grace! This place is really cool, and the atmosphere leads to a great experience. It's seemingly pretentious, but that's the whole allure; once in a while it's fine to be cooler than you really are. No sign. Sneaky entrance. Velvet curtains. Dim Lighting. Swanky music. High booths. Candles. House rules. Extensive menu. Also tried and liked the following: Half Way Cross Town, Plumb the Soul, Commis Sling.
