I loved our visit to Hot Doug's! Yes, there was a wait, but it went pretty quickly and there's so much to look at on the walls, the time passed pretty quickly.  My sweetie and I tried three different dogs, ranging from a chicken sausage and cheese to a regular ole weiner. Everything was super delish, and they even threw in an extra dog for free. The service was cheerful and it seemed like they had good repore with their regulars, even though they were slammed. Definitely a must-visit if you're in Chicago!
