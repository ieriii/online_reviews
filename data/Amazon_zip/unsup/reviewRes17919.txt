Holy crap this place is good! I have been longing for a BYOB on my side of town that offered the same quality and options as the many restaurants have available in other areas of the city. Not only does Caro Mio have a huge menu with tons of traditional and contemporary items, it also offers obscenely large portion sizes for a reasonable price. At first, I was a bit put off by the seemingly inflated prices, but am so glad I came here anyway to see what all of the fuss was about. It is priced a bit higher because each entree can easily serve at least two people with big appetites. My leftovers alone have resulted in two separate meals. Heyo! To top it off, the food is unbelievably good -- it was hands down the best meal I've had in a very long time. You really can't beat this place.
