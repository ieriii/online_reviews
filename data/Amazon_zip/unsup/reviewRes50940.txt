My friend and I wound up there last night after we couldn't get into the bar we had planned to go to for the Blackhawks game. I had actually already eaten dinner, but was so intrigued by the bbq that I had to try a sandwich. Growing up in North Carolina, I am no stranger to the vinegar based bbq of that region. And I have to say Wishbone absolutely nailed it. The bbq was excellent, the slaw was great, and the sauce was tasty. Not to mention the little cheesy cornbread biscuits. I can't wait to go back and try more of their food. As for the restaurant itself, it's just a visually fun place to be. The giant mural of chickens flying in formation was my favorite art piece. The service was great as well. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. An overall great experience.
