A bit disappointing. We dined here for a special occasion and while the food was good I think the place is overrated. We started with the chef's choice in oysters and some frites. Then we had a variety of small to medium size entrees. Among those items were the shrimp (which were large thanks to the fact that their heads were still on), the pork ribs, the chacuterie plate, and the skate wing (which had "bones" in it was probably the most disappointing). I had wine, but everyone else at our table enjoyed the large beer menu. We shared desserts (I highly recommend the waffle which was wonderful) and also all had coffee. We were lucky enough to get one of the paddocks/booths along the wall that give you more of a sense of privacy. I think that maybe our guests enjoyed the meal more than we did as they were raving about it afterwards. I honestly wouldn't return here given the cost and the time it took us to get there. The cost per person, including tax, tip, and all the food mentioned about was $80.
