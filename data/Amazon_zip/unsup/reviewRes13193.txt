We went to Revolution because our daughter said it was good. She is serious about her food, too. The atmosphere is trendy casual, but friendly and welcoming, with an semi-open kitchen and a big brew tank in view. Our waiter sensing we were interested in their beer but not sure beer is what we wanted, offered samples of their new brew. While it was good, we all opted for other drinks! We enjoyed the large pretzel with cheese and mustard dips. Two of us had burgers. They loved them, and also the fries and blue cheese potato salad. I had the pork chop -boneless.. OMG, I never expected it to taste that good in a brewery restaurant! It was thick, served artfully sliced, with watermelon and tomato and farmer's market style unique potatoes. So fantastic. The pork was succulent, and cooked to perfection. It almost tasted like a steak...hard to describe, but quite possibly the best pork chop I have ever had. Whoever did their cooking today should be applauded. This is a lively place with personable, friendly staff. The bathrooms are clean - always appreciated. You won't be disappointed at Revolution Brewing!! It was really wonderful.
