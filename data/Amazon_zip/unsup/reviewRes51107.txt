Went for dinner. 2 words: Yawn, Blah. Nothing was very good. I expected a unique experience with the southern flavors promised. Instead I got no imagination. Not a very exciting menu, small portions, bad wine list. Our server was good--she tried a bit too hard...the rest of the staff looked like they were hired for their looks & they all had a bad attitude. Oh & what's up with the boiled, bland peanuts?--I would have prefered them raw. Too many great places around to go back. Sorry. Went back after a friend begged me & it had improved so I raised it a star.
