Jesus Christ, what a selection. Unfortunately, I am the type who just likes his plain dog with nothing on it. Still Doug makes a mighty fine dog that pairs well with his homemade fries. I would like to try the "duck fat" fries sometime. Do not hesitate to wait in line for one of Chicago's true icons!
