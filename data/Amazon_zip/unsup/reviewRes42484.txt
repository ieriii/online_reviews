Stopped by Art for lunch yesterday, and decided to go with one slice each of thin, pan, and stuffed. The verdict: delicious, delicious pizza. The thin crust was the perfect balance of crisp and chewy, having a nice amount of crunch without being to crackery. The sauce had a nice herbal spice to it, and was a step above the usual sugary pizza sauce at a lot of places. The stuffed crust is the best in the city. The crust comes out nice and buttery all the way to the edge. The cheese is gooey and delicious without being rubbery. Great balance of toppings to pizza. Yum. The pan, unfortunately, fell a little flat. While the cheese and toppings were, of course, tasty, the thick crust started to taste pretty doughy after about half of the slice. It lacked the buttery moist deliciousness of the stuffed crust. Granted, it was still tasty, but I'm spoiled by Pequod's when it comes to pan. All in all, this is one of the best pizza places in the city.
