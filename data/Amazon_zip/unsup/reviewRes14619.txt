Hello little Italian joint. Coming to Sabatino's is like going back in time when my dad took us to a "fancy" dinner. But this place is awesome. Quaint yet comforting at the same time. Came here on Valentine's Day and it was especially full and alive. Service is also old school, could of sworn my grandma was waiting on us. Friendly yet commanding at the same time. The pizza bread as an automatic starter is def a treat and unexpected. Good but I don't think I would order it otherwise. We started with the minestrone soup and it was ok. Then has the ceasar and it was really good. For the big show, I had the veal special which was veal scalapini in a thin white wine sauce and fresh sage. Excellent. My wife had the Tuscan chicken with potatoes, artichoke, and sun dried tomatoes in a light white wine sauce. Even better. Would order that again for sure. Ended the night with some coffee and dessert: Tartuffe. Damn good - like a lighter tasting snickers bar. But better. We had a great experience and would def come back. Doesn't hurt that it's a few blocks away from home either! 5 stars for the combo of food and affordable price.
