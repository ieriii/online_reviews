Went back to the Gage yesterday for a post-work drink with an old friend from NYC. It was Cinco de Mayo, and we were concerned w/ attaining some margaritas..  I know what you're thinking.. "Irish-type bar for Margaritas?" The Gage did not disappoint. Their margaritas tasted fresh, and without all that acidic mix that some places overuse. For food, we split an order of the Buffalo Frog's Legs (!) and the cheese plate. The frog legs were suprisingly good! Kind of tasted like a mix between chicken and the lightest seafood flavor. The cheese plate featured 1 blue cheese, a goat cheese, a yellow sharp cheddar and one more that escapes me. Each cheese was oriented on the cutting board across from something it was to be paired with. The blue cheese got the cherry soda.. home made fizzy cherry juice. It was amazing! The goat cheese got dried cherries. The yellow got some roasted hazelnuts. The other cheese (it was also a stinkier cheese, similar to blue) got this amazing cherry chutney stuff. The Gage is now officially 2 for 2. One more excellent experience, and we're talking 5-star territory.
