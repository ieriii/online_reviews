so, first I'd like to ask, are the prices different at the Armitage location and the Clyborn location? If so, I definitely wish I went to Clyborn. I've never really experienced Cuban food, so to me, sure the food was good. My bf who is Cuban, was kind of appalled. The food was good, but the prices, seriously? 2 measley croquettas for $2.50, and I mean MEASLEY. ONE empanada that was just okay, for $2.00. I ordered the media noche (midnight) sandwich which came with fried yucca (which by the way was delicious due to the heavy amount of garlic on top) but all for $9.50. My bf ordered the bistec dinner, which was really tasty, and topped off at $12. We also each ordered a shake to go, and they really do need better blenders. If you're going to advertise shakes on your menu, please do everyone a favor and invest in a professional blender that can actually blend ice. I ordered the mamey shake, and they ended up giving me the guayaba. I knew it didn't taste quite right, and unfortunately, it was my bf who pointed this out to me, because he was far more familiar with mamey shakes than i am, so it wasn't until he pointed it out, that i realized it did taste like guayaba. our waitress was really friendly -- but in the 'way too friendly" way, where they check on you every 3 minutes and it starts getting annoying, because honestly, who likes telling their waitress theyre doing fine with their mouth full. i ended up paying $45 total (including tip), which is insane. yes the food is good, but i don't think the price is worth it. sorry 90 miles. you disappoint. if your clyborn location is cheaper and less obnoxious, then i may check it out.
