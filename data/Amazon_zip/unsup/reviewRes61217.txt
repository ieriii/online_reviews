We got married this past January and had a lot of out of town guests, so we wanted to do something different. We wanted a real Chicago wedding with Chicago pizza, so we had our rehearsal dinner here. It was so much fun, we made it fancy by setting a dress requirement and having our florist come in and decorate it and put place cards. The staff was so helpful and we had a blast. Writing on the walls was a plus. The private rooms upstairs really helped out!
