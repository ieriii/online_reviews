I used to love this place but the last 4 TIMES they've let me down. Food was undercooked, had the shrimp dish that THANK GOODDDDD I noticed was pink inside otherwise it would've landed me in the hospital that very same night turned off... gave it another shot. I figured a one time mistake..not so lucky. Went in for lunch during the week, simplest thing FRITA grosely made and undercooked (mushy in the center)ugh, the mariquitas (Plantain Chips) were stale, I remember thinking jeezz is this from a bag of chips??? The rice lately does not taste like its coming out of a pot, more like microwaved and not FRESH, trust me people I'm from MIAMI and my folks are CUBAN and I was raised on this food and know the difference!!  C'MON 90 Can we get some decent cooks, possibly authentic? The other thing I noticed, the cooks just seemed disorganized, waiters either overworked or frankly just don't want to be there. As we exited, I looked over at the kitchen and I said to myself...never again. Sorry 90 pick it up a notch. Undercooked food is a liability!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
