Came into Pequod's with my fiance after losing yet another softball game. We were bumming about our lack of softball prowess, and pizza heals all wounds. Pequod's has a sports bar atmosphere, a natural fit in a sporty town like Chicago, but its clear that on "game night" this place is going to be packed. Its a relatively small bar/restaurant, with short little booths made for two, and barstool flanked tables surrounded by Chicago sports memorabilia and flat-screen TVs. We kept it simple: soda, salad, sausage-spinach-mushroom deep dish pie. Our server brought our drinks and salads quickly; service here is brisk and friendly. The house salad was simple - chopped lettuce, sliced black olives, a slice of tomato, shredded carrots, all dressings on the side. Comforting in its simplicity. Our pizza took another 20-25 minutes, pretty standard for a deep dish place. I was hesitant about getting deep dish because I can't stand the typical heavy, buttery, pastry-dough crusts that so many Chicago-style places employ. When it came out, I saw that the cheese had oozed out onto the sides of the well-seasoned cast iron skillet, and I was briefly debating how greasy everything was going to be. But yessss...I was extremely pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the crust on Pequod's pizza! How Pequod's can take a thick layer of tangy, crunchy-on-the-bottom but light-on-the-inside crust, smother it with cheese, bright tomato sauce, and fresh spinach, herby golfball sized chunks of sausage, and fresh mushrooms and have it NOT be a belly bomb is kind of a pizza miracle. I ate two slices of medium-sized pie and felt full without that greaseball quesiness I get from just one slice of "the other guys" stuff. This just might be the best deep dish I've had in Chicago. Based on pizza alone this place is 5 stars. I'd happily go back and have it again and again...provided there's no game on, so I can avoid the crowds.
