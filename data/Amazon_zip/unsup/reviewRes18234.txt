Came for lunch on a Tuesday. Crowded but barely waited more than 10 minutes to order and get seated. Rick Bayless did not disappoint! - cheerful staff - amazing food - casual setting If it's your first time here, get the works. I got an appetizer, torta and XOCO's famed hot chocolate and churros--all amazing flavors. 1. Pickled Pigs' Feet Tostada: 2 small but mouthwatering bites of crispy spiciness 2. Carne Asada torta: flavorful meat served on buttery fresh bread 3. Mexico City Thick (Champurrado): thick, creamy hot chocolate 4. Churros: right amount of crunch and sweetness Wish Bayless had some joints in NYC.
