The atmosphere and decor of this place is pretty cute (I am pretty sure that the back bathroom even had apple scented air freshener...and the apples painted on the wall were def "bad")  The beer list was super extensive--which is so much fun. I liked that they had divided up the list for countries and then further more into states for the US. (So you could try a beer from the UK, one from Germany, etc) The back room also has shuffleboard, fooz ball and a pinball machine. It has a great area for a larger party, with tables and chairs towards the door, and a larger table and huge bench in the back. Major props to the awesome waitress that took care of the entire back room for a huge party. She did a great job and even though was stressed out, came at everything with a smile. The food looked yummy and it smelled awesome--might have to go back and try the food. Will probably have to try some of the other beers as well!
