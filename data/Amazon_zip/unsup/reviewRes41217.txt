On a nondescript block on Armitage lies this wee restaurant. There is no sign announcing "This is Bonsoiree!" - rather it is the sort of place you pass by and do a double-take back to check to see what you missed. As I mentioned, this 'wee' restaurant may seat about 30 at max. The decor is ultra modern with clean lines. Has a bit of a sterile feel to it and you will have very little elbow room to work with. I came here on an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend - I would say if you came here on an ordinary date, the dude that brought you there must make bank. We had the 7-course dinner, and even with byob and a groupon, it was $$$. The food was really amazing and I was impressed with the presentation and plating. I am pescatarian with a shrimp and crab allergy and they were able to accommodate beautifully (I have read that some have experienced otherwise). My favorites were the lobster with the bruleed grapefruit and the milk and cookies for dessert. Innovative and playful - I really enjoyed it. Do NOT forget to bring a bottle of wine. As my dinner progressed, I realized those around me were getting more boisterous and I'm pretty sure I saw a table of 3 leave barely able to walk straight. All in good fun of course.
