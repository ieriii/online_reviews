Well.. There has been enough said about the food. Of course delicious enough that makes you want to go there time and again... Their service has been downhill off late. Long waits and even the food takes for ever.. And Customer service is not something that is in abundance in Chinatown... I hope Mr. Hu realizes customer service matters to keep the interest alive.
