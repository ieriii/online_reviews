I guess I've never had real mexican food. Kind of a shock the first time I went here but I do go back because it's pretty good but not great. I only get the carne asada really because there's only like 3 things to choose from. Burrito is huge and hard to finish. Only comes with cilantro and onions so pretty bland for me. Get tomatoes and sour cream for extra it's worth it and pile on the fresh hot sauce. Food is definitely fresh and there's always people in there. Just not sure what all the hype is about, guess everyones pretty drunk 24/7 here in Chicago hahaha
