A good friend took us to Caro Mio for dinner when we visited Chicago and we were blown away. The calamari was perfectly cooked, the osso buco milanese was incredible (easily some of the most tender beef I've ever eaten), and the freshly made pastas were top notch. If I lived in Chicago I would totally be a regular.
