This is perhaps one of the best Pizzas that I have ever had. We tried the deep dish with two meat toppings. We had it delivered the first time we tried it and ate it in the second time. Both were phenominal! The delivery pizza was much better, because the sauce had thickened up and taken on a richer taste. We even ordered a few pies mailed to our home in the Kansas City area. The mail order was good but not near as good as in person. Love this place. I personally hated Chicago style deep dish until we tried theirs. I wish they had one in Kansas City! Can't wait to get to back to Chicago!
