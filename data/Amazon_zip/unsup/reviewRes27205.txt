Nueva Leon is not only low priced it's freakin' FANTASTIC!!!! They make one of the best Mole's (it rivals my favorite place in Mexico I love to go to for mole, they KNOW what they are doing). The place is clean, the staff is friendly and warm and the food will bring you back time and time again. If you love mole, you'll love Nueva Leon! Note: If you feel intimidated about going into the neighborhood, don't let this stop you, this ol' White Girl (me) has never had any issues and I have been going there for years with my friend Cindy.
