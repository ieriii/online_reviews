This is a great place to go with a group. It's noisy and fun and lively. (If you don't like that description, you probably won't like the atmosphere.) The communal seating was neat and didn't take away from my experience at all--we hardly even noticed! the decor is minimalist and very home-y, with random canvases of pigs. Now on to the food. The dishes are very similar to tapas, but there are some larger dishes that could be entrees. But I recommend sharing everything! It was a great way to experience all of the menu and really appreciate the restaurant's specialities! We ordered a bunch, so it was almost like a food parade. Here's what I can recall: Starters: -Chef's selection of oysters [**Fave**] -Chef's selection of three hams **Fave**] -Pork Rinds -Ahi tuna something (it was like sashimi) [**Fave**] Dishes: -Bouchot mussels [**Fave**] -Shrimp w/ fettuccine -Kobe sirloin -Country ribs Veggies -Brussel sprouts [**Fave**] -Beets [**Fave**] Dessert: -Waffle [**Fave**] -Sweet potato panna cotta -Chestnut cake Everything really was outstanding, but I marked my faves. Everything was very simply presented, no crazy sauces, just amazing combinations of flavor. Now, their beer menu is what everyone talks about...and they certainly should. I had a Framboise, which they later ran out of. I asked our waiter to suggest something that might be comparable, but without fruit flavor. He brought me this beer (Monk's Ale) and proceeded to give me a tutorial on Flemish beer. It was uh-mayyy-zing. I'm hooked! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I thought the portions were a bit meager in relation to the prices. Overall, a great place! It's definitely an experience to have.
