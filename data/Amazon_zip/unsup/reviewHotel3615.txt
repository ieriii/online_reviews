First impression? The valets outside could give a rat's ass about you. I was staying there for 3 days and each time I had an interaction with them, it was like I was disturbing them. Really annoying and the reason I only gave 3 stars. Location is great.  Historic hotel which is fun to stay in. Owned by Hilton, but you don't feel like it.  I ordered what was likely the WORST Old Fashioned I've ever had in my life. I think the bartender was Russian and maybe didn't learn that one in Moscow. Anyway, great ambiance in the bars. I'd stay here again because you're almost going back in time and you can't beat the location.
