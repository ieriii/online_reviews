I love going to Milk and Honey because of the great atmosphere, mushroom truffle oil soup and their chai tea lattes. They have a small breakfast menu, but the stuff is great. I'm also a big fan of their turkey reuben with cole slaw. I drool just thinking of the place... I was a little disappointed in my last trip (I got the waffle du jour--waffle with chicken sausage topped with red peppers and onion) because there wasn't much too it. Most everything you get from Milk and Honey is over the top with yumminess, but there was hardly anything to these waffles--maybe a few ounces of topping and a couple of bites of chicken sausage.  But rest assured this isn't a normal occurrence at Milk and Honey. I love it!
