I met up with some friends here on a full stomach. that was a mistake. I shared a Bad Boy Buddha with tofu, which was good, but the main event here is definitely the chicken. I picked off friends plates, wishing i was hungry enough to order my own. The wings were cooked perfectly, moist and juicy and the batter was light and so very crispy (despite being doused in some of the best sauces I've ever tasted). Favorite: Seoul Sassy. Sweet and sour soy/ginger. I loved the rolls of paper towels on the large community tables. And of course... bendy straws for drinks (surprisingly hard to come by these days). It's been 2 days, and i can't stop thinking about that chicken. I look forward to my next visit!
