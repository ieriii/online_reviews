A farewell lunch for a brief stint in a humble office called for wine. Oh, yes, and lunch. We had lunch too. Our party of nine bid our westward bound coworker adieu in the light and airy space of Bin 36. I have eaten here in the past (years ago) and the space still feels the same: stylish. Classy. Not stuffy. The vibe is lovely for lunch with the girls, an early-in-the-game date or a low-key dinner with office-mates. The lunch menu is quite reasonable in price and contains the usual suspects of cobb salad, burgers and the like. I enjoyed the cobb salad, which almost resembled a cross between a chef salad and its title. Not to worry, I ate the slices of ham and turkey alongside my trusty cobb staples. Sized appropriately, it was the perfect size to help me be productive that afternoon without lapsing into a total food coma. Everyone else enjoyed their steak sandwiches, burgers and the like. Lunching success! Service is friendly, polite, and willing to go back around the table when it has been decided, you know what, we DO want a glass of wine with our lunch. Because, really, how can one give a goodbye speech without a glass of something in her hand. And how can you hate on a place that gives you a cookie and a bottle of water on your way out the door? (Answer: you can't!)
