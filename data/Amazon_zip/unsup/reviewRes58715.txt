Ehhh... I thought the truffled popcorn was the highlight of all the food and that was free. It's really noisy in there and it definitely more of a trendy socializing scenery place rather than a romantic or catch-up with friends dinner - kind of place. The food was expensive as expected from this type of place but I wish it tasted better. Maybe me and my two friends all just ordered the wrong thing.
