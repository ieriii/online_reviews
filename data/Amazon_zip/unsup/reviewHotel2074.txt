I was in a wedding and the reception was here. The reception service and food was good. However while everyone loved the steak, they did not like the chicken. The cake was bad (dry, tasteless, even the frosting). I mention the latter because the hotel provides the cake. We had some room issues the first night, but the staff accommodated us and slashed the first rate night in half. Thank you manager Ben! Room service food was great. Bath towels were scratchy. The views are beautiful. Get a drink at the bar, whether or not you are  staying at the hotel. Parking requires you to schlep up and down a steep stairwell. The location is out of the way, and the cabbies will rip you off.
