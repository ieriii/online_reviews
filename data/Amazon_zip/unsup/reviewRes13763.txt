Wow, great beers and food. My good friend is acquiantances with the brew master, so he took me here on my recent visit home to Chicago. After a few beers by the bar, we sat down for some burgers, bleu cheese mussels and a few more beers... all was just amazing, including the service. Highly recommended!
