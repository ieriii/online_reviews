Best Thai food I've ever had. Hands down. I don't live in Chicago any more, and it's one of two restaurants I make sure to visit whenever I go back. Shrimp shumai and chicken satay are my favorite appetizers, and the Pad Thai is an absolute must have -- I've never had better. Curry fried rice and the beef salad are also favorites. Prices are also reasonable, service is good (although sometimes a bit slow), and food is just fantastic! Try it!
