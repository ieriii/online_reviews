An "edgier" bar that caters to everyone -Best service I've ever had at a bar. -Well executed burgers w great toppings, mac and cheese is top notch -Would get the fries well done but that's personal preference -Usually rock DVDs playing but not intrusive to your meal or conversation -Awesome patio for warmer months -The owner Pete is accommodating and goes out of his way to make sure you are fully satisfied -The drinks are cheap and the beer is ice cold, what more do you want? I go at least 2 or 3 times a month and never leave disappointed
