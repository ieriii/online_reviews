I'm torn about writing this review. I really want my fellow Koreans to succeed, but this place really gives Korean chicken a bad, bad name. The owners are so super nice and seem to be trying extremely hard (annoyingly hard as Nicole R mentions...). I was so excited to hear that this place opened, but I'm afraid that it won't be in business for long... The whole point of Korean fried chicken is that the fat is rendered out of the skin (please read my Bon Chon review) and still remains very moist and super crispy. The is was not the case with Crisp's chicken. It was super fatty. The skin was basically unedible, and folks, that should be the best part of Korean fried chicken. The sauces were sooo salty on the smaller pieces and super bland on the larger pieces. I also had a big breast chunk that was undercooked. If you want the real thing, please head to NYC, Los Angeles, or Seoul. I'm actually embarrassed for Crisp that they're putting the "Korean Fried Chicken" label on their chicken. I thought that I wouldn't have to travel for Korean fried chicken (KFC) anymore, but was I wrong! I guess if you've never had the real thing, you may actually think it is ok - ignorance is bliss!!!
