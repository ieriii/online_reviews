I was introduced to this place by my Chinese friend who brought me to Lao Sze Chuan to try "real" Chinese food. She helped me chose the very authentic Chinese dishes and they were delicious! Everything I tried was incredible, although I have to admit that I avoided the intestines, pig ears, etc. The service was not great, but I am willing to overlook that in light of it's amazing food. 5-star ratings do not come easily to me; I've tried lots of Chinese food over the years, and this is the best I have found. I'm so excited to bring friends and family to enjoy this place as much as I did.
