Very nice place!! Great strawberry margaritas! Great food!! I have never had calamari that been sooooo delicious!!! Tuna was awesome!!! and my friend got samosas i believe-were great too! Nice staff, not too attentive but pay attention to you regardless that they are busy. They have a nice roof top. It is not that big and clubby but a very special place to hang out at night and have a cocktail. Atmosphere is not common-very relaxing and even music was just right( not too loud and not too silent-just to enjoy) will definitely be back!
