Yeah man! Love this place. Here is why: Crazy cakes in the window that always change, they make some really unique looking cakes for people, a butterfly one, a cat in the hat cereal box one, a female chesticles one, a man package one, a big strawberry one, you get it. Its cool Macaroons: Holy mountain mother mary immaculate sisters ladies mountains of guadalupe. Soo good, and gluten free for you porkers. My fav's are the Passion fruit chocolate and the salted caramel. I got one of each kind they had and a cute owl cookie and it was like $13. Coffee: I like my sugar with this and cream. Tea: Good selection without being too snobby about it. Adjoining couch / chill area: What a great idea. Separate the cash register from the area hipsters pretend to do work in and POW! You have a, um, nice area to work in? I don't know but this area adjoining the bakery is very comfy and chill. To sum up, try it, or at least stop by the window to see what crazy cakes they have made for some rich a-hole.
