A very enjoyable experience, buoyed up exceptionally well by the staff and ambiance. As mentioned in an earlier review for this venue, ordering one appetizer (the chocolate and cheese one) and one main course will satisfy a party of two easily and, with a few glasses of wine, will keep your tab in the low three figures. The food is fresh and well presented, though of course, how well it's cooked is strictly up to you. It did take me a few times to get the tenderloin to the right level of medium rare. About the ambiance. You might have heard this place is dark. While still light enough to see people on the other side of the room, the illumination is definitely set to "intimate." We had piped music - a simple guitar - which added to the calmness and coolness. And, as mentioned, the staff - both in the bar and on the floor - were genuine and attentive. The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars was that the restaurant feels like an experience, and not one that I, personally, would have to have repeatedly. It's a good experience, mind you, and ideal for quiet nights out. But just not enough to want to return in a week or month or a few months. P.S. Do not bring kids. They (and presumably you with them) will be turned away. This is firmly an adult establishment.
