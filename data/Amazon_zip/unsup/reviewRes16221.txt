I read reviews and got feedback from localites before checking them out. The two entrees I'd heard the most about was their ribs and pizza. I like a nice doughy pizza from time to time and went with their pan pizza. Forgot to ask for double dough which was still fine because their pizza was doughy enough with a nice crust. Could've used a bit more sauce for a more tangy feel, but, it was a decent pizza. Nothing to write home about. Looking around the bar I saw that most ordered pasta and an afterthought was that I should have also. The ribs were okay, I think they were boiled and could have been cooked longer. Of course I could've had them sent back, but at the time I was hungry and didn't care much. Their BBQ sauce is tasty but extra was needed. Highlights:  The fresh made focaccia pizza bread which comes out standard and my heavily poured cocktail. Our service was top notch and we hardly waited for anything at all. Pleasant dark toned decor in the bar area with comfy cushioned booth seating. They had the room decorated with lights since it twas the season and as the night progressed and the lights dimmed I wished I was with a chick rather than sharing the moment with a dude. A good spot for date night. Places like this are best for pasta and other dishes, pizza is an afterthought. IF you're thinking what I was thinking about their ribs, perhaps you should have it on the night of ribs specials.
