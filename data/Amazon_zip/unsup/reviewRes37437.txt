Yeah, I'm not with these 5 star people. My mom and I went there last Sunday and were thanfully early enough that we didn't have to wait forever. I've been wanting to go there for a while and glad that I finally got to try it, but my overall impression is that it's not a place I'd work that hard to get to again. The beer selection is huge, which is great if you really like to try different beer. I do enjoy difference, but some of the beer on the menu was extremely expensive, so I wasn't about to venture that far from my usual. There is no table service there, either, so expect to be standing at the bar for a while when you want something (and if you're lucky, you'll get a little attitude to boot!).  The food? The menu looked way more upscale than I would have expected from a beer joint and it wasn't very big. I was thinking pub grub -- though hopefully something vegetarian, as that is what I am. It is hardly that (pub food), which I can appreciate, but the vegetarian food on the menu was too complicated for what I was in the mood for that night and it was MUCH more expensive than I was in the mood for as well, so we didn't bother. The seated dining area did look like a pretty nice atmosphere, though, so it might be a good place to try sometime when you're in the mood for that. I'm not sure why the people who have reviewed this place before me are so damn psyched about this place. It was pleasant enough, but not all that. If a friend wanted to meet there, I'd go -- unless it gets as crowded as they say -- but I'd probably never recommend it as a place to meet, myself.
