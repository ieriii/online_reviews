Had dinner at Anteprima last night. They have a nice wine and martini list - martini was chilled well and very good.  We shared the antipasto appetizer which was excellent.  I ordered from the regular menu and had the orrechiette with lamb sausage - it was slightly spicy and prepared perfectly.  My friend had an item off the specials menu - which was a spaghetti carbonara.  It did not have the usual heavy carbonara sauce and was excellent.  We shared the "espresso" dessert which was flan like, but nicely flavored. The service was good, but a little pushy on getting the order placed.  I like to relax and have some talk time before ordering - but that was a minor point. Overall, it was very good!
