Coast may be my favorite BYOB sushi spot in Chicago. I love Toro Sushi just as much BUT I didn't have to wait an hour to be seated at Coast since they allowed reservations. The inside was spacious which was a welcome change compared to the common "touching elbows" situation at Toro. It might seem like a minuscule thing but having more space enhances a proper dining experience. The food? Yum-o. The most important ingredient, the fish, was fresh and practically melted in my mouth. The other ingredients were not to be overlooked either and complimented the sushi well. The mochi cakes for dessert rounded out an awesome meal. When the bill came, we could hardly believe the inexpensive amount we paid for such an delightful meal.
