Regret so badly that I didn't have the camera w/ me - the 90 yr old violinist was the high point of the night at Sabatino's, playing for me with all of his heart, "BESA ME MUCHO" This performance pretty much made the night - not the food - not the service. The food is greasy, buttery, and tasteless. If you really want Italian, go to Club Lucky or Daves Italian Kitchen. Sorry Sabatinos
