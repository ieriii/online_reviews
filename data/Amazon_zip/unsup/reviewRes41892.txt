Not a very good experience for us. Let me start by saying that this place came highly recommended by several of our friends. Normally we would go to Morton's for special occasions. We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and were seated at about the right time. Our waiter and the service was quite pleasant. The low rating was due to the food quality. I'm going to go right down the line; The Lobster Bisque was mediocre at best. The baked potato was just a potato, nothing special. The Asparagus with Hollandaise sauce was just ok. The steak and lobster were subpar (the steak being not very tender and the lobster was slightly tough with not a great rich flavor). On the plus side the Bread Pudding dessert was definitely amazing. My husband and I only go out maybe one or two times a year for a special dinner and to have our, what we consider expensive, dinner not meet our expectations is such a disappointment. Unfortunately for Ruth's Chris, we will probably go back to Morton's for future special dinners.
