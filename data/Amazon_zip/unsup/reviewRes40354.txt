Just wanted to add an addendum to my review and bump the star up a notch. I had been torn on how to review and I feel my 2 star rating was more a reflection on my unique dietary situation. That said, it may have been a little low. I will leave the 4 and 5 stars to people who are more qualified to judge wild boar sloppy joes and kobe meatballs. If I ate meat, I'm sure I'd love them!
