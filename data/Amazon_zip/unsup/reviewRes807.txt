The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, was decent. I felt that the duck sausage was extremely gamey. I also tried the Antelope Sausage with Sweet & Spicy Pepper Mayonnaise and Saint Nectaire Cheese, I loved the Mayo and the cheese, but again I felt the game-ness of the Antelope meat was over powering. However, when eating Antelope you expect game-ness. My favorite was the Alligator!! It was juicy, slightly sweet from the toppings. It was phenomenal. Luckily I went on a weekday and the wait was only about 30 mins.
