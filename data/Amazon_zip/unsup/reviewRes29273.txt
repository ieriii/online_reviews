The Farfalle Pollo is fantastic!!!! I love that its a little place, really cute but annoying when there is nowhere to sit. I've been there many times with massive hangovers and this food hits the spot. I've tried a little bit of everything and it's ALL good but I always go back to the farfalle, YES its that good! The service varies every visit but it's cool with me. The only negative is if you can't get a booth, all the other tables are little to open. No girl talk or cussing if there are kids around & there is ALWAYS at least one kid.
