The bf and I have repeatedly failed to wake up early enough to make it for breakfast to try the chilaquiles...until last weekend. This was my first Bayless experience and I'm happy to have started with XOCO. Even though we were well aware of a wait, it wasn't too long before we were allowed to place our order and be seated. It gave us time to take in the ambience which in fact wasn't too complicated or generic. You could see what you were in for without any unnecessary frills. We ordered both kinds of the chilaquiles - one with the chicken and one with the eggs. Even though we much prefer more crunch to our bite, I think the way the dish was prepared was meant for the more "soggy" texture and I was completely satisfied with it. We also ordered some churros. Those were the best churros I've ever eaten. The taste is indescribable yet nostalgic; the complete opposite of sugar on fried dough. It reminded me of how cuisine used to be decades ago minus the artificial flavors. Definitely consider the agua del da (water of the day, of course). That day, I had the guava water which tasted like I was on Survivor in the jungle straight up drinking for my life.
