If I could go less than a star I would. This might be the worst restaurant in the world since Hawkeye's on Taylor Street. I expect decent service. I have come to realize that exceptional service is rare - so I will settle for decent. The service here sucks so hard it isn't even funny. The women that work there are very easy on the eyes and the other two on shift that night - seem to be hustling. One of them even came over to greet us when we looked lost. We looked lost because our girl was no where to be seen. I ordered the cilantro bean soup. It taste like cigarettes in toilet water. People I am not tough to please - but cilantro bean soup should have some cilantro in it. The "waitress" came by and saw a full cup of soup and asked "How was it?" I replied, "It wasn't very good." She smiled and walked away. Then she came out with the sandwich; the el diablo. I was ready to be blown away. A beef sandwich named after the devil has to be something. What it was was sparse and bland. It had as much flavor as the table. They brought something called potatoes O'Brien. In theory cubes potato - green peppers - onions fried WOW! Right? Raw potato and greasy peppers. No waitress. The busboy - who was serving our drinks and taking care of us - took the plate back to the kitchen to have them actually cook the potatoes. She looked at him - looked at me and smiled. BUT SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! He brought it back out - by then the scrimpy devil sandwich was a culinary memory. The potato experience was just chalky. She smiled once more as she dropped the check - she was like a Stepford Waitress except that she had less personality. I have heard they have a good brunch. I will never return to find out. It is simply too big a city.
