I went for the first time about a week ago. The atmosphere is very intimate and you can tell they aim to create a romantic evening - great date spot for a special occasion. The food was delicious and our server was entertaining and attentive. It's definitely on the pricey side but the food and experience is worth it. I especially loved the 8 dips that came with the entree...and the sangria was also pretty good. Just be careful if you bring a picky or paranoid eater because you do cook your own meats at the table in the oil. We thought this was great fun but just a heads up!
