Yeah, you have to wait... but anticipation is half the fun because the pay-off is so worth it. I had a tasty chicken sausage with all the fixins and shared a big heap of french fries.  Everyone who works there is happy and the sausages can't be beat. The. Stuff. Dreams. Are. Made. Of. Hot Damn, Hot Dougs!
