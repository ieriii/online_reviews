We now order all of our birthday cakes from Alliance. They do a fabulous job! We have had them create a Prada handbag cake, cow cake, and Angelina Ballerina cake. Obviously, the handbag was the one for me....and our little one liked the other cakes! The cakes are moist and delicious! Love buying cookies, scones, and any other treat out of the cases when we are in the neighborhood. My favorite bakery!
