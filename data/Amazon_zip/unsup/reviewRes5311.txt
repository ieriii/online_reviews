We would give this place a 3.5 if we could. The ambience was great. We were there in October so the weather was not quite cold but it was cold enough that they had the outside burners going on. The service was a little slow but they were very busy while we were there. The food selection is very eclectic and honestly some items were not familiar to us. The staff however was friendly and willing to explain and answer any questions. The Butternut Squash Arancini & Sage Pesto was very yummy and even the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg was surprisingly tasty. Their wine selection is extensive but we went with beer as it was early in the afternoon. The server recommended the Panino con Nutella and oh she was right, you can never go wrong with Nutella. We definitely will give this place another try but with so many great places to eat in Chicago, it might be tough.
