I've been here a couple of times now and I don't have anything bad to say. Great beer, great food, not unreasonable prices. A nice BIG restaurant, which we don't see in Chicago very often. As a bonus, a very picky family member of mine deemed this place to have the 'best burger hes ever had'. Thats saying a lot coming from him. I'm really happy to have this kind of place in the city. We need more of this. Big fan.
