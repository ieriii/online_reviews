I read somewhere that Chi Town isn't big on brunch..yet. But, if The Publican is any indication of a change in this statement, it certainly looks promising.  Prior to visiting the Windy City, I had made reservations for several places for the span of a 3 day weekend visit. WIth that, The Publican had the priviledge of being one of the target spots to visit, despite its unforeseen remote location from the rest of the world of Chicago. Nonetheless, it was well worth it. With 2 of my traveling companions who tolerate my love for food, we ventured here. At first, it reminded me of a bier hall from one of those like Hofbrau or even inside the tent at Oktoberfest in Munich, but looking much nicer.  The coffee was good and we split a side of ginormous hash. Gotta have that hash I say. Then of course there was the family style sharing of these beauties: -Red wine poached eggs benedict - was interesting and good, but the taste of wine in the egg is very subtle, which perhaps is a good thing. -Side of maple syrup pork belly - how could you nOT? Tis good.. -Maple Glazed Pork Shoulder with a sunny side up egg, grits, and pickled veggies and kale - when i saw the side of maple syrup pork belly come out, I realized it was almost the same thing as this meat, but bacon - wise. It was a definite must cause it was BOMB. If there are more places like this in Chicago, I'm sure brunch won't be a concern.
