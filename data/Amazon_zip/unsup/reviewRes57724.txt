A friend of mine brought me here, or else I don't know how I would have found out about it but I'm glad I did! All the staff was super friendly and attentive.We had beers because we were in the mood, but I have heard the wines are excellent and wouldn't doubt it. The beers we're top notch, really flavorful imports.They serve breakfast all day, which is an added bonus for a breakfast lover like me. They have a lot of great options though. Definitely one of those places where everyone will be able to find something they like!
