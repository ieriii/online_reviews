Demera really is one of the best priced Ethiopian places I've been to. The food is flavorful, but not very spicy.  I definitely suggest one of the samplers or specials that will make you try some appetizers and/or dessert. The sambussa we had was delicious, and something we hadn't had before.  The service was pretty slow, even considering dinner rush. I wouldn't come here on a weekend night expecting to get in and get out, but it is an enjoyable atmosphere to sit and enjoy the night with good company. Excellent cocktails as well, a nice bonus.
