Decor- classy Service- a lil slow at times but i will forgive them cuz I forget that I'm in the Mid-West most of the time Perfect for- DATE NIGHT! they had this pre-fix menu with priness bride movie upstairs........ (fyi: SAF looking for TDH(tall: at least over 5'11" dark: tanned/brown hair/brown eyes and handsom: if taller than 6'1" this could be compromised) SWM- must be a humanist (diplomat or gov't related), intellectual, cultured, hard working, sensitive/intuitive and most importantly self-made (PARENTS MUST BE POOR- as in they have what they have cuz they WORKED for it)
