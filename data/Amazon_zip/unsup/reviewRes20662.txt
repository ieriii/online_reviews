I don't even like sushi that much, but i loved this place for many reasons. 1.) Cool-ass decor -- new, asian-inspired, interesting elements 2.) Yummy Soup -- the spicy miso was amazing 3.) Veggi Roll -- not on the menu but one of the specials. it was a roll with cucumber, avocado, pickle, etc, all tempura'ed and sliced....like little bites of heaven :) 4.) good looking crowd -- yes, i'm usually not one to notice, but daamnnnnn! Go, NOW, FAST, HURRY!
