Been waiting to come here for so long and am glad we finally did, however, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizer garlic bread was amazing however, the pasta (truffle) that everyone raves about was above average but far from superb. Way too creamy and loaded with garlic (felt it the next day). Atmosphere is very clubby/loud so not the best place for a first day but young, hip crowd. Drinks were good. Fun for a group of ppl but not a romantic night out. PS: Check out the bar downstairs near the bathrooms, pretty unique.
