We just LOVE this place. They decor is uniquely Turkish. The staff are really NICE. The service is GREAT. They use really fresh ingredients. I had the Chicago crepe. it's simply Delicious! You must try it.  My friend had the strawberry crepe. The presentation was lovely & couldn't have been more Delicious. I hope more people try this little neighborhood TREASURE. The prices are Reasonable. There are many Vegetarian choices, as all crepes are meatless. They give you the option of ADDING your choice of MEAT for an additional small charge.  Also you can create your own crepe. Use your imagination. And the soup is a vegetable strained soup & is just out of this world!!! Reasonable prices. Most crepes are $8.50 meatless. Add meat for $2.50.
