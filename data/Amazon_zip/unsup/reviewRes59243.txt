Last evening, we held my mother's 88th birthday party at Sun Wah. There were 30 of us. Some in our group had never dined at Sun Wah. Hands down, everyone agreed that this is probably the best Chinese restaurant in Chicago. This says a lot since we are Chinese. The Peking duck is out of this world.I want to especially acknowledge the thoughtfulness of management who went out of their way to procure a special type of birthday pastry for my mother. I was told that the grandparents were sent to Chinatown to purchase the pastries. Considering the bustling business that they have, this was unexpected extraordinary care for their customers.Lilly
