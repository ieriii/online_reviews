I brought my family here because I heard they are known for their BBQ duck. I know that they have a dinner you can do for $35 or so but we decided to order other things in the menu including the duck. My uncle noticed these rice patties that they give with their duck meal and he wanted to try ordering them separately and they do not sell them other than with that meal. My uncle wouldn't give up and the owner was so kind to come to our table and explain to us why she couldn't sell it to us so now it makes sense that they don't make it in house and only get a limited supply for those who order the duck meal. Other than that, I thought this was probably the best duck I've ever had. The restaurant is clean and pretty big and good for big groups.
