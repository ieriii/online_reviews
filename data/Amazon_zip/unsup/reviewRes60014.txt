I actually wanted to give 5 stars, but whenever my wife feels cold in a place in winter, I've gotta subtract a star. Sorry, Big Jones, but we've gotta take care of the ladies. I know that some of these buildings are tough to heat, but you might need to upgrade, especially toward the front of the restaurant, or install a proper air lock (like on Star Trek, the original edition).That said, I think you're going to get a 4-5 star taste here, even if you ordered at random. For me, there are several things I could have ordered on the menu. But it's all about the gumbo when it comes to my interest in this cuisine. The last gumbo I had here in Chicago, I think, was at Heaven on 7. It was good but didn't leave me feeling like I was on my trip to New Orleans, pre-Katrina. And I'm sure that they're still cooking it up down there, God bless 'em. The gumbo at Big Jones had such good texture and deep color that I thought I was enjoying an Indian curry. The Andouille sausage was to die for, and you can order the gumbo here as a bowl or a meal (which includes a big dollop of rice in the middle). The gumbo is 5 stars in my book.Our meal came with complimentary corn bread, and it's one of the best I've had. Let's face it though, almost anything as buttery smooth as this corn bread is going to taste good. Nevertheless, we both loved it, and you will, too.Anyway, I think the food here is pretty authentic but don't claim to be an expert. Whatever lack of authenticity may exist is compensated for by using sustainable and organic ingredients (in most, and possibly all cases). Considering this aspect, the prices here are reasonable.Now if we can get the heating under control in the winter, we'll be all set. Perhaps they keep it cool so we can handle the gumbo.
