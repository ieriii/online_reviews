I'm gonna have to give this place 5 stars among hot dogs. They simply sell the best hotdogs I've ever tasted (Portillo's a close 2nd). I had the Salma Hayek (it's not spicy lol), The Dog (original Chicago style hot dog) and the Paul Kelly (soaked in beer). They're all very delicious!!! Btw, they also have Foie Gras on the hot dogs and Duck Fat Fries that you guys should try. Don't come Sunday!!! We came there once just to see a sign in the door that says "We're closed on Sundays" lol...
