OH my, I cannot believe I did not update my review earlier. First of all, after reading my first Yelp review, the owners contacted us, apologizing profusely for the misunderstanding, and also sent a lovely invitation to bring our friend out (who didn't make the first brunch) for brunch/lunch on them. Over the top customer service! THAT is what I'm talking about people!!! SO nice. Second of all, we've been back twice for weekday brunch/lunch since. Once was with a group of 8 or 10 people in July. The other time was a few days ago, we took my mom there for her birthday. The waiter overheard us wish her a happy birthday when our food came, and when we were done eating presented us with a piece of red velvet cake (on the house) with a candle in it! So sweet! And oh my god - SO good. It had a cream cheese semi-freddo on the side - the perfect match. The waiter was so sweet. We wanted to put him in our pocket and take him home. Alas, we did not as we figured this might have creeped him out a bit. Anyhow, I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. Everything is just so good. They never balk at my "um could you sub a salad for the potatoes" (and this last time I had a lovely salad with green apples and shaved celery/fennel - yum!), the service is great, the waiters very personable, and obviously the owners know what they're doing. :) Bravo Big Jones, for coming through for us!!!
