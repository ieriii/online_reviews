Alinea surpassed all of my expectations, which is pretty impressive because I had set a pretty high standard in my mind. The experience was unique, fun, amazing and most importantly, it tasted really, really good. I was a bit worried that technique would overshadow the food. I'm a pretty died in the wool farm to table kind of girl, but I was so wrong. The techniques are interesting and playful. They do not detract from the food, rather they transform it into an experience unlike any other. While the food is the heart of the matter, many other people have broken that down in detail, so I will focus on the experience. I was nestled in a lovely chair (why don't all restaurants have such wonderful chairs?) and served by a cadre of staff the most strange and wonderful food. I was very impressed with the staff, they were an excellent blend of knowledgeable, sociable, and smart. Surely this is fine dining, but it was not in the least bit stuffy. I found the young sommelier especially charming.  Even though the food may be presented in bizarre ways (apple balloon) the flavors may ring so true as to whisk you off in a food memory. The dashi almost made me tear. That may sounds really silly to most people. But I'm an LA born-Tokyo loving food fiend studying in Omaha, so chew on that for a second. The dashi's flavors were so clear, I felt home and comforted and I was almost overwhelmed. I was not at all prepared for the experience. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity, best present ever.
