I went here on a Friday to meet up with some old friends to celebrate a lads birthday a few months ago and definetely had a great time. I came late and was suprised to find myself paying about $12 cover for the live jazz band. (worth it). My friends arrived earlier and amazingly took over a reserved booth that I eventually learned was Al Capone's booth of choice! The place was standing room only for the majority of the night and for the most part silent. The band was kickass as we downed several pints of beer and cheap bottles of cabernet. The bathroom was hilarious because It was literally the size of a closet and located almost ON STAGE. Its pretty cool when you leave the loo, and everyone goes from staring at the band, to staring at you with your zipper down. Rock the shiz, Silky
