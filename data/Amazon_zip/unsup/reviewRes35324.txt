Shaw's is my favorite restaurant in the city. Not only does the ambiance bring you back to the era of the untouchables, but the quality of food you will eat is second to none. Bit on the pricey side, but the seafood you are getting is worth the extra $$$. Ever seen Deadliest Catch? The crabs you will enjoy at this Chicago landmark are caught by Captain Sig Hansen on the boat, The Northwestern. The crabs are absolutely perfect and huge! Sick of having crabby smelling hands all night? Shaw's serves a tea and lemon dish that you dip your fingers in to deodorize your digits. Thank you for the tip by the way, I use this every time I de-vein shrimp at home. If you make it to Shaw's during lunch, check out the oyster bar. I have eaten oysters there about 25 times and never had a single bad oyster. Match that up with a huge Bloody Mary (complete with shrimp and all the trimmings) and you have a lunch you will never forget!
