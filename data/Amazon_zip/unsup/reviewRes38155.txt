I have a love/hate relationship with Hopleaf. love: the CB+J sandwich (possibly the best sandwich in Chicago). the beet salad. the amazing beer selection. the atmosphere (when it's not too crowded). hate: how hard it is to get served at the bar when it's crowded. being told by the snarky door guy that the wait for a table was 45 minutes (confirmed by my boyfriend) and after I came back in 40 minutes that I'm obviously an idiot and he told me an hour and a half (not confirmed by my boyfriend). also hate that I once ordered rabbit (delicious, by the way) and took half of it home, only to find the bones of the other half included with my leftovers. REVOLTING, and really indicative of the general inattention of the staff. I do like taking visitors to Hopleaf because it's so much fun, but my last couple of experiences have really soured me on the place, so I'm no longer interested in going there regularly.
