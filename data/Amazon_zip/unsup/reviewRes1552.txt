I'll take the specials. Which one he asks? I'll take all of them.  Our journey began at 11:20am on Friday. We went from discussing 1 dog each to an hour and half later ending up with 3 dogs each (12 total) and a couple of orders of duck fat fries.  If you don't want to binge, absolutely don't talk about what you should eat during the long wait. The mindset becomes we waited this long and when are we going to be back - order it all. My highlights were the following: - The Fois Gras hot dog but wish the fois gras was prepared hot.  - The smoked shrimp and pork was good. Word of advice; remove some (not all) of the blue cheese; you'll feel better about yourself because you saved about 300 calories.  Your going to be full the entire day unless your my friend, who managed to put away a quarter pound value meal and a pastrami sandwich in a span of 15 minutes in the wee hours of the morning. He must have been talking to himself while waiting for us to get post partying food - he definitely has a tendency to binge :).
