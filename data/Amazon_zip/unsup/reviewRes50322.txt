went to fifty/50 friday night around 7 for dinner with the bf. he thought it was owned by jay-z, but that's the 40/40 club in NYC dearest... valet is only $8, but we'll get to that later. after handing over the keys, we were greeted by a friendly hostess (whaaat?) and led to a small table on the first floor. it was a little tight but nothing terrible. cubs-nats, hockey playoffs, and nba playoffs on the tvs. random mix of tunes likely coming from an ipod, a good mix. the waitress and waiter-and-training came immediately to get our drink order, gave good honest suggestions. i tried the lagerita, it was good.  she came back pretty promptly to get our food order, answered more questions about the menu and the setup of the place. brought out more drinks as soon as she could as well. she was good - easy going but informative at the same time. a rarity. also, the busguys kept our water glasses full, very appreciated. food came out quickly - he had the skirt steak, i had the pulled pork.  both came with lots o' fries and were very good. i asked for extra BBQ and the waiter in training brought it right our to me. that's a rarity too! when she came back to check on us, we asked about private parties and how the set up works. gave us all the info and told us about their bottle service, which is the cheapest in the city. at $120 for grey goose, she wasn't kidding. and they serve half bottles too, if you are so inclined. all in all, a great experience. liked the decor, the food, the service, everything. lots of different vibes in there, but somehow they work together. we'll be back for dinner for sure, but maybe i'll plan a private party there sometime in the future - both the top floor and basement areas look like they would work well for small to medium size events. only complaint - only one valet guy working and took forever to bring the car around. but it wasn't his fault, so...oh well.
