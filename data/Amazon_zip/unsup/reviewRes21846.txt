Superdawg is one of the Northwest Side Chicago landmarks. The food is ok. Yeah, there are better hot dog places out there, but this place is special. This place has been in a good deal of books, magazines, and food shows on TV. I think it is good enough to warrant an occasional visit, doubly so on a nice sunny day. Full disclosure: I was a camp counselor at a small diabetic day camp a few years ago, and Superdawg donated free hot dogs for our last day. Superdawg donated enough hot dogs for every camper, parent, and staff member, and did so happily.
