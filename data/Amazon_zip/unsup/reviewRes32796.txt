I think they do a fabulous job of making non-meat items taste and look identical to the meat items. We were just here a couple weeks ago - had vegan cheesecake, vegan ruben and tasted my husband's vegan biscuits and gravy. Mmmmm. Props to this place to appealing to omnivores as well as vegetarians. I love it.
