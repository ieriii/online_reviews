The food isn't great, but it's good--I don't think you could be disappointed, it's all pretty safe. No more expensive than, say, Cheesecake Factory (with HUGE portions to boot). The best thing about this place is location--if you're lucky enough to get the corner round room, you've got an awesome view of Michigan Ave. The staff is always friendly and service is remarkably fast for how busy it always seems to be. I've been able to go on a Saturday night without a reservation and a short wait, but if you're planning on going definitely make a reservation...they get pretty packed (yes, with tourists, mostly!). ALso, it's loud and busy so probably not the best place for an intimate dinner...I'd stay away from going with super large groups as well, just because it's not the kind of place I feel like you could sit down and stay for a while without getting the stink eye.
