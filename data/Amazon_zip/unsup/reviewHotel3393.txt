i love the location of the Hotel this is why I'm coming back again, I'm not familiar with Chicago enough to try another location. I've stayed here once last year for the long weekend, and planning on coming back again for the Victoria day long weekend May 19-21. the standard rooms are tiny, but its really well decorated, I felt it wasn't worth the extra $30 bucks per night upgrade if I had to pay $50 per night for parking already! They are charging a ridiculous $50 per night for parking, I called in and ask if we could get the parking for cheaper, the staffed just said I would have to use public parking and walk over, no help, didn't say how far it was either.
