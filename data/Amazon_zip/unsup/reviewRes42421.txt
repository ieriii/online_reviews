I'm fat in all the wrong places and loathe people that create more obstacles to my warped idea of self-content. Cheese, sausage, crust, sauce...get the thick pan stuff where the ingredients combined and heated to the proper consistency and leaves me more hours of sweaty salty tears to shed as I run more miles down Ashland in pursuit of a greater me. Not much for ambience, tons of seating as the new room next door has the personality of a bus terminal waiting area...small parking lot and what else...no alcohol, not sure about BYO, never though of it as I only sat in once to eat and was in a pop mood at the time.
