I'll be honest - when i hear "steakhouse restaurant chain" i automatically assume it's not going to be anything awesome. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! Being a Filet Mignon lover, I try filet mignons at every steakhouse i go to, and given all the excellent independently owned steakhouses in Chitown, I wasnt expecting much from a huge chain restaurant like Wildfire. Holy Cow! ***The Filet Mignon is EXCELLENT here!*** The meat is tender, juicy, well balanced in flavor, simply a gloriously delicious experience with every bite! They offer several filet optionswith different flavorings on the menu but i chose the original Filet Mignon. Also, the Wildfire Chopped Salad is also AMAZING - probably one of the best you'll have. I don't even like to order salad at restaurants if it's not free, but at Wildfire, it's a must! The service and ambience is also nice and classy.
