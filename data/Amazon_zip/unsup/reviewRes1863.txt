I really like Hot Doug's. The wait wasn't too bad when we got there (I didn't time it.. maybe 20-25 minutes?) and the guy taking our orders (the owner?) was really nice and friendly. Plus! We barely had to wait for a table. A group behind us tried to swoop in on a group leaving a table, but one of the waitstaff told them that we were here first, and cleaned the table off for us. So nice! The food was out within five minutes and we gorged ourselves. We ordered seven hot dogs/sausages between the three of us and shared an order of duck fat fries. Holy moly. The sausages were delicious, and the fries were amazing! I would only recommend that you don't order your sausage with "everything" on it... I was too ambitious and could barely finish my food. Just stick to what you KNOW you like.  Rock on, Hot Doug's.
