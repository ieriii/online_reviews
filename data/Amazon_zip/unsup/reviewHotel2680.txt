This Place rocks! its so quaint, clean , quiet and private and smack dab in the center of everything! just steps from Bloomies which I loved! I had a friend in town and they needed to be in the city what a perfect spot. The staff is exceptional and the gym is great. I loved the decor. and the bartenders were attentive and fun.
