I'm a huge fan of Gilt Bar. My first time there, I took my mom for dinner since her flight arrived a bit later in the evening and it's right down the street from my apartment. We shared the beet salad and bolognese noodles, and both were fantastic! We enjoyed a couple glasses of wine as well, which our server recommended. She was super friendly, and we loved the dark, loungey atmosphere. I've been there quite a bit recently, and their downstairs lounge, Curio, might be my new favorite place in Chicago. The small room is lit largely (if not entirely) by candlelight, and the atmosphere is very dark and intimate. They always have great music playing too! I've only been during the week when it's been very quiet, but my friend was there this past Saturday and said it was packed (he said it was far less enjoyable). I'll pass on Curio on a busy evening, but during the week, nothing beats a quiet night down there, enjoying a couple cocktails and talking to the very friendly (and talented) bartenders :)
