Catering sucks! They FORGOT our Thanksgiving turkey for our company potluck. No apologies, no call back. Called us three hours after the event and simply said that they accidentally wrote down the wrong date - despite the fact that we received a confirmation email. Given the importance of the event, and the fact that 20 people were sitting around waiting.... they should have at least comped us a pie or something! Bad service.
