The food was...lame. Actually, it was kind of gross. The inside reminds me of a crappy haunted house will ill-painted black walls. The music was WAY too loud and WAY too bad. Our waitress had her butt crack hanging out the entire time. I had to ask for water three times. I can see how people might like it, but they're probably not my kind of people. We had a gift certificate, so whatever.
