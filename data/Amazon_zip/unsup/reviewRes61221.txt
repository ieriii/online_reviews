I didn't think I was going be a fan of deep-dish pizza, but the all meat concoction that was served to us may very well have been the best pizza I've ever eaten. The wait was projected to be like 40 minutes, but my girlfriend and I scabbed bar seats after like 20. I admit we were tourist and had no idea how good it was going to be. The pitcher prices were very reasonable, but the drinks we ordered afterword were a little pricey. The pizza seemed expensive until it arrived and we realized how deep the pizza actually was. The service was friendly, and I can't wait to go back and eat there again.
