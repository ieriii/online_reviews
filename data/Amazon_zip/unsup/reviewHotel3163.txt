We came in from Miami for a weekend stay We were very pleased with the quality of service, the cleanliness of the entire hotel, and the proximity to all that is within walking distance, including Navy Pier.  We recommend this hotel to anyone who has a taste for the "whatever" experience that the W Hotel offers in Chicago. We look forward to them opening up in Miami Beach in 2009. Even though this is our home town we will go because they truly know what is takes to set an atmosphere of excellence. Watch out for the restrooms on the first floor outside the bar once you walk in. The men can look through a glass into the women's restroom, and visa versa. Maybe you will like it?
