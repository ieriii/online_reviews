Tiny rooms, no fridges in rooms. Got a staph infection there, that has been a problem off and on for a year now. No contact from hotel even though I tried twice to contact them about the issue.  Too bad since I travel a decent amount for work and now avoid Holiday Inns'. Nothing here was better than any other similarly priced hotel, no in room fridge and tiny rooms would have already dragged this to a 3. Staph infection and no communication makes it a 1.
