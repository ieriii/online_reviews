I have been a long time Glenn's patron, even being one of the first ones to discover Glen's. When we first found Glenn's, it was amazing. relatively small amount of customers made a nice atmosphere and the food was very good and unique, something that would make you crave Glenn's because no where else had their style of food. However over the few months its been open it has become immensely popular, and yesterday, we say many people standing around open table, waiting to be seated at 10:00 A.M.. When I asked if we could sit at one of the open tables they said that they those tables are reserved. RESERVED!!! for breakfast. Sorry Glenn but you sold out
