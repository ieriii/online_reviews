I was so glad to finally make the trek over to Wicker Park to indulge in this fantastic brunch spot. My girlfriend and I went on a beautiful Sunday morning expecting an hour plus wait. Turns out we easily found parking, waited only 30 minutes when we were offered a seat at the bar. I was a little hesitant at first about the bar seating but we were both completely starved and ready to eat! Hands down my new favorite Chicago breakfast/brunch spot. I ordered the veggie croissant sandwich-- the perfect combo of eggs, croissant, and oodles of veggies (sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc) with an AMAZING basil mayo. It was the perfect basil to mayo ratio. My girlfriend ordered some pesto grilled chicken scramble that looked fantastic as well. To top it off, we ordered one White Chocolate Pretzel pancake, this was the way to go for sure. If someone could describe sin on a plate, it would be this. It was creamy, super sweet, with a hint of salt. Absolutely Divine. I could have never eaten the entire stack, this was the way to go. It was the perfect way to top off our brunch! There were so many other menu options that I want to try, so I will definitely be back. Highly recco the Bongo Room!
