I was very much looking forward to going to this restaurant as it was one of the places on my original list before I had come to work here in January. This is the type of menu that I find exciting and unique, but based on classic dishes and technique. I was not disappointed. We started with two very good cocktails...Cocktails that would stand their ground at any cocktail lounge that served quality drinks. Our server was gracious, informative, and attentive. Our starter, a special for that evening, was a delicious lobster salad. We then had two entrees. Mine was was a roasted Monkfish Wellington. I was not surprised that monkfish was a perfect substitute for lobster. The crust surrounding the fish was perfectly cooked...It wasn't soggy at all. My friend had the pomegranate glaised lamb. Again, it was perfectly cooked. The balance of flavors for both entrees were surprising, whimsical, and delicious.  For our desserts, we shared the chocolate chocolate chocolate, a trio of madeleines that had in their cores dark, mild, and white chocolates, and the brioche french toast. Both were great on their own as well as a pair. For my entree, I drank a wonderful 2005 Bex Riesling. Why can't I give it 5 stars? The only thing that was distracting, rather than enhancing the meal, was the music. Granted, I love 80's music, but it was just too loud. At a restaurant at this price point, I really don't think it's necessary to create this sort of vibe AND I shouldn't have to ask to turn it down. This one gripe, though, shouldn't detract you from trying this fantastic food.
