Lovely clean washrooms Attentive unobtrusive service Monday AM seated immediately though it was busy Red velvet pancakes were dense, dry and had too little sauce. The lack of quality of the food made it overpriced. It was a huge portion. The husband ordered the breakfast burrito without the cheese and sour cream. He said it was OK, nothing special. The breakfast potatoes were good. The coffee was absolutely horrible and very overpriced. We won't be back. I can't recommend the Bongo Room.
