I love this place for Brunch and Late Night Drinks! I know it's popular and crowded but with such a huge seating area, I've never had problems getting in even on a Saturday at 10a.m. The acoustics of this place makes it easy to hear each other even when it's super crowded. My favorite Brunch Items:  - Brioche French toast (so yummy) - warm and melting in your mouth. - Deluxe breakfast sandwich(my sister's favorite!) - pastrami ham and eggs - Beignets - these take awhile to bake so you have to tell the waiter upfront so they can put the order in. Just like its sister chain Cheesecake Factory, the portions are HUGE. But as I'm not a fan of Cheesecake Factory, the food is better quality at Grand Lux. If you come with a group of friends, I recommend family style as the portions are very big and great for sharing. Brunch Drinks: Try the hawaiian cooler smoothie - it was refreshing and fun!
