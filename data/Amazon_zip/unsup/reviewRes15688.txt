I stopped in here for drinks so I didn't quite get to enjoy the dining experience so I would have to come back for that, but their drinks were pretty interesting and since I sat at the bar I got to see how the bartenders work and let me tell ya it aint easy! Their most popular drink is the mojito... it's not that hard to make except when you have to crush limes and mint leaves when you start the drink and repeat that five at a time thirty seconds apart.... yea.... lol so don't forget to take care of the bartenders because they're taking care of you !!! :] The decor is phenomenal! I really felt like the theme of the place not only got across with the style of their banner outside but also managed to keep a classy, casual dining experience all whilst looking colorful and like, well, a Carnivale!! :D 4 stars until I experience the food! :]
