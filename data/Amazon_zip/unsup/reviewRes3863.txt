This is a great new addition to the neighborhood! The first time I went in I tried a chicken sandwich, and I was not at all imrpessed. But, I liked the concept and some other menu options sounded pretty good. Also, the owner was working behind the counter and was great to chat with, very friendly. I have been back several times since, love the Buddha bowls and the Korean Burrito's are soooooo good! All the food tastes fresh and tastes great! I recommend it as a quick lunch stop!
