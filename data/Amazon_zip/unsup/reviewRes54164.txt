Rick Bayless, I don't get it! Went to Xoco right before lunch on a Saturday. We had to wait to order tortas until 11:00, so we decided to have some chocolate and churros. I also decided to have an empanada while waiting. The chocolate with almond milk had a little too much almond flavoring in it, otherwise it was OK. The empanda tasted Ok and would have been much better had it not been icy cold in the center.On to the tortas. Ordered both a chicken and a short rib torta. We were sitting right at the end of the serving line where the sous chef gives the food to the servers. Prior to recieving my torta my wife turned to me and said I was not going to like my order. Just then the food arrived. I looked down on my torta and it was not slightly burnt but black. I looked at my wife and asked her how she knew. She said she was watching our food come out and heard the server tell the sous chef that the sandwich was burnt. The sous chef then turned the sandwich over and handed it to the server.Standing above the crowd is not what I would call Xoco. For much less money I can go to any number of Mexican places in Chicago and get better food and better service. The worst of it is I sent an e-mail with a picture of the burnt torta to the e-mail address on the website. I am assuming that responding to customers concerns is not one of yours.
