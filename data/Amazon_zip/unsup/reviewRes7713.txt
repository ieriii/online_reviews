My first instinct would be to bash a place like this. Actually my first instinct was to crack the code to get the most bang for the buck by refusing salad bar and sides and trying to eat as much steak as possible. That was silly. And I don't think the meat is the highest quality, over seasoned. Service is terrific, absolutely exceptional. Every time I come the manager welcomes us, the staff is on point and I feel at home. There is something special about their service that is slightly unexpected but very welcome. I typically just order the salad bar and skip the meat. If you also skip drinks makes for a rather reasonable lunch or dinner. And extremely satisfying and healthy to boot! Example of service, we ordered salad bar only, manager asks us if we want some grilled veggies. Terrific. Was there with baby in a high chair, bus boy created a pillow out of napkins, came over and put behind our baby's back. Are you kidding . . . blown away. Surprised I am writing this but they earned it.
