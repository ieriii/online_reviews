I loved Mastro's. My husband and i came here on Tuesday for an early dinner, The service and atmosphere were wonderful, but the food was superb. We shared 2 crabcakes to start, which were very tasty. For entrees we both got the bone in ribeye with a side of lobster mash potatoes. Perfection. It is an expensive restaurant, but what steakhouse isn't in Chicago. Great meal and worth the cost.
