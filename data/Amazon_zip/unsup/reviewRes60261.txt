I came here last week and picked up carry-out and I have to say the service was amazing. I ordered online before I left work, and even though I showed up 15 mins early, it was ready. The guy working the register was super friendly too! The food, though it was good, nothing to write home about and a little overrated I think. I only got the chicken, corn, and rice/beans though, so maybe the pizza is key. And I would definitely not recommend dining in, it's pretty small.
