I have mixed opinions about this place. First the drinks are incredibly strong and well crafted. I got a ginger and something or other drink. The bartender even does a little shake shake bootie dance just for you as he mixes the drink. The bartenders here definitely like to do what they do, and it shows. This place was also hard to find. It was my first time in Chicago and our cab passed the place twice. Just look for a giant mural of a man outside on the side of the building. The only thing I didn't like was that this place was very anal about everything. I guess it comes with the territory if you are visiting a speakeasy. There weren't enough seats to accomodate everyone, but still, I got yelled at for moving a barstool. Granted, I was a little tipsy, but I hate power trips. I don't think this place is fond of anyone who goes here to get their drink on. Its more of a fancy place to sit, order one drink, and look pretty. Although their drinks are great, and I love dancing bartenders, I don't think I'll return.
