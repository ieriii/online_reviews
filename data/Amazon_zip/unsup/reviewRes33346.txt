Dear Yolk, I love you and your sunshiney goodness. I cannot believe that it's taken me over two years to Yelp about Yolk. I was actually just going on to update my review, only to realize I never wrote one. Yolk is my go to brunch spot - my absolute fav and a must have spot for any and all guests. Sure the wait seems daunting when you walk in to a crowd of people, but they move tables quickly here (and never in a rush you out the door way either). Opt for counter service because you'll get seated sooner. I have to disagree with Yelpers about this being a tourist trap, it's not - you're likely to run in to some neighbors enjoying the morning. But if you want to avoid potentially touristy crowds, that's fine, more Yolk for me :) Yolk has an amazing menu, but my husband and I usually stick to the french toasts because they are so delicious! I love the Tour de France so I can have a little of everything. He loves the banana bread with nutella. Sometimes we'll add an apple muffin or some sausage, but usually the french toast is enough. Their coffee is delicious too! It must be a Latin-American blend because it has a nice nutty flavor. As far as I'm concerned, you can't beat the prices either. Everything seams priced fairly. If you're super hungry, order the omelets or crepes and eggs - HUGE portions that I can never, ever finish.
