This is the only Indian place I've tried in Chicago so far. I would go back for some more of the lamb saag but I'm sure there are better places to try. Everything I tried was good but not great. I did like the sauces that came with the samosas a lot. I was drinking too much wine that night to try a sweet lassie unfortunately.
