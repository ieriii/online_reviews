My husband and I went here for our first wedding anniversary. We did the 20 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. I believe Alinea excels at service, creativity, and it is a meal that I will always remember. However, very few of the dishes are things that I will actually crave and feel the need to eat again (although I did enjoy the pea soup). It was a wonderful experience and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, but I did not find most of the dishes to be mind blowing on a taste level. It was the best food that I'd ever seen, but not necessarily the best food that I've ever eaten. I guess creativity and presentation are pretty cool, but for me, taste reigns supreme. The experience was definitely worth the money, but I don't think it's the type of place where I feel the need to go again. I went to French Laundry with my husband when we were engaged, and I was blown away by all the amazing things that I tasted there. French Laundry is the type of place where I would feel the need to go again on another special occassion.
