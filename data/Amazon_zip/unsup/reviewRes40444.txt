After a long night of gluttony and consumption. My husband and I went here for drinks and a late night snack. The staff was more than helpful with offering suggestions for both. We started with the smoked sweetbreads, which was on the small plates list-so don't expect a large portion. (Enough for at least 4 bites.) It was perfectly prepared to melt in your mouth, with its brown butter applesauce and tasty bites of beets. Next, we (with the help of the bar back) decided on the scallops with oxtails. Again, the scallops were perfectly cooked with an even sear on both sides, and fantastic flavorings, with the help of the well marinated oxtail. Every bite, made me want more, and more, etc! Finally we decided on some desert. Not listed on the Internet, they have a chocolate cake with a wine reduction sauce. I have to say, that was the least memorable part of the meal, but tasty nonetheless. As for cocktails, they are very heavy on American made liquor, especially whiskeys. Which if you read the long menu, you can actually go through a whiskey flight tasting. Overall, I love Longman and Eagle. Just make sure you get there late, or on a weeknight. Don't even try to get in on a weekend, unless, there's a blizzard, it's almost closing time, or you don't mind a 2 hour wait.
