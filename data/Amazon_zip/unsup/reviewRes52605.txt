My first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse and I have to admit I was in heaven. An all you can eat meat excursion is just what I needed. You'll find about 15 different varieties of meat being carved for you that range from filet mignon to shrimp. When you run low, simply flip your coaster over and you'll have a swarm of waiters at your table ready to serve up more meaty goodness. There does seem to be some negative reviews based on the service, but I can say ours was real good. Mind you I went on a late Monday night and about 40% of the restaurant was filled. I can't tell you how it would be during busier times. The whole experience is pricey at $50 a head. Drinks are not cheap either. Still, if you can eat a lot of meat, it can end up being cheaper than other steakhouses on a per food to price ratio. I guess what I'm saying is, Brazzaz has its value to those who can put down a lot of meat and have a nice appetite. Not worth it if you have trouble handling a petit filet.
