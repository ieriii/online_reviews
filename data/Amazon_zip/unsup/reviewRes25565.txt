Truly great pizza. Everything about Pequod's deep dish makes you want to... well, you know...leave the one you're with & start new relationship... I've been here many many times & have yet to had anything but great pizza. This is the place when 'they' talk about Chicago having the best deep dish. This is the place that YOU can count on when you want your toppings to be done right on your heavy-sauced-crispy-salty-sweet-deep-dished-mountain-of-a-PiZzAHHhh! And they are a Blackhawks bar, so that's always appreciated. Their sausage is that type of sausage that makes you think, Ohhh, this is how sausage is SUPPOSED to taste like on a pizza?!! Enjoy with a cold BEER. Always.
