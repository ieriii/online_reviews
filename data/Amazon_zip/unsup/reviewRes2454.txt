Hot Doug is correct--There are no 2 finer words in the English language than "encased meats." They have a lot of them. All are fantastic. Unbelievable combinations of meat and cheese packed on to high quality buns that range from simple to gourmet, but all are sublime. None of this would matter if they couldn't make a tradtional dog though--but Doug's comes through like diamonds on that. Perfect in every way. If you want it grilled, get it grilled. The duck-fat french fries are the best in the world--hands down, there--I said it. You find me better fries and I'll eat them.
