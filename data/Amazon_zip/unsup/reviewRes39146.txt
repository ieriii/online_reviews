So I biked up with some friends last weekend and we arrived at 3 am. They have a neon light over the front door that posts its closing time at 5 am. The door was unlocked. People were leisurely eating inside. And the lady who appeared to be the head waitress told us, "We're closed."  What? There's rude and then there's lazy beyond belief. I think the only reason we got to eat was because we had an Asian person in our group--who, mind you is Chinese. Upon seeing her, the boss lady relented, but only addressed accepted orders from her for the rest of the evening--the other 5 of us didn't exist. The groups that came in after us weren't so lucky. All turned away. But then again, I wouldn't consider my experience after the initial "good." They wouldn't turn on the grill for us--dragon lady would only accept an order for something cooked in the kitchen. Actually, only one thing--this very mediocre pan friend bulgogi. We kept trying to order other things, but she would just respond, "bulbogi."  It was almost hilarious, were I not really hungry and paying to be treated like *&^% If this is typical, I can see why this style of restaurant is dying.
