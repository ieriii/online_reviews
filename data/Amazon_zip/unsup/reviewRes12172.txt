Hands down my favorite pizza place in Chicago. Maybe chalk it up to not being a Chicago native but while deep dish is good, I prefer the thin crust style. I also love the wide variety of pizza toppings here. My suggestion if you want something different, get a white pizza with feta and spinach. I'm not yet brave enough to try the mashed potatoes on a pizza, but give it time and a few more of their insanely delicious microbrewed beer.
