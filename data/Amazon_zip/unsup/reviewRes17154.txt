yelp defines the 5th star as "woohoo! as good as it gets!" i can't honestly give violet hour 5 stars because i personally haven't been anywhere like it before. i can say that i've been twice and both times i absolutely loved it. some people may interpret the signs posted by the entrance and in the restrooms advising that cell phone usage, baseball caps and drinks with the word "bomb" in them are prohibited as pretentious or funny, but i just assume that the owner decided to open a bar and wanted to set a certain tone for his business. maybe he or she hates cell phones in bars. maybe he or she hates douchebags.  the point here is that you go to violet hour for a certain experience, and that experience is a grade A drink that you can enjoy in a peaceful, calm and intimate environment with a person or persons that you enjoy being with. in my opinion it is worth the relatively large expense and the wait you'll likely endure.
