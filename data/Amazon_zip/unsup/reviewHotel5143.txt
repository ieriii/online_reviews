My husband and I recently stayed at the Radisson Blue Aqua for my daughter's wedding. We were there 2 nites and had a corner room on the 11th floor. It was spacious, beautifully decorated and had an amazing view. The bathroom was equally as nice and big. The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was very accommodating.  I needed a cart for gifts twice and they were there in less than 5 minutes. Visited Fillini for pre rehearsal dinner drinks and the service was excellent.  We had a post wedding breakfast in the Black Sea Lounge and the food and service were surperb! I would highly recommend the Radisson Blu!
