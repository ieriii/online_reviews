This was our first trip to The Gage - mostly based on the pretty good reviews and proximity to our apartment. Always looking for good eats in The Loop. We enjoyed it and will go back.  Very busy Friday night - bar area was screaming loud at 8 pm - middle dining area a little quieter. Lots of good food options to try, wish we had more stomach space. Wife said the soup was her favorite ever. Sweet potato and apple puree topped with bacon and chestnuts. I tasted it and it was really good. We also had the fondue, the caesar salad, and shared some scallops. All were prepared and presented well. I found the combination of the fondue along with the butter that came with the bread to be quite salty. And I like salt, so that's saying something. We found the beer, wine and mixed drinks list to be more than adequate.  All things considered we found this to be a good value. We spent $85 before tip, more than we usually spend on dinner but that included a $24 sparkling wine split for my wife and a beer for me. You can make this place a reasonable night out or a splurge, whatever you want. Seriously wanted to try a number of desserts but ran out of room. Service was excellent, including a server who was both knowledgable and who valued our opinion of the food and drinks she was serving us. We will make it a point to go back. Not just for dinner but for drinks, or dessert, or both, depending on the occasion.  Will bring out of towners here too. Solid 4 stars.
