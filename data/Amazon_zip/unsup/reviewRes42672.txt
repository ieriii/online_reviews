By far our #1 spot for 'za. We normally call ahead and order because Pepperoni is always running low. My favorite is deep dish but my husband prefers pan. The great part about the Art of Pizza is that we can both have our own faves as they sell it by the slice. Big bonus that the place is only a few blocks away and we often walk there. We rarely dine in but if we did, I noticed it's roomy enough to bring your stroller.  Two thumbs up!!
