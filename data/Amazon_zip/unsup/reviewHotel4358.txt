Really nice hotel. One block from Millenium Park. We stayed here for 2 nights and it was a really convenient location. Close to a bunch of subway stops. In the Theatre District, you will be able to soak up a lot of history just walking around the hotel itself. The hallways are filled with pictures of performers from days gone by. The furniture is all really nice and fits the decor of the hotel. There's a couple restaurants that we did not get to try, but I'm sure they're pretty good. I'm sure they're probably pretty expensive as well. All the staff was really nice and would not hesitate to stay here again.
