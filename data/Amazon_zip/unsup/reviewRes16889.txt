Violet Hour isn't my bag. Do not get me wrong; the cocktails are very good and worth the $12 each. I like that it's hard to find. I like that they have introduced me to new and excellent booze(s) that I would not have otherwise found.  The dark environment, the awkward nubby little tables, the warbling music, the weird alice in wonderland chairs, the rules of the house near the bathroom - those things turned me off. This is a bar with a nightclub feel, and the pretensions aren't necessary. If I'm around and there isn't a 1+ hour wait to get in I might sample a few more drinks, but I won't make this a destination again.
