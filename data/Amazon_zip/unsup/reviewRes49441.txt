The steak combination plate is amazing, especially for the price ($21). A medium rare is actually cooked medium rare and the steak is tender, juicy, and spiced perfectly. The baby octopus that came with the combination was also delicious. If there is a complaint to be made, I wish they included some kind of leafy vegetable with the combo plate. The restaurant was also a little loud if you are looking for an intimate setting but the food more than makes up for it.
