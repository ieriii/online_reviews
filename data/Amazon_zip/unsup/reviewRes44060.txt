Wakamono? More like WHACKamono! I think I finally know whom the Godzilla Roll is named after. Upon a recent visit to Wakamono -- a place I've frequented a few times, only because of its close proximity to my apartment -- I had my ass served to me by a snatchy little host who came over to yell at my entire table for taking too long to eat (a little more than an hour). "NOT TO BE RUDE, BUT YOU HAVE TO LEAVE!" he screached. "WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE WAITING!" When we pointed out that, actually, that is kind of rude, he responded: "NO, NOT REAAALLY!" I don't know if he was feeling the pressure of not being able to manage his restuarant or if it was the pressure of his too-tight, mod-style man's kimono, but I have never witnessed (let alone been a part of) such a scene at a restaurant. Generally speaking, when a customer drops a Benjamin after three rounds of sushi and two flights of wine, you might want to treat him with a little respect. Not this place. Its only redeeming quality is the bathroom, where you can feel like a teenager all over again, who, having just been scolded by Mom, runs away to his room to drown out the awkward tension through an overbearing bass. Oh, and while you're there, just flush that hundred right down the toilet.
