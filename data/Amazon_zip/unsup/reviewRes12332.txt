Beer gets 4 stars, pizza gets 2. Atmosphere gets around 4 as well. Service gets 0. Can I give zero? Well I would. When you wait longer to see your server once you're seated than you do to get a table (45 minute wait to get seated) you get 0 stars for service. We round it out at 3 stars overall. If you're a beer geek, you should give it a drive. It's a nice casual place with a lot of regulars.
