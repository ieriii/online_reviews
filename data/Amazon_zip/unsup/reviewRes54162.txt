I have never been to a place that is so unorganized. The people there who are supposed to serve you have no idea of what is going on and it just seems too hectic. I waited over 30 minutes for a sandwhich and a soda, which when the sandwhich arrived, it was the wrong one. My friend ordered a basket of Chips and salsa and that arrived 30 minutes later also. They refunded my money, with no apologies, exect one from a lady who was cleaning the table. The lady who was, I guess the chef, did not even apologize, when I approached the counter and asked for my money back. IT'S A SANDWHICH.....HOW LONG COULD IT TAKE. I high recommend you DO NOT GO THERE FOR LUNCH, IF YOU PLAN ON ENJOYING YOUR LUNCH.
