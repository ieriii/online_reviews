Here I go, adding another review to a place with more reviews than I've written in 5 years of Elite Yelping. The real kicker is that I hadn't been here yet.  I wanted to give Violet Hour three stars. The secret entrance, dark hallways leading to dark heavy curtains, the pretension of a place where it's too dim to read the menu until after you've ordered some crazy thing you can't figure out what it is... I could go on. The high backed chairs are silly and Alice in Wonderland-like, yet offer a welcome privacy for your tryst with a secret lover, or maybe just a butterface. The dimness can help with that one.  All that said, at 6pm, we didn't wait, the staff were all exceedingly friendly, and the drinks were lovely. My first drink, the Riviera, with pineapple infused gin, lemon, egg white and Campari was odd at first, but then it grew on me. By the last drop, I would have ordered another. The second was perfect in its simplicity. I know it was a $12 simplicity, but I may or may not be able to replicate the Tattooed Seaman at home. Plus it was fun to order. I enjoy ordering things with slightly suggestive names. I'm really a teen boy. This drink was Sailor Jerry, Demerara sugar syrup, and root beer flavored bitters. With a giant ice berg in the center. It was the type of ice ball that would blacken the eye of your worst enemy. Sipping this drink while listening to many of Tom Waits' lesser known and more ambient works just seemed right, and it's this little scenario that gives Violet Hour that extra star.
