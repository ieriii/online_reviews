Do not let the humble exterior of this restaurant fool you -- the pizza here is absolutely fantastic! A few friends and I stopped by here last night before our movie across the street. Talk about conveniently located! We were hesitant to check it out at first because the outside makes it look a bit run down. Imagine our surprise when we found that Pequod's is not only nice inside, it is ENORMOUS! The menu is simple and straightforward. You can tell that pizza is their specialty. Why bother with a large extravagant menu when you can instead concentrating on perfecting one dish? That's not to say there weren't appetizers/sides on the menu, because there were. We just elected to ignore them. The pizza was absolutely PHENOMENAL! We stuck to a simple, large pepperoni pizza. It was one of the best pizza's I have had since moving to Chicago 3 years ago. The large pizza (thin crust) was easily enough for 4 or 5 people. The best highlight of the evening was when the bill arrived. A large pizza, 3 sodas and a salad came up to $30! You'd better believe I'll be returning to Pequod's VERY soon!
