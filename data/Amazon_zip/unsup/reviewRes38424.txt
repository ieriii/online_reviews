Come for the mussels, frites, and a beer an nothing more. If you were to rate Hopleaf for any other reason, it would fall so short that it would likely become a ghost town and go the way of betamax. The service is terrible and pulling i.d. from everyone whether you look 18 or 68 is not flattering for the older folks, it's just plain ridiculous. I have tried in vain to find any food items worth my money; but short of mussels and fries, no go. The cook (not worthy of chef title) has a real knack for making everything taste sweet even when it shouldn't. He or she must really learn food basics and then redesign the menu. So in the end, go with an full stomach, have your i.d. ready to show the 21 year old at the door, be prepared to be ignored while you wait for a table, but enjoy the beer.
