Having heard so many things about duck fat fries, I felt that it'd be inappropriate to skip out on these "life changing" (according to Anthony Bourdain, I believe) fries on my visit to Chicago over the July 4th weekend. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I finally made it into the store and ordered two special dogs (the catalonian and the foie) and of course duck fat fries (they only have these on the weekends). Before I get to the good things, I've got to say that the duck fat fries were *very* disappointing. I'm not sure if it was a long day and we were just unfortunate enough to get stuck with fries from old fryer oil or what... But the fries were disappointing even if they were not fried in duck fat. Lacking flavor and a little bit on the soggy side, I probably wouldn't order these again. The Foie dog with the duck sausage was interesting. Hot Doug's definitely did not skimp on the amount of foie on the dog. I'd suggest eating this last as the foie can overwhelm your palate and have a tendency to stay in your mouth a little longer than you'd think. My favorite, by far, was the catalonian... Pork sausage with a saffron rouille... That combo was heavenly... Not only can you actually see threads of saffron in the rouille, it tasted sooooo good... I can probably eat the rouille by itself... If you don't want to wait in line for a loooong time, you really should come early...
