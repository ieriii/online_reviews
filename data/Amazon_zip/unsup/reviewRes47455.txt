this is becoming a more regular hangout of mine. the food is good (burgers almost as good as kuma's!), there are drink specials, and there is almost never a wait. i have been getting the bootleg burger which has kimchi, bacon, and a fried egg on top of the 10oz burger. and, just like kuma's, they actually give you a real medium rare burger as ordered instead of overcooking it. yum. i also tried the mac n cheese this time. not bad! also, the wait staff is attentive and courteous. i'll be back.
