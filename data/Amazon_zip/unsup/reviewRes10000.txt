I don't drink much, but when I do, I opt for ales at Piece... and the selections are aplenty! Ask for samplers! At dollars a sample, work your way through the menu. My favs so far: hopsided, cap'n kickass, and the dunkelweisen We usually start off with a Piece salad complete with slices of pears, chunks of gorgonzola, candied pecans, and leafy greens. Makes us feel a little better about our veggie intake before we do our carbo-loading. Choose between a red, white, or plain style of pizza with a variety of toppings ranging from the conventional to unique. Once we had clams, another time, a mashed potato 'n bacon white pizza. Yes you heard me, a mashed potato pizza... and it was fudging fantastic!!! I've been here twice on Monday and once on a Thursday night. Good crowds, but enough where people were evenly spaced about. I don't think I'll ever brave the weekend scene, but since my weekdays are my weekends, it works out perfectly.
