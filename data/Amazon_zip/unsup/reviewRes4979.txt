Went here with a bunch of friends while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. Found it via yelp, thanks, yelpers! We were not disappointed. We had a couple of the different corn antipasti dishes not listed in their online menu, but both were good. The prosciutto balls and croquettes were excellent too. I can't say I was a huge bone marrow fan, but I tried it. We asked the waiter (who was from WI, hehe) to recommend a cheese and we got the Podda, which was sweet and tasty. I ordered the pork shoulder which was delicious! We split the Sicilian Iris and the lemon panna cotta for dessert. I recommend the panna cotta, very fresh and tasty. Only complaint is that the bar seating outdoors is jam-packed and uncomfortable. Other than that, would totally go back!
