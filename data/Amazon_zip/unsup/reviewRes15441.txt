I don't even know where to begin with the praise. This place is killer. I had heard much about Violet Hour, and finally got the opportunity to stop in for a few cocktails last Thursday night. Located in a cool neighborhood, with a discreet, but not hidden, entry, and a vibe that says "This place is fucking awesome. If you don't like it, go somewhere else and get a Bud Light". The door was attended by a guy who clearly had managed to keep occupancy at a perfect level, which just added to the ambiance. The decor was simple, but chic. Each table, and section of chairs was private and integrated into the space at the same time. The cocktail list was incredible - thumbs up to arrows of outrageous fortune. The crowd, attractive. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't find something to complain about. I was only able to handle 2 drinks, as it was getting late, and I'd been drinking for a while, prior to showing up. However, the next time I'm in Chicago, I'll be back, and I'll be continuing the quest.
