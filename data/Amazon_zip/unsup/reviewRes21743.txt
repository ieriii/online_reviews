You want to know what reminded me to write a review on this place? I was watching television being a bum and I saw one of those Illinois "click it or ticket" campaign commercials and I noticed they were at Superdawg. I really think this place has got some good marketing/pr person. Alas, it is a Chicago landmark. The dogs are good. For the price? Maybe. I am not a fan of the bright green relish though. I like that nostalgic feeling when I drive up. The servers are great and on point. On the weekend its more like a car show and gathering for car enthusiasts. Its a good place to go visit for the new-to-Chicagoans and first timers. Kudos for also being in the neighborhood.
