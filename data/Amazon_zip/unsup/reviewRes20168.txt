I really want to hate Coast. It's way too dark, the crowd is full of intoxicated, incredibly loud, overdressed 25 year-old women. And the bathrooms inexplicably only hold one person. There are many things wrong with this place... however, the sushi is the best in the city. Everything I've had has been great.  I highly recommend it if food is the #1 priority. You may not like some of the other aspects.
