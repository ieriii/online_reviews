I'm not the most active man, so going to Hot Doug's was like running a marathon. I've always thought about doing it but it's an intense process that truly requires some preparation. For starters there's the location. It's not near any good public transportation. So you'll either have to drive or head out at 9:00am. Secondly there's the dreaded line everyone talks about. "How long can it be?" you think. Believe me, it's long. I had my doubts at first. I questioned could it be worth the wait. After 30 minutes in line, you're in for the long haul. I couldn't wait that long just to leave. As we edged closer an ice cream truck appears almost like a mirage. This definitely made the wait more bearable and gave me a second wind. As you enter, the smell of grilled meats hits your nostrils and the salivation begins. I sampled four dogs that day (two for myself and two for my fiancee). You would think two hot dogs would be a breeze, but you would be wrong my friend. I could barely walk as I was leaving the place. The four I tried were the Kira Knightly (a spicy hot dog that was great), the cognac infused lamb/pork (nice but nothing amazing), the bacon and cheddar elk (very good), and the duck frois gois (I almost pulled a scene from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and shot the cook as it was too good). The duck fat fries taste no different than regular fries, so I suggest getting the tater tots as they're more fun and have more crunch. In the end, the food was so outstanding I completely forgot about the 2.5 hour wait it took to get inside. Maybe it'll be better in the winter...
