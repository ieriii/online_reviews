FYI the bad review at this one is due to the crappy address they gave it: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ Hiya!!!! I have had this stuff since I was a little shit in Hebrew school. I went to the same temple as the owners of this joint. They'd have dawgs with the fixins for all the kids every so often. You got to have the Whoopski-dawg with grilled onions, or the regular dawg with everything (including hot peppers but no ketchup). Speaking of which I love it how they won't put the ketchup on a dawg, they'll give it to you on side and let you ruin it yourself. Oh and I'm not going to review the decor b/c everyone already commented all that is needed
