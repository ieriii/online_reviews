So far, 4 stars. I have only been there once but will definitely go back again. The Caterpillar was probably the best roll of sushi I have ever eaten. We only got 4 servings of Sushi; one was great, one was really good and spicy, one was good (crab) but I probably wont order the Metallica again. It's definitely worth trying and I will definitely go back again. It is BYOB so bring something to drink.
