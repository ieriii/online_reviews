Everyone loves Pequods... literally everyone... but me (the bf will see this post, largely dispute it, and then re-write it). Pequods is decent; I'll give you that. But it has significantly more dough than cheese and toppings, which I do not like. To me, Pequods is like Pizzeria Uno meets Papa Del's... a lot of dough, a different type of dough, but ultra greasy. The carmalized crust is tasty, but the texture makes it difficult to chew. And to speak to the grease factor, we kept leftovers for a few days, and each day you could see more and more grease secrete out of the top and bottom. Too gross to see and then eat. In general, I'd come back to Pequods if friends declare their love for it and plan a dinner there. I would not, however, ever chose to come on my own.
