Pro: Casual Restaurant, Margaritas (watch out $$$), selection, presentation and flavor pairings Cons: Quality - Steak and Chicken did not taste fresh on a couple of my plates, price $$ I guess I was slightly disappointed with my first experience at Frontera and I will surely go back for a second round to balance my review.
