Overall, very pleased with the food. Every dish we got was really nice, except for one. The most expensive dish on the menu was severely lacking seasoning and tasted bland. Other than that, it was great. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is for pretentious staff and for our overnight stay in one of the rooms upstairs. You basically fend for yourself as far as your stay. I think this place would be a 5 star joint if they just boned up on how to treat you like a real guest, in their restaurant, and in their overnight rooms. Passing along info like names, reason for stay, etc. would really heighten the guest experience. Not taking reservations for your overnight guests is just silly. There are only a couple rooms. I'm pretty sure you could make an exception for the people who have already guaranteed you they are spending several hundred dollars at your establishment. Communication between staff members would make this place a repeat destination for us. Still wondering how they got that michelin star....
