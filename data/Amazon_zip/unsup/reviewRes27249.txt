Just chiming in with the awesome for this place. It is as good as everyone else says it is. It is as good as I say it is! I love going here in the middle of the week when it's not crammed full of people, just so you get to enjoy the excellent menu with a little bit of space. I will be going to Pequod's as long as it exists.
