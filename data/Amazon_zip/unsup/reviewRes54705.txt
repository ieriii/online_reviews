Simply put, THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE LIKE IT. Truly one of a kind.If you are visiting the Windy City and willing to pay for the best steak and seafood place in town or any other town for that matter, then you must go there.If you're from Chitown, well chances are you already know what I am talking about.To get the full experience, take the time to have a drink or two (not to mention their oysters) at the bar before getting seated at your table.
