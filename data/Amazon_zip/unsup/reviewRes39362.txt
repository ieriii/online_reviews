I didn't love it. I'm sorry, I just didn't. It didn't live up to the hype. I don't know. It just wasn't. "Party for 2" I said to the cute hostess in the anthropologie dress. "sure no problem. The wait is about an hour." I head to the bar to grab a bloody mary while I wait for a friend. The bar is virtually inaccessible as tables are crammed closely and gobs of other patrons linger, waiting, waiting...waiting. I'm practically on top of someone as I awkwardly chug the beer chaser that came with the bloody. Plus +++ it was a damn good bloody. Things are looking good at this point. Cute dress comes over to tell me that my table is ready. Awesome, I only waited half the time she quoted me. Love when that happens. 2 points! About 5 people stopped by our table before our server came. I don't even know what they were doing. There was a water guy, a coffee guy, a table cleaner, wrong server, different server, huh? I'm confused, too. Alas, we order food. I decide on some croissant eggs mushroom BS that basically had no flavor. Instantly regretted it. My friend had the wild boar sloppy joe. This man loves to eat and though he ate every bite, he didn't rave about it. Who knows. It left something to be desired.
