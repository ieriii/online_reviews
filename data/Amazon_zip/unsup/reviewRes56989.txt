This place is very interesting.We went with a medium size party & kids but the service was still pretty good. Its an experience the way the serve but the food was just alright & fairly pricey for alright food. Beverages are spendy & small so stick with water by at least try the traditional Brazilian beer ~ its funky!I wouldn't go again but I'm glad we went
