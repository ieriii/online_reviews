Yeah, yeah, yeah...so it's a chain restaurant. I don't care, I am a huge GLC fan. They are nothing like their Cheesecake Factory parents as they have a much more tasteful and adventurous menu. The portions are huge so I highly recommend sharing. If you're super hungry go for appetizers and dessert to share as well, that way you can taste more of the menu. The drinks are awesome and huge just like the portions. Be careful because even just one can give you a hefty buzz. My favorite dinner item: Fish and Chips. Yummy tempura battered white fish pieces standing up in a bowl on top of crispy fries. Alongside it is this incredibly tasty Asian coleslaw that is fresh and crisp. My favorite dessert: THE BEIGNETS!!!! They are cream filled fried balls of goodness that melt in your mouth served with a white sauce, hot fudge sauce, and this nice tangy raspberry sauce. I also quite enjoy the warm apple crisp and chocolate lava cake both of which are made to order. Cons: usually a super long wait (ohh, but so worth it) and the floors upstairs are insanely slippery so tread carefully, especially after a few cocktails.
