FOGO 2 GO...I can't believe it took us THIS long to write a raving review about this place. My husband's family is Brazilian and we jumped at trying this place out when we heard about it through a Living Social deal last year. Although I love the thick Chicago pizza, we have been looking for a place in Chicago that has a great thin pizza and this definitely hits the spot. Not only is the pizza great (favorites are the Baltimore...mushroom ones...and sausage ones...basically ANY that we have tried)....but on TOP of that, they have some pretty amazing Brazilian goodies. We are suckers for pao de queijo, those cute round Brazilian spherical cheese breads and this place definitely has the best pao de queijo we've had so far...large, crusty on the outside, warm, toasty, and slightly chewy on the inside...YUM. The coxinha is also a hit :) We have yet to try the chicken, but from all the reviews, it sounds like it will also be a winner!! So good that my husband's parents travel all the way out from the burbs to visit this place!
