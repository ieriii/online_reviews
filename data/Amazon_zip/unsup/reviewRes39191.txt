Located in Chicago's Logan Square, Longman & Eagle is a restaurant/lounge that attracts all sorts of hipsters and other cool cats. Judging from the casual decor and bar-like atmosphere of this place, you wouldn't think that they would have a Michelin star, but they do. And when you taste their food you realize why. Inventive, playful, and just downright delicious, Longman & Eagle feels like a neighborhood bar that somehow kidnapped the executive chef of a nearby gourmet restaurant. Their actual chef is Chef Jared Wentworth, though I have yet to confirm if he's being held there against his will. To describe this place as "popular" would be an understatement. They don't take reservations, but if you put your name down, I can almost promise you that however long you wait will be worth it. An hour, two hours, heck, they could stick you in the closet for a week and it'd still be worth it. To give you an idea of what kind of place this is, when they bring out the check, they also include a postcard featuring their favorite review from Yelp: "OK. First things first! It's dark, gloomy, and noisy? Who wants to eat in that kind of atmosphere. Second. Who eats that kind of food? Bone marrow and wild boar? Yucky! Yeah this place is just not the kind of place for me. It seems just so awkward..." Yes to everything the reviewer said, but to the exact opposite conclusion. I don't know if it's the food or the atmosphere or the sack of gold that the chef slipped me after the meal, but this is honestly one of my new favorite restaurants ever.
