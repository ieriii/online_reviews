I was introduced to Artopolis by my Greek friend and since then, I've returned many times. Long story short: - I crave their traditional soup daily - You will probably want to try everything on the menu - The bakery is fantastic. Get the dark chocolate mousse. - Great food for a great price! My only issues were: - it gets really loud at times  - They seemed to be understaffed, so it took longer than I had hoped to get our food, however it was worth the wait. Go here!!
