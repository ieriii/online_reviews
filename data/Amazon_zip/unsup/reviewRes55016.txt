yea, it's already been said by everyone else, but this place is dope. long lines on weekend night to eat, but they got a lotta good whiskey to choose from to make that time fly by. the food here is amazing, they got tons of good beers to pair with your meals, and the servers/bartenders are great. go here. confirm the hype. repeat.
