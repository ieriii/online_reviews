I love Cuban food, and this was the best I've ever had, hands down. Since this was my first time at the restaurant, I had the waitress walk me through the menu and suggest some options. I ended up getting the pulled pork dinner, my husband had the ropa vieja dinner, and we shared a chorizo & cheese empanada. Whoa. It. Was. Delicious. The pulled pork was slow cooked for hours and had a melt-in-your-mouth flavor. The ropa vieja was also very good, but I liked my dish a bit better. This place is no frills dining. The inside is very small with only counter top space indoors and there's a modest patio for outdoor seating. It looks a little like a shack from the outside, but don't be intimidated! It's some of the best food you'll have! I'll definitely be back again.
