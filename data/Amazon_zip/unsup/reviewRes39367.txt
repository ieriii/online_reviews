After all the hype, I am happy to say that Longman & Eagle truly lives up to it's reputation as being a foodie fave. With the delicate, balanced flavors of each dish, I savored each bite. Huge respect for the chef.  We stopped in shortly after they opened on Saturday morning and was told we had a 10 minute wait. So we strolled around Logan Square and came back just in time for them to give away our table. No problem, we saddled up to the bar as I wanted to peek into the small three man kitchen to see the magic happen. My friend's elbow was barely in the "service area" and the bartender asked him to move. I almost took away a star for this, but our server made up for his foolishness. I understand if the place was crazy busy, maybe the elbow would have been a slight inconvenience, but we were barely there long enough for one person to come into the space.  Perusing the menu, I stopped on the Tete de cochon - something I have never eaten and was immediately curious to try. Literally, head of pig, the dish is served on toasted brioche with just enough arugula and pickled red onions to add a bright pop of acid and spice, and topped with a beautifully cooked, brilliantly yellow sunny side up duck egg. The tete itself was a porcine treat that has me longing for more. Served sliced from a roulade, the texture was sublimely smooth, and I knew we should have ordered two of these. As I wanted to try two different dishes, I had to part with half of my tete, although I knew my friend would enjoy his just as much as I did. On recommendation from the server, we also had the duck hash, with two sunny side up duck eggs, yukon golds, duck confit, and a truffle vinaigrette. The truffle flavor was strong without overpowering the dish, and the confit melded together with the potatoes and gorgeous yolk that I wanted to soak up in each bite. Definitely looking forward to a return visit.
