We were visiting from seattle and heard this restaurant is the bomb, so we had to try it out and it is really amazing. It is the best Vietnamese food we had ever. We always thought Seattle has the best Vietnamese food but when we tried Simply It, we were impressed with everything the restaurant offered. The food is authentic using fresh ingredients with a French influence. They have competent wait staff and a very nice and friendly owner. He treated us as nicely as everyone wants to be treated.
