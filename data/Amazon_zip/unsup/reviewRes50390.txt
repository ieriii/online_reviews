If this place is still open after last night I'd be amazed. Their basement fire escape is either locked or fake. As we were being evacuated (which took more than ten minutes) I witnessed a pissed off firefighter trying to break the door down to no avail. Last night I went to the Fifty/50 to watch UFC 100. Right before the main fight a smell of smoke lingered in the air and we were told to evacuate. Mind you, I was at the bar downstairs, which made my friends and I the furthest from the front door. The evacuation was called off after about two minutes (we hadn't moved anywhere at this point). Then five minutes later firefighters came running in yelling at everyone to get out. We saw that the fire flared back up as we walked by the kitchen, which was completely filled with smoke, and firefighters were tearing the place apart with axes. If this place ever re-opens, I'll never return. If you do, I'd definitely stay near the front door.
