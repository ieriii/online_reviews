In my quest for deep dish pizza, I have tried Gino's once before. That was in 1998 and I came back ten years later to try it again. Now, trying to rate deep dish is like which music is the best, there's no right answer. This is my answer. The crust was good, a corn crust, the sauce ok, the sausage very bland, not as good as I remember it. And the service was lacking, no coming back to see if everything was good and no refills, we actually had to get up and find someone.
