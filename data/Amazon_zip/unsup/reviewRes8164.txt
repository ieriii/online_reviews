This was some of the freshest meat ever! The potatoes were good too. Oh and those little cheese biscuity type things were the bomb! I didn't try the salad bar like everybody advised me. For some reason I felt fat and bloated this day and didn't really pig out like I planned. Me &the bf) didn't like the Caiprinhas. It tasted like the limes were either old or recycled from other guests. But I love this place and can't wait to go back.
