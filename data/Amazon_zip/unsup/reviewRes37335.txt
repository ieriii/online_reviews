I walked into heaven when I walked into here.....OMG, everything you could possibly want is here....bread, cheese, wine, cupcakes, candy, meat.....EVERYTHING. I was like, can I buy everything in this store.....please. I walked in just to check it out and ended up spending way more than I wanted to.  The staff is super attentive, but not stalking you. The cheese area is sweet because they slap off a chunk for you to try before buying...you just have to ask. It is expensive, but no more than any other high end grocer.
