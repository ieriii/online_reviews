I'm not a big fan of super spicy or street food when it comes to indian food. I like food to be be spiced so you can still taste it. :) I think India House is pretty good, and definitely the place to bring any "new" initiates to Indian food. I usually bring friends that have had bad experiences in the past with trying Indian food here, and it has been known to change minds. Also people that haven't tried any Indian food out..the buffet is a great way to taste a few different popular dishes and get an idea if you'd be into that style of food. I have been here for dinner once, but definitely prefer the buffet. The weekdays are slower than the weekends, but I've never had much trouble or waited more than 5 or 10 minutes for a seat during sunday. Buffets are usually 11am-2pm or 3pm or so, and are served on weekdays and Sunday (maybe saturday too....dunno). My favorites are the basic grilled veggies, the chicken tikka, butter chicken, and mattar paneer. I also like their mango lassis (yogurt smoothie made with mango pulp).
