I love La Villa been ordering and going here for years. The food is soooo good, from the chicken, pizza, to the surf and turf.I would highly recommend going here for a date. The delivery is fast and the food is always hot. So much, you'll burn your tongue. Yes, it comes that hot. But everything is insulated very well so heat isn't lost. There isn't anything bad about this place. Just go taste it, very good italian!!!!
