wants to be so much more than it is. perfect example of lipstick on a pig. no matter how much you try to dress it up, underneath it is one very unappealing restaurant. for a wine themed restaurant the selection is very mass market. somehow a very pedestrian restaurant found its way out of the strip mall and into downtown chicago. if you have any taste, don't bother.
