What a great place - if only it weren't so dang crowded! My boyfriend and I showed up at 5:30 on Saturday and had a 20 minute wait for a table....at least there was a little room to shoehorn ourselves in near the bar. I am not an enjoyer of beer, so the Framboise on tap was perfect - like a fresh raspberry soda with a pleasant wheaty finish. When we finally got a table, it took a LONG time for our waiter to reappear to take our order, but the food came quickly. Note: mussels for 2 is enough for a full meal! We'll definitely be back - but maybe on a weekday...early on a weekday...
