I found myself here for a friend's birthday and was immediately wowed by the decor. While nothing outlandish, it was very well-done and provided a very urbane background for the dinner with a lot of energy. Since we were in a large group, we tried various tapas as well as sharing a half pig amongst our group. The pig was excellent as it was juicy and well cooked and the crispy skin was a hit. The tapas, while excellent were not very large or even very sharable though multiple plates were ordered amongst our group. That is my only complaint about the restaurant as the staff was very accomodating and on top of things with a group of 14 and noisy background. When I find myself back in Chicago, I will make it point to have another meal here.
