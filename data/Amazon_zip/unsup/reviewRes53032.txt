What a treasure in our little neck of West Bucktown! I was so happy when this opened just down the street from me (not that I didn't love me some Calvin's BBQ, but really I'm not sure that place was even up to code). We sat on the patio for lunch on Friday and felt like we were on vacation! We had the bistec and the ropa vieja sandwiches, both were great as well as the croquettas and the beef empanada. The staff was friendly and even bellowed, "see you tomorrow!" as we left... honestly, I would have considered his invitation if we hadn't been going out of town!
