I liked Carnivale and if I had a better entree I would have givin it a much better ranking. Great apps, good drinks, cool atmosphere. The Chicken empanadas were great and the service was good. I was really disappointed in my shortrib entree so I really don't recommend that- it was super fatty and just not good. I know that shortribs have fat but this one was gross.I couldnt really even eat it. Yuck. It is a fun place to go with a group of people so I would possibly check it again but am a little weary about having a full sit down meal here again. Bummer!
