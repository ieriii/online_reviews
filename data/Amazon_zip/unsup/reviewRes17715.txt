I recently had lunch with coworkers at Carnivale and I was really impressed. The service was fantastic; the hostess was welcoming and our server was polite, charming, and not constantly hovering over us. The atmosphere really grabs you when you walk in, and the restaurant is aptly named because the entire vibe is Carnivale. We all had a hard time choosing what to order because the menu was incredibly well written - which sounds strange, but the phrasing literally made us want to order every item they make. We started with guac, which I hate, and yet it was so good I was compelled to eat it. Verylight, tasty ,and fresh. The entrees were good but I wouldn't call them amazing. Nothing really stuck out as being very special. The highlight of the entire meal was desert - scoops of chocolate, cinnamon, and cactus pear ice cream served in a martini glass. I will definitely coming back for the desert alone!! I would love to try drinks and desert with girlfriends in the the front bar area.
