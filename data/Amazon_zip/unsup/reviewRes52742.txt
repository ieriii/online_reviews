I kind of feel bad not giving 90 Miles Cuban Caf the five stars, but I thought the food, albeit delicious, lacked a bit of sauciness. I thought the tostones were a bit mushy, more moist than crunchy, and I prefer the latter quality. The guava/cheese empanada was delicious, and the grilled pargo filet that my co-patron had me wanting to have more space in my stomach. With generous portions, attentive service and one of the coolest restaurant ambiances I have encountered in a while, 90 Miles will have me coming back, as I want to believe that this is a five-star place.
