I love the Diner!! It's my favorite! The soymilk shakes here alone are worth the trip. The ambiance is casual. The service is nothing to write home about. But hell, it's a diner! How often can you say that vegan food actually sticks to your ribs?? It really does here! The flavors are always just right and I actually crave the food between visits. Their raw nachos are to DIE for....which is probably why they're often sold out if you get there late. The food at the Diner pretty much ruins any chance other veggie places have to kick ass. I love the Chicago Diner.
