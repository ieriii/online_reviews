Our party of eight really were really surprised by our experience at Gino's East. After four members spent 20 minutes (in the heat) waiting in line to make sure that we didn't have to wait long for the rest of our group to be seated. We finally made it to our third floor table. This famed restaurant truly underwhelmed us and we all left with the impression that we were not a priority, after being handed cold pizza which was left to sit after our waiter forgot about us. With our appetizers eaten and after our table was littered was plates, it took up to 45 minutes afterwards to finally get our pizza. . While I really appreciate the atmosphere and the graffiti on the walls, nothing can overcome bad service.
