I've only been to Piece twice, but both times were good times. I love how you could select how you want the pizza done and if you want sauce or not. I think the sizing goes well with the prices. Both times i went with a group of friends, we got large pizzas that came out big and we didn't spend too much. It's a nice setting inside as well. There's tv's all over and it's a good place to watch some games at also. I don't really think the music they plays suits the crowd it brings in and the ambiance of the place, but it wasn't that bad. It's just something i noticed from the couple times i went. But i definitely love the pizzas there. The appetizers are good as well!
