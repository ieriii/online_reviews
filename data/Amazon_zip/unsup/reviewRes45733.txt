What is it with this place? Everything on the menu is greasy. I ordered a bison burger and the plate arrived with a layer of grease on the bottom of the plate. The "special sauce" that was indiscriminately spread on the bun had no taste whatsoever.  Luxe Bar this isn't. The place has the look and feel of what someone from Schaumburg thinks a Chicago neighborhood restaurant should be. Actually, this place would be perfectly located in Woodfield Mall, but it's sadly out of place in Lakeview.
