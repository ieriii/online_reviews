A family friend kept recommending this place to us everytime we'd mention that we were going to Chicago, so we finally decided to give in. It was a bit of a walk from our hotel, and it's off the beaten path, but MAN is that place crowded and popular. Good thing I made a reservation. The restaurant is pretty gorgeous- all woody and warm with a cozy home feeling to it. Their menu is somewhat extensive, but it didn't take me long to decide what I wanted: short ribs. MMmmmmmMMmm I love me some tender short ribs. Here's the rundown on everything we ordered: shrimp and crab bisque- soooo good!! Super creamy, not too fishy or seafoody, with a burst of great flavor. braised short ribs- sooo tender and delicious, the sauce was awesome, and i ordered it with a side of the au gratin potatoes which were good, but could have used more cheese in my opinion surf & turf- filet mignon and a crab-crusted lobster tail. The definition of a man's meal. He was worried his lobster tail was going to be super small, but it was pretty sizable and it was sweet. I also had the watermelon martini, which was gooooood. Kept me buzzed through dinner. We were too full for dessert. The food was great, but service lacked a little. It took a long time for our waters to be refilled, and get our food boxed with the check. One of the stalls in the bathroom was overflowing too, and when I went to let the people at the front desk know, the guy was pretty snappy and rude to me.
