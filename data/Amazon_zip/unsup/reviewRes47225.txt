I wasn't planning on writing a review here today, but then I started reading some of the other recent reviews of this place. Most of them are, obviously, spot on, but some of them make me wonder about the general unpleasantness of humanity. I've been here twice with a group of friends for burgers and beer. The burgers and beer were fantastic. The service was quick, polite, and efficient. Unibroue on special? Yes, please. The Federales and Possession of Shrooms were delicious and my burger was cooked perfectly (as I ordered it medium rare). I'm not a metal fan nor was I particularly enthralled with the decor of the place, but I appreciate that they're trying to do something they enjoy, even if Kuma's "did it first" (it's not an exact replica in there, weirdos). I've written about hype before. Kumas has a lot of it. Lockdown has considerably less. In any case, it's hard to always live up to hype. Last time I was at Kumas, my fries were too salty. A stupid complaint? Sure. But when you have to routinely wait a million hours to get in, it's hard not feel whiney after. Lockdown has the same caliber burgers with less of that whiney feeling. Unless of course, you just happen to be an insufferable suck-pod.
