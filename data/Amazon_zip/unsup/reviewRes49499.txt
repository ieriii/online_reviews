Bin 36 is the place to try out some phenomenal wines - they'll serve you entire flights of similar wines so you can taste and select the absolutely perfect wine for whichever occasion you look forward to. I'd been in a celebratory mood, so I went with the Bubbly flight, only to find that the Heidsieck champagne was one-upped by a vouvray. A bubbly vouvray you say? I do. The carbonation actually allowed the natural sweetness of the grape to be somewhat hidden, letting the other subtle flavors play a more central role. It was a wonderful wine. The fries were fantastic, and the cheeses were revelatory - parmesan cheese flakes and sheep's milk blue cheese were perfect for bubbly white wines. The rest of the food was just eh. A perfect little place to try out many wines, and they'll sell you bottles afterward. I bought a bottle of the vouvray, but thanks to the flight rules of Homeland Security, I left it with a friend.
