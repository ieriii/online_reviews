Went to brunch with a few other yelpers and really enjoyed the food and company. Simply b/c the food was so different from other places, it's nice to mix things up. The mojitos are really good, only I would suggest *not* getting one if you're on a date. B/c the mint is muddled freshly it's almost like eating spinach. So, unless you have no shame and don't care about mint in your teeth I'd suggest against it. The food has a bit of a kick to it and is really filling. I also saw the bartender make a bloody mary and they looked really good too. I think I'll have to try this place for dinner before I have a complete review of it all.
