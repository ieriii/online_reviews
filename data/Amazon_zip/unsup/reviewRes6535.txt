OMG, LOVE their wine list...LOVE!  I must say this is a GREAT date place..perfect ambiance...great crowd...and you get to share plates..and the wine list is amazing! Service is good, the servers are pretty helpful. They have a variety of appetizers. The foccacia bread is the best i've ever had..and the corn salad was so flavorful! We ordered the Ravioli dish (with spinach and egg) AMAZING! I wish it was bigger or came with 2! We split the chocolate hazelnut dessert..OH MY GOD...seriously borderline orgasmic (ok im exaggerating...but it was THAT good), I wanted to lick the plate, but realized that wouldn't be appropriate with my company haha! The portions are a bit small, and they are meant to be shared (Which is why I dont know why they are small) but I guess thats why you order more! Great place I want to go back to try the polenta.....and more wine what an amazing list. Seriously, take note, great date place!
