After hearing great things about Piccolo Sogno, I came her for lunch right before the Snowpocalypse. The special appetizer platter of roasted veggies, meats, and cheese was a perfect start. I had the special pasta of the day that had way too many olives for my taste. It was super salty and I really don't like olives, so I wouldn't have ordered it had I known it had olives in it. The chocolate hazelnut cake and custard/pastry dessert (it would help if I remembered the names!) was AMAZING! I'll be back again in the summer to check out the patio.
