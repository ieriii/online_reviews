Knew we were off to a good start when they brought this yummy, free flat bread brushetta type thing to start of the evening. Things got better from there. The menu is a bit confusing to look at, so we went with the tasting menu. For like $80 a person they bring you amazingly delicious tapas (more than I could count, I'm thinking it was around 14 different things) and 5ish wine parings. Everything was delish. The only bummer is that the tasting menu doesn't come with dessert or a sparkling wine and it is kind of loud in there. We went on a Monday night and it was almost packed full. The decor is nice and swanky though, and the service is excellent.
