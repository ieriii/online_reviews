So I went there a few months ago and my friends were all, "You've been here before." They INSISTED that I'd been there but I didn't remember it at all. It is very grand, hence the name. Things are big, furniture is big, and the serving sizes are huge. All in all, eh. I could take it or leave it. The food is pretty good but people are REALLY into it. It's basically Cheesecake Factory without the cheesecake.
