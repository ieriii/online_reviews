Mia, Mia, Mia....you were the next sister on the list of Francesca's I had to meet. You and your sister forno must be like the Jan and Marcia Brady of restaurants eh? Trying to one up each other all the time... neck in neck to be the best?? Well MIA, your bianco fish was fabulous. Absolutely, hands down, the best fish I have ever eaten. Super flaky, full of flavor and very moist...the white wine sauce and all the vegetables that complemented the fish were fantastic. I cannot say enough about this dish! I normally order gnocchi or something...but I took a chance and I am SO happy I did. It was AWESOME. Also Mia, huge props to you for having a gluten-free menu- that is the reason we dined here that night. My sister absolutely loved the linguine dish she had; she's never had linguine style pasta! My mom and I both tried it and it was awesome...definitely the best gluten free pasta we've ever had. SO SO SO GOOD. It's few and far between you find an Italian place, or ANY place for that matter that serves gluten free. I'm happy and appreciative the Francesca's family is keepin up with the Jones'. Our waiter was super cool on the gluten free thing and was a very enthusiastic waiter...props to that. Our drinks did run empty on more than one occasion...but that could have been because of the very needy table of women behind us. Does every dish HAVE to be altered?? Seriously ladies, COME ON. My Mom had the gnocchi with meat sauce...I'm not a fan of meat sauce, but I did try a gnocchi or two and they were very good. They weren't too mushy or too dry...they were...perfect. Yes. I said it. The place is PICCOLO, molto, molto piccolo, (very small). If you don't have a reservation on a weekend or any night for that matter...you must not care waiting. The bar area is more of a nuisance than anything. People cram up there 2-3 deep while a table of diners is inches behind you. It's loud and crazy but the food is fabulous and definitely worth it.
