Came here for date night and had an absolutely fabulous time! The place is sexy as can be, love the lights, fixtures and design of the place, especially the super trendy mirrored colored bar! The food was amazing, everything we had was absolutely delicious starting off with the complimentary tomato bread, very tasty. We had the bacon wrapped dates which were phenomenal, and my favorite item of the night, you must get them here! They are small and pricey but sooo incredible with this fondue cheese sauce all over them, wow! We had to splurge on the jamon iberico de bellota which was a tad pricey at $25.00 but definitely enough for the two of us and totally reminded us of the streets of Barcelona. Definitely tender and recommended. Other yummy tapas we had were the potatas bravas, which are the spicy potatoes with a spicy ailioli sauce. Then we had the butternut squash and lamb ragu stuffed ravioli's, which were very tasty as well. We weren't sure which sangria to get so we got the Sangria flight which had a red, a white and my fave the rose pink :) Definitely a fun dining experience here and worth the hype. My only complaint overall is that the portions are ridiculously small, so you can easily spend over $100 for 2 people, and that's without alcohol but I would say that the quality is good, and in life, you get what you pay for :) My tip to Mercat, make BIGGER bacon wrapped dates.
