In my personal opinion, Peter Luger's is #1 by a long shot. Ruth Chris is the #1 chain steak house. Not as good as Peter Lugers but still fantastically delicious. I always get the porterhouse for 2. You can never go wrong. Medium rare with sides of creamed spinach and asparagus. If you do go with a large group of people, not every pairing needs to get the creamed spinach because the sides are enormous and you can share them with a lot of people. I made that mistake once. Came here with 6 people and we got 3 porterhouses for 2. We didn't talk to each other about our sides and we all ended up getting the creamed spinach. Let's just say, there was a lot of creamed spinach left over. The steak here was fantastic. Juicy, tender, unbelievably good. Each bite just melted in your mouth. Got a tomato mozzarella salad as a starter which was very good and ended the night with some creme brulee. Oh. and I usually end up drinking 2 bottles of wine each time I come. Now that's what you call a Saturday night dinner!!
