Ended up here for a small birthday gathering, and I'm a fan! I really liked the interior/vibe of the place. It was super busy on a Thursday night, but we didn't end up waiting more than twenty minutes total. The food was good. I ate the sweet potato cakes and some fish and chips. It was all very tasty, but way too much fried food for me! I highly recommend splitting the fish and chips, as the portions are quite generous. The salads looked awfully good, also. My dinner companions were also quite happy with the mashed potatoes. I would have loved to try the bacon popcorn, but at the wise urging of my group, decided against it in fear of the tummy havoc that may come later! The beer was also exceptional. I drank the Golden Cross while others in our party tried different brews. Everyone seemed very happy with their selections. I would enjoy going back and definitely trying those salads!
