Was just on here to write another review and realize I haven't given Art their props for being the best deep dish Chicago-style pizza in the city. Amazingly good...don't miss it!  Go for the Art's meaty delight...utterly decadent. And, stick to what they specialize in...the "stuffed" pizza, as they called their deep dish. Appetizers are meh, but they can be when the pie is this good.  Take a bet on this place...you WILL NOT regret it. We've eaten this pizza at least 20-30 times and never been disappointed. How many places can you say that about?!
