The name of this restaurant is davanti enoteca which translates to "in front of the wine bar" in Italian but their name should be "best Italian restaurant in Little Italy". The food is amazing but you'll need to know a few things before you go. They have a $7 corkage fee which in Chicago terms means "BYOB" BUT they aren't BYOB (I was really confused) until I learned what they do is sell you their wine at retail prices and then add $7 corkage, at first I thought "rip off" but after seeing the wine list and looking at the prices I completely retract that thought. As far as the food is concerned, it is top notch on all levels. However, don't expect your normal over-sized Italian pasta dish. These are very small portions and you'll need to pick 2-4 dishes to complete your meal. The giant ravioli and giant rigatoni with sausage are amazing but the nutmeg soup and hazelnut gelato are a must have as well. All in all, this place is my new favorite Italian restaurant and a must try for anyone looking for interesting chef creations and a perfectly crazy atmosphere.
