He says: Hot Doug's is a visionary of sausage wonders. On a long weekend to Chicago, we went there twice. Both times were delicious and we ordered a sizeable chunk of the menu, all told. That sizable chunk of menu was later found in our lovehandles. As a general rule, the "standard" dogs were better than the flashy dogs. Mind-Bendingly Good (in order of preference): * Thuringer - Best dog ever. A perfectly charred dog with a perfect mix of garlic? * Chicago - Awesome. The pickle, the snap of the dog, I want one right now. * Chicken & Gruyere - Melts in your mouth into a puddle of cheesy deliciousness Also Awesome: * Elk - Great flavor, but a bit drier than the perfectly oozing dogs above. * Andouille - If my local market did this as well, I'd have sausage weekly. Tasty, but not for me: * Duck & Fois Gras - It's rich, it's tasty, but while I like it... I'd much rather have 4 of the Chicago dogs. And, due to the price differential, I can have that for the same price. Protip: They can prepare any dog as: charred, fried and grilled, deep fried, or steamed. The charred versions seemed tastier (even compared to a fried and grilled dog). They do a great job with that preparation, so I'd go with it. Fried and grilled is a close second. Also, Doug was awesomely friendly despite the fact that we had very little idea what we were doing. He seemed genuinely surprised that our group came all the way from PA and Kentucky to eat his dogs. She says: I always thought the expression "foodgasm" was weird and slightly scandalous -- but, the first time I bit into a hot dog here (Chicago), I had one. It was incredible. The dog was juicy, delectable, and charred just right, perfectly dressed. To this day, Hot Doug's is the only place to have ever given me a foodgasm.  Doug knows his meats. Be sure to enjoy the basics as well as try some unusual (to me) game meats. I second my guy's preferences above.
