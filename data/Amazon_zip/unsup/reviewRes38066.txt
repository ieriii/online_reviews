The Hopeleaf is one of the places that makes living in the city great. Michael, one of the owners, is also a cyclists. His story is very similar to that of New Belgium Brewing out in Colorado. Michael was riding his bike in Belgium, which has a great beer culture, and he decided to bring that culture to Chicago. This is one of those places that transports you to a different part of the world in a way. That part being Belgium. They bring the beers and cuisine of Belgium to Chicago and also fortify their offerings with an awesome craft and worldwide beer selection always served in the proper intended glassware. Tru, the place can get crowded at peak times, but what good place isn't. Note that they do check IDs and if you want to sit down for a meal, make your way to the host stand in the back. Go here spend and be happy.
