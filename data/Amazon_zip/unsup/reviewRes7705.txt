Boyfriend took me here one night after we found out that the restaurant I was going to take him to was closed... we were pretty hungry going in and left all satisfied some 2 hrs later. Everything tasted great! Although I sometimes had trouble distinguishing between different kinds of steaks. But they are all great! Salad bar and the side dishes were also good. One of the side dishes was something like corn bread and I loved it :) Service is great! People were nice in explaining how things work here for us. Would want to visit again if I get the chance. Their bathroom is really fancy... ok maybe just the paper towel.. they almost felt like napkins if I remembered correctly. hopefully they recycle!
