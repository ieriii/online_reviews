I really don't have anything bad to say about this place other than, maybe they're too popular? I don't know, seems silly to get all ninny about someplace being successful. Yeah, I have to wait longer for a table, but for me, the food is still worth it. The CB&J (Cashew butter and fig jam with melted cheese on toasted bread) is still reason enough to come here, and I haven't even mentioned the beer yet. The first time I came to the Hopleaf was a couple years ago for the Drinking and Writing Brewery's Festival. Fucking marvelous. We got to taste test a large amount of the beer the Hopleaf serves, and let me just say, it was hard to find one I didn't like. I did find that when I left I left with an addiction to Delirium Tremens, Satan (the beer), and Three Floyd's. The servers here seem friendly, and well the bartenders can be standoff-ish, I find that if you do seriously ask them about the beers their willing to talk and are knowledgeable enough. There really isn't any reason to give this place less than 5 stars. I'd give 'em 6 if I could.
