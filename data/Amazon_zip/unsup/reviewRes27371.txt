I didn't have the deep dish. I had the thin crust. I did not like the taste of the sauce or the cheese mix on this pizza tho, So I do not think that I would have like the deep dish if it used the same. I actually didn't like it enough to finish eating, I just ate candy at the movies. I did however like the fried zucchini!
