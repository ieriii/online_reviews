This is an exceptional burger. Perhaps they copied quite a bit from Kuma's, but it works. We did the 1/2 price Tuesday night burgers and really enjoyed it. That said, 4 stars not 5 for the following reasons: the combined burger choices on the menu left something to be desired, imo, I thought it was pretty pricey and the mac and cheese side was not very good at all and was served cold. That being said, it is a very good burger. I made my own and was very happy with it. (Brie, sauteed mushrooms and a fried egg.) I found something slightly off about almost all of the burger menu combos; a sauce that didn't work, a combo I don't understand, etc. I only tried one - the goat cheese and mushroom and thought mine was much better. (Goat cheese doesn't melt well and it made the consistency of the topping a bit off.) I'm glad we went on 1/2 price night, because the burgers are pricey from like 11 or 12 to 17. They are big and come with good fries, but the mac and cheese substitution is 2 bucks (and not worth it) and my "1/2" price burger was not exactly half price. Probably my fault for not clarifying this and in the end, the difference was only a $1 (as it would be to the restaurant too) but one of those things that is just annoying. The "half price" burgers on Tuesday are for burgers up to $13 and then one or two other menu burgers are also included (that may be 14 or something). Building your own is an $11 plain burger, with one topping - so essentially 11 for a cheeseburger and then each topping is an additional $1. I added two topping to bring the total to $13 assuming that meant 1/2 price b/c the deal was for burgers $13 and under. It was half of the 11 and the added toppings didn't count. Again, not a big deal and discrepancy was $1, but why they wouldn't include that as part of their special is a little annoying.
