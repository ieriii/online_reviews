Stuffed French Toast! So good. I actually never had French toast growing up, so I've just recently been introduced. But wow Nana's really blew me away. I was here for Sunday brunch, and unlike other brunch spots, I only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. The service was a little slow, but that's because it was sunday brunch and it is very busy here. As much as I loved my french toast, and I know it's organic and local, I felt like it was over-priced. It doesn't take much for me to be full after a meal, so it was weird that I actually walked out still kinda hungry after my brunch. Maybe I should've ordered more food, but I wasn't expecting such small portions I guess. Loved the atmosphere too. Definitely going back for more.
