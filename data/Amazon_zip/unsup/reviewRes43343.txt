There's not a lot I can add to the reviews of the food at Milk & Honey Cafe: it's great, from the dried cherry and walnut oatmeal and amazing huevos rancheros to the incredible lunchtime sandwiches and salads. Anyone who wants to judge the decor can easily do so themselves by checking out pictures online. So I won't rehash that. One word of advice: If you want to go for a weekend brunch, go before 11. I live across the street and every weekend I watch the lines that back up around noon. I'm not a patient person, so I make sure I get in around 9:30 so I get a table right away. And one complaint: The hours. Why, oh why, do they close so early? It would make me so happy if I could drop in after work and pick up an easy sandwich for dinner. Bah.
