Indie is a great neighborhood spot. At night, this little restaurant can get pretty packed. They serve Thai and Japanese cuisine and do so wonderfully. I usually stop by for lunch to enjoy their specials. You choose from either soup or salad, appetizer, and an entree for 7 bucks (ends at 3:00). They have a lot of great choices on their menu. I tried the curries, sushi, pad thai, soft shell crab salad, grilled shrimp salad, etc. and they're all pretty good. I only had one dish that I absolutely hated. It was a scallop dish with a spicy sauce that completely overwhelmed the scallops (although the presentation for this dish was gorgeous). The service is good and the price is right. What more can you ask for...
