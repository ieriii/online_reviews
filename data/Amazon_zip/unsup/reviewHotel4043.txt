I'm torn between the 4 star review and the 3. It's actually a 3.5 star. Pros: - Super close to touristy attractions either directions: Magnificent mile, Cloud gate, Navy Pier, etc. - Close to public transport ie 5 blocks or so to Red line - Attractive lobby - Friendly and helpful staff - Secure rooms that require a key to enter elevators after 11PM or so. Cons: - A somewhat dreary room with the color scheme, which looks contemporary in the pictures, but not so in person. - The glass window in our room was dirty with streak marks and such as if they haven't cleaned it in a while... I suppose this was an excellent deal for the location and all, but I expected a little bit more from a 4 star hotel. Maybe it was listed as 3.5stars. Either way, our request of a king bed was confirmed when we checked in, but when we got to the room, it was a double. No biggie I guess. It was nice though that they allowed us to extend our check out time to 1PM instead of 12PM when I called the morning of check-out.
