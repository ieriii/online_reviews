Came here on a Thursday night and it wasn't too crowded. We were seated practically right away but we were shown to our seats before it was ready (twice that happened). The busboys were still in the process of cleaning the tables.  Service was great and prompt. Portions are large. My friend and I shared an appetizer and an entree and we were both super stuffed. Both dishes were excellent. I will probably go back for both. For the appetizer, we ordered the Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls topped with cheese and bacon and for the entree we ordered the jambalaya chicken and shrimp. mmmmm, the shrimp was succulent, chicken was tender and the sauce was just right. Nice spicy kick but not enough to burn your tongue. The spring rolls were also amazing. For 8 bucks, you get 8 larger pieces. The cheese is melted on top with bits of bacon pieces and slices of green onion--perfect combination.
