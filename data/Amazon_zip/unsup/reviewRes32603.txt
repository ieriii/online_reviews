I went to Demera with friends yesterday. We used a groupon - 3 course meal with TWO bottles of wine. Not only was I impressed by the awesome deal, but the food was excellent. I will definitely be going back even without a voucher! The food was tasty and the honey wine was sweet and delicious. It kind of reminded me of Chinese rice wine....I loved this place! And the appetizers were great! They were kind of like samosas...I can't remember what they are called!
