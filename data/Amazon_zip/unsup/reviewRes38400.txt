Any friggin' second I get to snatch up a Tripel K. on tap at this place, I'm there. They have a very good selection of beer, scotch and food. Here's my usual repertoire: -2 to 3 goblets of tripel karmeliet ($7 each) -CB&J with morbier mac and a side of house cooked potato chips ($10) -Pomme frites w/ garlic aioli ($5) If you can help it and like to stay away from busy, crowded bars, DON'T GO FRIDAY thru SUNDAY. It is PACKED. If you can go before 5pm on those days, you might be okay but I like to close the place down with minimal screaming with whomever I'm there with...I'd go with Wednesday nights as a preferred visit to this place. Nice bathrooms and plenty of secret seating but I like the front (by the entrance) although it's hard to find something after 6 or 7pm every night in that area. It's nice sitting up there because I'm a fan of getting my own drinks and getting up from time to time.
