They have a great happy hour deal 3-6pm in the bar area- $2.95 for many items as long as your table has more than 2 drinks. The $2.95 menu includes calamari, Caesar salad, burger with fries, french onion soup, and peanut skewers (very tasty!)  We have had the salmon and steak as well and they are very good- pricey, but good. Great place to go when being treated to dinner when parents come up to the city!  The restaurant has a very cozy feel to it, and they just added a new outside seating area on Kinzie with 10 tables and little lanterns- very romantic!  The outdoor area used to be on wells street but I think the owners realized it was too congested with the el stop right there so it was moved to the south side of the restaurant (kinzie st) and it is much better.
