First time there last night. And a big thumbs up! Wonderful service with great energy and knowledge about food and wine. Tried new parts of the pig (ears and, yes, even tail) but it was the pork shoulder braised in milk that really won us over! Nice cheese selection with some interesting local choices. Crowded but not overwhelmingly so and noise level was a trifle bit loud... If you're visiting Chicago this is a nice new addition to Michigan Ave...
