Oh my gosh, do I ever love this place! It's as if it was frozen in time from the 50s and the menu reflects that. Sabatino's doesn't concern itself with culinary trends or modern interpretations of classic dishes. Or even faux "old style" Italian. They are old-school authentic all the way, even with walking musicians throughout the restaurant. Mangia!
