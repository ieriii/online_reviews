attempt #1: closed. - - doug broke his leg. attempt #2: closed. - - closed for the holidays. ...even though it was well past christmas day. attempt #3: OPEN. halle-f*ckin-lujah.  normally, i would deduct stars for being closed 2 out of the 3 times that i tried to come here, and the line out the door, but the food MORE than makes up for it.  my meal: hickory-smoked cajun pork sausage with chipotle-horseradish dijonnaise and vieux brugge cheese and a side of duck fat fries.  a heart attack for $9.50. but damn, i'd do it again. just the right size dog, and an abundance of fries. ...so much that my friend and i shared one order. i love the fact that doug rung me up... i wasn't sure if the fries would be enough for the both of us, so he told me to skip the line and let him know if we needed to put in another order if we needed to. (the tear in my eye after perusing all of the dogs on the menu must've tipped him off that i was a first-timer.) he was really nice even though it was super busy on a friday afternoon. i'll most definitely come back here when i visit chicago again!
