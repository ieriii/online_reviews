The ladies of my family took a trip in to the city on a weekday and were so very excited to eat our lunch at Frontera. We had reservations and were promptly seated. However, the good service ended there. It took a good ten minutes before we even saw a server. The restaurant was noisy, kids were screaming, strollers were parked everywhere. Here's the breakdown of my meal. To say it was mediocre would be a gross understatement. Drink - Top Shelf Margarita - very sweet and weak, I think Chile's makes a better drink. Appetizer - Sampler Platter - As most people mentioned, the ceviche was very good. I wish I had just the ceviche for my meal. The "mini quesadillas" were balls of mozzarella deep fried. The taquitos were a nonevent, beef in a deep fried shell. And then we got about 2 tablespoons of guacamole. Dinner - Flank Steak Tacos - This was probably the worst thing I've eaten in a restaurant. It appeared that the meat was cut against the grain, making the meat so chewy it was inedible. I tried to politely nibble, but should have made a stand and sent it back. I left the restaurant still hungry. The other entrees at our table were the tamale and chicken enchiladas. The tamale was pure mush and the enchiladas were dry and uneventful. The mole was pretty good though. So, in all it was just a really disappointing meal. We went in with such anticipation and left with nothing endearing about our meal. We really wanted to like it. As a side note, the day before I went to a Mexican restaurant in a small Wisconsin town, run by an adorable immigrant family, and was blown away by the delicious margaritas, guac, and enchiladas. I would give them 5 stars. I say, save your money and go to a quiet authentic restaurant were the service is good and the food is worth it. Sorry.
