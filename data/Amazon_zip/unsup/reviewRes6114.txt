Love love LOVE this place! I had the wonderful opportunity to eat dinner here for the first time last night with a few friends. We had 4 in our group at around 8pm on a Tuesday and were quoted 30-45 minutes. The wait wasn't too bad as we could just chill by the bar and drink a bottle of wine together. I really like how the dishes come on small plates so you can try a bit of everything. Here's what we got: Pecorino Tartufato (aged sweet+ truffle flavor) - DELICIOUS, I am completely in love with this cheese. Capicolla Piccante (cured spicy pork shoulder) - addicting as well...and I'm usually not a fan of spicy foods but this was pretty mild We chose two from the Vasi section: chicken liver pate & ricotta + honey comb. Both great choices and I couldn't stop eating the pate even after all our bread was gone! Pizza della Fattoria (farmed egg + pork belly + potato + scallions + asiago + bechamel) - different from any pizza I've ever had but it was pretty good Riccio di Mare e Granchio (linguine + sea urchin + crab) - I love sea urchin, I love crab....I completely devoured this dish Our server was very attentive and was always asking if we needed anything. They took away our empty plates promptly but there were times where I had to grab the mini mason jar of pate before they tried to take it away =P I will definitely be going back again. It's nice that they have different specials for beer/martinis/no corkage fee on different days.
