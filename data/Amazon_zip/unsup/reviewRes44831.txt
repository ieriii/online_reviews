As my first trip out to Chicago, I knew I definitely had to hit up a deep dish pizza spot. Giordano's is very close to the Fairmont Hotel so we took a short stroll on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. The wait for a party of four took about ten minutes; not bad. The restaurant is classic and spacious. One look at a medium deep dish pizza and the boyfriend and I knew we were going to order a small. We had sausage and jalapenos, a very scrumptious combo. After two slices each on a small, we still had two slice leftover. It takes about 30-40 minutes for the pizza to bake so prepare on waiting. But so worth it. Every bite was yummy till I couldn't take another.
