Bellied up at the bar on a Friday evening. Great beer list. Had the New Holland Dandelion, Founders Centennial IPA, and a too sweet Pumpkin Imperial. Went with a perfectly cooked med rare LaFried burger. Not sure on the name but it had tomatoes, arugula, and blue cheese. Good service and met some friendly patrons at the bar. Are they trying to ride on Kuma's coat tails? A bit. The burger was really good but need a bit more variety in toppings if that's what they are going for. Music was meh at best. But then again, I think Kuma's is the most overrated place in the city as well. Update: came back 5 days later with sister and my 2 yo. They have a cute little kids menu. And some rockin cheese curds.
