It was a mixed bag, really. First, this review is for brunch, not dinner. Might try again for dinner to broaden the PIG offerings. First, service was unusual. At the beginning, they were all over us, later... we had plates piled on top of each other wondering if someone was coming by. I ended up tipping a mere 15% as it didn't deserve better... maybe not even deserving of the 15%, but it's the Holiday season. Fried french toast... nasty. Tasted burned, no real sweetness, no gooeyness. Just gross, dry bread from the deep fryer. Sausage with French Toast... great. Meaty and a little sweet with a maple finish to the taste. Pork rinds... Great. Crackling hot and spicy. Hash browns... evil twin of the French Toast. Nothing special and tasted very greasy, it not overdone. Ham and Eggs with Grits... best part of the meals. Strangely had pickles diced and tossed on eggs and that was weird. Grits were good, but underportioned. So there you go. Skip the brunch and go for dinner.
