Had the eight course, I have to say, as the stars indicate, this is "as good as it gets!" Brought two wines, one being Black Zeppelin(BIG red), but I'll save the wine for another review. Bonsoiree is hands down the best upscale dining I've had in Chicago. I can not remember a meal where I had as good a time, and enjoyed the food as much as I did here. Presentation was excellent, and the atmosphere was not as stuffy as Alinea and I felt I could actually have a good time while enjoying the meal. This is my number one choice if i want a nice meal and need to make a reservation(non reservation would go to Avec). Went here with a good friend and had one of the best times in recent memory. Note: you can almost drive by this place without realizing, very small but awesome atmosphere, highly recommended
