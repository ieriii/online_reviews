Great Pizza, Great Beer... Too busy and hard to park by. That pretty much describes it. I absolutely love the pizza no matter if you get white,red, plain. look at there website if you want to learn about the differences. Try to not overload the pizza with too many toppings. I personally like mushrooms, hot peppers, and garlic. Try any beer that they brew and it will be good. They are always winning awards i hear. The place can be very loud and gets quite busy it seems like they're a sporty type bar which I think is totally unnecessary. Just stick with pizza and beer.
