I was excited when this placed opened because I thought maybe, just maybe they would have some kind of vegan b-fast option..not the case :( Being in an area where there are a lot of colleges-younger crowd they should know that a lot of people are veg/vegan. I had to go here one day for b-fast because we were meeting some friends there and the only option for me was a fruit plate. It wouldn't kill you to offer a tofu scramble! SO many other non veg restaurants offer this option! Eleven City diner, Bongo Room, etc.. I definitely won't be heading back until they offer some type of vegan friendly b-fast option.
