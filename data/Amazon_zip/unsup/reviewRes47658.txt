I think the best thing about Zed 451 is the decor and service. The food is a close 2nd. I went there on a Friday with my girlfriend who is a vegetarian. You might be thinking that is stupid... take your vegetarian girlfriend to a steakhouse. This is much more than just a steakhouse. The Harvest Table is perfect for your vegetarian girlfriend and I would have been happy with just that also. If she doesn't mind watching you stuff your face with delicious meat and fish. The best thing I ate was the red snapper and the Pistachio Duck. After we ate they even drove us to a neighboring bar. This is a really nice place and you will for sure get your moneys worth.
