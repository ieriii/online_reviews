If I were just judging the ambiance and service of this place, I'd give it 5 stars. I loved the decor, it was very comfortable and homey, yet elegant. The service was great-- our waiter was extremely polite and helpful, not pushy or a "know it all" type at all, like you find at many nice restaurants. Another reason i would've given Big Jones 5 stars were the corn muffins! They were amazing, and our waiter brought out extra when we asked for them. Now, the reason I had to give it 3 stars is because our entrees weren't that great. My boyfriend got the gumbo, and it wasn't at all what he wanted in gumbo. He said it tasted more like chili, or sloppy joe. So, not the best. I got the only vegetarian entree, which I can't remember the name of and it's not on the website's menu, but it was some type of grain-ish thing, kind of like rice, with vegetables and absinthe soaked raisins. My problem with this dish was the another reason why my boyfriend didn't like the gumbo-- it was EXTREMELY salty. Almost too salty to eat... and I like salt, so yes, it was very salty. I wasn't that happy about it. So since the entree is one of the most important things, I give this place 3 stars.
