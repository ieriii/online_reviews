For the price and convenience of hours, I give this place 4 stars.It isn't the cheapest place or most expensive place. It is big on the bbq and remember that you might come out smelling like it too. All the food is good, the bbq, the soups, the cooked dishes, and the side dishes. I never got any of the Japanese food so I can't tell you how those are.What I don't like is sitting on the floor. They have a side wall area that is all floor seating. I ache while I eat, it is inconvenient. and it's even more difficult to get the server's attention.Go here for some good Korean food, but be ready to sit on the floor if the sitting tables are all full.
