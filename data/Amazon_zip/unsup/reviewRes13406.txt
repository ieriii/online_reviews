If you're in the mood for a delicious and creative take on breakfast then give Glenn's a shot. You won't be disappointed. Chocolate cherry french toast and salmon-filled omelets are just a few examples of what I'm talking about and, even better, everything I've ever eaten here has been fresh and well-cooked. Include a friendly and attentive wait staff and a cozy ambiance with a variety of breakfast cereal boxes lining the walls and you got appointment brunch.
