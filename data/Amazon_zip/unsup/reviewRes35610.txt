I can understand places having off days. But I've only had food poisoning once before in my life (El Presidente, bad late-night burrito, bad). Sorry, the food I had was dry. Smelled of a reheat and serve. BBQ Pork, Eggplant and some pan-fried noodle dish. All ill-advised. My friend also was sick. We've traced it to the pork. Should have ordered the duck. Yes. My next two days were full of fever, pain and various stomach maladies. Unusual because I can eat about anything. Sun Wah was like Kryptonite. I undertand, again, that this place can have an off day, but what they served to us should be a crime. There are no mulligans when you get sick. You don't try to pass that off to a customers. For those of you that didn't experience what I did, good for you. Chinese restaurants are not Chicago's strength, but despite the rave reviews, I am not going to roll the dice with Sun Wah another time.
