We were group of 5... non of us had nice food and will not go back. Food was just ok - like I made it myself at my place for the very first time.... bland.... not sometnihg Italian places are famous for. Believe me I have had way better lasagna or pasta than food they serve!!!Im giving one star for nice looking restaurant, ambience and decor... but thats not the reason for me to go back!
