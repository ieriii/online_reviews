First off, let me say that if you are a part of the Bud Lite crowd, you can go ahead and stay home. This place specializes in imported European beers. No American shwill here folks. Some of the beers they offer even have their own unique glasses. Kinda makes you feel special. This place is dimly lit and has great atmosphere. Just so you know, Hopleaf has no arcade games or tv's, so you have an idea of what not to expect. P.S. Try the pomme frites, aka the fries w/mayo. Addictive as crack.
