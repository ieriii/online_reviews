This place is expensive! The small plates are really small and just ok. The scallops were overcooked. I know now why the website doesn't list prices. We were there for my girlfriend's birthday with a big group. We ordered a handful of appetizers to start. The bread was better than the food we ordered. We got the check and finished our meal at another restaurant.
