Mmmm...burgers. I came here for the first time, and considered the salad bar, but looking at it I decided it just looked ok. Instead, I decided to go all out for the hickory bacon burger.... beef, bacon, cheese, fried onions, and bbq sauce. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. It felt like a rock in my stomach afterwards but it was sooooo gooooood.
