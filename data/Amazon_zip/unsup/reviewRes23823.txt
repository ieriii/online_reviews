Woot! Started our trip here off to a good start with the free valet parking! Yippee!!  Our waiter, Patrick, was super nice, gave us plenty of time, and did a great job overall--we were really pleased with the service. For starters, we ordered the grilled octopus, which came drizzled with olive oil, vinegar, and oregano.......I am still sighing with pleasure over this dish. Sooooo gooood! For dinner we split gyros--and they were the only gyros I've ever had that didn't make me wanna crap my pants, to put it rudely. Not greasy, not overly spicy or salty, but just right. We also split the combination plate, which had roast lamb, mousaka, dolmades, keftedes and rice with tomato sauce, and veggies. The lamb was ick, but it was the butt end, so I can understand why. Too bad we had to get served that butt end :( boo hoo. The mousaka was good, the dolmades was good, and the keftedes and rice was super good. The veggies, not so much. Kind of a mass of unidentifiable green shapes, I don't really know what kind of veggies they were.  All in all, I left pretty satisfied with the meal, the service and the restaurant overall. Yay!!
