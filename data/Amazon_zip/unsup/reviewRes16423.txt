There's a fine line between pretentious and sophisticated, and Violet Hour is on the wrong side of it. I went with a friend on a Wednesday night and signed in around 10. We were told it would be about an hour, so we went across the street to Big Star. To our surprise, we got a call in about 20 minutes, so we chugged our salsa beer and rushed across the street to the cool mysterious door. When we got there, two women who came in after us were seated, leaving us seatless. We inquired as to why we got shafted after rushing to pay our bill and dashing across the street. Apparently the girls knew someone important. Apparently that makes me trash. The hostess was as apologetic as could be and even offered free champagne, so I decided to be calm and stay. The champagne was terrible, but, again, no big deal. I've heard a ton about this place and wanted to give the experience a fair chance. The interior is beautiful, and is a great romantic date location. The private type booths and high backed chairs are unique and gorgeous. The drinks, however, leave quite a bit to be desired, especially at this price point. After one drink each, we were ready to head out. I don't even remember what the music was like, but I do remember wanting to fall asleep while I was there. I won't be going back to Violet Hour. It was unique, and the mysterious unmarked entry door is a nice touch, but the sophistication stops at the entryway and gives way to pretentiousness.
