The restaurant is nice. The bacon and cheddar hush puppies were yummy, but a lot heavier than I expected. I was so disappointed with the brisket sandwich! I've only had brisket once before - in Texas. It was so good that I was hoping someone in the city could make brisket just as good. It wasn't Chicago q. It tasted like it had no seasoning. It appeared as if it would be moist since something wet drenched my sandwich bun to the point I couldn't pick it up or eat it, but it was dry as well as flavorless. Bummer. :(
