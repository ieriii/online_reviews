After watching the Illini's annual trip to the United Center, I ended up here with some friends. I guess something about this place just drew me here as apparently we were supposed to end up somewhere else, but I just went straight here and took advantage of the free parking and my friends just followed.  They bring out tons of super crumby bread and basically don't attempt to keep the table clean as it is pretty much impossible. The saganaki was pretty awesome. I ordered a vegetarian sampler as my meal and added a large order of potatoes to that. The sampler was really good and the potatoes were LARGE. Even though the game hadn't gone as we would have liked, the food here really almost made up for it.
