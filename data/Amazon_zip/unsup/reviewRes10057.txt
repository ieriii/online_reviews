meh... that's all I can really say about the food here. Service and ambiance were great but that doesn't change the fact that they serve sub-par italian food. With so many great options in the city, I don't feel the need to come back. It wasn't bad, I just wasn't impressed with anything on the menu or the dishes that we ordered, especially for the price.
