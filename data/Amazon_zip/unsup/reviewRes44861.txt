This place is a chain, the largest deep-dish pizza chain in Chicago, and you know what? It's pretty damn good. We got free bread, which was great, ordered a big salad (pizza takes a long time), and that was really good (we finished a huge bowl between two of us), and the pizza, their signature offering, is top-of-the-line deep dish, what they've been doing for years and years. So while it's the McDonald's of deep dish in Chicago in some ways, it's still really good stuff, probably where I'd take out-of-towners for deep dish if they came to Chicago and asked for it.
