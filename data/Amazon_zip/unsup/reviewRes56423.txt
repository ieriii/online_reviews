Just the best Vietnamese food in Lincoln Park, and pretty much the city. We've been to many Vietnamese places, and it's genuinely one of the best. Cozy small setting with excellent, friendly service to top off the fabulous food. We had a large house party recently so we thought of Simply It. They put together an array of appetizers and large dishes that wowed the crowd. Everyone commented on the food and asked where to find the restaurant. Eat at the restaurant, cater a party, whatever. You'll like it.
