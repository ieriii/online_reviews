So the wife and I decided to check this place out for lunch since it has good rating on yelp. Biggest mistake ever. Let's do a countdown on why this place sucks. 1. Parking: The parking spaces were created by someone with a smartcar. Even with my versa it was pain in the ass to get out of the parking lot without the wife getting out the car and helping. 2. Smokey: The place uses buckets of burning wood chips as the source of heat to boil the water at your table. So be prepared to smell like hickory when leaving there. 3. Dangerous for Children: To many open flames and waitstaff walking around with buckets of burning wood chips for me to comfortable to any small childrend there.. 4. Place is a bit small: The tables here are kind of low. But I'm 6'2 and most clientel appears to be 5'2. . 5. Service. So most authentic asian restaurants service usually a little slow. But we had to flag down multiple service people before before we could even get a menu and that's after waiting ten minutes. After we figure out what we wanted to eat it took another ten minutes and multiple hand waving before we could place order. And to make matters worst multiple table that came after we sat down were served before us. So after i complained that our food was taking to long to come out. Lo and behold ten second later our food came out. Then one of waitresses had audacity to tell us that we should had our food cooked at our table and not in the kitchen it would have come out faster. Thanks for the heads up b**ch. The wife thinks the service was treating us bad cause I was Black. Personally I don't want waste my energy on those thoughts. I should have just walked out but I was hungry and food smelled and it looked so good. BTW the food was decent. I definitely will not be coming back here. .   TLDR; Service REALLY sucks and food was o.k.
