Mastros is beautiful and the steaks are awesome! If you go for no other reason, go and have the butter cake and then die! Only negative - turn up the lights - mood is one thing, practicality is another. The customers who are going to keep you going in January aren't the 20 somethings out for a special occasion - it's us 50, 60 . . somethings who need a little light!Beautiful room, great food, GREAT butter cake!
