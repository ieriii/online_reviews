Violet Hour is not an everyday sort of bar. The rules posted at the entrance demonstrate this fact: "no Budweiser, no light beer, no Grey Goose, no cosmos." And no baseball caps. Some folks probably get this far and decide Violet Hour isn't for them, which is just fine with me. Having waited in a long line to get inside (which I'll avoid in the future by going early on a weeknight), I appreciated the fact that the interior of Violet Hour was not just another bar. It's a transformative space that's relatively quiet and intimate, with a touch of nostalgia for another place and time. The crowd control ensures that you have a comfy seat, that there's not a long wait for the ladies' room, and that you have enough personal space to prevent getting hit on. It still takes a while, though, to get your damn drink.
