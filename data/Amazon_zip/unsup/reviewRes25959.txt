Update 2, 11/7/08: After my last update I got an email from Jeff @ Geja's, telling me that the $9 charge was an oversight and shouldn't have happened. He was so prompt and accommodating, that I can't imagine it's anything but the truth. Thanks for taking the time to fix a problem Jeff, it's greatly appreciated. We'll see you next time we're back, and I'm sure we will be back.
