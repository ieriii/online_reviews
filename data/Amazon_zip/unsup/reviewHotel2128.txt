I stayed here while my bf was on a business trip. It's centrally located, near to the train, the river, the sights, restaurants, shopping, etc. Walk outside, and downtown Chicago is right there for your enjoyment. I think I'd rate 3.5 stars if I could. I was really happy with the bed, because usually no matter how nice a hotel I stay in, I toss and turn all night long. I pretty much slept like a (semi-drunk) rock here, I am pleased to report. The room was very small, but fairly nice. I'd agree that it's not a four star hotel - more like 3. I dunno if I'd stay here again, but I don't really have anything bad to say about it. My room was free, however, and I don't think I'd pay more than $200/night for this place, if that. Maybe I'm cheap? It's been a while since I've paid for a hotel room in the US since my bf travels a lot for business... I like how they have a touch screen computer thingy in the room - that was pretty cool.
