Went to Glenn's with a friend who's a big fan and also Mr. Atkins. So glad to find out it wasn't a diner and that we wouldn't be eating burgers without buns (one of his favorite Atkins foods)! Rather, we had seafood! As everyone else has probably already mentioned, this place is not really a diner in any way except for the casual and pleasant attitudes of the staff! We started off with mussels - my first time eating them - and now I'm a fan! He had the scallops, and had no complaints, and I had spaghetti and meatballs...lots of meatballs, very little spaghetti and not enough, or maybe too much, very sweet marinara sauce. I'd say the sauce was the only downside; too sweet and not tomatoey enough for a marinara. The wine list is great, short and sweet and not pretentious; I had the Zinfandel - not the fanciest wine, but it worked. I would definitely go back - there seems to be a reason people wait in line to eat in such a small space!
