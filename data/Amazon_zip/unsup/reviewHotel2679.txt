Forget yoga class. If you want to relax without breaking a sweat, book a room at The James. OK, so yoga is a bit easier on the wallet than a stay at this hotel, but I was relaxed as soon as I walked into our room. The employees are friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, and the location is perfect. There's a spa conveniently located in the hotel, but if you want to save some money the great Kiehl's bath products, rainfall showerhead, and comfy robe and slippers will do just fine. Also, skip the pricey in-room pantry and bar items - Trader Joe's is right across the street. If you feel like getting out and exploring the city or want to cruise down the lake shore path, the hotel offers complimentary Paul Frank bicycles for guests. But, trust me, you will not want to leave the comfort of this hotel.
