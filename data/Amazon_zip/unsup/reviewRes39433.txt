Came here with a buddy on a Thursday evening. It was around 9 pm, so it was a little busy, as expected. We had about an hour wait for a table, which was a bit less than expected. We settled up to the bar and started with some bourbon. The bartenders were nice and enjoyable. Everyone around the bar was having a good time; it was a fun atmosphere, but we were still able to have a conversation without yelling. We got a great table and our server was nice and informative. We started with the house olives and the shaved pear salad (servers recommendation). They were both pretty good. The server also recommended a beer with each dish, which we were happy to partake in. We followed the olives and salad with the scallops and sweetbread. These were decent, but would likely try other things next time.
