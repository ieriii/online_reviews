Finding good asian food was one of my biggest concerns about moving to Chicago. Forget about the chilly winds, bitter cold winters, or being over two thousand miles from my boyfriend- I was worried I wouldn't find a decent bowl of pho.  I love pho and I love this place. I originally wanted to try Tank two months ago, only to find that it was closed because the staff was on vacation. I finally tried it this weekend and was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting much, especially because I have tried the surrounding pho places and was pretty disappointed. With rain in the forecast, this was the perfect weekend for pho. Back in LA, its become a ritual to get pho whenever it was gloomy or rainy out. The pho was great. The broth was very tasty. Clean restaurant with a very friendly staff. Its right off the red line argyle stop. I will be coming back often to get my Vietnamese food fix.
