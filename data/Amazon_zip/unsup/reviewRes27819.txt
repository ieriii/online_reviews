GREAT FOOD, GREAT AMBIANCE - so why the 4 star rating? Because the waitstaff is extremely pretentious and was very rude to one of the guests at our table - so much that she threatened to pour wine on our head waiter's shoe when he *tried* to make up for his rudeness by giving her a taste of the port. The music is really loud and it's hard to talk to your fellow diners, but who cares when you're eating a foie gras lollipop cased in pop rocks?
