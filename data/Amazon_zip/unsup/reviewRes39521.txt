This place is rockstar. I've been coming here for YEARS and it's always delicious. Excellent Kalbi but it's better if you cook it at your table yourself. Their spicy squid is great and the amount of side dishes that come complimentary is amazing (upwards of 30 little dishes). Their cold, spicy noodles (bi bin lang mein) is tasty but not the best I've had. It fills the void though...! Their kim chee soup is great and overall this place is a favorite. We go every time we visit Chicago!
