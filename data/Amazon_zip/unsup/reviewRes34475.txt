I won't lie, the first year of grad school I came in here at least 4 times a week. It was on my way home! And who is going to say no to delicious food that's right there, just waiting for you to chomp -- especially if you're tired, hungry, and only have $5 in your wallet? What, you're going to cook dinner? Why spend precious time in the kitchen when someone else can make much more delicious healthy(ish) food for less money than you can?
