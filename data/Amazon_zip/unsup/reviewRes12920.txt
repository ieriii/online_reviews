I have been going to this restaurant minimally 6x/year for years. This is the first time I have something negative to say.  We had a horrible waitress that disagreed with me about how something was supposed to be served. As I have had the dish several times, I believe I know how it is supposed to be served. I was very disappointed and offended by the waitress. I am definitely going to go back but I will make sure I am not in her section.  The last 3 times I have gone I have ordered a fish dish, I used to order the Ropa Vieja religiously and loved it -- I happened to have a bite of someone's the other night and I didn't think it was as good as it used to be.  I am sooo sorry this is the last impression I have of this restaurant because usually I look forward to dining there, now I am somewhat hesitant.
