My hub and i are huge Top Chef fans and we especially loved Top Chef Masters. Rick Bayless rocks!!!! this is our 2nd time here, the 1st time was 1.5 years ago and at the time i thought it was pretty good.....but being from Los Angeles, where good mexican is pretty easy to come by, i wasn't terribly blown away. This time, we got there early before the restaurant opened and were greeted by a long ass line. Thankfully, we realized that bar opens earlier than the restaurant so we ran past the line and dove for the last 2 available seats at the bar. Awesome! the place filled up really fast. the drinks are ok. the chips and salsa and guacamole were tasty. i had the cochinita pibil, which is pork that is tender and AMAZING. my man had carnitas tacos and they were really tasty as well. The ambiance was fun and lively and the bartenders were nice. Would go back again for sure!!!!
