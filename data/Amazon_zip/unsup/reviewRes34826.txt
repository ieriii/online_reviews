Having grown up with homemade tabouleh and Lebanese dishes, you may think I'd be a pompous prick about eating at a "fast food" Middle Eastern place. No. Sultan's Market is good, and there's no lollygagging around that fact. I've brought my dad here, said cook of those dishes growing up, and he loves it. My recommendation is to get the lamb shawarma and load that sucker up with everything they let you, it's all amazing. There's no reason you're still reading this review and not eating here yet.
