Yum! Shaw's has such great food. I have been there twice and was not disappointed either time. The food tastes so fresh. I am a huge fan of their stone crab and their drink menu is delightful as well. I think their service was just okay. Both times we had the same exact waiter and felt like he was a bit stuck up. The food definitely made up for it though!
