We love The Gage! The venue is beautiful, the food is fabulous, the service is great, serious wine list....it's all there! We have eaten there many times and have never been the least bit disappointed. Dinner, lunch, ever. I'd list which dishes I love, but it would take too long. Try the nightly specials....always interesting. Do try the fois gras appetizer in a jar; it is luscious. The steak salad is amazing. Elk steak. Fennel soup. I could go on and on. Love The Gage.
