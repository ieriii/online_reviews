Violet Hour house rules: 1. No Hats 2. No Jager Bombs 3. No Cell Phones 4. No fun 5. No light beer 6. If you can't find the place, you aren't cool enough to come in so go somewhere where that doesn't have rules #2 or #5 So after reading and studying the rules, this place is not so terrible. I was extremely skeptical after waiting in line with a party of 4, and watching parties of 2, 3 and 5 go in before us. When we finally got through the first set of blue curtains for staging, we waited another 10 or so minutes for the bouncer to check our ID's before seating us. The atmosphere is just like I would expect it to be, which was cool dark and swanky. Waitress was cute and bubbly, which was not exactly what I expected, but she was very prompt which made the experience more pleasant. The drink and whiskey menu is expansive, and the drinks are all a standard price, which is nice, except that that price is $12, but I wouldn't expect much less for a good Manhattan. I had The Sazerac which was strong but tasty, and when I checked out the appetizer menu and saw my favorite food ever on there I had to order the Deviled Eggs. $6 is not bad, and I assured everyone that if they weren't in the mood for hard boiled eggs in the middle of a night out, that I would eat every last one of them and pay. So to recap, Long wait, cool atmosphere, high priced delicious drinks, good deviled eggs, and an overall decent experience. If they took reservations or bribes of $20 or less I would bring a first date here for sure.
