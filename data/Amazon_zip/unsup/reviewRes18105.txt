My favorite burger place in Chicago.  This is my go to restaurant. The burgers are excellent, the truffle fries are amazing, and the beer selection keeps me here long after I've finished my meals. I still think Kuma's has better burgers, but Bad Apple isn't the pretentious ordeal that Kuma's is.  I recommend trying the Elvis Last Supper. I avoided it for a while, but that creamy peanut butter just melts in your mouth when you eat it. Its soo good and unique. Really my only complaint is their ketchup, which I like to use on fries. What is that stuff made out of? It has this weird texture and taste...I'm assuming its made in-house, but I'd much rather just have Heinz. If you are in Lincoln Square/North Center, you should give this place a try.
