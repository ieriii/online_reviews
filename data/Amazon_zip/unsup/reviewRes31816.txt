Was travelling to Chicago for work and dined here alone by the bar. Was a great experience, fun, lively "restaurant and cocktail" vibe, modern interior. Excellent sushi (was very surprised by the quality of Sushi in Chicago overall, I also hit Sushi Wabi for lunch). I particularly liked the signature sushi with the pan fried rice and handcut kobe beef tartare. This was a unique dish with excellent flavours and texture, a great creative riff on sushi. The miso brozed black cod was also a stand out, supple, sweet and tender cod with eggplant. Will return next time I visit.
