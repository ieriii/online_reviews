My second time at Bongo room (after trying the South loop one first) was perfect. I had red velvet pancake and french toast (1 each, yes you can order by piece here!). My bf ordered the savory stuff to balance our meal. We shared every dishes. They were all tasty and I cannot wait to try other stuffs.
