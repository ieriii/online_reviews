DELISH!! The falafel sandwiches are SOOOO good it's almost ridiculous that they charge $3 or $4 for it, or whatever insanely low price it is. I love the tabboule salad and the lentil rice is also a favorite. A wonderful cheap eat in Wicker Park. And yes, don't forget to bring $$, they don't accept plastic.
