REALLY REALLY good, innovative food. However, can't give it a 5 star because I've eaten at Alinea and that deserved a full out 5 star, this place, sure was great but not over the top incredible. The atmosphere threw me off a bit even after reading almost every review on this place. Looks run down from the outside, and once we walked in, we were the only people in the restaurant. I'm not sure I can even call this place a "restaurant" since it was just a rectangular shaped small room, little decor, nothing on the walls and small tables/chairs. Oh, they covered the tables with white cloth so that's what gave it away as a restaurant for us. Very casual atmosphere, however they try to be fancy with their dishes. They came out all very tiny (as expected) and with a lot of unique flavors. It was all great but once again, nothing over the top amazing to justify the price per person. What really bothered me was the EXTREMELY loud, unnecessary loud music that was blasting from the speakers. I could not hear my husband and he was right in front of me. Totally unnecessary for a tiny restaurant like this. I get it, they want to be "cool" and "different" but the rap music wasn't what bothered me, it was the loudness. We came here basically because of all the hype. Will we be back, probably not. Are we glad we came, sure b/c now we feel more "complete" as foodies. Overall, great marketing on Schwa's side for not answering their phones making it almost impossible to get a reservation. We just got lucky, called one afternoon and they answered. If you're as curious as we were and have the cash, go for it.  Great friendly, casual staff.
