I am gluten and dairy free and read that Wildfire had a gluten free menu, so I booked on OpenTable and told them I would be ordering from that menu. I went with a friend (not GF) and we had a really great experience. I have dined at Wildfire before going GF, but dining is now sort of a horrible experience. I have to ask a lot of questions about ingredients, and it is just embarrassing and an all-around pain in the butt. Wildfire made it easy. Our server was attentive, patiently answered all my questions, and never made me feel like an idiot. The restaurant was so accommodating to GF, I will recommend it to anyone like me who dreads going out to eat. And they give you warm GF bread! My friend liked it better than the regular bread they brought. I had an amazing filet and sweet potato, cooked perfectly. I will be going back again.
