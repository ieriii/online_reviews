I love this place. Excellent Beer on tap selection and a great food. The only strange thing that happened was when i ordered a salad i asked for ranch and the waiter said "we dont have ranch, the owners think its too main stream." i looked at my friends and we all laughed. Two minutes later he brings a bottle of Heins ketchup to the table. We started laughing even louder.  How is ranch too main stream but ketchup isnt..... lol. I still love this place but they are kinda weird.
