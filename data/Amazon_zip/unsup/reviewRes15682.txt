We ordered pizzza from here the other night and it was outstanding. It had a VERY thin crust and the sauce was perfect. We will order the zaa from here again! My family dined in the restauarant and they said the other food was good too. Yummy bread, huge pasta portions, and delish terramisu. Can't wait to try it.
