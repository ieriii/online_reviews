My favorite place to grab a bite in the neighborhood. Usually my boyfriend and I go and get 1 order of Seoul Sassy wings and 1 Seoul Sensation burrito to share both and sometimes we still have leftovers. The first time I had Seoul Sassy wings spoiled me for life--I will never love any chicken dish as much as I love that. I love my fried chicken, but that takes it to a whole new level. YUM!!! The burrito is bursting with the freshest ingredients. If I go alone, I can eat half the burrito and have the next half the next day--lot of bang for your buck. Good prices, friendly service, clean place, best food--can't go wrong.
