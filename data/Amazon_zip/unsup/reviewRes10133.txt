I was here for the first time yesterday for dinner. I had the white pizza with chicken, spinach, and riccotta. It was so dry it tasted like I was eating flat bread with some toppings sprinkled on. I was extremely unimpressed. It was also SO loud that I couldn't hear my boyfriend across the table, and we had to sit uncomfortably close to anther couple at the next table 4 inches away from us. Also, the doormen are really douche-y. This isn't Wrigleyville. And why are you carding me at 6pm to get in when you have toddlers eating there? So 20 year-olds aren't allowed in, but 5 year-olds are?
