AMAZING PIZZA! Our group of three got a white pizza (plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese) with sausage and mushrooms. The garlic was definitely the star of the pizza. It was delicious! Now they noted that a medium serves 2-3 but it was pretty massive by my measure and we had several slices left over which made someone quite happy later that night at 2:00 a.m. Great brews as well. I had the Cappin' IPA and was much pleased. Now I need to go back and get the mashed potatoes on my pizza that everyone has been raving about.
