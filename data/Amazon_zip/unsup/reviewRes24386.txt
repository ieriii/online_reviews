My querida and I decided to go to Geja's for our six month anniversary, and I am trying to think of something in the experience that was NOT spot-on. No, really - it was that good. The vital stats... GETTING THERE: You have to look for it a little bit just to be sure you don't miss it (it's not quite on street level), but they've got $10 valet parking. A real deal. AMBIENCE: REALLY nice for a romantic evening out. Spanish guitar, the feel of an old world taverna, lighting straight out of a Rembrandt. SERVICE: We had an exceptional server - friendly, informative, gave us the perfect amount of space. FOOD: There's fondue, and then there's FONDUE. This is FONDUE. The meal comes with an appetizer order of cheese fondue, which is absolutely luscious...just a perfect balance of gruyere and white wine flavors, nicely paired with a couple different types of bread (including a great pumpernickel) and fruit. The salad course comes up at the same time; nothing overly special here, but a nice salad. The entree selections come with excellent quality meat and a lot of fresh vegetables and mushrooms, plus a spread of really tasty dipping sauces...something for everyone. The real star, though, is the dessert course. Somebody came up with the brilliant idea of firing the chocolate fondue with a little brandy at the start of dessert...and you've got marshmallow and graham cracker crumbs (plus pound cake and more fruit). Marshmallow+graham cracker+melted chocolate=SMORE. Brilliant. I had a coffee with frangelico to go with dessert; also lovely, though it would've been nice if its price had been advertised. So, this is an amazing place for a really intimate date night. I even found a groupon, so we'll be back at Geja's before too long...and that is WAY fine by me.
