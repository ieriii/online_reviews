I can't believe I've lived so close to this magical place for a year and never visited. My new favorite sandwich place. The Veggie sandwich is so good. Roasted veggies cooked to perfection. Next time I'll ask them to add some avocado. But even without, it was delicious. Service was fine. Outdoor seating rocks. BYOB is awesome. I can't wait to go back
