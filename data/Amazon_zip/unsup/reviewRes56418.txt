Simply It is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to get take out. The food is delicious, fairly healthy (lots of choices for vegetables and rice and not everything is fried) and the staff is extremely friendly. I highly recommend the Pho Bo (beef noodle soup), Asian Vegetables on Crispy Noodles, and Simply it's Beef (Bo Luc Lac). These have all been great! The Pho Bo is a main staple though- reason enough to order!Also they always give you complimentary fruit on the side (for take out at least) and again the staff is so nice. If you pick up, you will certainly meet the owner who will offer you tea or water and cater to your every need (even if you don't have any). He's great! Go to Simply It!
