I'm usually not one to splurge on gourmet mexican food, but after watching him dominate Top Chef Masters, I had to come visit. I also had a chance to meet him at the Green City Market BBQ, which was an awesome event. He genuinely a great character and I commend him for that! Appetizers: i) Tamal Al Guajillo (banana leaf wrapped tamal) and ii) Cazuela De Tinga (braised smoky maple creek pork shoulder with potatoes and chorizo). I was a bigger fan of the pork shoulder and it almost felt like a drier version of stew. Both tasted great in the corn tortilla shells. The Tamal had a bit less flavor and was just ok. Main course: i) Pato En Mole De Cachuate (duck breast in red peanut mole). After watching top chef masters and learning that he combines 20+ ingredients in his mole, I just had to try it. It did not disappoint! Great flavors and perfectly cooked duck breast. ii) Carne Asada A La Oaxaquena (angus steak). Eh. I was surprised to find the meat wasn't that tender and was even a bit stringy. I wouldn't order it again. iii) Falda Asada Brava (flank steak with spicy salsa). We probably went overboard with steak, but this dish was better. The hot sauce was no joke. iv) Wednesday night pork special. I forgot the exact name, but it was awesome. I'd come back for this and the duck mole dish again! For dessert, we had the Chocolate Pecan Pie, which was surprisingly light. I figured if Rick built out Xoco, he would have some tasty surprises. Overall, pretty good dinner. I'd give it 5 stars if the angus steak dish could have been executed better. The flank steak dish was better than average, but didn't blow me away. The style of the other dishes was exactly what I came to Frontera to experience.
