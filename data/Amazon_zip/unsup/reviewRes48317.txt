Sat family style with a bunch of strangers. It was the 1st time I ever did so it was a new experience but based on other restaurants it was also the trend. Ordered the pork rinds, which were featured on "the best thing I ever ate". Enjoyed them. But they tasted just as good as the pork rinds off the elotes carts in Albany park. Ordered some oysters. Chose them based on the cool exotic names they had but because I get squimish thinking about a slimy raw just killed animal grazing my throat I couldn't palate them enough to taste the difference. We also ordered a few things from the charcuterie but I don't remember them well I'm not a connoisseur of cured meats. Ordered a larger chicken dish and also a beef dish. Both were great but I can't remember the details about them. They have a great selection of wines and beers. The hubs has a liking for lighter ales and wheats. He enjoyed a couple glasses. We'd go back again and maybe with some friends and I'll play more attention to the food next time... promise
