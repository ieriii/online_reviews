I picked this place for a friend's birthday, and NO ONE was disappointed! Food and presentation was amazing, same as the service.My favourite part was the dessert plated on a monkey sculpture, and the dessert cart at the end which loaded with small french treats!! I was so regret that I was too full to try every single item on the cart. Will def go back on a special occasional to impress friends/family again!
