I was first introduced to Hopleaf a few years ago on a first date. That didn't last, but this neighborhood bar did. It was instantaneous chemistry. In the 'hood, a beer selection that will knock your socks off (for the hop lovers like me!), delicious food (the mussels are amazing!) and a great, casual atmosphere. I really really love this place. I look forward to coming here for a drink, a bite to eat and good conversation with friends. But, the service has got to improve. I have yet to meet a bartender here that knows the meaning of customer service. And it only seems to get worse ... so please, drop the 'tude.
