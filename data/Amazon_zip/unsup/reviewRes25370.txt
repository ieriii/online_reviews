This is a place that people rave about. So, even though I'm not really a fan of fondue, I was hopeful when a date took me here. I'm still shaking my head in bafflement- what is fancy or romantic about dining in a room that feels like the inside of a fondue pot, navigating stabby utensils, and over-cooking my own food with a burning pot of hot oil on a small table...it almost seems like a display of medieval weaponry! It seems like this is the kind of evening meant for people who like 1. themes 2. bragging rights 3. something to distract them from speaking to each other. For the cost, there are so many wonderful, wonderful restaurants in this city with atmosphere, intimacy, delicate service and amazing food.
