Well, I have to update my previous review. I went back after the remodeling. Man, was I dissapointed. I walked in at around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. I was told 5 min before a table would be ready. I ended up going to the bathroom after 10 minutes and noticed at least half a dozen tables empty (uh-uh, here goes service, I thought). 15 minutes after we walked in we were seated. No waitress for another 10 minutes and no chips for at least 15 minutes. When the waitress comes back we place an order. About 30 minutes (4 stars to 3 stars) the food comes back and it's totally missing my son's order! (2.5 stars) His order arrived about 10 minutes later when we were practically done with our food. After my wife complained about a piece of hair in the food and the missing food to a hostess (there doesn't seem to be any manager in there), she assures us that the extra item for my son will be taken out of the total bill. 15 minutes later, after pressing hard, we get the bill, which of course, includes my son's order (2 stars). We ask the waitress to correct & re-run the bill. The next day when I check my credit card statement I noticed that the order was rung twice !!! (1 star) The service is so horrible at this place, that the food becomes irrelevant. This place is now on my list of "must avoid". I now have to find myself another place for my chimichanga craving. p.s: I can't even use the "stinky cheese" rating as it is an insult to any cheese lover. 1 "velveeta" star.
