By far one of the BEST places to eat in the city. Not only is the food superb (Best Italian beef I've ever had), but they also make great coffee and alcoholic drinks.Some of my must have items on the menu:-Diablo's Beef-Diablo's Tacos-Chinese Noodle Soup-Cajun Chicken Penne-Stuffed French Toast-Lynchberg Lemonade -Chai Tea Latte-Hot ChocolateNot to mention some of the best coffee and service.
