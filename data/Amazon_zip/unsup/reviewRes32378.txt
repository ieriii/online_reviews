I had heard good things about Demera so I thought that I would try it. I ordered deliver and the food took about an hour to get delevered instead of the 35-40 they told me. No big deal, just mentioning it. My brother and I ordered the sambussa sampler. Those were good. I wasnt expecting to like the tuna one but I did. There was a cheese one but with a very odd cheese, very dry and crumbly. The wrapping dough was golden crispy, tasty and flaky. I ordered the ye-siga alicha (42) which is small cuts of stewed beef placed on top of the injera bread. My brother had the ye-beg-wot (33) which is small cuts of stewed lamb in a spicy berbere sauce placed on top of the injera bread. First impression, the taste was great and new. Really an interesting blend of Arab and Indian. Which totally makes sense since Ethiopia is on the trade routes between those two cultures. The injera has a very pronounced sourdough flavor which I love. Some people just dont like the spongy consistency of it but it was fine for me. The second impression was not so good. The lamb had number small bones in it and my beef dish had several "tendony" parts that I had to toss. For dishes which you are supposed to grab with the injera I would think that the chefs would take enough care to not serve bones and tough pieces. I would never serve that to my guests. To me it shows either laziness or an inattention to detail. Or perhaps it is just cultural and for them it is perfectly fine. But my brother even got a piece of bone in his cabbage side dish, now that just should not happen. Despite this, I'll try them again if only b/c of the great flavors they put together.
