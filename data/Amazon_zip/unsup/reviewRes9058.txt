I've just recently discovered Le Colonial (very late, i know) and have quickly fallen in love with it. Somehow it seems to have remained a hidden gem, despite its Rush Street location, and is a refreshing change from the gold coast's other, more obnoxious offerings. As others have said, the ambiance is beautiful - especially the lounge upstairs. If possible, try to sit at one of the tables up there, on the balcony side. In this slightly exclusive section, you'll get a great view with the tables overlooking Rush. I have yet to go in the summer, but I've heard they open up the roof... and can only imagine the people-watching opportunities. Anyways, the FOOD. Oh wow, the food is really good. So far, I've liked everything I've ever tried here, and would highly recommend the following: 9. TOM CUON RAM - beignets stuffed with shrimp, chicken and vegetables ... maybe the best thing on the menu 10. CA SONG - tuna tartare with wontons ... can't go wrong 11. PHO .... duh 26. MI XAO DON CHAY .... stir-fried mixed vegetables and tofu over egg noodles Also worth noting, they have a wide selection of vegetarian options, so if that interests you, ask them for the vegetarian menu. Finally, do yourself a favor and order the banana chocolate dessert. You won't regret it. I'm thrilled to have finally found Le Colonial, and you will be too.
