If you're looking for a good breakfast or lunch, and need to get in and out fast, I highly recommend Meli Cafe. Delicious food, from hearty egg skillets to fluffy omelettes and fresh squeezed juice combos and tasty sandwiches. They always have a homemade jam or jelly and fluffy butter for your toast or English muffin. This place is always busy...but they move people quickly so waiting is never an issue. Service is on top of it as well. If you're in Greektown, don't miss this place. If you're a breakfast fan, it's a true delight.
