Whenever in Greektown, there are a couple usual places everyone goes. Those are the biggies. The heavyweights. The quintessential Greek restaurants. But my favorite is Artopolis. It looks and feels more like a pizza joint but with a bakery and cafeteria-style service built in. We decided to come down here after a walk in the neighborhood on a Sunday afternoon. I haven't been here for anything but bakery so I was excited to come. We were sat nearly immediately and at a relatively small table in the downstairs area by the front windows. Great for people watching. Instead of getting proper meals, we got apps: spinach leaves, dolmadakia, kaseri & feta. To drink, we got a frapp and vissinada. Everything was properly delicious and came out in waves. The incredibly small table made for some interesting acrobatics, but we ended up consolidating the plates and eating off the serving plates instead of our own dinner plates. It's all good. We ended up with a bill for $34 without tip, which in my opinion is a little pricey for a lunch. But it was delicious.
