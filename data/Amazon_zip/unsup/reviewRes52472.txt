Brazzaz's has plenty of meat options as well as a huge salad bar to choose from. Everything taste wonderful my favorite is the top and bottom sirloin AMAZING! I have been to other Brazilian steak houses before but this is my favorite. Besides having a million different salads, vegetables and cheeses and breads they have pasta & sushi at there salad bar, you get rice and beans, the BEST cheesy bread, and fried bananas which my 3 year old son LOVES. The restaurant is not hit or miss everything always taste the same EXCELLENT! Enjoy and don't forget to try the sirloin yummy....
