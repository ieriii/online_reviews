This place is awesome. I went for lunch to get a smaller crowd and a cheaper price - $30 a person for lunch. This is all you can eat, so come hungry. The food is awesome and the service is great. The staff was friendly and attentive.  The perfect compliment to this restaurant would be a voodoo church since i had amassed a good amount of bones after 4 rounds of meat.
