I came here with my bf on a Friday morning. We had to wait about 20 minutes in the cold, but it was well worth it! This place has really creative hot cakes and other specialties. My bf had the Chorizo omelet. It was really tastey! The portions were also huge. There was just enough flavor, not bland and not salty. The potatoes were also full of herbs. Yummy! I had the red velvet hot cakes. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but man am I glad I ordered these hot cakes! They were soooo goood!! I wish we had these in Cali!!! If I ever go back to Chitown, I'll be sure to stop by The Bongo Room again!
