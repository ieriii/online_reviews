Fun, fun, fun! That is the atmosphere that Carnivale conjures.  We were visiting Chicago and a friend of ours from college took us here for dinner. We loved it. The ceviche was really tasty. I split the fried deboned fish with my husband and I had some of our friend's ropa viejo. Everything was delicious. If I live in Chicago, I'd definitely celebrate my birthday here. And by the way, I love the decor. Now, the only thing that is missing are samba dancers. lol.
