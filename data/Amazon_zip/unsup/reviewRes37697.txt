mmm Dogfishhead 90minute IPA for $5. Get a nice strong beer for a cheap price? That not strong enough for you? Over the winter time they got some crazy Christmas beers upwards of 18% ABV (served in a smaller goblet, but hot damn thats one strong beer). The food is sooo good. if you never got the mussels there, get them now. Both flavors are good, but I think I prefer the one cooked in white wine sauce with bacon and potatoes. Its like a free bowl of soup when you finish the mussels. And in this economy, who doesn't want a free bowl of soup? Other must haves: CBJ, duck sandwich.... can't think of any other ones, but this is a gret place for good food and really really good beer.
