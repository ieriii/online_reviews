I've been going to Uncommon Ground for a few years now and have always, always had a great meal at both locations. I prefer the Devon location over the Lincoln Park location, in part because it's so much easier to find parking and in part because on a couple of occasions there has been excellent live music at the Devon location when I was there. Both places have awesome food--the menu changes somewhat frequently, so I sometimes miss meals that I liked in the past (there was once a buffalo ribeye steak that was unbelievably good . . . ) but there's always new stuff to try. The Friday fish fry is great--I lived in Wisconsin for several years, and although this isn't an all-you-can-eat fish fry, the quality is way higher than what I've had elsewhere. Great beer list, great atmosphere, really high quality ingredients, friendly staff. It's a bit on the expensive side, but you absolutely get what you pay for and more. I have recommended this restaurant to several friends and they've all become fans. I will be back!
