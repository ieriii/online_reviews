The front desk hostess: Michelle is HORRIBLE. I'd probably never come back to this place. When I was checking in, she says the only room available was a TWIN size bed and I looked at her dumbfounded. I obviously had another person with me, but she insisted that it's fine. I complained, and I instantly get a King size bed. Either she was lazy, or too dumb to operate a computer.
