Great news Superdawg lovers!!!! I was driving this morning down Milwaukee Ave in Wheeling and as I was passing Bob Chinn's I saw a sign in the lot next to Bob Chinns with Maurie and Flaurie sticking up above a still covered sign. I had stopped my car and peaked under the sign and it said Superdawg opening Spring 2009. I can't wait!!!!!!!
