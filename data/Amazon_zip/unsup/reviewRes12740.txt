My experience here was mediocre. I think from the get go I was in a salty mood because the Host staff was one of the most incompetant (did i spell that right haha) group of people I have ever encountered. People were getting seated out of line, and once the hostess grabbed us she brought my boyfriend and I to a table for TEN! I said with a smile, "Um, I would prefer not to sit at a table for ten". She laughed and said "Ok, go find a table!" WHAT!? We looked at eachother in shock as she continued to fumble with her table "cheat sheet". Ugh this really pissed me off. On a lighter note, the food was spot on with a better salad bar than some of the other churrascarias in town. Waiter was great and the chick swinging in the wine cellar is pretty cool. Bad first impression held back the forth star!
