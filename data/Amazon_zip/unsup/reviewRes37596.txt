I do love Fox and Obel. I hadn't been there in a while but have missed going for sure. They have the most amazing chocolate cookies. I used to buy the 40 dollar tin when they had it. Things maybe alittle more expensinve but you can find items that you cannot get anywhere else. One not would be check shelflife dates as some items do have short shelflife.  I am really happy they are opened later now. It make it much easier for me who lives in the suburbs to go when I go downtown for another event. They have the best customer service because even thought we were there at 10 pm and the meat counter was starting to shut down. They went ahead and helped us. How great is that. That was the same for the bakery.
