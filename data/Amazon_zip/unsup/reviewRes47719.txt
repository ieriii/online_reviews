Three. Maybe four for the drinks served at the roof deck. Now I'm not the kind of guy who's ready to drop $12 on just any cocktail, especially when I can buy a pint and some mixer and make my own for less. However, when that cocktail is a thoughtfully hand-crafted (delicious) one, I can swing $12 once in a while. I had the ginger bourbon lemonade. My group also got a kiwi-strawberry margarita and a blackberry mojito. All of the drinks were made from scratch with real fruit. All of them were extremely tasty. The guys up at that bar were pleasant and seemed to be knowledgeable of their craft. Now I'm not sure if it was house policy, but it looks like they were measuring shots and not free pouring them... So I'd definitely go back on a nice summery week night; I'd probably skip weekends and the inside. Inside was another story. Server was by like 5 times in 5 minutes to ask our indecisive little group if we knew what we wanted. Then gone. Then a while later we were able to place our order. A while later we got our drinks. And then... we never saw her again. I can understand being new to a job, but no matter how new, you do still have a job to do. Or there should be someone around who does know what's up and can step in. Comfy spot by the fire, but the music was a really weird selection and the crowd was a little, well, the place *is* at Clark and Superior. Anyway, definitely a chill place to duck in for a classy cocktail on a classy roof deck once in a while. Beyond that, though... not too sure.
