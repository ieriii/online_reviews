I always heard that this place was great, but unfortunately that was not the experience I had. I ordered a lamb shawerma dinner, and the meat was almost tasteless, and so dry that it was damn near inedible. They just slap it on your plate too; the overall attitude there seems extremely "don't care". With so many great places to eat Middle Eastern food in this city, I won't be returning to Sultan's again.
