Pro: Cleanliness. Location. This one probably makes up for all the cons below. Online deals seemed available. Con: Told I would have a room with a view. The view was of the a/c unit that blocked all but an inch of the window. Staff not that helpful if you're not in the "trendy" crowd. Airlines use this hotel for their staff, and if you're there when they are coming or going, good luck trying to get an elevator, a cab, service from the bellhop, etc. The elevators can fit maybe 1 person with luggage and 1 other person. They are extremely small and there are few of them so it takes awhile to get to your room. I waited 6 minutes for an elevator, which doesn't seem like much. But after a day of touring the city, tired feet, being hungry, etc., 6 minutes is 6 minutes too long to be waiting for an elevator.
