My father refuses to eat any Italian food outside the home, but he will gladly make the exception for Piccolo Sogno - the descriminating taste of a native Sicilian is the best testament ever. I took my colleagues when in town for a tradeshow and they raved about this amazing restaurant for weeks after returning home to CA. Several comments suggesting Northern Italian food but Chef Tony most certainly offers fine, authentic Sicilian dishes - just like my Zia Damiana makes back in my family's beloved homeland...brings a tear to my eye...enough said... Fabulous experience.
