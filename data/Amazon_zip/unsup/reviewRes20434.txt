Yeah I drank that XOCO kool-aid. And I can't get enough of it. We arrived at around 5:30 on a Friday and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. Bayless & co. seem to have the kinks ironed out. Even though it is a quick serve restaurant, there was someone there to greet us when we entered, and then he brought us to our seats when they opened up. This is smart planning, since it keeps everyone in order in a small area. It is the little things that make an experience so great. Things like complimentary sparkling water with lime. We got some chips and guacamole to start. The guac is very fresh with large chunks of avocado in it, which I liked. Chips are nice and fresh. I got the Pork Belly Vermicelli Caldos. I absolutely loved it. The pork belly was crisp and the broth just the slightest bit spicy. There are chunks of avocado, mushrooms, and zucchini in there as well. It was filling and very satisfying, yet I wasn't overstuffed. What put me over the top was the fresh churro with vanilla ice cream. OMG. Dough just out of the fryer coated in cinnamon and sugar. So good. A few minor annoying things here: the people at the registers don't take your order until a table opens up and you receive a number. I don't know how to make this more efficient other than expanding the dining space because you're essentially waiting for people to finish eating. The line can get ridiculously long during peak times as a result. As with most extremely popular places, avoid the rush and it will be a much more pleasurable (and less time consuming) experience.
