Ordering individual pancakes to share is definitely the way to go - there are too many yummy options and they are mostly way too rich to eat an entire order yourself. I tried both of the burritos, and think the vegetarian was better than the rock shrimp one (although my breakfastmate ordered it without chorizo, which could have changed everything). The coffee was good, and they were pretty good about keeping it full/hot. Also, they seem to be anal about cleaning up used "milk buckets" and sugar packets...
