This place is unusual and interesting. Luckily someone in our party knew someone at the door so there was no waiting. As we passed people in line, they were not shy in stating the obvious, "Um, there is a line." and "Who do they think they are?"...which we all ignored and pushed our way through. We arrived at the door and were greeted by a handsome tall dark man wearing a violet trench coat. He proceeded to check our IDs and went over the rules. The first, no cell phone use...that was a first for me. After hearing the rules were were seated at a table in back. This was close to a fireplace and high back chairs with tables, and all in violet color (or at least a similar shade). After being seated the first thing I noticed was the terrible 80s music playing...what? I tried not to listen and engaged myself in the drink menu. I decided on the Austin 75 (Tito's, Lemon, Hisbiscus Syrup, Sparking). The drink came in a tall glass with a huge from top to bottom of the glass ice cube. It was very tasty but I was wondering how much room that ice was taking in there...My friend had the Moscow Mule (Tito's, Lime, Ginger Syrup) which is what I wished I ordered because I liked it better. This drink however came in a short glass and had a huge round ice cube in it...basically from one end of the glass to the other...not impressed but maybe it's just me. I went to the restroom and noticed a list of rules at violet hour. No bombs of any kind, no light beer, etc...HA! The crowd was friendly and was a mix of older and younger. It was an interesting experience and I would go back with the right group.
