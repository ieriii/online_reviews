This place was AMAZING! Expensive, but it's worth going once in a while. The concept is really neat. It's a set price, so you can eat as much as you can (which means, don't eat that much during the day when you plan to go here). The staff was very nice and attentive. They bring you all different kinds of meat pretty often and then you have a full salad bar that you can also go to and eat as much as you want. The meat was very tender and tasted great. Next time we are in Chicago, we are definitely coming here again!
