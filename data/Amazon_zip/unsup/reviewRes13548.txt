Met up with a group of 8 over the weekend. It was incredibly packed inside, but I was able to find a close street parking. The wait for a table was fairly long, but our server and the bar staff were in good spirits really adding to the fun and relaxed atmosphere. I loved the wood carved fists decor and the hanging artwork. Drink the beer. Get the Bacon Popcorn. The Blue Cheese Potato Salad was good, but the blue cheese was a little too subtle for my taste. Not too much to comment on the Ruben and I wasn't too unpressed with the Cheese Plater that was on special. The over all quality is good and the server was even nice enough to split everyone's tab in advance. I look forward to trying something new when I go back.
