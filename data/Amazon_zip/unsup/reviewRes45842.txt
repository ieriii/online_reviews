Meh ... just not my style. BIG. This restaurant is huge. Pretty cool looking I must say - impressive even. However... bad service. With a place that huge they should have bussers, food runners, servers, expos... the whole gang. It shouldn't be lacking in the service department. Servers shouldn't be stressed out. They definitely make enough money to hire the appropriate staff. The menu is way too big for me - I like places that specialize in one type of cuisine, but hey if you like a lot of choices - then this is for you. I did LOVE the warm goat cheese salad on the appetizer menu. It was delicious! Not complex though and I can make it at home. Overall just a mediocre place not worth all the hype I had heard. Just not my style. You may love it though! Chain feel.
