After reading raves on Facebook about Hopleaf from hipster doofuses I went to school with but no longer talk to, I decided I had to venture to this far north destination, and I'm glad I did. The beer list is worth the trip. Mussels were fantastic. My only complaint with the place is that it gets so packed and doesn't take reservations. So be prepared to wait over an hour for a table. Because there were six of us, we were able to get a table much quicker. Everything was good, but nothing in the city is worth waiting over an hour for. What can I say, I'm impatient. But if you have patience you can't go wrong at Hopleaf.
