Going to a steakhouse is not commonplace for me. Although I am a meat lover, I find it difficult to focus all my energy on just a piece of meat....so I went to a steakhouse last night and ordered fish.. We had a reservation and were seated immediately; however, it was a Sunday evening, so I did not expect anything less. The restaurant looked nice, but a little cluttered with a lot of tables fitted into the front room. The back room looked like it had booths, but I only saw that from the corner of my eye - so I could be totally off. The table for four that we were seated at was small for the number of things they had on it. I felt crowded, but after a while got used to it. The rest of the dining experience was positive - good, prompt service.  I ordered the halibut was cooked to perfection, sprinkled with coarsely ground, black pepper, and served on a bed of mushrooms and asparagus. The sauce had the just the right amounts of ginger and lime, making for an appetizing, filling and reasonably healthy meal. The three diners I was with ordered the summer special, which included a choice of appetizer (1 of 2) entree (1 of 3) and dessert (1 of 2). The portions were nicely sized, although the grilled shrimp entree only included 4 shrimp. The veggies were fresh and nicely seasoned. The Decadent Chocolate Cake was delicious, but I felt the Chocolate Terrine could have been less chilled...kind of difficult to get the full effect of chocolate mousse if the temperature is not right. I also tasted the rum cheesecake, which was good.  I started this review with four stars, then took one away as I realized that my dining experience there was good but not stellar .  P.S. for those who have children and like to frequent steakhouses, we saw an infant at one of the tables. Another peculiar observation - the majority of people were really dressed down - shorts, tank tops, jeans etc. Not quite what I expected.
