I had dinner with my wife at the India House a couple of times. In both occasions the experience has been wonderful. We don't know much about Indian food but always willing to try different cuisines. The food we have tried tastes like heaven, the service is excellent and although a little pricey, the taste of the bread and the bunch of healthy options makes it all worth a try! I would recommend to buy a coupon at http://Restaurant.com to decrease the amount of the bill. The alcoholic drinks are not the highlight of the restaurant so you can skip those too.
