Great food! I've been there twice in the past two months and will be going back next week. Love the salad bar and the Lobster Bisque is just unbeatable. The beef ribs are my favorite. The only things that are missing are shrimps and oysters. If they have these two more food I'll be going there at least every couple weeks.
