I love this place! Not only is the food awesome but the staff does a great job! We hosted a rehearsal dinner party in July for our son and fiance and the staff did a fantastic job. The Wine room worked beautifully for the party and we had access to the whole upper floor. Mary Catherine and Stephanie handled all our arrangements exactly as I asked including a wonderful custom menu card with the couples names and picture. The whole event was wonderful! Thank you!!!!
