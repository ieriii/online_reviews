I am a homebrewer and a former brewery intern. I can attest that Revolution makes some of the most solid beers I have ever had. Everything from the session beer Workingman Mild (like eating a handmade loaf of fresh whole grain bread) to the more powerful Anti-Hero IPA (tastes like the smell in the air after a long afternoon of landscaping) to the innovative special releases (not always winners, but always interesting and worth trying--these guys know how to make beer. And the food, atmosphere and Mug Club perks are just gravy. Awesome!
