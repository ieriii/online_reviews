My wife, 14 year old stepson and I just had dinner at Demera and we were raving about it the whole way home. We had the sambussa sampler and family style messob and even though we were all hungry when we arrived, we took home enough leftovers for another meal for all three of us (we didn't even have dessert!). Friendly service with helpful recommendations (it was our first time there), very reasonable prices, delicious food - we look forward to returning!
