I am extremely disappointed that I only just found Bonsoiree. I guess I should appreciate the fact that I had a chance to experience it before Beverly Kim and Johnny Clark take over August 24th. But I almost wish I hadn't because that way I wouldn't know what I would be missing! Ignorance is bliss some times. Bonsoiree was one of the more enjoyable dinning experiences I've had in Chicago and ranks as one of the better Michelin Star restaurants. The service, food presentations, flavors, and innovative dishes were superb. On Sunday's, chef Shin Thompson picks up fresh local ingredients from the market and presents a 4 or 7 course meal. The 7 course, BYOB, for $75 is one of the best values in the city! There is no menu, just sit back and enjoy one artistic, flavorful dish after another. Beverly Kim has a big shoe to fill. I myself, will follow chef Shin Thompson on his new adventure in the west loop!
