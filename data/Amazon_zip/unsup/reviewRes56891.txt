One of my most favorite restaurants in the city of Chicago - not to mention the most amazing maitre d', Monisour Raphael. My family has been going here for years. It's a luncheon staple with the girls, and always a romantic dinner with my husband. Best French Vietnamese south of Argyle St.Consistent with a wonderful ambiance and flavors to die for.
