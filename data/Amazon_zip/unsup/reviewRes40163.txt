Landed here on a random Tuesday for an impromptu dinner with a friend. I had no idea what to expect walking in and was surprised at how crowded it was at 9 PM...though I suppose they are open until 4am every day, which in and of itself baffles me. The service here is no frills order your meats, they show up with a table full of tiny bowls full of everything from pickled veggies, to unflavored gelatin, to processed potato salad, oh and don't forget the tiny dried fish (the only one I didn't try), along with a huge plate of meat, rice, and soup. I liked everything i tried, especially the marinated short rib mixed with some of the spicy side dishes. In addition to everything else there was a plate with a bunch of lettue leaves banded together, I am still unclear of the proper use of these, we tried making lettuce wraps but that didn't work out so well so they remain a mystery. Prices were a little higher than I expected though with everything that is included, and the presumed costs of running such an establishment, they weren't out of line. The one thing I was still left wondering is that they much have a massive fire pit full of hot coals in back somewhere, because the demand seems to be nonstop, and it is a quite large place. All in all if you like meat and pickled things, as I do, this is an experience worth having.
