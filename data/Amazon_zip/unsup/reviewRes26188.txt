I went to this restaurant per recommendations from friends and also the ratings from people on Yelp.  I got the seafood fried egg rolls and the beef pho #30. First off the food is just plain not good. Any Vietnamese restaurant worth anything should be able to make a decent pho with beef in it. It's like the chicken terriyaki of japanese or the kung pao chicken of chinese. The flavor was so watered down that you could barely taste anything. The portions were minimal, and they did not even provide basil with the herbs. The price is cheap compared to other restaurants, but not other Vietnamese restaurants who would give you better and more for less than the $6.50. It may be my elitist Californian attitude, but Asian food in Chicago is just terrible. Eggrolls were also fried for too long and semi black on the shelling. If you want Vietnamese food you might as well take a gamble with one of the restaurants in V-town instead of coming here.
