All the amenities without the price. Found a great deal on http://hotels.com at about a 25% discount to the surrounding hotels in the area. Pool, hot tub, new treadmills, free hot breakfast (waffles!), LCD tv's and free wi-fi jussssst to name a few. I called ahead and they were fine with me checking in early (9AM). Free luggage closet service if you decide you want to book an evening flight. No hassles, great service. Just a few blocks from the Willis tower (formerly Sears tower)... one block from the Brown, Orange, Purple, Pink Metro. This is very new hotel, highly recommended.
