I have been to Brazzaz a few times now, including recently as part of a friend's bachelor party. Brazzaz is a fun venue to go with a large group and they accommodate groups well (definitely make a reservation though). While the price tag is a bit heft (about $50 per/person for the food; it is a fixed price and then all you can eat), you do receive a lot for your money. The meal starts with an elaborate salad bar with all sorts of fun options such as raw oysters (the cocktail sauce is really good), ceviche salad, sushi rolls, various salamis and some really good cheese and much more. Be careful not to fill up though as Brazaz is all about the meat. You have a little disc (it looks like a casino chip) and you put it on one side if you want the waiters to bring you meat, one side if you are all set for the time being. Every couple of minutes a waiter comes by carrying a cut of meat, each waiter carrying something different (i.e. filet mignon, sausage, flank steak, grilled shrimp, chicken, pork etc.). There are also a couple of non-meat dishes such as roasted pineapple and fried bananas. The freshly baked mini popovers they place on your table were extremely tasty. The food is not top quality, but is pretty good and it is plentiful. Our primary server (Laura) was very friendly and attentive. There is a full bar, decent wine list and lots of good looking desserts if you somehow manage to save room.  If you are looking for a feast, love meat and want a festive atmosphere Brazzaz is a great choice.
