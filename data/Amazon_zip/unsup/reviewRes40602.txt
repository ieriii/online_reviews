The greeter is awesome, the service is great, and the food is fantastic. I decided to get the #93, which has bean sprouts, basil, pig's heel, pig's blood, and noodles. Such an insane combination of flavors that the host thought I wouldn't like! I proved you wrong sir. And though, the menu says it's spicy, it's not. A little Sriracha and we're all good. Mango bubble tea is a must. Ambiance isn't that great, but the delicious food makes up for it. My girlfriend got the #83 and loved it as well. She liked my food more than hers! Overall, a pleasant experience. We splurged and got everything for around $30. We had leftovers that heated well. Definitely would recommend.
