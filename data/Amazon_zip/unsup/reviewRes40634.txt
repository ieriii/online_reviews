I have been dying to try this place out and it did not disappoint. You know a place is good when every single time you drive past it there is a ridiculous crowd. The only thing that really annoyed me was the 250+ ITEMS ON THE MENU! Seriously, is that necessary! Can EVERY single thing on the menu be amazing? Probably not. Wish they would hone in on a few items within each category or a few categories. Just personal pref.... Shrimp Spring Rolls - Yum, but other places have mint and it could've used that freshness. Small personal pref :) Marinated Beef Banh Mi - RIDIC! Best one I've had. The spices on the beef were out of this world. Vietnamese Beef Stew - If you want something richer than the traditional Pho this is the way to go. Thick hearty pieces of beef and tendon (I LOVE TENDON!). Love those egg noodles, too. Papaya Bubble Tea - Yes please! Right up there with Joy Yee's in terms of bubble quality and they use fresh fruit! This place is schooling the rest of Vietnamese town. I see little reason to hit up the other places!
