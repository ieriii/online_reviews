Delicious food at a great price. Plus it's BYOB and across the street from a nice wine shop. Irazu is hardly a vegetarian restaurant, but it's very veggy and vegan friendly, which is a rare but appreciated combination in Chicago. The oat shake was really refreshing, and my burrito was among the best I've had. Their jalapenos are extra spicy (a plus for me) but also have a great flavor. The owner, Henry, also said they're considering having a brown rice option, so encourage him to go for it, if you'd like that.
