I've been here numerous times, and love this place. Most of their food is great, a little pricey, but great tasting none the less. The churros aren't the best, but the salted caramel bacon ice cream was absolutely delicious. The major problem with this restaurant is the ordering/waiting system. I expect to wait when dining at Xoco, but the last couple times I have been there, it was basically a cluster f*ck of people. No one knew where the lines were or where they should wait. Employees kept coming along and moving lines without regard to who was there first and obviously without communicating with each other. The process might work a little more smoothly if there was a person assigned to keeping order at the door instead of whoever happens to walk by. I would return to this restaurant if I could catch it without a line going out the door.
