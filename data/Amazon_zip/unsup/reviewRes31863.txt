I'm a vegetarian who brings any and all visitors to this place, carnivores or no. That said, I went with a friend on Friday morning. We got there around 10:30 to find it closed, with no phone number or hours on the storefront. That kind of sucked. Sure, we should have checked before we left, but some information would have been nice. We walked around until eleven, when we assumed it opened. We were right. Of course I love the food. The spiced black beans are my favorite side, and I ate a good portion of my friend's breakfast bowl, which he ordered totally vegan. It was delicious. My one complaint is that sometimes they skimp on what goes into their sandwiches. I ordered the Monte Cristo once and it consisted of the French toast and a teensy bit of the fake ham. Boooo. I have to say, service was kind of slow for as few diners as there were in the restaurant. That's typical, but generally they're packed, so it makes sense then. Our waiter was a little pushy on the appetizers and dessert too. I'll obviously be back, but I wanted to throw my two cents in there with the hundreds of other reviews :)
