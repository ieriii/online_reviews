Love this place for lunch! I love meat and this place is considered heaven to me. Lunch is only $20 all you can eat salad bar and meat! The meat is very good and flavorful. The salad bar looks pretty good but I don't know for sure since I never eat from the salad bar. The veggies and pasta looks fresh. The only thing i get from the salad bar is the white rice. I love red meat and rice! The wait staff and gauchos are very attentive. They come by often and if you request a particular cut they will run in back and get it for you. I usually bring clients here for lunch and they all love it! Parking here isn't available unless you want to pay for the valet or parking lot. That's the only drawback for me.
