While my stay at the Dana Hotel and Spa started with a very helpful and witty valet, it has ended as the strangest hotel experience of my life - and I travel often. It started to go downhill when we realized that we had to pass through a "V.I.P." rope to get to our "V.I.P." elevator. I'm not sure if people are just that hungry for fame, or if we just didn't understand how popular we were... but it was completely unnecessary and total overkill. While the service can be confused with politeness, its completely fake and unauthentic. Being chased down a hallway to thank me for my business for the third time is simply not necessary. This hotel is very cool as a structure, but the human beings that run it are incompetent, groveling fools.
