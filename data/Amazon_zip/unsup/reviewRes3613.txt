I haven't had a chance to try the Korean side of the menu yet, even though I love bibimbop, because the fried chicken is SO GOOD. I eat a lot of fried chicken, and this is hands down my favorite -- very light and crispy and I love the way they chop up the bigger pieces so you're never stuck with a giant hunk of meat. I like the Plain Jane and my wife loves the Seoul Sassy sauce. For sides, I really like the People's Greens, which is a selection of cold, cooked vegetables like you'd have on bibimbop. The fries are fine, but nothing to write home about. The onion rings are also good -- on the smallish and thinnish side.
