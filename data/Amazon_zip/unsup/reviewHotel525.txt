I recently threw a Bachelorette party here renting a king suite and a joining double room. The suite was perfect for the preparty doing gifts and things. I had about 16 people there and there was plenty of room. The staff was great, very accomodating. The location was awesome and the hotel offers free wireless AND free breakfast. The breakfast was much more then continential.
