Well, first of all i'm a thai. My standard for thai food is high. I went there for my friend's BD. i love the fact that it's a BYOB place, and located right next to a liquor store. A lot of people who work there are Thai which made me hope that food will be really authentic. However, i was fairly disappointed when i sneak peek dishes of other tables. Food were really americanized.. curry dishes look really white 'coz they were soaked with coconut milk !! We ordered quite a few dishes. My favorite one is Mhu Ping (pork on skewers). It was really good, and authentic. We ordered Panang, and green curry which i couldn't recognize its thai form. Pad Thai was disappointing. it was all in pale white, rice noodle with bean sprouts and chicken. The taste was not awful but it was more like Chinese stir fry. Overall for the whole meal, the taste was not bad; just that it was not Thai. By the way, it was really cheap though.. we order 6-7 dishes, lots of thai ice tea, and desserts.. it costed us about $18 per person, including 20% tips i think.. it was a deal!!
