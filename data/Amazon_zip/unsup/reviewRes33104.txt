stumbled into this gem after visiting the museum campus peninsula. It's at a convenient location, with a bright and cheery atmosphere. I had their skillet breakfast with turkey/asparagus/mushrooms and a poached egg on top. This is more than enough for one person, delicious tasty meal. Service was prompt and friendly, and a few of the staff members even came by to recommend me their favorite local haunts seeing that I wasn't a local. They also have quite an extensive menu for vegetarians too. Would definitely come back when I'm in town!
