Let's just say the Hopleaf is hopping!  They were really crowded when I strolled in here last night at 9pm for a nightcap. I saw, thanks to Caitlin G.'s review, that their April special is Bell's Cherry Stout, and what better way to end a beautiful day than with spring in a glass? For those of you who don't know me, I'm a huge fan of Bell's. It all started for me when I had a six pack of their Oberon and because I like those hoppy beers so much, I tried their Hop Slam and boy was that good too! So, when I saw that Hopleaf had Bell's Cherry Stout on special, and that we're running out of days in April, I decided to take the trek over here to give myself a special treat. I'm sure glad I did!  The atmosphere is great. I really liked their posters of old school alcohol advertisements they have hanging on the back wall. I also loved the fact that there isn't a TV in sight and the music is turned down low, so that you can actually have a real conversation at a normal decibel level. These are mega pluses in my book because there is nothing more annoying than trying to have a conversation with someone who is trying to watch the game. It doesn't work. Thanks Hopleaf for making your establishment a casual place where a conversation can be held without distractions.  Just so you know, if it wasn't for the 45 minute wait, I probably would of stayed and had a late night snack, but I will be back some future night for that, no doubt!
