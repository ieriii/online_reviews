So here's how a restaurant does it right and redeems itself. I went last night for dinner with a large group with a 7:30 reservation. When we got there, they were ready to seat us right away. We asked if it was a round table and they said it wasn't but that they could accommodate us. Less than 10 minutes later we were seated at a round table. Our adorable waitress Mandy came over to get our drink order. I asked for something special that they don't make. Mandy and the bartender totally took care of me and made me my perfect drink.  For dinner I ordered the skirt steak and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon medallion trio and we were going to share. The medallions were good but my steak was luke warm and had a piece of something not so good running through it. Mandy and the manager came over, apologized and said they would bring me a new one. The second steak came back piping hot but raw. Again, Mandy and the manager came over apologizing for the mistake and offered to bring me a third steak. By this time, I'm over it. Everyone else had pretty much eaten their dinner and I did have half of the medallions.  Here's were the redemption comes in. Not only did they not charge me for my dinner, they didn't charge my friend for her filet medallions or the salad we had as an appetizer. The bottom line for other restaurants to take a lesson from...even after you've had a not so good experience with the food, if a restaurant can make you walk out with a good feeling, they know how to do it right. I will definitely be going back...just might not order the skirt steak!
