So overrated. Bad art. Cheap decor. Lame music... But mainly, the sushi just wasn't that good. The Aisan-fusion theme seemed interesting at first, but the sushi presentation was a little sloppy, they left out some of the best sushi ingredients on the menu (No Ikura?? No uni???) and everything was drenched in way too much sauce. All that said, Sushi X has mostly great reviews from other patrons. It's probably a good bet if you enjoy overly-Americanized cuisine and a late 90's ambiance. Definitely wouldn't recommend it if you know what good sushi is.
