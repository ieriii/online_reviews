I am so picky when I eat Chinese food and finding good Chinese seems to be so hard in this city....but this place has great BBQ chicken and duck. The scallion and ginger dipping sauce is fantastic and really send the slow roast meat over the top. You come here for the food only.....the decor is classically cheesy and laden with formica and fluorescent lighting...but its the food that counts in terms of what you would come here for. I had a group of chefs that I led on a tour of the city who wanted to experience BBQ in Chicago ad I took them here and they loved it....and they were from Texas which adds some credibility.
