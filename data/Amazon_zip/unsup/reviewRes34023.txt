I've been on a Mediterranean kick lately and tried a few other venues (I Dream of Falafel and Taza--both downtown), and both pale in comparison to Sultan's. I've written reviews on the other two if you want to check them out. For me Sultan's is the epitome of great Mediterranean food. Whenever I've gone the place is always packed--people lined up around the fresh salad bar (a vegetarian's dream come true). But I am NOT a veggie--I go for the chicken schwerma platter with extra falafel every time. In fact, the last time I went the guys working there were making fresh falafel--it was so neat to see the bright green color of the chickpeas and the manner in which they toss the little balls into the grease (is that grease?). You'd think they'd do it with an ice cream scoop-type contraption, but in reality it looks more like a wax seal press like you'd see in the Tudors. Back to the food--their hummus is drinkable and they have a little stand on the side where you can load your dishes up with as much tahini as you want. And let's be honest, who doesn't want more tahini!? I highly recommend adding a falafel or two to your order--in my opinion theirs are the best in the city. When it comes to dessert, while I've yet to try it, I've heard rave reviews about the baklava. One drawback, which clearly didn't affect my review, is that it's cash only.
