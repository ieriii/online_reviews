I'd give the Publican 3.5 stars. We headed there for a Sunday brunch without reservations and the wait was probably 5 minutes tops, but we got there when they opened, mind you. The wait was definitely alot longer as the morning went on so reservations are definitely recommended. I ordered a mimosa to drink and it was alright. Wasn't amazing. Oh and they serve Intelligentsia coffee if anyone's a fan. One of the fave's of the morning was definitely their pecan sticky bun - soo soft and gooey. Yum! Other things we had: Wine poached eggs with proscuitto - kinda their version of an eggs benedict. I could actually taste the wine in the eggs. it was pretty good and...mmm...who doesn't love prosciutto?! They actually give you a good amount which was surprising. Arctic char with seeded bagel - the smoked arctic char was delicious! Kinda like lox so you can't miss with that. Soft Scrambled Eggs and Bone Marrow - Definitely something to see. It's an interesting taste. But it got a little too rich so definitely dip it with your bread, not really for eating by itself. My friend couldn't finish it because it tasted just like fat to her... Quiche - probably something we could have skipped. Soo greasy that I could barely taste it. A bit soggy too. Will definitely be back to try the other stuff.
