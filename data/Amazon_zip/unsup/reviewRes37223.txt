I came back here on a Wednesday night for a dinner date.  Getting seated was no problem. It only took us 15 minutes. During our wait, we ordered a couple drinks from the bar. We were seated at 8:40pm... We put in an order pretty quickly. We ordered "mussels for one" (w/ the spicy Thai curry), a side order of Macaroni-n-Stilton Cheese, a Duck Reuben sammich, and a Toasted Nueske Ham sammich. The mussels came out in a timely manner. I took a fork full of what I thought were shredded veggies surrounding the mussels. Bad move. I found myself chewing on ginger. STRAIGHT UP GINGER. I played it off and just ate it. The mussels were good, and so was the curry broth. The two pieces of bread that came with it were hard as rocks. Hard enough to break windows. 10pm... Why are we still waiting for our dinner? You'd think making two sandwiches would be pretty quick. WRONG. And what about our mac'n'cheese? They forgot about us. The waiter asks us if everything is ok. I let him know we are waiting on our food. 10:15pm... The sandwiches come out. They were tasty. Nothing to rave about. Our mac'n cheese came out a few minutes later. It tasted like it needed a dash of salt. Our waiter apologized for the delay. I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend night trying to have dinner. I think there were ten busboys and one waiter. At least our table was always clean.
