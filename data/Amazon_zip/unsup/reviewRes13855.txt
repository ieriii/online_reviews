Paid a visit here recently on a Friday night and the details of the dinner special had changed. The previous $12.95 cost for lunch/early dinner is now $14.95, and the hours have been shortened from 11:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Also, as early as 5:30 p.m., at least on a Friday or Saturday, reservations are recommended. Our waiter that evening, Roy, was really exceptional. And the food, as ever, deliciously and carefully prepared. But if you want to have the "Catch of the Day" special for dinner, you need to do your best Florida Senior citizen thing, and arrive by 4:30 p.m.
