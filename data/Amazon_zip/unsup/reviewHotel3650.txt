Staying the night in this classic hotel was an enjoyable experience. The executive suite had a cold and uninviting decor. It reminded me of a place where the mafia gang would meet to plan their *business*. However, the suite was HUGE. OMG, this thing had like 3 connected rooms. The view of the city was blah....looking into the windows of the highrise across the street. BUT the BED....OMG. I want that bed in my home. SO why does this place get 4 stars?....well, mainly cuz I have always wanted to stay here so now when I drive south on LSD I look up at this magnificent structure and think "Yup I've stayed there." This place has history and class. Whatever my experience here was....it was still an enjoyable one.
