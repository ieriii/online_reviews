The Hard Rock Hotel was among my top three choices after researching over 60 potential wedding venues in Chicago. However, after the treatment I received while trying to see the space, it is crossed off my list and I would not recommend the hotel for any other purposes. I had exchanged emails with both the Direct of Group Sales & Catering, as well as the Wedding Specialist, and had an appointment to meet the Wedding Specialist and see the space last week. Unfortunately, I was stood up. I arrived 5 minutes early for the appointment and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes until giving up and leaving. The very nice Concierge did her best to try to track down the Wedding Specialist to no avail. After 30 minutes of waiting, another employee physically went to find her and came back to say, sorry she's in a tasting. I'm not sure if she was double booked (she confirmed my appointment the night before) or if the previous appointment ran over, but there's no reason she couldn't have sent word to the lobby with her apologies and/or asked someone else to show me the space. What's even worse is that 9 days later, I have yet to hear from her with an explanation, much less an apology. I also contacted the Direct of Group Sales & Catering explaining my disappointment 7 days ago and have not heard from her either. If this is the way they treat people during the sales process for a pricey event, I'd hate to see how they treat people who are already under contract.
