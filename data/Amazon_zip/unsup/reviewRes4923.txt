I'll add to the 588 reviews. Me + The Purple Pig = Very unimpressed. We won't be back.  We sat at the bar. We had three bartenders helping us.  The first one forgot one of our orders. That was fine...$9 less than we had to spend. Wine selection was great...beer selection was lacking. $19 for 3 pieces of cheese was a bit expensive. Proscuitto balls tasted like fried mozzerella sticks. Didn't get to taste the pork shoulder - that was forgotten.  In all honesty - as a Chicagoan, I feel this place is a tourist trap. The tasting room is so much nicer and less expensive. It's like this place is frequented by people who go to http://travelchannel.com and this is a recommendation. And the music in there, sucks. Didn't know I was in Wrigleyville after a Cubs game at a lame-o dive bar.  I wouldn't reco this place to anyone.
