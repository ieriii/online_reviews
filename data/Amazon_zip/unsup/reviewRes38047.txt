Good stuff. Long wait as expected. About 1.5 hours. Drank some great beer and had good convo while waiting so not terrible. Dining room was way nicer than having to sit in the bar area to eat. Ordered mussels, Stuffed Pheasant Thigh and the Walleye. We split the mussels four ways as an appetizer and it was a perfect amount (we got oysters for one) The pheasant thigh came in four pieces which also worked out great. Mussels came with fries which were good.  My walleye was superb. Cooked perfectly with a crispy skin to it. The celery root puree was great. I've never had anything quite like it and it worked so well with the dish. The consistency was super cool and it had a great flavor. I loved my dish.  Make sure to ask for some extra bread with the mussels to soak up some of the goodness of the mussel juices.  My buddy had Orval as his dinner beer and it was very very good. I recommend it, very different. I've never had anything quite like it. I was also happy to see that it was bottled only a month ago.
