My husband and I were in Chicago tonight (we drove in from Lake Geneva, WI) and thought it would be a great evening to use our Groupon for Las Tablas. The restaurant was pretty empty at around 6 pm on a Thursday night. When we got to the hostess stand, we noticed a sign that said that all Groupon customers must have a reservation. I asked the hostess if we could make a reservation for later in the evening and her response was "well, I can make it for another day." The restaurant was empty!!! I can sort of understand that if it were a Friday or Saturday evening, but absolutely not during a weekday. I triple checked my printed Groupon as well as the actual Groupon website where the coupon was posted and nothing was mentioned about this ridiculous requirement. If they are going to make their own rules, then they should at least have the decency to have it written on their coupon. Bad business. Period.
