Great Beer, Great Food, Great Service! My fiance and I went here the Monday after Christmas 2010 in the late afternoon. They we not expecting to be busy, so a bit under staff (probably didn't think so many people would come out on a Monday around 3pm). My server gave us a heads up that things might be a little bit longer than normal since they weren't expecting a large crowd. I was very happy to hear the server let us know what was going on--communication! Beers and food did not take as long as we thought they would. Both were great! So good....we went back on Wednesday for dinner! And again in the future!
