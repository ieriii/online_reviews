I can't say enough good things about this place! Went here with a group of 8 and had a wonderful waitress who was extremely knowledgeable about the food and the wine. It's small plates kind of place so come ready to share. Can't Miss Dishes: Ricotta and Honey Comb Pizza della Fattoria Cacio e Pepe Make sure you come early because the wait time can be atrocious on the weekends. They do no accept reservations.
