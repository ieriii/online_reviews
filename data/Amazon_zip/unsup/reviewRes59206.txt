I went with some friends a few days ago here on a busy Friday evening. My mood was slightly depressed but when I entered Sun Wah, my mood began to get uplifted.The service was not that good but the atmosphere was lively. Not enough wait staff at all ! I'm not a big fan of Chinese food and mainly went for the duck. We ordered a few side dished which were nothing spectacular at all...the duck however was Delicious !!!! The next time I go back there I will be ordering 2 ducks and nothing else but a side of rice. Best DUCK I EVER HAD :) so i forgive the crappy service
