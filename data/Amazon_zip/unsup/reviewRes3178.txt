My brother saw a review of this place on the Food Network. So we were heading up to Chicago to buy some stuff and decided to try this place out for lunch. Outstanding!!! Some of the best chicken that I have had in my life. They had a Crisp Chicken combo special going that consist of a whole chicken with 2 sauces, 2 small sides and 2 drinks for $19.99. Being raise to look for bargains, this seem like the way to go. We picked the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ sauce. Awesome!!! Our sides were fries and onion rings. Neither portion was small. The rings were good. The fries, I could have passed on those, but the Allison Sauce on the table made them more palatable. I think that when we go back and if the combo is in play, I will order the Marty's Magic Mushroom or more rings. The chicken was cooked to perfection, not dry, very juicy. They only use hormone free chicken and they don't use chickens that have been stored frozen. There isn't much seating in the place. So if you are bringing a large group, think again. Take out might be the way to go for a large group. Definitely recommend this place. Can't wait to go back!
