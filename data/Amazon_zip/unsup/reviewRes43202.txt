Very cute cafe with fresh ingredients and tasty food! We got there on a warm Sunday morning, and the place was packed. You wait in line (we probably waited around 30 minutes), place your order, and then wait for a table again. We ordered the huevos rancheros, lox and bagel, and special egg empanadas. Everything was good, but nothing was great. The huevos rancheros were baked in a casserole dish, and while creative, I got bored of the blurred flavors after multiple bites. The lox tasted fresh, and it was overall an enjoyable experience. However, with all of the great breakfast places in Chicago, I will not be running back!
