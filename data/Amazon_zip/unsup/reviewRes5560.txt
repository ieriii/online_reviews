Purple Pig has a surprisingly varied menu given its name, which is great for vegetarians. I've tried nearly all the non-meat options (including fish/shellfish) and while they are universally tasty, they are also very heavy. You can't really find anything healthy on the menu - even the salads have copious amounts of salt poured on them. The cheese plates are great (love a good cheese plate!), and the eggplant and goat cheese smear is incredible. I also loved the sepia, which is cuttlefish - I'd never tried it before, but it was delightful. The wine selection is great, and the service is also fantastic. I just wish they'd have a little lighter fare, for when one is not in the mood to eat an entire stick of butter in one sitting.
