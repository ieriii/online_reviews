In the battle of New York vs. Chicago, New York definitely wins in my opinion. Obviously Giordano's has garnered many, many favorable reviews; enough so that this was place that people recommended we try our first deep dish pizza. If you're reading reviews and trying to decide whether or not to eat here, please do not read my review alone. The good: this place runs like a well-oiled machine. It's absolutely amazing to sit at the bar and watch the precision of the ordering process, the kneading of the dough, and the accuracy of throwing a crust across the kitchen and having it land on a shelf. The guy never missed that shelf. Crazy...  The bad: it's just too much damn pizza. We ordered the smallest pizza and were only able to consume 2 slices. It's a LOT of cheese. I mean, a LOT. Too much cheese. The sauce is OK. The crust? Not so much.  Chicago in November is fucking cold. It's grey and miserable. If I lived in Chicago I would eat this pizza. I would eat all that cheese and store up fat like a bear. I would sit in the restaurant and eat the whole pizza so I wouldn't have to step foot outside again and endure the misery. And maybe that is why Chicago pizza is what it is.
