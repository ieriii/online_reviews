First of all: I am not a vegetarian; I came here during Lent when I had made the unfortunate decision to give up all meat. But on the whole, I like my meat and did not have high expectations for this place. However. It won me over. I still think it's a little overhyped, and the lines out the door on weeknights are just sort of silly (and for that reason, I don't anticipate going back a lot), but the food and the beer selection were both impressive. I had a sweet potato quesadilla that just got better and better with every bite (it was weird -- like the exact opposite of General Tso's chicken from a subpar Chinese takeout place). My boyfriend had a pretty basic garden salad that looked neither impressive nor disappointing. We both got a very tasty IPA to drink (or two...actually...). Good dinner on the whole. To finish up, after reading the Yelp reviews, we decided to get the vegan peanut butter cookie dough milkshake. And Yelpers, you were NOT wrong. Usually when something gets such rave reviews on here, I end up being disappointed because my expectations were so high, but this milkshake was not one of those things. My very carnivorous boyfriend was super skeptical to try it, but he actually ended up fighting me for the last of it. It was stupid delicious. He's even raved about it to friends of ours, which (trust me) he does not do too often. So. Get the peanut butter cookie dough milkshake. A million Yelpers are not wrong. Bottom line -- two non-vegetarians enjoyed their meals here quite a lot. The lines out the door and the hype are a little annoying, but this place is definitely worth a try (especially if you can make it at an off-peak time).
