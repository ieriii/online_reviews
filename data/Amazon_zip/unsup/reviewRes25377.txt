HYPE! HYPE! HYPE! HYPE! I sometimes worry that my obsessive reading of Yelp reviews will make it so that I'm never pleasantly surprised about anything again. Luckily, that was not the case at Geja's. There are so many things one imagines when you read "dark velvety cavernous lair of love" but are you ever really prepared? No. I mean, yes- it's small, it's dark, it's quaint, there is a mandolin player. But you have to experience it yourself to really appreciate the intimate atmosphere. As many have said, service was attentive and helpful. As many have said, go for a booth if possible. But please, for all of ours sake, if you're a couple- don't sit on the same side of the booth. It's gross. We get it , you're in love. Give each other some space. You're going to poke an eye out with a skewer. So, take that special person to Gaja's for a romantic evening. It really is all you can imagine, in a good way. Just sit on the other side of the table from each other. C'mon, people.
