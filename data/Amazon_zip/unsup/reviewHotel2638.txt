Me? An A-list celeb? That's how I felt when I stayed at the James. From the doorman greeting you to finding a cookie on your bed, these small details make you feel special and at home. The hotel is small but has everything you need, including a great location only steps away from terrific restaurants and excellent shopping on Michigan Av. As for the accommodations, my room included a king size bed, a bar, living room area, 2 flat screen tvs, 2 iPod stations/radios, and a gorgeous bathroom. The James strikes a unique balance between modern function and artsy aesthetic that made my stay feel unique and personal. It's a great choice for business travel, a romantic getaway, or a weekend to explore the city.
