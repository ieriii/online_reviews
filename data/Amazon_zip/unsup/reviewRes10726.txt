I still really love this place. Great blend of atmosphere, pizza and home-brewed suds. Dysfunction'Ale is tasting very smooth these days, and the white pizza always is a nice complement to a traditional red. I suggest alternating slices- maybe even bites. But, on a trip here recently I was told that they don't serve pizza-servers, or spatulas. Now, I lived outside the country for the last year, but this is a party foul that I would have remembered. My server made me feel like a dope when I asked for one. Is this a new policy?
