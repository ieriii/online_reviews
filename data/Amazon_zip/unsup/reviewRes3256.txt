For a fried chicken place, they have a LOT of vegetable bowls. After you've had their famous wings and other assorted fried goodness, check out the Korean menu items - they are delicious! They're also an interesting twist on some flavors that you might not be as familiar with, if your Asian food experience is mostly of the Chinese-Thai-Japanese variety. Definitely worth several return trips. Plus one of the employees looks just like Peggy from "Mad Men."
