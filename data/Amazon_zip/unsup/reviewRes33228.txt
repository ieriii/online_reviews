Meh, overated, I heard great things about their french toast so I had to try it. But it was just a normal piece of thin sourdough with too little custard soaked into the bread. I also tried their signature eggs benedict and that was good, nice creamy holandaise, poached egg was a little rough around the edges but the yolk was perfectly runny. The canadian bacon was cut weird thicker on one side making for uneven salty to creamy to bread ratio in some areas. The english muffin was fresh and moist, that was a real plus. I was also disappointed when there was no mimosa or other breakfast cocktails, can't call yourself a proper brunch place. Overall I was not impressed, and definitely would not want to wait 45 min+ in order to eat here.
