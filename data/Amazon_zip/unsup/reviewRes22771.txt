From the boards on http://chow.com and http://lthforum.com, we ventured to Lao Sze Chuan last night to try what people have been calling "Chicken Crack" otherwise known on the menu as Tony's Chicken With Three Chili. The dish was everything everyone said it would be, sweet, savory and spicy. Delicious. It was also very greasy but that's okay. Looking through the menu was like perusing a high school yearbook. The hardcover menu has over 800 items and very, very overwhelming but that's okay. I thought the misspellings were funny - Carlic Chicken, Noosles. When you sit down, they bring you a small appetizer of spicy cabbage. If you can't stand the heat, don't try this. We consider ourselves lovers of all things hot but even the free cabbage was almost too much for us to eat. We finished it anyway with a lot of water. Along with the Crack, we had Spicy Noodle with Beef and the Chengdu Dumplings as the appetizer. The jus that came with the dumplings was so good, I drenched my rice in it. The dumplings, crack and noosles came to $26, not bad. When we asked them to doggy bag our left overs, we asked to take the left over rice as well. The waiter said he would give us fresh rice instead, nice touch. I might go back today to get another fix.
