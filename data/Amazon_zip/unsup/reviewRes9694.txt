Bar far one of the BEST meals I have ever eaten! I love FOOD. OK so I am a Dale fan but really the food, flavors, presentation, wines were fantastic! Took a few colleagues here who knew nothing about Top Chef and they raved about the food. As one of my colleagues put it...it was UFB, un-"freeking" believable! Ok so that was the sensored version of UFB but you can sense the enthusiasm about the food.  Yes so the menu reads weird and you have to ask the server questions. So what..that's what makes dining here so much fun. The unpredicatbility yet amazing sofistication of the food is unmatched! My mouth waters to come back here!! I would fly there just for the weekend to eat here again! Great job Dale and the rest of the team!  Incredible!
