If there ever was a boutique sushi take away, Sushi X would be it. The first thing you'll immediately notice is the amount of attention paid to their packaging. They have their own specially designed carry out plastic bag, box stickers, chopsticks, flyer menu and business card (see pictures).  Being a bit OCD in my personal time and taking great pleasure in putting stuff away in neat containers, I found it refreshing to find a place that shares my love of organization as each roll was carefully tucked away in a container that looked like it could withstand the harshest of delivery routes (again, see the pictures). Yes, this is very clever, I hear you say, but as a customer, it gives me great satisfaction when I take away food and the restaurant asks me how many people will be partaking in the meal and then making sure the same amount of utensils are not only included but carefully packaged away for me to enjoy and use. Call me a sucker but small things like that carry a lot of weight for me. The food is outstanding. The rolls are decently sized if not a tad on the big size but that's forgivable considering the price you're paying which is a tad on the expensive side. The ingredients are plentiful and they do not cut any corners in the construction of their rolls. This is definitely a place where both quality and quantity are served.
