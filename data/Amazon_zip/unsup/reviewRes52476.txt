I expected to be disappointed in this place since it is in the same building as a hotel and is close to the business district, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was not difficult to get a reservation. Service was so pleasant, a bit formal, and very responsive. If the servers don't bring the meat you want, you can let your server know what you're waiting for, and he/she will go have it brought to you. The interior is beautiful, dark wood, very white tablecloths, dim lighting, and clean and elegant surroundings. I would not recommend jeans or shorts or flip flops. It's casual-dressy. Great place for a date! Every time I've been there, there were a lot of large groups, so I think it's a good place to go even if you have a lot of people. I think the soundproofing is pretty good, because I did not think it was unusually loud. There appeared to be a lot of business customers and tourist/hotel customers, but it did not seem like a big deal. The food was really terrific. I love the salad bar. Although smaller than the salad bar at Fogo de Chao, they had really terrific offerings. Oysters, asparagus, shrimp, risotto, artichokes - everything is very fresh and very tasty. I could just eat only at the salad bar and be happy. The meats were terrific. My favorite were the bacon-wrapped chicken, the parmesan encrusted pork, and the filet mignon. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. A bit pricey but on par with Fogo de Chao. Brazzaz has a terrific lunch special. A very nice pick for a downtown dinner. You should check RedEye and those neighborhood coupon mailings for a $25 coupon card.
