We arrived for our pre-theatre reservation on a Saturday night and the place hopping! We were seated immediately, in a quiet section at the back, so away from all the action at the bar, which was nice. The servers were efficient and knowledgable. I especially liked that there was a sommelier on hand to talk about any of the booze and wine, even the by the glass wines. The food knocked me out - honestly, if I had known had great this place was I would have been here a long time ago. My partner started with the chicken soup with big noodles - it was delicious - not as good as my dad's - but what is?? Chock full of chicken and veggies and parpadelle noodes - yum...i started with a couple of diver scallops, sauteed and garnished with tangerine, glazed nuts, garlic...it was sublime. Dinner was the gage burger with fries for my partner - he loved it - i had the vindaloo mussels - omg - heaven on earth - the mussels were mostly plump and the sauce gave a kick, but was mellow and comforting - really, the best mussel dish i ever had. No room for desert!! For sure next time, coz there were alot of tempting options. We'll be right back thank you very much:)
