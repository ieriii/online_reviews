I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars - I'd like to go with a 3.5.  Came here with my man a week or so ago after passing by the restaurant several times (and noticing it being pretty busy) - it looks cute, usually has a good crowd, so we tried it. I made a res. but didn't end up needing it; we arrived early and had no problem getting a table. We sat outside in their lovely patio area (recommend the outdoor seating here!) started with two mojitos (pretty good, though a little weak for an 8 or 9 dollar cocktail) and their bland bread basket (we both thought chips/salsa or more festive bread would have been more appropriate than this very blah bread).  I ordered a chicken meal with beans, rice & plantains, and an odd addition of green beans (I love green beans, but that really didn't fit this dish at all); He ordered a steak dish where half the plate was beans (he wasn't happy about that), rice and plantains. The food was good, but for the price ($15-19) I would have expected more: flavor, pizazz, quantity? Something!.. Particularly the beans/rice - there was no extra flavor here - tasted like someone mixed white rice with a can of black beans -- nothing more. The chicken had nice flavor, some seasoning, but nothing else really was anything special.  We both love 90 Miles - and the whole time, I couldn't help but think how much better 90's food and prices are!  We had great service from the time we walked in to getting our bill. Everyone was on top of things, but overall, I was a little disappointed with the flavor of the food (and the strength of the drinks), for the high menu prices.
