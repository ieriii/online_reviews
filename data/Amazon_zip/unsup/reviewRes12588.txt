I lucked out and work right across the street from my favorite cuisine. I have only been to cafe 28 once, but it was really good. I ordered the bistec a la cubana to share and I'm glad I did. The portion was so big...4 meals worth.  Their maduras (sweet plaintains) were great. As were the rice/beans and steak... so yummy.  However, I was dissapointed in the Tostones. I love tostones... my Puerto Rican friend got me hooked. I make them myself from time to time, but they are messy and difficult. I thought this would be my new easy way out. But they were very rubbery and not salted. I am convinced that I just got a bad batch. I am going back soon and will order them again. Until then 3 stars....
