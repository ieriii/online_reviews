If you've already tried authentic Korean BBQ with charcoal pits, then just know this is truly one of them:) No electric grills, real charcoal right in the middle of the table. If you haven't tried it yet, you really should! The smokey BBQ really adds flavor to thin strips of beef, bacon, or whatever you choose. It's a totally different experience you can only get with Korean BBQ (at least as far as I've seen). On top of that, you get an entire table full of different sides that are all pretty top notch. Coming from Minneapolis we have tons of great restaurants but nothing that compares if you're looking for Korean food. I'd recommend this to locals and out-of-towners alike.
