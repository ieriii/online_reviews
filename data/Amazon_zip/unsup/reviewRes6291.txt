Wildfire is dependable, like the Lettuce Entertainment Restaurants usually are. The food is always good and the atmosphere is relaxing. Because it is always crowded, it can be loud and hard to hold an intimate conversation. The appetizers and drinks (wine tasting) are killer while waiting in the bar to be seated in the dining area. All the times I've been here have been with a group of people, not romantic dinner for two, so from that experience, Wildfire works perfectly. I have had some insane friends who like to complain the food wasn't done just right and send things back to the kitchen (not just once but three times), and the staff here does a wonderful job being polite and accomodating when I wouldn't have been myself.
