Super good! I have been here twice in the 5 months I've lived in Chicago. I'm a sucker for a place with small plates and good wine. I highly recommend the Greek Cabernet. Who knew? And the non-fried calamari (I can't recall the name) is so interesting and so tasty. Great place for 2. Be prepared for a wait, even early on a Sunday evening. Worth the wait. This place is a must try!
