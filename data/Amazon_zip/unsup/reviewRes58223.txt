Savory salads? I think not. The menu description was misleading and disappointing, to say the least. I made the outstanding choice to order the Caesar Caesar. The fresh parmesan turned out to be the powder-y kind that comes from a green can and the 'savory garlic croutons' were crumbs that came in a foil packet (I'm not exaggerating either; I had to tear from the perforation on the corner to open the packet!). The tofu that I added was the consistency of runny, undercooked eggs. After one bite, I pushed it aside. At least the super strips of chicken my six year old ordered were good.
