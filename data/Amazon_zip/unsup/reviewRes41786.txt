A friend came in from the western suburbs and we were going to go to Agami, but with our luck, it was closed for lunch. WTF! this is the second time this has happened to me when trying to go here for sushi. Well it worked in our favor. We walked over to Tank Noodle because it is one of those places, people talk about, and you pass by it all the time, but you never get the chance to actually go in. They have a giant menu of Pho, but we opted towards a more solid meal to prepare us for the extensive drinking that was about to partake. I cant remember what the name of what we ordered was (menu item number eighty-something???), but I can describe it as pure joy and wonderful-ness. It was a bowl with steamed vermicelli, mixed greens, onions, bean sprouts,minced garlic, and thin slices of grilled pork. Holy cow. This was so damn good. The ingredients were really fresh, the meat was super flavorful, and the bill was only $17 for two people. The service time was short, but trying to flag down our waitress to get the check was the only down side. But really I can't blame her because this place was packed. I guess I'm not the only person who loves this place.
