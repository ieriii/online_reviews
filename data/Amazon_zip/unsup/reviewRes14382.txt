Just went to this place with my friend today, at the suggestion of another friend who said it was fantastic. It was true. Soooo cute, and very neighborhood-y - perfect spot for breakfast/lunch. The staff is personable but professional. The whole place had a really home-y feel. I actually chose to have breakfast - these wonderful red-hot cinnamon pancakes (actual candy red-hots in the batter!). You must try them! Tasty tasty! Those were so unique and sweet. A perfect pick-me-up to my day. My friend had a spinach salad that was enormous and fresh. I really want to go back for the all the fresh seafood they have for dinner options. They even have an all-you-can-eat crableg night, and I actually can't wait to try that. You can't trust just any place to prepare good crablegs - but based on what i saw, it seems to be a specialty there - and I'd definitely trust them. Overall I was quite impressed and will be back in a pinch to try my next dish at Glenn's.
