I'm not sure what crack these other reviewers are smoking, but Mayan Palace is not worth four or five stars. I went here with some friends who were VERY hungry. We were a little bummed we couldn't smoke outside, but we sat out on the patio anyway. The service seemed very nice, I will give them that. Kim and I ordered some tasty margaritas (which she downed in like five minutes!) Those were pretty good--no complaints there. The chips and salsa were fine, but the salsa was a little spicy for my taste buds. I decided to take a chance on the veggie enchiladas. What a disaster! Okay, so it wasn't THAT bad, but I was quite disappointed in the canned mushrooms. Who in the hell uses canned effing mushrooms??!! Seriously! I guess everyone else had good food. THEN...the check took forever! We sat there for at least 15-25 minutes. Also, when we took a little bathroom break, my friend said it seemed as though they were talking about us. WTF? We were good little patrons, nothing but polite. So, enter at your own risk, I guess.
