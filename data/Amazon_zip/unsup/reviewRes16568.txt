This place is very nice! First off, its completely hidden. Its basically hidden in what looks like a wall covered in graffiti. When you go in, you wait in a curtained room until you can get seated. When you finally go inside you will see two big candle lit rooms. There are chairs that have huge backs with them around small square tables. This is a very intimate setting, perfect for a nice date! High class! We sat at the bar and I enjoyed listening to what our bartender had to say, he was very knowledgeable and nice. I had a rum cocktail called the Hush & Wonder and I enjoyed it. The slight hints of grapefruit were a plus for me. All cocktails are $12 I would highly recommend coming here with a small group of friends to chill with nice drinks or on a nice date!
