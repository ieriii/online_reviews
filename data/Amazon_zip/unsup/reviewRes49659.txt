Stopped here fo a light dinner on a recent trip to Chicago. We ended up trying a flight of South American wines (Argentina with a bit of Chile- I think it was called), a flight of cheese and a flatbead pizza. I really really enoyed the wine and cheese. Each wine had a unique taste that changed with each type of cheese. It was wonderful experience for someone who enjoys the complex falvors in wine/cheese and wants to play with different tastes. It was not a place to go if you are starving. Actually, we loved the wine so much we went back a few hours later for another glass and ended up tryin more cheese too. The staff was really friendly (but it seems everyone in Chicago is that way). I only wish they had a list with the actualy names of the wines. Sure you can buy it there (listed by bin #), but I wanted a name so that I could try to find it at home.
