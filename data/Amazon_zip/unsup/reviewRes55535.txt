I think the Bongo Room deserves a 5 star review based on the food but because it's a breakfast place that doesn't open until 9am I had to go with 4 stars. Having a child, I need to beat the morning rush for breakfast in Chicago which means eating very early. Aside from that one small complaint, the breakfast at the Bongo Room is by ffar the best in the city. A staple on the menu is the breakfast burrito but don't overlook the amazing pancakes which changes flavors with teh seasons.
