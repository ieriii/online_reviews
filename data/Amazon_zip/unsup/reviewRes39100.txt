I've been to San Soo Gab San three or four times, and it's decent Korean food. My friend, who is a native from Seoul, and I agreed the kalbi is fine. I found them to have a better variety of banchan (small side dishes) but not all were tasty. The first time I came here, we thought it was known for its unmarinated kalbi but we found it underwhelming; Definitely steer clear of it and get the marinated kalbi. Side notes: Service is very functional and utilitarian compared to American standards, so don't come expecting super attentive wait staff. Also, because it is a grill-your-own-meal place, your clothes will pick up the smell of smoke.
