Best food in the land ! My wife and I went for the third time and have yet to be served a dish that is anything short of spectacular. My only complaint is that our server, Daniel, had zero personality and it seemed as if we may have even been bothering him by just being there.The only way I knew his name was from looking at our check to see his name printed on it as he made sure not to introduce himself but merely said, what do you want to drink ?, what do you want to eat ? and Anything else or the check?'. There is a reason this place has a huge wait,(it's not Daniel), and its worth every minute to do so. Food and wine here is amazing and wont wipe out your wallet either.
