SO GOOD. I just had my first Art of Pizza experience tonight and even though the pie arrived to my door about 45 minutes later than they told me it would be, my review and rating will not be swayed!! I decided on the "pan pizza" because I didn't want everything that a stuffed pizza would give me, but I wanted a little more than a thin crust. Um. WOW? 12" pan pizza is HUGE! Totally the size of a medium deep dish from Giordanos (and about $10 cheaper too). AND FREE SODA! I had no idea this was part of the deal as well! I don't drink soda anymore, but it was free and so I decided to be bad. Just this once. ;) Awesome. I will totally be revisiting this establishment for my pizza needs again and again.
