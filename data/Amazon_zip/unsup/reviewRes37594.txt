Quite frankly their recent catering "effort" for a summer party was a disgrace. We ordered appetizers from 3 caterers - Fox, Goddess and Wholefoods. Fox's dish was the most expensive and by far the worst. Whatever happens, do not order the duck confit on the sweet potato chips. We ordered "Four Dozen". I expected a tray of sweet potato chips holding a soupcon of duck confit. I received - a tub of chopped duck confit that resembled dog food. It tasted good but numerous guests commented first on whether it was for them or our pooch. Accompanying this was a plastic tub of sweet potato chips that had simply been emptied from a pack of Terra off the shelf. Main issue - how do you get 4 doz from this and the majority of the chips were completely unsuitable to hold any duck confit. Quite frankly an absolute farce. I have heard great things about Fox on the chicago grapevine and this was my first experience with them. I will never buy anything from there ever again. Fox is now a four letter word in our household. Wholefoods catering is cheaper and blew them away. The experience is compounded by the 2 calls that we have put into them with no response. Final comments - Fox and Obel you are a complete disgrace!
