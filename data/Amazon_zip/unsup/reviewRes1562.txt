I ordered the Smoked Gouda, Apple-Chicken-Sausage, and a side of Chili Cheese Fries. All that and a soda for only $10! Super awesome choices for hot dogs. They have a special odd meet up each week like Rattle Snake and fry items in duck fat on some days. You gotta love this place. it's an excellent landmark that everyone should visit when they come to Chicago. The only downside is the line to get in is always no less than a city block long. :)
