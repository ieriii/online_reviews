Definite 5 star restaurant and one of the best we've experienced. This was for our first wedding anniversary, and I happened to have After leaving our car to the valet, we were greeted by a couple of hosts and led to the dining room after passing the lounge which looked pretty nice. The decor was very minimalistic and modern, with long curtains covering the long windows in the east side of the dining room. The restaurant was very spacious, so I thought they may only need half the space for this business. The maitre d' was a young asian lady, who was very nice and kind. It was great that we didn't have to order the tasting menu for the entire table.  So what we did was that I ordered the 3 course menu, and they brought an empty plate when only my wife got the dish.  I don't have time to break down the whole menu, but it was great. Especially the ones I remember are the rabbit entree, and duck consomme. From amuse bouche to petit 4, everything was marvelous (the only dish that disappointed me was the rubarb dessert). They then printed out the menu with our names for us, which was great. So they know how to treat people in special occasions. Lastly, I just wanted to talk about some funny stuff about this restaurant. I think the owner must have some kinda ocpd like personality because I think they pay attention to too much detail. For example, for every dish, servers stand by the customers and serve the dishes at the same millisecond. They also serve the dish from left side, then take the empty dish from the right side. There is a designated starting point for all the servers where, when they come out from the kitchen, they pause for a second, then proceed to wherever they are assigned. I thought that was a bit funny.
