My first experience at piccolo sogno was nothing spectacular, I was actually really disappointed. I returned last night for restaurant week and decided to give it another shot. I was blown away by the food. The service I have to say needs improvement, our reservations were for 7:30 and we were finally seated at 8:00pm. After having to wait a half an hour to be seated, all I wanted was a glass of wine. Our waiter took another another 20 min just to bring the menus and another 10min to bring the wine... The service was pretty frustrating, that is why I am not giving 5 stars. Now for the positive feedback, I ordered the green and white paglia e fieno con vitello.. which was a handmade pasta, very similar to a fettuccine in a light veal meat sauce!! all I have to say is WOW!! it was so fresh and delicate, exactly how good Italian food is meant to be... For dessert I split the Hazel nut cake with hazel gelato and candied hazel nuts!! YUM. I also really liked the decor and I will definitely return this summer to sit outside and enjoy fresh food in their gorgeous patio!
