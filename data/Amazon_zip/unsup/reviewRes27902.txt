Authentic Mexican Joint--In biz since 1968--Not many can say that.. One of the busier restaurants I've seen in a awhile, VERY Cheap!! Yes, the floor is greasy? Who Gives a shit? For the amount of food that Kitchen is turning out it's to be expected! Line was OUT THE DOOR, but moves very fast/majority of people eating there were Mexican if that tells you anything!! Peppers/Carrots,Chips/Salsa to start... Forget the salsa! Carrots were good... Had the Tacos De Sabinas and they were EXCELLENT! Very Flavorful and Authentic...Flour Tortillas were to die for! The little App they bring beforehand was quite good as well, not sure what it was though.... Highly Recc'd and it's a BYOB with no corkage fee or any of that Bullshit!! Get There-No disappointment at this JOINT!! Oh, and ya I liked the OLD SCHOOL Mexican Waitress'!!!
