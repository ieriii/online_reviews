We passed Glenn's a couple of months ago and the chalkboards in the window definitely caught our eyes. Since then we've been trying to find an excuse to make it over there again. Thankfully, Glenn's did not let us down. We both debated for quite a while until finally settling on some specials on the chalkboards. Both dishes were great. We had some scallops for an appetizer, which were tasty but a bit overpriced for the small portion. The place was definitely crowded, but super accommodating. I'd love to try some of the non-fish dishes sometime soon. Probably a bit more expensive and out of the way for a weekly occurrence, but we'll make sure to hit it up again soon.
