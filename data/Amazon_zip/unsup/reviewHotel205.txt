Okay, this is a toughie... because the hotel itself was pretty nice, and definitely a convenient location, pool/hot tub/sauna, comfy beds... the problem really came to the service. The rooms were not cleaned until late afternoon/early evening. Not really a problem, just later than I'm used to, and really we only needed some necessities replaced. However, towels were not replaced (even after calling to ask for new ones). Toilet paper was not stocked (we assumed there'd be some somewhere in the room if they didn't replace the empty roll... we were wrong). When we asked for a mini fridge to be brought up to the room, we were told it wouldn't be a problem. It never came and we had to call 3 times before it was finally brought up to the room. We waited nearly 30 min for valet to bring around the car after being told it would be 15 min... normally I'm patient, but when given an expected wait time, I tend to count that it's accurate. It only made things worse when we were completely ignored while we were waiting. It would have made things slightly better it some one would have at least come up to say 'we apologize for the wait.' (One last side note on the cleaning, on the last day there, on doing a final check of the room to make sure everyone had their things, I discovered a random shoe of unknown origin... just one... who knows how long it had been there). Overall, it's a nice hotel, and -very- convenient. Just be prepared for repeated calls to get what you want.
