The duck is sensational and the empanadas are arguably the best appetizer in the city.  The only dish I've had that wasn't excellent was the ropa vieja, which was far stringier than it should have been. I don't like the bizarro butter, but most others seem to like it. The service is a bit on the slow side, but not too bad. I was once feted with a surprise birthday party here, and the staff was helpful in the orchestration of said party. (I was fooled.) I don't even try to go here on a weekend, however, since it is packed. I took my girlfriend here once for a special occasion and the wait was 45 minutes or so. Try it on a weeknight!
