I will have to review this place again when I go there for a full meal and a couple of drinks. We went here after having a full dinner prior, so I was stuffed. We wanted to sit in a booth so ended up having to order more food... we got a cheese plate and of course, the bacon popcorn. The cheese plate wasn't much. I felt it was a little skimpy and I think I only tried half of a slice anyhow. I like the idea and the flavor of the bacon popcorn but the popcorn itself didn't seem fresh and crunchy. I did enjoy one of the brews... I think it was a light one. The atmosphere was open and fun. Would definitely like to go back for a few beers and actually eat some food.
