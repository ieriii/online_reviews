Word on the street is that this place gets packed up to the gills during prime weekend brunch hours. Add it to my list of "places to brunch when I have a weekday off." Cuz I hates to waits. My lady friends and I hit it up on a weekday...no wait. Perfect. Hot, delicious coffee with real cream started the meal off right. The menu is huge, you won't have any trouble finding your perfect breakfast item. Follow that up with an omelette with figs, goat cheese and pancetta. Honestly, I could have done with HALF the figs and more goat cheese and pancetta. It was delicious, but the proportions were a smidge off. We also shared a carrot-apple-celery juice (I think) and it was delicious. I really did feel healthier after I imbibed. Maybe. Bonus points for having English muffins as a toast option. Prices are on point with a brunch joint. Definitely more expensive than your local diner. Service was friendly and efficient. I would definitely come back. But only without a wait.
