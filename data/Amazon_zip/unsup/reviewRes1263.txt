Found this place on Yelp while visiting Chicago for Lollapalooza. Had to travel forever and a half to get there and then wait in line for about another hour to get in.... ....but it is definitely good! I'm big on uniqueness (as evident by my previous reviews) and this place is no exception. Where else can you get a Guiness soaked sausage topped with goodness? How about Ostrich? Check Duck? Check. Jamaican Jerky? Check. The wait was worth it and I think this is a must for everyone visiting Chicago.  Whoever said don't get the Duck Fat Fries is on something! These are awesome!
