The Beer is amazing, lots of wine selections too. The food is pretty awesome, had the steak frites and the little lady had a spinach salad. Dessert was absolutely beautiful, flourless orange cake and the mousse. We both did have a bit of a stomach issue afterwards, not sure what it was but I don't want to seem like hopleaf doesn't rock, lol.
