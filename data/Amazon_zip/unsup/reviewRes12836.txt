While I can imagine that dinner must be to-die-for, I was more concerned with getting the most mileage out of my $40 groupon and finding the most vegetarian options I could, so brunch it was - and what a brunch it was! The bloody mary had a nice kick, the plantains were roasted to perfections the tamales and eggs were oh-so-much-more than I dreamed they would be. The room was only semi-crowded on a Saturday at 11, so maybe that's why the service was so good, but for whatever reason it was good. I'll save that fifth star for my second trip because I will most certainly be back.
