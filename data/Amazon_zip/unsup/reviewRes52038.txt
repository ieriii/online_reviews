This is definitely a place that rests on it laurels at the expense of the restaurant's product and experience. The Chicago deep dish pizza takes roughly an hour to bake. Completely understand this fact as it is an extremely thick dish but that doesn't mean you can completely ignore the table you're waiting on until the pizza is ready. I had to walk up to the kitchen to get a refill of my water. Ordered a Caesar salad to stave off the hungry as we waited for the pizza but it was completely underwhelming and watered-down. The salad really and truly felt like it belonged at the Rain Forest Cafe or some other tourist trap. The pizza is good but not phenomenal and definitely not good enough to ship home for the holidays as several signs implored me to do. In my opinion, this Gino's East caters to one-time tourist visitors.
