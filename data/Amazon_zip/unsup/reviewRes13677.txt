I must update my last five star review of Glenn's to another five star review. Seriously. This place is amazing. I can't speak for the food on their regular menu. I can speak for the food on their blackboards. My husband and I took his parents there for Father's Day. We had blue crabcakesas an appetizer. Amazing. I'll have to order the entree portion next time I come here. There was another shrimp appetizer, which everyone seemed to enjoy, but I don't eat shrimp.  We had four different entrees: *Jerk-spiced marlin served with a coconut-pineapple-rum sauce - the sauce was served on the side and was to be used to cut the jerk spice. I LOVED the jerk-spice. It gave my mouth a nice burn without setting my taste buds on fire. I used the sauce very sparingly. It was good though. I would definitely order this again. *My husband got the rainbow trout which he enjoyed quite a bit. I'm not a fan of trout. His plate was clean post-meal. My mother-in-law had the Arctic char. I had never had it before. It was very much like salmon in taste and consistency. It was served with a spicy shrimp diablo sauce with shrimp. She said this was delicious. My father-in-law wanted the scallops that I raved about from last time I was here. He ordered them and, sadly, they had run out. So he ordered a black & blue steak which was covered in blue cheese and tomatoes. Oh man, the flavor of that steak was amazing. And it was cooked perfectly bloody - medium rare.  We then ordered and shared the brownie pie (warm with vanilla ice cream) and maple pecan pie (warm with ice cream). None of us could shovel these desserts in fast enough. I preferred the brownie as it was a little crunch on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside - the way a brownie should be.  I've still got to get here for brunch. I must try their bloody mary.  Love, love, love this place.
