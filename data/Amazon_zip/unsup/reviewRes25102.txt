I've heard the complaints - it's too dark, it's too cramped, you come out smelling like oil, etc... I think if you go into Geja's knowing what to expect you will have a blast. I've been dozens of times over the last ten years and have nothing but good things to say about the place. The service has always been impeccable, the food is consistently delicious and the music - oh, the music. A few things to think about if you're going. First, make a reservation. For real. The last time I called they didn't accept Friday/Saturday reservations after a certain time (7?) so just avoid it on weekends if you can. When was the last time you went on a Thursday night date? Second, request a booth. This will solve any overcrowding problems. Yes, the regular tables are close together but I have never had any problem ignoring (or making friends with!) my neighbors. Once I learned that you could request a booth I have never had a problem. They can't always honor it, of course, and you may have to wait a few extra minutes but the space and privacy are worth it. Third, you will smell like oil when you leave. There's simply no getting around it. To be honest, though, I've never understood this problem. Your date smells like oil too - what's the issue? Embrace it. It's not a foul smell, and it reminds me of Geja's the next day when I do laundry. Mmm. Finally, enjoy the music. The guitarists have always been happy to chat with us on their breaks, and they are phenomenally talented. They're interesting folks, and finding out about their backgrounds and training always makes listening to them more enjoyable. One last point: you will leave STUFFED. The prices may seem a bit high depending on your budget, but it's worth it. Every bite is heaven.
