Oh how I miss you Wakamono. :( The fish is fresh, fresh, fresh! So good. Rolls are good too. Love the Godzilla, Oedipus, Peter Parker, and Sweet Potato rolls! I really like the cucumber in your water and the miso soup here as well. Love both the outdoor streetside patio and the indoor with the wood everywhere for seating also. I can't wait to be reunited with you someday soon, sigh....
