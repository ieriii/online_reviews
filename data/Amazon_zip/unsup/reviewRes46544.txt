This is the first lettuce entertain you restaurant. It didn't remind me of a typical LEY restaurant but it sure was crowded! I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and there was over a half hour wait. Seriously!? My party and I went to the bar to grab a beer while we waiting. RJ's has very little waiting room so people sat their asses down at the bar and they were not drinking anything. WTF? How is this acceptable? A party was called to be seated and we stole their seat at the bar. This place is kind of a vintage time warp. There is a big TV over the bar, but the TV is from 1982. I haven't seen an "old school" TV in a bar in a long time. There is also a wall of ladies from the 70s and 80s. We asked our waitress and she said those are waitresses that used to work at RJ Grunts. That was kind of a neat touch. RJ Grunts is known for their amazing salad bar. Since it is very small and crowded in this restaurant, I obtained form the salad bar. I wish I would have got up and at least taken a look at it. I settled on the pulled pork and it was pretty tasty! RJ Grunts serves "cottage fries" with their sandwiches and they are very good! The other 2 people in my party had hamburgers and they really liked them. The service is very friendly here and the food is pretty decent. I will probably make it back one day to try that salad bar. It looks simply amazing! If you do come here, expect a wait and the place will be filled with kids and strollers... just saying.
