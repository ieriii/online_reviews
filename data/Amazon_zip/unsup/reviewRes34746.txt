Many, many moons ago a boy took me on a date here. And while I didn't love the atmosphere for a date I did remember the sushi being very good, but with so many sushi restaurants to try in Chicago this one fell off my radar. That is until tonight (about 5 years later) when my fiance and I were looking for a good sushi restaurant to deliver and I came across many raving yelp reviews. I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach tonight because I ordered a seaweed salad, double stacker, caterpillar roll, honey roll, and the buddha. Way too much sushi...we only ate about half of it and it's a very rare occasion that we leave any sushi on our plates. The double stacker was my favorite and the caterpillar was a close second. I liked the honey roll as well, but could have done without the buddha. It's just vegetables and while it may be a perfect choice for all you vegetarians out there....show me the raw fish! Definitely will be ordering from Sushi X again in the near future (especially if the delivery is always this fast...they were here within 20 minutes!) and after reading that it's BYOB I plan on dining in very soon as well!
