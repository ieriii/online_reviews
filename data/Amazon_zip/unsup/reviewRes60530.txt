The food is amazing, and the atmosphere is warm and cosy- even though it's a large restaurant! Everything I've had there is absolutely delicious and their Saturday and Sunday brunch is amazing. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the service is a bit slow. We had to wait over 15 minutes for an omelette which I thought was a bit long, especially since our server never came back to check on us to see if we needed more drinks, etc. It took just as long to get our bill after our meal. If you aren't in a hurry then I would highly recommend Wilde.
