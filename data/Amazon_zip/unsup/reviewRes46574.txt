The drink menu attracted us to go inside. It's a mix of family place (like an upscale Sizzler) and a sports bar...sounds weird, I know. It must be popular because it was packed. We were taken to the booth near the back...so we walked by the famous salad bar and it did look good and very tempting. It was snack time so we got the chili (just ok) and the extra spicy buffalo wings (raw slices of jalapeno pepper sprinkled on top of the wings - huh???). The root beer float (black cow) was pretty good, as was my cold one. The best part about the place was the music - it was rocking with some 70's music! The worst part is one tiny little stall for a restaurant that size.
