As far as thin crust goes this is top notch!  Everytime I've gone there is a wait of about an hour but it never really takes that whole time. After a few Golden Arm beers I don't notice anyway. I love their brews, and I love trying new combos of pizzas. Really it all comes down to the crust and theirs is delicious. Definitely a Wicker Park scene, so make sure to whip out your black rimmed fashion glasses and chucks.
