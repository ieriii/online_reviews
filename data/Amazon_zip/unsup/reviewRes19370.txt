Came here with a group of 5 for a sloshy Saturday night dinner. We called on Thursday for a res and they were already booked, so we had to go the Patrick Bateman-unapproved route with no reservation. The wait wound up being epic (over 1.5 hours), but that is to be expected for a swanky establishment at peak dining hours on a Saturday. Plus Map Room is 2 blocks away, so we didn't have much of a problem with this at all. Service was prompt and attentive. All of the rolls were fresh and interestingly presented - the crunchy spicy tuna with avocado was my personal favorite, served with all the pieces stacked into a pyramid doused in panko. Very unique. The regular spicy tuna was also good, and even the kappa (cucumber and avocado), ordinarily mediocre, was delicious. Unfortunately for this review but fortunately for my life, last night was a sorry for partying moment for me, so I don't remember much more than that. I was almost certainly belligerent and was by no means the only one in the joint, so that's more points for Coast. The bill didn't hurt by any means (under $20 per person for a large amount of sushi). I'm definitely going to be back - this is definitely my new go-to for BYOB sushi. I'd advise making reservations ~1 week in advance to mitigate the wait. Highly recommend!
