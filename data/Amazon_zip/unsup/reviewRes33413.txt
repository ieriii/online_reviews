I have been here more than 20 times. It is always PACKED, loud, and happy. The food is 99% of the time great and often spectacular. They have had a few dishes (and the menu has been different almost every time, so when I get to repeat things I usually cherish it) that I would eat every day if I could. Things to watch for: the gnocchi in tomato basil sauce, the rigatoni bolognese, spinach ravioli, arugula and roasted cherry tomato flatbread, mushroom risotto, and the orechiette with sausage crumbles, roasted tomato herb broth and broccoli rabe. The food is REALLY fantastic, the desserts are all good (especially the flourless cake and the peanut butter torte). I usually get a glass of wine or two. Dr. L Reisling was my favorite over the summer. They typically have good Italian blends for a cheap glass fee. Another highlight: the bread. Which we eat entire loaves of before the food comes. I actually like their chaotic dining room. I have almost always gotten a decent table (often the one by the window) and the high rustic urban space is way better than the bland upstairs room. The perfect place for a carb coma. Lately they've been sketchy with seating reservations on time and it's annoying, but before that they were always fine. Definitely make one, though. This place gets crowded really quick for a good reason.
