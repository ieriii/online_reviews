This place was spectacular! Just hosted a bachelorette party, and not being from Chicago, had to go off of yelp reviews... As we pulled up, I have to say it wasn't in the cute chicago-esque neighborhoods that I expected, but once we got inside the team @ Sushi X completely wowed us! I had pre-ordered for 16 people, and we tried a bit over everything! The roll with bacon is my favorite! Although the spring-roll type rollups were delightful. Love the gyoza, and the tempura mushroom and green beans. So good! With it being BYOB, we had such a bang for our buck, and all of the people in my party were mucho impressed! I know Chicago has tons of BYOB sushi joints, but this one is definitely a winner! * Also, we brought in a cake for the table, and they were super cool with that! Thanks!
