I only went here once so I'm not sure if I can actually claim to "miss" this place, but I do! Hot Doug's is everything great about Chicago dining - quirky, fearlessly experimental, fresh quality ingredients, and the food is made with lots of love. And it's veg friendly! I love the pickle spear served in the standard hot dog. Ahh, Doug's. Totally coming here when I visit!
