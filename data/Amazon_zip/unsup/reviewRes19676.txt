I went here for a weekday lunch with some coworkers and had zero wait, the staff was great (not one but two owner/manager types stopped by to ask hour our meal was), the food was delicious and the portions were huge!  I got the beef brisket on brioche, topped with swiss cheese, arugula and apples...tasty and original -- a good combo. It's at a great location if you're near the Art Institute, Millennium Park or work downtown.
