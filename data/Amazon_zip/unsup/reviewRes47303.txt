They opened with some inconsistencies, but over the year they've tirelessly worked to iron out the kinks and have risen to near the top of my favorite burger places in the city. I've had several of their burgers, but my favorite by far is the This Is Sparta! Tangy feta, salty kalamata olives and sweet roasted peppers on top of a huge beefy patty cooked to my liking. I can get a salad on the side and pretend I'm healthy. Speaking of salads I've had a few of them on the menu, and all are delicious and can be customized to your order. Their wings are awesome as well. Light, crispy, not too much breading, meaty...just delicious. Drinks are slung fast and cheap, and they have a Foursquare special as well. Service is quick and usually with a smile. The manager will always come by and check in with us. It does get loud, but I love the music and the walls of TVs. Its always crowded, which is a good thing for Lockdown! All this and its walking distance from my home. I'm definitely a fan of the Lockdown.
