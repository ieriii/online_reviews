As a meat eater who can front it with vegetarians when she needs to, I think this place rocks.  I've had the seitan (which really needs a better name, by the way) fajitas about 10 times and they are just fabu. The smoothies are also great! Black bean soup is always a crowd pleaser. CAUTION: don't order the macrobiotic plate if you aren't hard core--it's a liiiiiitle extreme for my taste and was basically as if I had little piles of sawdust, dirt, and grass on my plate.
