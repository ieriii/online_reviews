Normally, I am more of a Chicago-style pizza guy, but this is by far my favorite thin crust pizza. The crust comes very crisp and nice.  Every pizza is very customizable, so there is something for everyone.  My 2 favorite pizza creations: 1) White pizza with tomatoes and artichoke hearts 2) Red pizza with sausage and banana peppers - they have the best banana peppers that I've ever had. They also serve their own beers. Almost all of their beers are very good, and they rotate the selections throughout the year. If you plan on coming here on any day after 7pm, be prepared to wait up to three hours depending on your group size. This place is outrageously popular and is always packed. Because there are so many people waiting to be seated, there are often people standing around you while you are eating if you end up sitting closer to the bar.  If waiting a long time to sit for pizza sounds terrible, they do offer take out, which I have taken advantage of a few times and have had no problems. I believe you can get their beer to go as well.
