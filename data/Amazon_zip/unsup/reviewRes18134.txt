I joined some friends here for a Groundhog Day dinner. The 5 of us met up with a few bottles of red wine. It had been years since I've been here and we were all anxious to try it again. The meal didn't disappoint. It was an amazing meal. It was a longer wait than I had anticipated to get a table. But I suppose it was 7 on a Saturday. Even with reservations some groups had to wait along with us. We waited so long that a member of our group drove to get some beer on Western & Lincoln and made it back before we were seated. Still it was worth the wait. The service was spotty because it was so busy but when you had the staff's attention you had their complete attention. We never felt rushed to leave the table. There were several groups there celebrating birthdays that gave it a very festive atmosphere. There were people waiting for tables throughout the meal. I had a very lovely risotto. It was the perfect texture. Everyone else at the table had one of their lovely specials. It was such a great time. It was all going well until we got our check. We were offended that they had added a gratuity to the bill. We were surprised that there wasn't a corkage fee. Was it supposed to make up for that? We would have tipped at least 20% for the service especially since it is a BYOB. I had to knock off a star for that. I think their service speaks for itself and if they don't have enough faith in that I don't know if I should. Are people usually bad tippers?
