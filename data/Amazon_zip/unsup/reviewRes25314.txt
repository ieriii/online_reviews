I really liked this place on account of a number of factors: 1 - I like the decor. It offers a modern atmosphere with out being pretentious. Its pretty laid back. 2 - All of the menu items have an eclectic mix of ingredients that exceed expectations. 3 - When I struggled in deciding between two desserts, the waitress surprised us with our second choice for free while we were eating our first. And it was even better than what we decided on. I tried: - Cana de cabra (queso) - very good - next time I want to try something a bit more adventurous, but it was good! - Bacon-wrapped lamb and cherry tomatoes (can't remember name, but it was under the traditional tapas) - Patatas Bravas - Mussels from the traditional tapas portion of the menu - this way by far one of my favorites! It was served with charred toast which actually accentuated the flavoring of the mussels. They were fantastic. - Toci no con ci dra :Slow-Cooked Pork Belly, Cider Glaze, Green Apples & Truffle - definitely my other favorite!! The dessert I loved was the Croquetas de Xocolata! This featured milk Chocolate Croquettes, Banana marshmallow, ROSEMARY CARAMEL, and Arbequina Olive Oil. I am obsessed with this Rosemary Caramel. Brilliant! I will return soon!
