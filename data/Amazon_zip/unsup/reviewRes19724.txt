Let me first say, I hate waiting in lines. Most restaurants are not worth a long wait, especially if the line is out the door and it's cold out. And that's why I've avoided Xoco till last night. That being said, the wait was worth it [that being 20-30 minutes and they even had a guy often asking if we were ok and if he could do anything for us]. The price was a wee bit high when I think about most "quick" Mexican food stands, but again, it was worth it [as you read on you'll understand]. It was about $35 for 2 hot chocolates, 2 sandwiches and churros. $17 apiece isn't bad, really, just a bit higher than I thought it'd be. I had the Cubana sandwich, which was tender and the sauce accompanying it - amazing. I am NOT a fan of sandwiches to start with, but it was entirely easy to eat [aside from huge pieces of avocado that slipped out, and let me tell you, I was not letting any of this torta get away] and a great sauce that I'm hoping Rick Bayless bottles. BF had the Wednesday special and that was also delicious - but in a completely different way, almost sweet and savory. Definitely delicious. The hot chocolates were intensely rich and delicious! I'd order them on the hottest day of summer and there are at least 7 varieties. The churros were different than I'm used to - no filling but a TON of sugar and cinnamon and chocolate bits. They were nice and nothing I'd complain about, but they're not the delicious ones I find in Pilsen! We want to go back... now. Huge fan, about to get bigger from daily Xoco stops...
