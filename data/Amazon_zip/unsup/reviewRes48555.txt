Nice place. Would love to come here with a group so we could sit at the fenced in booths. Since it was just my boyfriend and me, we were seated at the long communal table. It was fun sitting between people on blind dates and first dates. The restaurant gets pretty loud and you can easily listen/hear to conversations around you. The food was good, but nothing memorable. Maybe if i was an oyster fan I'd give the Publican a five, but I HATE oysters so I didn't try any. I did like the scallops, they were perfectly cooked. The farm chicken with summer sausage and fries were also tasty. But my favorite part of the meal was the cauliflower gratin with oh so yummy hamcrumbs! I'm still not really sure what hamcrumbs are, but they sure are tasty. Service was also good. Servers were knowledgeable in the food and very helpful with the drinks. They have a good selection of whiskeys and beer! I enjoyed my old fashion and sips of my boyfriend's beer.
