After securing a reservation months in advance, I dragged my family out into the snow for our first Frontera experience. Two nights before Christmas I expected a massive crowd, but the cold must have kept people home. Wusses! We were seated about 20 minutes after our reservation (no big), and the gastric fun began. Between six of us, we tried many menu items, and not a single one disappointed. The star of the show was the duck mole and the roasted suckling pig. What the hell is a suckling pig anyway? Delicious, that's what! The only thing standing in the way of a perfect rating was the service, which wasn't bad, but didn't have any sort of "wow" factor. Having never been there, I was looking for a little guidance and enthusiasm. Our server answered all our questions, but we could see we were kind of on our own. No one at the host desk for quite a while as I did my search for the restroom, and no one to say goodnight as we left. Clearly, the kitchen pays attention to the little things; now the front of the house needs to follow their example. Overall, fantastic food that will bring me back again.
