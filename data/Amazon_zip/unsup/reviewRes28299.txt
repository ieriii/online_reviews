This is an excellent, authentic Mexican place. I do my best to get there whenever I am in town. I think my favorite thing about NL is that it has a large and varied menu, which makes return visits a pleasure. The people watching is pretty amazing too, locals, foodie tourists and the CPD on dinner breaks. Don't forget to BYO. Try the queso chirozo, greasy, spicy and excellent!!
