Hands down, the best Mexican food for a restuarant of this category (I am not saying that the small joints all throughout the city are better or worse, they are just in a different class than Frontera Grill). The flavors are amazing, and never a disappointment. I can't recall each dish I have had here, but all have been as expected from Rick Bayless. Yes, there is always a wait on Friday/Saturday nights (if you don't get there early enough, they may not accept more walk-ins), but it is a sure-fire win and worth the wait if you live here or if you've got out of town guests.
