This should not reflect negatively on the staff as they are pleasant and attentive. My issue is with the hotel being rated as a four star hotel. The rooms are woefully small, the walls are thin and there are no tubs or water pressure in the showers. The Internet service is next to unusable, there is no pool and no hot tubs. The bar closes before midnight and there are no dressers in the room. Even the door hangars don't stay hung on the doors. Oh yeah, 1998 club music playing throughout the lobby and elevators.I'm all for an Eco friendly hotel, but not in place of luxury. Four star means posh, not green. On a good note, the Mattresses are comfortable an the rooms are clean. Don't expect to get a king size bed though.
