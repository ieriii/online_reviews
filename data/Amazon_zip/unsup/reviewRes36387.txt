I dined here a while back and vividly remember the wonderfully creative menu--half Thai, half Japanese. I ordered a maki roll and some sushi pieces which arrived beautifully plated, making it a feast for my eyes as well as my taste buds. The combination of taste, presentation and atmosphere make the dining price tag seem almost too reasonable. This is definitely on my try-again list. ---Update, July 2008--- I now live within a few blocks of Indie and it's one of our favorite neighborhood spots. Delicious food every time with a broad menu. You can bring pretty much anyone here--order a Thai noodle dish if they aren't into sushi. We often order a maki roll to share as an appetizer and then go Thai for a main dish. But is also great to just order a whole bunch of maki and sushi to share as a table. They've decorated nicely, but it's not too self-conscious at all. They're not trying to be anything they're not. Some of the seating isn't the most comfortable and they've got some wobbly tables. But it's easy to overlook.
