Great local rustic tavern-like atmosphere without feeling like a dive. Eclectic crowd, excellent beers, staff is accommodating - not overly pleasant, but usually fairly patient and knowledgeable. Tasty food - Steak Frites - yum. Beer is a little pricey, but its almost all imports or specialty beers and lots with higher % of alcohol, so I feel like I am still getting decent bang for my buck. Minus 1 star for always getting a little pushed around by the crowd and stinking like the bottom of a stale ashtray when I leave here. Its smoky, and usually crowded but worth it.
