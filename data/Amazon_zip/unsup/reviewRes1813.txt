What needs to be said about Hot Doug's? It is everything that you've heard; it's everything that you think it might be. Anthony Bourdain is absolutely right - Hot Doug's is one of the 13 places you have to eat before you die: http://www.menshealth.co I've been going to Hot Doug's for the past couple years. I try and go once a month. Check the website - it's a great resource. The flavors are amazing - the decor is amazing - and Doug's personality manning the cash register every Saturday morning makes this place a MUST GO if you are in Chicago.
