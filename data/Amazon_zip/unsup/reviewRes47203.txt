I met a couple friends here a week or so ago to have dinner and take advantage of the place's half price burger special. The place was not so great and definitely not my cup of tea. My friends and I had planned to sit outside for our meal. Although only one table outside was taken, I (being the first to arrive in my group) was shown to a small high top table outside. The door staff/guy who showed me to the table was not friendly at all. When my friends arrived, we asked to sit at a different table outside and were told we could not because there were only three of us. When we asked to sit inside, the unfriendly door man proceeded to show us to the table directly next to the front door. Finally, a waitstaff person was kind and showed us to a decent table further back in the restaurant. The restaurant had extremely loud heavy metal rock music playing the entire evening. My friends and I had to basically yell at each other to have a conversation. The only good thing about the evening was the burger which was actually very good, and the selection of beers available. Our server was kind but it just didn't make up for the first impression made by the door staff guy. I have no plans to return to this restaurant as I would rather spend my money where I am treated well and provided with good service.
