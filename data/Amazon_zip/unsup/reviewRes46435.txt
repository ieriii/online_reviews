we were fortunate to be staying across the street from the grand lux, and our concierge recommended we check this place out. i am so glad i brought my camera, because words alone can not describe how good it was. began with the kobe beef chili cheese dogs and followed with the italian beef sandwich w/ a side of mac 'n cheese (see pics). we followed with the beignets for dessert, which come highly recommended by pretty much 87% of chicagoans. perhaps it was the food coma i had already put myself in, or the recent news that KEN GRIFFEY JR. was dining there at the same time, i did not get a picture of our delicious dessert. i wanted to try everything on the menu, but i was able to only put a tiny scratch in to the glorious wonderment the grand lux offers on a daily basis.
