Everything about this place is warm and inviting. I didn't have time for dinner, so I had a few drinks while lounging on the dark tufted leather banquets. The Corpse Reviver was one of the best drinks I have ever had, citrusy layered flavor that really brings your palate to life. The drinks are made with care, so for anyone complaining about time realize that each drink is made with exceptional ingredients and is likely going to be like nothing you have had before. Five minutes isn't a lot to ask when they make your sour to order. The atmosphere is one of Gilt Bar's best qualities. The staff is a community. You can feel and see the pride, cooperation, and knowledge at work, from the bartender explaining what decade your next drink originated, to the charismatic cook running your next course, just because he can. The warm mix of modern fixtures and aged woods sets the perfect environment for just about any occasion.I will surely return, not only for the drinks and company, but if the scents wafting from the kitchen are any indicator of what is in store, I'm in.
