From he moment you get in and to the minute you leave, the service is incredibly friendly. Our waiter was very accommodating and patient. I started with the Sangria, which was a bit sweet for my taste, but still very good. The order of pork tacos was huge - I had to share it my my husband. The side of Spanish rice was the best I've ever had - sweet and tangy and cooked to perfection. But back to the tacos, they had a very generous amount of "pork", good mix of lettuce and shredded carrots, and the vegan sour-cream was to die-for. A think slice of avocado in each taco, completed this perfect entree. I also had a couple bites of my husband's Radical Rueben, which was way better than any real Rueben I've had in the past. It came with the most delicious sweet potato fries, which were crunchy enough, yet still moist and soft on the inside. We finished with a slice of Strawberry-Coconut pie and vegan whipped cream. First of all, the cream is unbelievable! The pie was very good as well, full of fat strawberries and only lightly coconutty. The crust was just hard enough without being touch and crumbled perfectly in my mouth. The atmosphere, the food, the service are of top quality and I will come back again and again. I've been here only yesterday and yet can't wait to come back!!! It's also a perfect spot for before or after an Indie flick at the Landmark Theater.
