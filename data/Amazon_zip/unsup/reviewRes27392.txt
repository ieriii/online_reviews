We had our first Pequod pizza tonight and it was above-average as far as taste and enjoyability, but it was definitely far from life-changing.  All this talk about a "caramelized" crust is completely bogus. I was expecting the entire crust to have some mind-altering, slightly-sweet, crunchy, buttery properties, but the only thing novel was the thin rim of burnt cheese along the upper edge -- the rest of the crust is pretty plain, bready and boring. Not sure why the bit of burnt cheese is so alluring to some, but we were definitely mystified by it. After some preliminary Yelp research, we opted for extra sauce to kind of correct the topping/crust ratio and the results were quite good. There's not a whole heck of a lot of cheese on the pizza (which is actually a good thing) so the extra sauce really helped to cut through the breadiness. Toppings were satisfying and liberally applied. Price was pretty standard for Chicago-style pizza in the city... $26+ for a large with three toppings. Pizza was ready at the promised time, and we picked it up piping hot.
