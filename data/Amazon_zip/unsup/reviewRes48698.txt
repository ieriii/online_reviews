This is my favorite place in Chicago. The food is unbelievable. The beer list is good. The pork belly is unbelievable. Decor: fine. Servers: fine. General staff: fine. Who cares about any of that stuff when presented with such incredible oysters and pork? My girlfriend and I spent 2 hours there. Had nine different dishes, including oysters, pork belly, frites with eggs, house pickles, ricotta, dessert and espresso. And two beers. All for less than 100. So so so good.
