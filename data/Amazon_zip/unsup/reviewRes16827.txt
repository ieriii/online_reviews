This is like nowhere else you have ever been. I went here on my birthday; it was a Wednesday night, so we did not have to wait for a table. I love everything about the Violet Hour: the "secret" entrance, the rules posted in the washroom (no reservations, no cosmopolitans, proper dress required, etc...) I had 2 delicious cocktails: The Riviera (Pineapple Infused Bombay, Lemon, Egg White, Campari) and another off-menu Absinthe drink. Both were suburb. The food offerings are quite good as well!  Walking out of the Violet Hour, back onto the street is a bit of a jolt: you feel like you are waking up from a dream.
