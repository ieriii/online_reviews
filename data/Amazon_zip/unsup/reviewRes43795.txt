My girlfriend and I visited Milk and Honey on a recent roadtrip from Nashville to Chicago. Honestly it was a delicious brunch on a Saturday morning. She got the orange brioche French toast, while I ordered the pankcakes. They were tasty, fresh, and worth every penny. If I can nitpick just a little there was a huge line, but it was Saturday, and their "table numbering" system was a little confusing. But definetly worth a visit.
