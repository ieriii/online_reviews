I love Piece. Pizza and beer are my faves! The place is huge so there is room for everyone that loves to go there - and lots of people love it. I don't like crowds but I was okay at Piece. Even the European style seating didn't bother me. The staff was really nice. I wish I could remember my waiter's name... he was super patient. I had a really hard time deciding what I wanted to order and he never once gave me attitude, which you can get in Wicker Park, let's be honest. I'll be going back for more, and more, and more!
