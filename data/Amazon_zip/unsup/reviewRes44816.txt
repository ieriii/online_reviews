My BF and I went after many people recommended it. We went at 3:30pm on a Saturday. We were told the wait was 1.5 hrs and to order the pizza after 30 min. So that's what we did. We got seated about an hour in, but had to wait another 30 min for the pizza. We were starving and so excited since so many people had raved about how amazing this pizza was. And then, we were super disappointed. The pizza wasn't hot, it was warm, but not hot, and the sauce was eh. I already don't like waiting for food, but this was probably one of the biggest disappointments after waiting for so long.
