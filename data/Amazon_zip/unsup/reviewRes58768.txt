These are ironic stars. I mean, go Graham Elliot if you ever wanted to go to a place where they point to and explain everything on your plate (and not just yours - the whole table!). Or go there is you ever wanted a massive plate with just a drop of food. Go to Graham Elliot if you've always wanted the perfect combination of obnoxiously loud music, food which is more theater than taste and service that is robotic and scripted. Soooooo pretentious and trying sooooo hard to be cool - go there if you've forgotten how to hate.
