SO not to b e negative Nancy but I've had better. So I went to Bongo Room because though I've lived in the neighborhood for two years always woke up too late to make it by the 2pm closing time. Anyways to cut the story short, I understand it's super busy but waiting an hour for breakfast only to come in, get scoffed at by the waitress when I tell her I'm not ready to order yet and then after I get my food which she sets down the check at the same time. Not exactly the service I expect. I'm not a demanding customer, but when your family is all in the restaurant biz...you come to expect at least a "hello" "thank you" and the fake smile. Then the food, my boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict, they weren't properly poached, more along the lines of hard boiled. I had the white chocolate caramel pancakes, which were good-But not mind blowing as I had expected according to all the reviews and word of mouth. I loved the coffee...but it's coffee. I much prefer other brunch places, didn't hate it. But am probably sticking to Milk and Honey on Division where the "trendiness" is surpassed for clean, simple, fresh and wholesome food.
