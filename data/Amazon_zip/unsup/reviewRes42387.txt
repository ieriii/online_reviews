My husband and I ate at the Gilt Bar and absolutely loved it. On a Tuesday night it was completely packed. We were seated at the Chef's table, which was so much fun. The service was friendly and fast but not in your face. The food was delicious. My husband ordered the pork meatballs and I got the pasta bolognese. We also go fries and for dessert, brownies a la mode. My favorite ice cream was cookie dough because of the HUGE chunks of dough, my husband's was the coffee. The atmosphere was amazing. It's dark, cozy and a little loud but that's what makes it fun. If you want to treat yourself to a hip, modern restaurant, go here.
