With a friend visiting from out of town and running out of options as Saturday afternoon turned to Saturday evening, and too many places already booked, we jumped on a reservation at Carnivale. A beautiful, over-the-top dining room, great selection of ceviche and some really inspired cocktails. The reason for the five stars, though, the service! If you have ever spilled a nearly-full drink in a high-end restaurant you know how embarrassing it can be. When that happened to a member of our party two waiters swooped in like a pit crew and had all evidence of the event erased in about 30 seconds. They brought a fresh one and we were not billed for the extra! Very professional, guys, thanks for saving the night.
