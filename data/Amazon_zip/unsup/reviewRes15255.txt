Went early on a Saturday, they were quickly able to seat a party of four. Appy's were spot on, bacon popcorn, cheese plate, smoked meat plate, all were way beyond brew pub standards, the house mustard was beyond great! 4 different mains, pizza, burger, pork, and a steak. All arrived perfectly seasoned, one of the best steaks in a long time. Tried several of the house brews, all flavorful and well put together. Thanks!
