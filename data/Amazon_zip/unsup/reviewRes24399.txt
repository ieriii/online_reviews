it was the first time i've had costa rican food. many of the food items on the menu were very similar to mexican food. i ordered the milanesa dinner plate. it was pretty good but i think they put too much cheese on my milanesa. the rice, the cabbage coleslaw and my friend's dish were amazing!! she ordered the casado? i know i will be back there and i think i'm going to try the taco tico. yummy!!! oh, and they close for the winter so we were very shocked that they were opened. i guess they will be closing for only a couple of weeks this time.
