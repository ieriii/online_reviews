Went for the first time last night. Its nice to see another great Italian establishment in Little Italy, where you would think it would be nothing but. And guess what, we didn't order any pasta! The Pizza DOC came first which you would think would be typical, but it was the best brick oven I have ever had! Our second course was the Pollo 'Sole Mio' which was amazing and cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy, bursting with flavor. The service was great too. The owner stopped by our table multiple times to check in and bought us a delicious mozzarella dish to try. At the end of the meal he comped us three deserts which were amazing. Bread pudding, peach parfait and a grape sorbet. We will definitely be back to this well dressed and comfortable atmosphere with exposed brick, wood floors and ceilings and calm lighting. It was great to see this place packed on a Monday night and not by UIC students.
