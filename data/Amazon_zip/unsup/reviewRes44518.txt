I wish I lived next to this place. This is exactly the kind of bakery I love and seek out in a city. I got a dark chocolate mousse cake which was garnished with what appeared to be really teeny tiny macaroons, and then some kind of vanilla filling with a peanut butter crunch thrown in. It was amazing. I eat a lot of good dessert on a regular basis, but this blew me away. Next door to it is the Alliance Lounge which you can go sit down in if you want, although everyone already in there were using it as a place to do work and it wasn't exactly a fun or cozy cafe vibe.
