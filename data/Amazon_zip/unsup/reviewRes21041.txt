I was lucky and had my boss take me to lunch today at The Gage. I'd say it was very good, much tastier than my normal left over lunch. The options were very unique and delicious. We had the fondu and Scotch Egg for an appetizer and they were both delicious. The Scotch egg was new to me but I enjoyed it very much, the mustard spread it's served with is delicious. The fondu was very good as well as the bread, very crisp. The sandwiches are a good size, more than I could finish with the soup I had as well. It is pricy but not as bad as I thought it was going to be. With a soup and sandwich and fries, I could be out of there for under $20, which doesn't seem terrible to me for the few times I decided to go to somplace nice to eat. It was crowded so make sure to get your reserverations ahead of time. All of the wait staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. We were treated well. If you like root beer they have a very good one made by one of the local Chicago chefs. I liked the venue a lot. It made you feel like you were in an upscale place from the moment you walked in the door. The only negative i'd have to say about the place is that it is pricy for a sanwich and fries and I feel like everything had a little bit too much oil. The bread for my fondu was pretty oily, my asparagas spinach soup was oily and the my mushroom sandwich, was fantastic, but oily as well. It's nothing more than any other place, but food with lots of oil never really appeals to me because I feel it always leaves me feeling the same way when i'm done.
