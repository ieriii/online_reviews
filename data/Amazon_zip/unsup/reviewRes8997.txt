We had some time in between a few appointments to look at apartments in the area so my wife and I grabbed a bit of lunch here. Ordering from the lunch special menu gave us a very solid and tasty lunch at a very reasonable price. But my favorite part of this trip was the table behind us, where 3 very stereotypical Chicago cops were raving about the various sauces and dishes they had ordered and encouraging their coworkers to share. Having family that vehemently refuses to go near any type of food that might be considered "ethnic" it was touching to hear these fellows bellow their satisfaction with the food here.
