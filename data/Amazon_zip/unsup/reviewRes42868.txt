Off the charts! We went last week for cocktails and dinner with business associates. We had an incredible time. The bartenders are super knowledgeable and they carry great liquor choices. Then moved onto dinner! The appetizer section offered a unique selection. Had the bone marrow and it was delicious. In addition, we passed around some of the toast options and all were great. Atmosphere - tons of beautiful people but not pretentious. (p.s. I would not have added to the beautiful people) A++
