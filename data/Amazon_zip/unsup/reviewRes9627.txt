Great food and atmosphere. However after booking a table, my guests and I where very annoyed that we had further 30 mins from our booking to get getting our table. Luckily I was able to convince my guest not to walk out, otherwise would have not have been able to taste the fab food. Slight delays in getting seated would not have been a problem, however the front of house where rude and could not bring themselves to utter the word 'sorry'. Would give the food a 5 star, waitress 3 stars but Matradee get no stars. And thus I would not go back a gain.
