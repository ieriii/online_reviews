Went really early on a Friday night and sat at the bar which is our favorite spot when there are only two of us. Even thought it was busy, had great service from the "mixologist" which is really what he is. His recommendations were spot on especially his drink suggestions, which you were expect.   Don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, however, the donuts for dessert were to die for. We rely on Yelp reviews all the time, but have never submitted one - until now.
