Love this place! My friends and I went here as part of a 'Girl's Night Dinner'. We were very happy with the service and the delicious food. The pomegranate martini that I had was one of the best in the city!  I ordered the roast pork and was pleasantly surprised at how juicy and flavorful it was! One thing to note: The butter is FLAVORED (garlic-y, perhaps?). It's awesome!! Can't wait to go back here!
