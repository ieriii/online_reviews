We had an amazing lunch here with brother/sister in law who are from Chicago. Ordered a lot of the menu. Everything was well conceived and executed. Service was flawless. Some standouts were the neck bone gravy (which was almost as good as my grandmas) pigs ears and the octupus. The cheese selection was also brilliant. One of my favorite restos in the US.
