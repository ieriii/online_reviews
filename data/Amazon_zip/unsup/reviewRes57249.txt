@jaire q. if they serve donkey meat, then it's AMAZING! I too simply don't care. The environment of this place is awesome. The wait staff is on their game. I never had an empty glass the whole time I was there. The ropa vieja is out of this world! The Victoria's Secret is delicious. I love love love Carnivale!!! This place is great! Make your reservations quick because they do fill up!
