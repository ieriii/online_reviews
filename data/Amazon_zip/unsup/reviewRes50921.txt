I absolutely love this place. It is close to home and open fairly late. (Just wish they were open on Monday nights!) I have never gone during brunch but I am sure I'd hate it. It always looks pretty packed with families.  I almost always order the strawberry lemonade which is made with fresh strawberries! And I also get the hoppin' john almost every time. It is pretty hard to get black-eyed peas north of the Mason-Dixon so this is a real treat.  Also, I have always had excellent service here. I am a pretty picky eater and they always accommodate my requests with a smile. Last time I went we had an especially wonderful server who was funny and attentive.
