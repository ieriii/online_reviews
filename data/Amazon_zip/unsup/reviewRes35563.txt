This is totally the BEST DATE PLace EVER!!! at least I thought so, which probably explains my luck as of late;-( sigh But the food is, how you say it? ....flavored with taste and cooked with love. After standing in the foyer as you first enter and notice the huge menu on the wall in both english and chinese you also notice you are in front of a prep kitchen. It's hot, steamy, and smells incredible with ducks and chickens hanging in the window. The sound of smiling asian cooks doing what they love, WHAK! WHAK! WHAK! goes another duck into tasty bite size pieces... I got me some veggie soup, large please... which turned out to be a medium soup with a bonus small soup on the side and did the duck as well as bbq pork over rice deal.... mmmmmmm tasty good. I call this a perfect date place, because its places like this that are real, about great food, and with an earthy ambience that when you sit back and remember your time here you know your date really liked your company enough to follow you anywhere you were going to be enjoying yourself.
