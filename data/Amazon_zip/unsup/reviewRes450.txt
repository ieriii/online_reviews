YES. All of the positive, even fawning, reviews are correct. Best dinner ever. My small add: Get the wine pairings. They are brilliant and be honest, you won't do this again so do it right.  Remember that It isn't just food, it is a performance, with intricate pieces of presentation hand-crafted for your dinner. We had a mod-art teeter toter with a piece of bacon dangling from it AND wine glasses from 1904 and 150 year old silver. Used at the same meal!? Pay attention to the details and be amazed. You will leave full and drunk and happy. Cheers.
