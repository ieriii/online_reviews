mmmhmmm. i took my sister here when she visited this summer. she wanted to try something new, and i couldn't for the life of me find parking on the southport corridor for tango sur or bull-eh-dias. so we ended up here on recommendation, and parked right in front. it was about 8:30pm on a thursday night and she had been traveling all day, and we both become crankypants when we haven't eaten, so we walked in with a scowl. however we were seated right away, service was fast and friendly. the drinks were pretty good, but the food that was quickly presented was amazing. definitely one of the best steak dinners i've ever had. and the price seemed reasonable for what we ordered for two people. we rolled out of there, scowls replaced by slightly glazed eyes and happy smiles, and went about our way. can't wait to go back!
