I had a great time @ Nana last Thursday (with the new American!) Our server suggested a bottle of red from Walla Walla (Washington) which just got better through the evening. The anti-pasto offered so much flavor on the plate and for our main course we selected the rabbit cassoulet and smoked pork shoulder. Both plates came out @ a great temperature, the flavours were rich & complex. I have never enjoyed a finer cassoulet, the pork shoulder simply fell apart and paired nicely with the polenta. Dinner was highlighted by Omar telling us a bit about the building's history and capped by Chef Guy coming over for a chat after a really busy Thursday dinner service. Parking was plentiful, and the streets are well lit. I will be definitely be going back again, I hear brunch is how the restaurant really made it's name. The service is excellent you will definitely enjoy Nana...
