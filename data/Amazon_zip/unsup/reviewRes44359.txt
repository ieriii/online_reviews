My roommate is always surprised when I'm not familiar with a particular cafe since I know so many of them (and can usually be found working or performing in one!). But this is my first visit to Alliance Bakery, and I'm typing this from my laptop via their free wireless connection. I ordered a mocha (they use Intelligensia coffee) and a turkey and swiss croissant, and I have to say that both were fantastic! It's a little strange to have to go next door to find a place to sit (the seating area is two doors down from the bakery itself, which has no seating), but I can easily see spending a few hours here comfortably. It would be difficult to order more food since that requires walking outside and bringing my stuff with me only to come back again, but that's the only real downside I see.
