I have actually only eaten at Fox & Obel once, but we get lunch catered from there all that time at my job. And everytime I see those Fox & Obel box lunches, I get a little bit excited. The Harvest Vegetarian sandwich is unbelievable: spinach, avocado, cucumber, tomato, pepper, and hummus. Mmmm. The sandwiches are usually accompanied by delicious pasta salad (with cubes of mozzarella and asparagus) and amazing desserts. The cookies are huge and rich. Their brownies and little tarts are delicious (I recommend the chocolate tart). Today I actually tried the potato chips that accompanied my lunch and they were possibly the greatest chips I've ever had. In fact, I don't really like potato chips, but these were homemade tasting, fresh and crispy.  I think it's about time I got back to the actual restaurant to investigate more goodies!
