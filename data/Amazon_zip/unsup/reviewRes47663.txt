Took me a sec to find this place here on Yelp. All I knew was that it was somewhere on Clark, that it had numbers in the name, and that I was there on Friday night in a somewhat drunken state. However, I also remembered that I liked the place. The lounge part anyways, I didn't try the food. The bartenders were friendly, the drinks were strong (obviously!) and the crowd was pretty cool (mature, non-touristy, non-viagra-triangle-esque), and the space was great. I didn't even know about this deck upstairs but I will definitely be back to check that out!
