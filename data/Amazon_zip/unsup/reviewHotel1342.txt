Just had my wedding here in April (2010)... The did an AMAZING job!! Marc Kaufman is the best and our wedding was flawless and stunning!!! The new decor (they just finished the ballroom in March) is classic and very posh.... The food was beyond our vision (we're big foodies!!) and the service is the best in the city!!! We had a large wedding and we planned it in 4 Months from start to finnish and Marc was there every step of the way... He knows everything about weddings and went the extra mile for us... The hotels rooms are brand new and they hotel staff is AMAZING with children (We have a 3 yr old ) and they brought hims snacks, toys, his own little bath robe, dvds... A great place for families to stay at... If you are going to have your wedding there you MUST book fast! they book up at least 1 year in advance, we lucked out because no one wants to get married in chicago in April..... though it was 74 and sunny on our day!!
