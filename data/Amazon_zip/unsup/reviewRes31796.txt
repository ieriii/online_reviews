My friend and I wanted to try Sunda, asian fusion restaurant, the new kid in town. They are definitely out to impress. As soon as you walk in, you are the center of attention of the wait staff. Who can't wait to help you.  We tried several items to share and loved them all. The soup dumplings were especially good, we got two orders of them because we thought the first one was so good. The devil's basket filled with soft shell crabs and chilis was also good. A little overkille on the chilis but it was fun. The sushi was fresh and prepared well. We also ordered a sparkling saki that wasn't on the menu but was delicious. I would definitely recommend Sunda for anyone who has clients, a date or anyone they want to impress. They can take them here and have a great meal.
