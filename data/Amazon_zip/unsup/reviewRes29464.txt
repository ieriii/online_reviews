Well I'm writing this review since I have recently returned from Thailand and I must say this is the best place for Thai in Chicago. I've been going here for over 14 years and I've never had a bad dish or experience there. It's the closest thing I've had to food from the homeland. I highly recommend this to anybody who wants great Thai food.
