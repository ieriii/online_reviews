I have been coming to this place for years, despite the repeated warnings of co-workers who have gotten sick because of food-born illnesses from that place. Not again. I went yesterday and two thirds of the people at my table got violently ill after lunch, including myself. We called Meli and they could not have cared less. In fact, they acted put out that we had the nerve to interrupt their afternoon with our calls. The response to me was what do you want me to do about it, just pass a message along to someone?.I will never, ever dine at Meli again. Everyone who complains about their service in reviews is correct. And now they get a zero on food, as well.
