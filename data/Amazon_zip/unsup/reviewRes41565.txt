When I came to Tank Noodle to have dinner with a friend in February 2010 I had been craving pho for weeks, it was freezing outside, and I was starving. Basically the conditions were perfect for me to happily chow down any form of pho and be immensely satisfied. Which I did, and I was. But I didn't find it to be anything special. I had the beef pho with skirt steak. The meat was sliced very thinly and plentiful which is always a plus, but for me what counts most is the broth-and it was eh. Good, but not great. The menu is extensive (pho with cow penis, anyone?), the service fast, and the table turnover pretty quick as well so I don't think you'd have to wait too long. The prices are also cheap and the location convenient for public transport. Though the pho was pretty good it wasn't anything that would keep me coming back, but I wouldn't mind returning either.
