WOW, this place really knocked my socks off! Every single thing that came to the table was delicious. The bruschette con proscuitto for an appetizer was delish, and the rigattoni alla sicilliana was spicy creamy and amazing. Don't skip dessert either, the banana chocolate chip gelato and flourless chocolate lava cake was exceptional. I can't wait to go back to this place, its my new favorite Italian spot in the city.
