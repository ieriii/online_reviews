The young Chef's, some from L20, really have put together a nice menu, and whoever designed the place did a great job. We had several things, I highly recommend the Veal Bones, they are split long to expose the yummy marrow. The Pork meatballs were awesome as were the frites (fryed in pork fat). The pastry Chef does a wonderful chocolate truffle and makes his own ice cream. You should definitely check this place out. Nice bar area too to gather with a group.
