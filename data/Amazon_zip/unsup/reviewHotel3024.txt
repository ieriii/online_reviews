My favorite place to stay in Chicago! I prefer W Lakeshore to City Center as it doesn't feel as cramped to me. Cozy beds, quiet rooms, yummy Bliss bath products, and the staff is great. A bit pricey for the size of the room, but if you're able to score a deal (I usually am) then go for it! Cheers, W!
