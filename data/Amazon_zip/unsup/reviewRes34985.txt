Well, where to start? My experience wasn't bad at Shaw's, overall. Drinks were good, but basic wine (1) and beer (1) so I can't rate their cocktails. Acapulco Maki roll - tasty for sure. Lobster bisque, wonderful. My $9 wedge salad? Watery as heck. And, I got some brown wilty parts of the lettuce. I know, wedge salad meas you will get iceberg lettuce, but most places I've been where I've gotten a wedge, it's been a pretty good part of the head of lettuce with wonderful toppings & dressing. Not at Shaw's. I wouldn't pay $9 again for the YUCK salad I got - honestly, I wouldn't even pay $2.  On to the entrees - Surf and Turf, and the Club Room Combo. I didn't dig the scallops on the Club Room plate. Everything else was great!! Two sides - green beans and the au gratin potatoes. AU GRATIN! They were the best. I would totally order these over and over again. Green beans were green beans. All in all, our total ended up being $200. That's with tax, tip, everything. Was it worth it? Well, not really. We got pretty good food, but I can imagine where $200 at some other restaurants. I spent less at Girl and the Goat the last time I went there, and was happier with my meal. It's different, being seafood and all, I understand. However, when you are talking about bang for your buck, I feel that Shaw's is a teeny bit overpriced.
