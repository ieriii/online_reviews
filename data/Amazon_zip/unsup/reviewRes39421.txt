Cramped, crowded, smoky. Awesome. San Soo Gab San is a fantastic Korean barbeque joint on a fairly desolate stretch of Western Avenue, perfect for a raucous evening with 2 or 8 friends. For those of you that have never visited, here's a primer.  You sit down, and immediately are delivered about 30 small bowls of assorted pickled vegetables and other treats - some of them are fairly straightforward, some of them consist of ingredients known to no one except for the folks in the kitchen preparing them. Don't mind that - eat them - they're tasty. Next, order your dishes (I recommend the chicken, the bulgoki, and the short ribs - and remember that they are big enough to share). A giant pot of coals is summarily dropped on your table, as well as several plates of raw meat (I don't know how this is not in violation of the City health code, but that matters not). Now start grilling. Drop the meat in a lettuce leaf, top with some peanut sauce, and enjoy! The meats are perfectly marinated, and on my many visits have been uniformly delicious. The Korean BBQ method (cook it yourself and share with your friends) breeds a dynamic and incredibly fun atmosphere (aided by the giant bottles of Kirin that you'll most likely order with your meal). Prices are very reasonable - you'll stuff yourself silly for less than $30. Negatives: it's crowded, especially on weekends, and you will walk out of the restaurant smelling like charcoal - the ample vents do little to stop the onslaught of smoky goodness coming from all directions.
