Excellent choice for the whole family! For breakfast, I indulged in the crab cakes eggs bene - fantastic new crab cake recipe and hollandaise perfection! My husband tried to eat the sausage gravy and biscuits but our 4 year old got a taste of this bit of divine perfection and rejected his own breakfast. Both kids got the cereal - sort of killed me to pay $5 for cereal but my 6 year old had a ball deciding to mix 3 types of sugary stuff we never have at home and exercising the free refill option for a 2nd bowl. For dinner (yes, we went back the same day) the kids spit the rainbow trout and loved the sweet pecans and asparagus. My tuna (sushi grade, ordered rare) had a slightly spicy hollandaise, my husband had the creamy, delicious seafood pot pie. On a previous visit we had the catfish and sturgeon entrees which I most highly recommend. We capped off our high calorie and omega 3s day with brownie pie. Out of this world!!!! Great place for the family! Just keep in mind it is a small and popular restaurant. Be on time for your reservation and leave your gigantic stroller at home or outside!
