Went to a birthday dinner here - had seen plenty of good reviews but never had taken the plunge. Glad I did. The atmosphere is very relaxing though not sure I'd use romantic.  Maybe it was the booth we sat at, but it was quite large and very sparse. Not exactly my idea of romantic.  The service was excellent. The waitstaff from the coat girl to the bus boys to the waitress were all top notch and definitely an A+. So let's get to the courses: Cheese course: Better than average, but prefer emmenthaler to gruerye. The assorted breads/apples/grapes paired well with it. Meat course: Went with a mix of beef, scallops and lobster.  Was too much food for the two of us. Could have probably went with a cheese/chcoloate for one and meat course for the other and had plenty of food.  The scallops stole the show. Paired with the lemon aioli, they were to die for. I was a bit disappointed with the lobster - just didn't seem to lend itself well to this style of cooking. Beef was excellent with the roasted red pepper balsamic vinagrette, Chocolate Course: OMG Graham Cracker Crumbs rock!  Dip banana in chocolate and imediately put in the graham crackers and eat. HEAVEN! The downside is 1) you walk out stuffed and 2) you walk out smelling like cooking oil.  I guess there are worse things.
