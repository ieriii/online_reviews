The place has gone down hill quite a bit since its inception a couple of years ago.... The quality of ingredients has gradually deteriorated as well as the service. The owner used to be there all the time, but I haven't seen him in months. It's a shame. Used to be a great joint and I would go there with my son sometimes twice weekly. :-//
