I was only in Chicago for the weekend and was referred to Graham Elliot for my dining pleasure. At first glance I knew I would enjoy this place the ambiance and table set up were great. When we first were seated we were graced with some champagne and some yummmmy popcorn! I then went for the amazing Caesar salad which had amazing visual appeal the brioche Twinkie is a great idea and was great! The pork loin went great with the bottle of wine that we ordered and all the melded together for a perfect meal to a perfect start for a night out on the town. I truly cant wait to come back to this place and enjoy even more of what they have to offer!
