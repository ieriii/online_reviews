Obviously the place has a beer list that knocks your socks off. Their food is very tasty too... they've got super yummy mussels and the frites are just like I remember from the netherlands with that mind-boggling mayo dip. My parents love this place and will drive from the suburbs just to eat there... then they call me while stuffing their faces to gloat--jerks.  The one thing I will say is that I always end up waiting for a table, and I've been there and waited significantly longer than the hostess had initially promised--you know, I don't mind waiting for a table, but don't lie to me about how long it will be. Again, I dream about their beer list... mmmmm
