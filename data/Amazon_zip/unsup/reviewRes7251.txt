Butternut squash ravioli. I can't help myself.. I ALWAYS end up ordering this at any restaurant I go to. The flavors that came together in this dish were truly impressive--the browned butter and sage flavor with the sweetness of the squash was savory deliciousness. I also tried my friends' dishes- all were amazing (gnocchi, linguini with clams, and the bolognese rigatoni). The pasta was superb, and the dishes were simple enough to let the flavors sing for themselves. Wonderful atmosphere and they have an outdoor seating option. Great quality food!
