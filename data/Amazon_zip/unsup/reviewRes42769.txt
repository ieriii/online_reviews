I may have found my favorite pizza place in Chicago. At least, right now, it's my favorite deep dish place. I admit, I'm biased based on the TimeOut article rating "the best" pizza in Chicago. My opinion is also swayed by the fact that AoP sits in a shitty strip mall. For some places this is discouraging, particularly if the restaurant is meant to classy, but for AoP, a simple pizzeria, it works and makes me feel like I "made a discovery". This place is CHEAP and mad props for selling by the slice! $2.95/slice, any slice, deep dish, thin crust, toppings, cheese, whatever. Never will I settle for a substandard slice of pizza for more than 3 bucks within a 2 mile radius ever again. The menu is fairly extensive, with pastas, italian sandwiches, etc and there are daily specials, which I will return to try. AoP is a point and order at the counter type place, and you can mix/match to your heart's content and have them throw it in a big pizza box to go if you so choose. The dining area is simple, 2 rooms of tables and counter space. You bus your own plates. 'Tis homely. Everyone has their own definition of what makes a good slice, but for me, AoP pizza has a nice buttery crust, a rich, but not overly heavy dose of cheese, and tasty sauce that isn't overwhelming. The multitude of combinations of toppings to choose from w/o having to pay a premium certainly adds bonus points. The only drawback I can think of for AoP is that it's not close to any public transportation...maybe you can take the bus up Lincoln to Ashland...maybe you can walk from Belmont or Southport stations...the good thing about this though, is that you're forced to walk off some of the pizza you ate since you ate so much since it was so good! Looking forward to the update after I've tried some of the other items..
