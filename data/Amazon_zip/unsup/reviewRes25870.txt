This restaurant holds a place in my and my husband's heart. We go every year for our anniversary. The food is great. It is easy to get carried away, but there are things like jamon Iberico de belota, and the patatas bravas, that you just can't find as good elsewhere.  We live in the South Loop so we eat great and walk home. It's a perfect combo. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the cost.
