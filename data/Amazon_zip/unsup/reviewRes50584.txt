I'm from the South, so I guess that makes me a legit judge of sweet tea in the non-Southern parts of the country, right? And I do like the kind that they have at Big Jones. It's syrupy sweet, just the way we like it in the South. But it has a stronger hint of freshly brewed black tea that is often absent from the classic Southern variety. Served with lots of ice and free refills - perfection. The interior is very modern and well-lit and prices are reasonable. We went for brunch, and the server brought a little complementary plate of the tastiest freshly-fried beignets completely doused in powdered sugar. So good I wouldn't have minded just having coffee and beignets for brunch if that were an option... The brunch menu does not lack in choices, however, and it was difficult to make a decision. I ended up having the corn cakes with Creole-spiced ratatouille and poached eggs. It felt like a healthier alternative with the savory ratatouille full of veggies and the corn cakes bursting with crunchy whole fresh white corn kernels in each bite. The eggs were poached to perfection, runny yolks and all. It was a great, comforting brunch, and with so many menu items, I'll have to be back.
