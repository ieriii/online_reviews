Just because it's a Kuma's clone doesn't mean its bad. No lines and no metal. And much closer to my place of living.  My only concern is when they're going to start jacking up prices. I've never had a sit down dinner in Chicago with a menu only in English that didn't make me feel like I'd be eating rice and beans all the next week to compensate.  Don't fear the poutine.
