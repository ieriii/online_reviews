With 382 (and counting) reviews averaging 4 stars, I probably didn't need to review The Publican. Oh, well. Make that 383 four star reviews. I went here on Valentine's Day, but I'd been here before. I went to The Publican for the first time about a year ago. I loved it so much, and I would have given it five stars at the time! The pork rinds were amazing, crackling in my mouth with just the right spice. But, the star of the show was definitely the pork belly. This was the best meat that I'd ever eaten in Chicago, hands down (belly up). This time, the pork rinds weren't as fresh, and The Publican was out of pork belly. Boo... Instead, we ordered the country ribs, potted rillettes, smoked chub, pickles and beets. Although many Yelpers have mentioned how delicious the country ribs were, I didn't find them that amazing. However, the potted rillettes, greasy duck and pork topped with fruit mustard, was delicious. It was my favorite dish, although I didn't think that it came close to the pork belly. Go to The Publican, but, if it's a busy night, make sure they have the pork belly. It is truly delectable.
