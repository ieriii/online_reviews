The Sunday brunch buffet was delicious, yet pricey. They are lil slow on replenishing the salads/fruits/etc, and didn't make sure every meat and side were passed around to every table. My table had to ask for the cinnamon rolls cause they didn't come to our table at all. However, the bacon and french toast were my favorites for being so amazingly delicious and warm every time I got some. I'm usually not that picky with food, but buffalo chicken on waffles? I don't know. Flavors didn't match well to me.
