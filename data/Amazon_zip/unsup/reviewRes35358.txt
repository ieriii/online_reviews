My best man picked Shaw's for the bachelor party, and I was impressed by the service and tasty food. I had a very difficult time picking an entree from their menu, which was full of delicious options for the beginning of a long evening. You have to know what you are getting with Shaw's. This is an old-style, classy restaurant with all the trimmings. The waiters are in white coats, the service was prompt, and the food was excellent. I highly recommend the shrimp popcorn; sounds corny, but oh so good.
