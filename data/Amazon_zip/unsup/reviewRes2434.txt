One of my favorite hot dog places, and a place I always take out-of-town friends to. It's a religious experience as evidenced by the followers that queue up out the door and along the side of the building every day, rain or shine. I'm into Doug's more exotic creations, the spicier the better. I've been here dozens of times, and will always try to time my visit with the availability of duck fat fries, a truly genius way of making an artery-clogging addiction even more so. Don't be intimidated by the lines or by the crowds inside. The line moves quickly, and I've never had to wait for a table once I've ordered. There's plenty to look at on the walls too while your food is being prepared. This place is truly a Chicago institution and something everyone must experience in their lifetime.
