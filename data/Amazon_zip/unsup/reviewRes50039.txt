Brunch at The Fifty/50 was a win. It was Sunday, hot, I only had one egg and was craving someone else making me breakfast...plus there is a lovely patio in prime D-Street people-watching territory. Sold. We snagged a table in the shade and ordered up some brunch-ly drinks...Bloody Marys, Hoe-Mosas and a Georgia Peach. Big high five-oh to the BM. Spicy, with a slab of bacon and a killer stalk of celery, it was very, very good. Hoe-Mosas gave my young man a brunch drink (Hoegaarden with a splash of OJ...brilliant, and completely refreshing on an upper-80s day) and two thumbs up for the Georgia Peach beer-tail as well. I went with the fifty skillet which was chock-full of spinach, broccoli, cheddar cheese, potatoes and topped with fluffy scrambled eggs. A piece of marble rye rounded out my breakfast. Not bad at all. Granted, not the best breakfast I've ever had, but I had a killer Bloody, some of my favorite people and a prime spot on the patio. I was enjoying my lazy Sunday vibe. "Dessert" was another round of drinks and lots more ice water. (Did I mention it was hot?!) Service was adequate and friendly, prices average for a brunching with booze experience. I'd definitely do a brunch repeat here.
