Pequods is hands down my favorite pizza in Chicago. This isn't to say it's my favorite Chicago stlye pizza, however. To be fair Pequods, as advertised, is pan pizza at its finest. It's not the stuffed or deep dish variety that other Chicago joints serve up and I like it that way. Burnt, camalized edges and crispy pepperoni with just enough cheese to hold up to the delicious crust underneath. The atmosphere is inviting with exposed brick walls and a dimly-lit bar room setting. There are booths for two and those that offer more seating as well as tables and stools around the bar. The staff is very friendly and seem to enjoy working together which is nice, as most places I venture into...it seems service is lacking. The waitress I had around lunch hour greeted me quickly and took my order... had my beverage out just as fast and asked how I was doing. The manager on duty also came by to ensure all was OK. They offer a great lunch special. A personal pan pizza and cola or Miller Light pint for $4.95. This is unbeatable. Expect to wait about 20 minutes for your pie to cook. It'sworth it even if you are sitting alone guzzling a pint of Miller Light in the middle of the afternoon. The overall experience here is enjoyable. I'll be back, as I always am and I'll continue to refer friends to this place for a great slice of pan pizza. Great atmosphere, great service, all around great neighborhood pizza stop!
