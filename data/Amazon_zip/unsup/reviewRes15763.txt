Carnivale is such a fun place to take guests, especially those who don't live in the city and are used to standard chain restaurants - this place is entirely the opposite! The vibrant colors inside the restaurant are a fest for the eyes. The atmosphere is energetic and the food is succulent. I especially love their ceviche, guacamole, and ropa de vieja. It is also fun just to sit in the bar area and order appetizers if you are looking for something on the lighter side.
