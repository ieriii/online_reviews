So, this place is kind of expensive. Not going to lie. But I don't put a price on buffets and especially, GOOD buffets at that. Their lunch is simply amazing. They have at least 10-12 different items, and their service is very nice. The waiters are very well mannered and dressed. When I used to live in Chicago, they used to recognize me and my former roommate because we used to come in so often! Make sure to get the dessert, no matter HOW full you are. I don't recall the real name but I call it frozen mango. That and the indian donut. Yes, I should know learn...at my ripe old age my memory is going awry. ps- lunch time is hectic so try to get there early.
