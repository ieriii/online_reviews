Can you say OVER PRICED.... yes way too much for nothing special. The only thing I can see going back for was the green tomato. The Hot dog is nothing special the burgers are greasy and the fries... come on the fries are just normal so many other place for good dogs or fries. Lower your prices SuperDawg and maybe it would be at least average.
