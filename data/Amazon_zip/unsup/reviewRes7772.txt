This place is not hidden, but it's definitely a gem. I usually have weird feelings about places that are always sending out coupons ...but I was proved wrong. After getting several in the mail, I finally decided to use the "four course meal" coupon. Boy am I glad I did! For one, I was taking my boyfriend out, so the fact that we got a bottle of wine, bruschetta, salads, two pasta dishes AND dessert for under $70 (including tax), is amazing. The items we got would have normally added up to $25 more than we paid. It's a small but cozy place, a great romantic date restaurant. Service was fantastic -- prompt but not overbearing. I got the seafood risotto -- it was a huge dish of creamy rice, decorated with clams, mussels, shrimp and squid. A little too much squid, though, I could have done without half of it. After drooling over the plate at the table next to us, my bf ordered the lasagna. It was about the size of his head, and he has a big head. I tasted some and it was probably some of the best lasagna I ever had. We finished the meal with a warm bread pudding -- not the best I have ever had, but my boyfriend loved it. I'm VERY glad I got over my fear of restaurants that mail frequent coupons.
