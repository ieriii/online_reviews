It was last Saturday night. Clueless of where to go. We were staying at the Blackstone Hotel so we just made reservations.... convenient since it was in the same building. I have to say the place surprised me.  Cool atmosphere, excellent service, great food, and yummy drinks! My boyfriend and I have never eaten at a "tapas" place. We couldn't decide what to order so our waiter suggested the chefs special which was $55/pp. It included 8-9 dishes that the chef picks. Honestly, when our waiter said that we would be satisfied and full with the meal, I kinda didn't believe him. Tapas are small plates.. I didn't think 8 would fill me up... but I was wrong. By the time the steak slices came at the end, my boyfriend and I were pretty full. The dishes were presented very nicely and they were all tasty!  Fantastic variety. I would definitely go here again.
