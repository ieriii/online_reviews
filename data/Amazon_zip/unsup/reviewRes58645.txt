In an area that is getting more and more saturated with chains where your options are Jimmy Johns, Starbucks and Chiapotle it was refreshing to find an independent Cafe/ restaurant that offers you very good food at all times of the day. The food which ranges from French Toast in the morning to a fresh Talapia filet with fresh vegetables @ night was supprisingly good. Their interesting wine list has become one of the best kept secrets in the hood. I could not believe that I had choices ranging from a producer such as Bodegas Lealtanza, Rioja spain. Their Crianza I had was amazing and went well with Diablos Meat Tacos. I also found a great Organic bottle of Domaine Le Garrigon Cotes du rhone 2007 ( which by the way received three stars from the NY Times) on the list as well. Who ever does the wine purchasing made up a list better than most restaurants @ twice the price. The desserts were fantastic esp the Carrot Cake which must have been given steroids as it was the size of a top hat but oh so GOOD!!!!!!The service was ok , could have been better but then again I had service issues @ Bouley in N.Y paid six times as much , swore i would never go back and never did. I keep going back to Third Coast Cafe because the food is above par, not expensive the wine list is very good and most of all they always make me feel @ home.
