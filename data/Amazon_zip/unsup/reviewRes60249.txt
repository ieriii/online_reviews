Had lunch here yesterday. Nice. Our sandwiches were good. The food at neighboring tables looked good. The sweets in the dessert case looked really really good (I'm on a diet). Pleasant dining room, but I wish they cranked up the air conditioning a bit. I also wish they had more salads to choose from at lunch time. They seem to be 90% sandwiches, 10% salads. Looking forward to going back for breakfast. Finally, the prices were quite reasonable and I like the age range of the clientele ranging from infant to senior.
