Greek Islands has the best Greek food in Greektown. I've been there 4 times since last summer and I would have gone more if I wasn't a poor graduate student. Whenever I go, I always order the Arni Fournou (Colorado baked lamb served with oven-browned potatoes). It is by far the most juiciest, the most flavorful piece of lamb I've ever had! And the potatoes are amazing!! I've also had Arni Fournou with rice and a tomato sauce - also really great. The Mousaka is good, but not as good as the Arni Fournou. Both times I've had it the Mousaka, it wasn't heated properly. Their service is hit or miss. Most of the waiters are older men who are a little too cold and aggressive, but other than that, they are very attentive.
