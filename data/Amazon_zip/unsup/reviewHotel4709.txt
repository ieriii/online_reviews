Although hotel Felix is certainly not the worst place to stay, I would say that "upscale and luxury" (as stated on their website) is a relative term. We stayed there last November and I'd say that $200+/night was too much. If you can get a discount it would be Ok place to stay. The rooms are very small and definitely meant for 1 person; for 2 persons it is a stretch. Closet space is tiny even for 1 person (it may be Ok if you travel without luggage or planning to stay just for one night). Admittedly, it is a very well kept place (probably in part due to the fact that it was just recently renovated). The shower is huge especially in comparison to the room size, but the bathroom sink has the weirdest design I ever saw. It is so shallow that it's difficult to wash your hands. Internet connection is painfully slow. The elevator's capacity is not enough for the amount wanting to use them. On the bright side, hotel staff is very friendly and attentive, but every once in a while it seems that they simply get overwhelmed and line to check in/check out can be quite sizible. The restaurant (Elate) is exceptional. We ate breakfast and lunch there on 2 separate days and the quality and taste of our fare was amazing. I would definitely recommend to try it. Location is good and fairly central, so you can either walk a take a short cab ride to downtown. Overall, it was Ok experience.
