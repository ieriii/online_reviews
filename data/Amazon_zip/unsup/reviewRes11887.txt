To eat dessert at noon and call it brunch/breakfast is quite a feat, but Bongo Room pulls it off. Having drilled through a few cups of coffee with sugar and a pancake with white chocolate and bananas and god knows what else, I probably (happily) got a month's worth of sugar-intake. It was worth it, obviously, and the food was good, but it would be hard to keep coming back to. Apparently it gets busy, which isn't surprising given it's great location, but it's definitely worth checking out early.
