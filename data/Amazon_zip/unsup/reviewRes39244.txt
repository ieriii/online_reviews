Dear Abby, I treat everybody like ass and then pour 2 pounds of MSG in all my dishes and pass it off as korean food. Everybody still loves me though cause they think my korean food is so good. That must mean all the other korean restaurants are serving food that tastes like a bowl of assholes. How do I get these chicago fools to stop coming to me? I've tried the following: - slam dishes down on the table - sass customers who keep asking for lame things like napkins and spoons - glare at the jerks who come through the front door to give me their business - hire menopausal douchebags to serve the food - ignore those ass clowns who are waiting in line at the front. haha what a bunch of tools None of these seem to be working though. Need help, San Soo Gap San PS. I provide shitty parking.
