Ok so I'm writing another review on a sushi restaurant...I really do eat at other kinds of places. My friends and I just went to Coast and I forgot how much I liked their sushi. Andrea N. picked it (after the awful experience she had at Hey Sushi she didn't trust me.) The Volcano rolls are the best I've ever had - so spicy! I also loved the Coast Crab and the Spicy Salmon. BYOB is always a good thing, and it was nice to see that the place was still packed late on a Tuesday night. I'd go more often if it wasn't so far away. Taxi fare to Bucktown is a killer.
