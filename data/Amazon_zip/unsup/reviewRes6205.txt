Eleven of us were visiting Chicago this past weekend and came to Wildfire on a suggestion from a friend of mine in NYC. All I can say is that I wish there was a Wildfire in NYC!!!! This restaurant was AMAZING. Every single morsel that touched our lips was deeeee-licious. I had the petite filet and was wishing that I got the larger one just so I could have more of that scrumptious steak. And one of the best compliments to the apps, salads, steaks, and dessert... the wine and martini flights!!! Oh. So. Awesome!! Our server took tremendous care of our table and it was so great to be in a place with that "dinner club" vibe. We were seated promptly and at a huge round table where we could all engage in conversation. It was a GREAT experience!!! A dinner to remember from start to finish!
