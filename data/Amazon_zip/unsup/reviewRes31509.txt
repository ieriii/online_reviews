This place is REALLY good!! From their original, signature drinks to the tasty appetizers, outstanding entrees to the fabulous desserts. We had a great dining experience. Started with the onion dish.. really good. I had the pork shoulder while my partner had the quail. Both were really good, well prepared, nice size portions and SO delicious. We had dessert, but I honestly can't remember what it was (we ate there a few weeks ago; just getting around to finishing this review). We plan on going back again and definitely will go for breakfast/brunch one weekend.
