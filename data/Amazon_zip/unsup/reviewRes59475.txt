This was by far THEE WORST restaurant I have ever gone to. Everything from the wine ,appetizers,main course on down to the dessert was BAD and cheap and low grade. This is NOT Italian food at it's best. I doubt real Italians even own or run this establishment anymore. I know it used to be good in the 1970's and 1980's but it is NOT the same. It is in the top 5 worst restaurants that I have ever been to. I have been to many . No stars as a rating.
