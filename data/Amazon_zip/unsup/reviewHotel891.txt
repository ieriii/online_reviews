Loved it! Staff was accomodating and friendly. Hotel was a beautiful renovation of the Reliance Building--rooms on the 8th floor retain the original frosted glass office doors, replicas of the original metal grillwork in the halls and elevators. Ask for a room on a higher floor--there's some serious construction going on across the street. Also--free wine between 5 and 6--hard to argue with that.
