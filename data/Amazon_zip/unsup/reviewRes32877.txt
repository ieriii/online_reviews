I went here last night for dinner with my boyfriend and a mutual friend. The first impression I got was that it was very busy! Most of the tables were full, though no one seemed to be using the traditional seating, only the western style tables and chairs. The menu is quite extensive with about 6 or 7 dishes per protein (veggie, beef, chicken, lamb, seafood). They also have a mixed platter with either fully veggie or mixed dishes, but it was pretty expensive ($15) since it apparently feeds one person. We chose to order three dishes to share (around $9 each) and since each dish comes with a sample of another dish, there was definitely enough food for all of us. The dishes were served in bowls on the injera bread with more injera bread on the side. All the curries we had were delicious though I especially liked the shrimp with berbere sauce.  The reason I gave Demera 3 stars is because of the service. Despite it being quite busy, the waitresses seemed to have nothing to do than come around every 5 minutes to ask if we needed anything. Now, I love good service and appreciate when they come around once or twice a meal to check on us, but seriously - interrupted 6 times during our meal when we were obviously talking to each other? Plus, they didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about their beers. When asked the difference between the three ethiopian beers, I was simply told the most expensive beer (and the largest) is very good. Uh, great, but how about whether they're lagers or stouts, etc? So overall, the food is excellent, but points off for annoying service.
