I was so excited about staying at this cute little hotel, and it did not (really) disappoint. Service: was excellent throughout. The staff was no nice and helpful in directing me to my nearest Starbucks etc. Decor: lobby was gorgeous and adorable. I loved the fire and the things hanging from the ceiling. The little bar/coffee bar is a cute intimate touch. Rooms: were very cute. They're really small, but for one person on a business trip, it was great. There were nice little touches that you don't see in other hotels. Only one tiny window in each room though. Location--EXCELLENT. Other: I hate elevators and the elevators in the hotel were a little bit sketchy. I was afraid they would get stuck. Overall: Love that its LEED certified, love the decor, love the location. Get new elevators and its 5 stars! That said, I'd stay here again!
