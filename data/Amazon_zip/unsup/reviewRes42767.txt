Last night was my second time at Gilt, this time for dinner, the first venture just being drinks. They have a pretty decent bar list and a cocktail menu that was obviously blessed by a very talented mixologist. I took my fiance, dad and stepmother there as they were visiting from out of town and aren't into too crazy of food. From being at Gilt previously, I had remembered the menu appearing as sort of jazzed up comfort food with the incorporation of quality meats (Gunthorp farms chicken and such). Not only does Gilt delivery on potent potables, but it delivers culinarily as well! The pot roast falls apart with a spoon, the chicken is slow roasted and beautifully browned and covered in sweet melty roasted garlic, the gnocchi were like light little pillows of heaven picked directly out of the clouds, and the braised fennel under the swordfish had the consistency of slowly roasted onions that melt apart in your mouth - not a normal costume for fennel! Oh, and don't pass on the burrata appetizer with buttery crunchy toasts, either. Everyone in my party loved it. We'll be back. Frequently. So long as they keep the Johnny Cash in check and play more of the Knife!
