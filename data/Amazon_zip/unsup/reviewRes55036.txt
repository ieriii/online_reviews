I was slightly confused when I entered this Rivernorth hot spot as it imitated one of those dining gems you find in wicker park or buck town. It's definitely not your average swanky urban professional venue with loubou's and brooks brothers all over the place. I was pleased with the cozy atmosphere on the blistery snowy evening, but found the food (the reason for venturing out) to be somewhat bland and generic. I guess I was expecting robust flavors and interesting pairings which is what the rustic, prohibition vibe implies. Not sure if i'd go back for a dining experience...
