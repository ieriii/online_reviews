This place is heaven for a born and raised Chicagoan! Doug, you are so nice and always give the best service available, thank you! Your staff is also very sweet! The dogs at Hot Dougs are absolutely amazing. What I love about this place is the variety of ways you can eat a dog. The different dressings and the way the dog can be cooked are great, options, options, options! The best is their Chicago style dog. Words cannot express! You must try this place.
