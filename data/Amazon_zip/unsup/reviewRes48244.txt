Honestly, I wasn't impressed by Publican. If I could, I would probably give it two and a half stars, as I found the whole experience rather underwhelming. The atmosphere: a bit drab, actually. Publican seemed to be channeling the communal restaurants of New York, but lacked any real style or warmth. It didn't help that nearly every patron was dressed in a business suit, making the restaurant seem duller. The food: just okay, really. The chef's selection of oysters were exactly what you'd find at half the other restaurants in town, and the farm chicken tasted as though it sat in the brine for far too long. Certainly nothing I ate was worth the price I paid. Not surprisingly, Publican jumped on the pork trend all the restaurants are following now, so there was plenty of serrano and pork rinds on the menu. Honestly, this little piggy would rather go to The Purple Pig, where the quality is simply better. The service: when beer is a staple on your menu, I expect you to know a thing or two about beer. So if I'm looking for a bitter beer, you better have an idea or two. I also shouldn't have to flag you down if I want some pepper...or better yet, the check. Especially when I'm one of 30 people in the restaurant on a weeknight. The verdict: I don't get the hype. If you want great communal dining, there's better around the corner on Randolph Street.
