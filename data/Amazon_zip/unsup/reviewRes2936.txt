The food is great here but what really stands out is the service and the decor. When you're eating in Tru you eating in the presence of Warhols and other great pieces of art. The service here is excellent. The best I've ever seen in my life. When I ate here at the end of our dinner they gave us little cakes to take home and eat for breakfast. I was so impressed by that gesture.
