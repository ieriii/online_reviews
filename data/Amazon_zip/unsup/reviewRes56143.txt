I've eaten here several times. Yesterday I was walking by, the menue looked new and I went in.As ;I hve some food restrictions I asked the waitress some questins about the food. She answered them and I said I'll think about it. I then asked if I could use their bathroom, which was no problem. Afterwards I sat down at a table and waited to order. When the waitress came I asked what was in the soup. I have it several times and live it, but now may not be able to eat it. As i was getting ready to order the owner or manager came over and asked me to leave. He said I was playing games and he didn't like it. I told him I wasn't, but I would gladly.As I was getting ready to leave he movjked his hands in a motion that meant go. I couldn't believe this. Needless to say I won't go back to this place.Rhona B
