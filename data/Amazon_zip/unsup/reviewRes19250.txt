While not rotten to the core, the Bad Apple just didn't live up to my expectations. First, the good. Our waitress was fantastic and another waiter helping out with our dinner party was also great. They were very attentive, quick, and offered lots of helpful suggestions. Drinks were served promptly and the beer selection is extensive. You could come here fifty times and still have something new to try. Now, the bad. We sat in the main dining area, which makes you feel like you are a vampire (this could be good depending on who you are). The curtains were drawn across all the windows, making the space feel closed in. The ceilings are covered with black draping with red lights peeking through. And, in the center of the room is an obnoxious chandelier with about 50 bulbs and blinding beams of light that were very irritating throughout dinner. Things got worse when dinner was served. For appetizers, we tried the fried cheese curds (with ranch) and goat cheese fondue. The cheese curds were decent, but I wasn't that impressed with the fondue. For my main entree, I selected the chef-inspired veggie burger. BLEH!!! It tasted bland and heavily spiced with sage (or something else I couldn't place). The bun was grocery store-like, making a bad sandwich worse. I could barely eat more than a few bites. Thankfully, the fries were good (although a number of them were burned). My husband order the Texan, which is a burger plus pulled pork and onion rings on toasted Texas Toast. He was also disappointed. But, with all that good beer we didn't want to give up after some disappointing food, so after dinner we moved to the bar area, where we were greeted by a snotty waitress and ear splitting music. The music was so loud that we couldn't talk to each other without shouting and I swear my ears are still ringing today. As a result, we quickly finished our drinks and headed out the door.
