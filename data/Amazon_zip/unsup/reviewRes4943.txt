This place is great but not for everyone. I went with a large family gathering and had mixed reviews. Personally I loved everything I tried. My brother was a chef here at the time and we tried everything! It is a very unique place and I would love to go back even though my bro doesn't work here anymore. As another reviewer stated, how can you go wrong with Cheese, Swine and Wine!
