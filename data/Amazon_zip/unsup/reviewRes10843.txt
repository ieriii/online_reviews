Unremarkable Pizza, Unremarkable Beer, Unremarkable Service....Ugh Piece....I can always give you a MEH. I dont know why people LOVE it so much here-- I think the concept is good-- but they just dont execute. I DO think they do a lot of fun promotions....they are always having something fun going on, so I'll give them that. It might be good for a big group to hang out and watch a game or something.....but I think there are definitely better pizza, beer, and bar choices in the area.
