Let me just say - YUM! All around YUM! This place has awesome beer (I had the Golden Arm and Worrying Ale) and even better "pizza". It is not your traditional marinara/mozzarella/various toppings pizza. We ordered the "White" pizza which had the crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese. We added sausage, mushrooms and ricotta cheese. HOLY DELICIOUSNESS. I was skeptical about this pizza that I am not exactly accustomed to but I was so pleasantly surprised. If you want the traditional Chicago pizza (deep dish, loaded up) then definitely go somewhere else but if you want delicious beer and extremely tasty pizza, check this place out. We went on a Saturday night around 7:30 and got seated in about an hour. Not bad when you have that beer to sip on. Piece Out!!!
