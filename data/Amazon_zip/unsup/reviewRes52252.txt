I have never been to Chicago before, and was told to try their pizza, cause they said it's the real deal. We had our pizzas delivered so there was no waiting and I highly recommend the Gino's special! The thin pizza was also really good, and I found myself coming back for more and more. They cut their thin pizza in small squares which is very convenient. If I ever come back to Chicago, I will hit this spot up again.
