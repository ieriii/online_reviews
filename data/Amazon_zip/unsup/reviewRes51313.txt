Okay, so we dined in the other night and wanted to bump them up a star because I am a fan. My previous review was going off of past experiences as in over a year ago. Since then, their food went from exceptional to just edible.....and, as of the other night, back to exceptional again. They must have hired the same cooks from back in the day because there was a kick in my pico de gallo and flavor in my carne asada! Yes Garcia, you've done good.
