Enjoybale cubano. Made correctly, good size, served hot and juicy, and on better bread than most. I will say I've had better though at a better price. I also tried the pollo sandwich. Not so great. Very dry and processed. Could have made this at home. The yucca fries were, well, yukka. Perhaps if they'd been hot?I think this place could use a little quality control.
