As people already mentioned. This is the WORSE SERVICE I have been also!I had my wedding dinner hosted there. BIG MISTAKE!!The place is nice but that's it! The party manager gave me a hard time.She does NOT communicate with the people that work there.They tried to push us the most expensive bottles that they have and they ALSO tried to charge us more. They gave us a terrible experience on MY WEDDING DAY and tried to charge us as they deserved it. Oh My just don't bother people!
