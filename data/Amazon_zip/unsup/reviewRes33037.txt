Just returned from our second visit to Yoke at 355 E Ohio Street (corner of Grand & McClurg) and I must say that we're very happy with this find! Each of us had the Dublin Pot Roast sandwich which was rich, flavorful and grilled light and crispy. While enjoying the sandwich, I was thinking that a ramekin of the mushroom cabernet sauce for dipping might be nice, and then who should appear but our friendly server! It was almost spooky! Okay not really... Now, I was expecting the sauce to be gravy-esque tinged with red and bits of mushroom, but it turned out to be more like a French-dip au jus - still nice to have, though. Choice of fries, onion chips, fruit or slaw and for me when fried onion is available, nothing else has a chance! It's a good thing nobody is checking my cholesterol anytime soon! The dining area is airy and open but, acoustically "live", so it was a little loud. Overall the service was efficient and friendly and the menu is extensive. On our last visit, I had the Black and Blue Steak Caesar Salad which I remember as just great. So we'll have to return real soon! No Yoke!
