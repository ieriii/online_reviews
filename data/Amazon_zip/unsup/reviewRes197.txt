The virtues of this restaurant have already been exalted ad nauseum. I would like to add that the food, plating, and service at Alinea strives to be more whimsical and interactive than at other high caliber restaurants. For example, you have to assemble a scaffold for holding a cabbage leaf. Then you form the cabbage into a roll after adding miniaturized stew, veggies, and sauces--the chef's interpretation of Hungarian Goulash. While very few people would ever crave the food here, the cuisine is nothing if not cutting edge. The whole meal, all three plus hours of it, is quite the production. On another positive note, the servers have personality and make jokes, a charming departure from the flat affects and zombie-like service you'll encounter at other places.
