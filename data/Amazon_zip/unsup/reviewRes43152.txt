What's a girl to do when she needs gin? Head to Gilt Bar, of course. I couldn't be happier that this spot opened up (dangerously close) to home. Zach is truly a genius behind the bar. He always knows exactly what to make for our crew we can't quite put a finger on what we want. Three adjectives like "gin," "sour," and "herbal," and a magical drink you never knew you wanted but always desired shows up in front of you. The fries are also stellar and provide great absorption for when you have overindulged, which isn't hard to do here! Keep up the good work, Gilt Bar.
