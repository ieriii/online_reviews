No cover. Right off the bat, prime time equals wait. We stopped in on a Friday night 9pm-ish and expected a wait. There were only two of us, I think bigger groups get seated quicker. Not sure if sitting at the bar shortens the wait or not, did not think to ask. Mixed crowd, but mostly younger. We waited approx an hour, wait space inside is tight and cozy. Got in, grabbed two spots at the bar which I recommend by the way because of the accomodating mixologists. Atmosphere for sure, dark, shadowy, candles. My lady liked it once she got inside. Drinks are what I call foo foo drinks, but unique is the key word. $12/each, but with what you are paying for a cocktail at most places these days (yes you cheesecake factory), not too much of a stretch. Bill can add up quickly though so watch it. We were just having a cocktail, I have never eaten here so can not comment on the food, only had the nuts to snack on and they were good. Kudos to our mixologist as he was especially accomodating to my lady since she was unsure of the drink menu. He was able to suggest a custom made drink on the spot that was very much to her liking. In my book, that kind of service rates.
