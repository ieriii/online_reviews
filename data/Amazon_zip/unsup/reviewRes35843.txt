Where to begin... The first time my husband and I ate at Sun Wah had been when the restaurant was still located on Argyle, the eat-in food was terrific! That's what brought us back to the place after they moved to their Broadway location... I walked in to order some duck and ribs to-go... boy, what a huge _capitol letters_ DISAPPOINTMENT!!! If you want some real BBQ, go to a BBQ joint, and needless to say, I could find better duck at any place down the street. I spent more on half a duck than I would have spent buying a whole duck from a butcher and cooking it myself-- the duck itself was greasier than any I've had (my husband almost choked on the grease hidden under the gooey-- not crispy-- skin); it was also 50% bones! The ribs were incredibly dry and again, about 50% bone, 30% fat. Furthermore, the meat was barely lukewarm, so kind of a weird experience eating it, and there hadn't been any take-out sides offered with the meat (that I could see from the menu). This place is completely and disturbingly overrated! I will admit that I haven't had a chance to sit down and eat inside the restaurant since they've moved to this new location, but how could I even muster the desire to after throwing out half of my take-out?
