The winter delights menu also drew us in, although I had the mushroom ravioli, which was pretty good needed some salt which I added. My husband had items off the winter delights menu-ceaser salad-which I ate, pretty good-just your basic cesear salad but the croutons had this spicy kick, pretty good, the medallions which he said was prett good. Also had the lump crab cakes, I would say it was more shreaded than lump but it was pretty good, great sauce with it. the hot buttered rum cheesecake was really good! The service was pretty good, the only thing was i asked the waiter what drink off the martini list he would recommend and he said he doesnt really like drinks like that and he prefers wines.... i got the caramel sour appletini, wow it was strong but good. Although when we were deciding on the desserts he did say the cheesecake was the way to go, at least he gave a suggestion on that...
