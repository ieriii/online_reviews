What a pleasant little italian restaurant. Perfect for a date as I did or a big group which we saw enjoying the night as well.  We went for my birthday and loved it. We enjoyed some bruschetta to start, I had the agnelotti rossini and it was totally worth my carb intake! For dessert there was a hazelnut gelato goodness that made it a great birthday dinner. I would mention how awesome our wine went with out meal, but that was all us, because oh yeah ITS BYOB!
