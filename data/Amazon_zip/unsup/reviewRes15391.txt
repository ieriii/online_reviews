Went to Revolution Brewing last weekend. My overall impression: good beer, good food (although the portions are beyond enormous) at a relatively non-ridiculous price. I do think there's something funny about any capitalist business using so much socialist imagery, but regardless. The food is good. The beer is good. Check it out!
