My wife loves this place! We were here once for dinner, and the food impressed us. We had a lot of high quality steak and salad. Before we closed our bill, we ordered some dessert. We were amazed by the flan. It was soft, sweet and smooth. As I write this review, I really want to order one from there for dessert tonight. Dinner costs about $60 per person just for dinner (dessert excluded), but I immediately found out during my first visit that their lunch only costs $20 per person. We tried with a few friends for lunch later on, and we continued to enjoy the service and food. Even though lunch had fewer varieties of meat and salad, but their flan cost much less (around $5 during lunch while $10+ during dinner). I will definitely come back again.
