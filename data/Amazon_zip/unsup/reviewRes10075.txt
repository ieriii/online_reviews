The pizza was served on a large cookie tray and we just dug in - no need for plates. This place was packed on a Monday so we opted to eat right up at the bar. I ordered the fresh basil and garlic and she grabbed mushrooms, artichoke hearts, olives and onion. The toppings were plentiful and we could not finish a medium pizza. Solid pizza - almost tricks you in thinking it was coal fired. The service was outstanding! We did a shot of Woo-Woos and the bartender and a staff member jumped right in to join us - no charge for the round! Beer was very good - we had a bunch and probably too many because I cannot even remember which ones - but they were all very good! Head out - sit at the bar where the tender can tell you all about the home brews! Also - there were a few toddlers running around so if you can't get a sitter - no problem here!
