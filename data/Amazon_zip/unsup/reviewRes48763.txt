SUNDAY BRUNCH: Dynamite!!! These plates were delicious! Reminded me of my 5 years living in SF and going to wine country . . . and the reason I moved to Chicago. Midwest picks up where they West Coast leaves off when it comes to using fat and heavier flavors.  1) red wine poached egg, prosciutto, sourdough & bearnaise: the wine pairing with the proscuitto was spot on and the sourdough was no ordinary sourdough, almost brioche like as it stayed crispy while soaking up the delicious red wine infused bernaise. 2) Pastrami Short Rib: O MY!  Been to some of the best deli's in NYC, LA and B-more (yea I said it), and this was insanely perfect. I could not get enough of this.  3) Publican Bacon ala pork belly. get the hell out here! this should come in candy form. Publican Bloody was one of my all-time favorites. perfect flavor, Spicy, great consistency. Garnishments but No pickle. That made me sad and I almost went 4 stars, but its just a pickle. Go here for Sunday Brunch, its not the seafood and meat/sausage spread but one of the best Sunday Brunch's I've ever had.  I can't wait to try dinner.
