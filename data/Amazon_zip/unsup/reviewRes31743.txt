Like Terrance mentioned, Sunda is a great place to be for the atmosphere, decent service and there is no shortage of "beautiful people". Sometimes we go to restaurants for the food and sometimes we go for the ambiance. Only every now and then do we actually come across a place that embodies both. If you are a sushi person, I think you will love this place. Although my husband had the chicken, he loved the place. I on the other hand am a fish-less vegetarian and the menu was definitely on the light side... Our seating would probably have been better than at the sushi bar but we were 10 minutes late for our reservation. So don't make that mistake unless you actually enjoy the look, smell and preparation of fish.
