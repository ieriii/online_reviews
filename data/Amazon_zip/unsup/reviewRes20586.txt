what a disappointment. for all the notoriety you'd think they could design a better experience. i went to get a sandwich to go on a wednesday around lunch time and encountered practically no line. but then the cashier told me to hold on, left to do something, came back about 5 minutes later, took my order (and my $15 for a pork belly torta and 10 oz iced tea) and told me to wait by the end of the counter, which i did for about 15 minutes before i was herded by another lady into a long line directly in the middle of the dining room, blocking all the runners and patrons. and of course i am now about as far from the counter where they call your name as can be. i wait another 10 minutes (that's about a 1/2 hour now for one sandwich; it's lunch time during the week; it's not busy, there's about 7 cooks behind the counter). they finally call me, forget the iced-tea. i wait some more. i walk back to my office, unbox my sandwich that has about 4 square inches of pork belly on it, a few sorry sprigs of arugula and avocado that has long since fallen off the crusty french bread--which as i take my first bite is way too much bread for this sandwich much like the way too much money i paid and the way too much time i spent waiting. over all it was disappointing, disorganized, and over-priced.
