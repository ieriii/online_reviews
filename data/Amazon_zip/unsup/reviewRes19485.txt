I had heard this place was great. Went on a date here, everything was great except I think I got sick from the tuna roll. Can't be positive but the day after my stomach was off ALL day. I was also irritated that they didn't have valet on Monday. Ambiance is good, romantic. Server wasn't that attentive. Overall, meh.
