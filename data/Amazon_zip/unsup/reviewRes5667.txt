Community type portions (small, but you order a lot to pass around). Amazing food, but expensive. You get what you pay for, though! The service was a tad slow...we had to ask some passing busboys for water and a fork for our dessert. It was a very busy night, so I don't blame the staff - they were doing they best they could. After quite a few nights of trying to find good food in downtown Chicago, we felt like we finally had an Eureka! moment at The Purple Pig. Get the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. You can't go wrong with that order!! We went during the dinner hour and it looked like a good mixture of people who just got off of work and tourists. All were dressed either in business suits, trendy outfits or just looking really nice. Call ahead - it was absolutely packed when we arrived. We watched a family of 6 wait for at least a hour if not longer for a table. They looked miserable every time a table of two were seated (like my husband and I).
