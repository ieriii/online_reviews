Yum!!  I can't believe today was my first time going to brunch at The Bongo Room. I have heard so much about it for so long and today I finally got to try it! It was really, really good.  I had the breakfast burrito which was made with scrambled eggs and guacamole. It had some sort of spicy mayonnaise concoction on top with scallions and cheese.  There was salsa on the side and it came with "hashbrown" which are really just sort of seasoned and roasted potatoes.  The burrito was one of the best I've had. I like to be able to control my spiciness and it was just right for me.  The potatoes were pretty great, but I prefer the potatoes at Dodo, myself. I went with Nathan A. who had the cheesecake pancakes. Oh man those were great! They were super sweet and cheesecakey and he was very generous in the tasting allowances. Ryan S. had the lemon buttermilk pancakes which I liked even better than the cheesecakes, but both were great desserts after my breakfast burrito.  ** If you're scared of the often LONG wait on the weekends try going during the week. They are open for breakfast until 3pm.
