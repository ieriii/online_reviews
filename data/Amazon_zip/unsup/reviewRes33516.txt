One of my fav breakfast spots! Everything I've had so far is good. I usually get the basic breakfast (scrambled eggs, sausage, toast) & the side of pancakes (chocolate/strawberry). Good as hell. Don't wait an hour for a table. Get a bar seat and eat your breakfast. I like to look at the wait staff too (as I stated). But you can tell a good restaurant can handle being busy -- they do a good job. I looks fun...if that was my profession I'd like it crazy like that. SC
