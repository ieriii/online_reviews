Third time here, again to use up the Groupons we bought here. My past 2 reviews, we ate 4 star food. This time, i think we had more of a three star experience - nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible. -For our appetizer we ordered #126 Papdi Chat which are pastry crisps topped with boiled potatoes, chopped onions, cilantro leaves smothered with sweet chutney and chilled light yogurt. This was a pretty tasty dish! -For our main dishes, anyone who's been here will notice everyone ordering a loud & sizzling platter of meats/veggies. We asked our waiter what it was, and ended up ordering the popular # 136 Tandoori Pesh Kush. This is a sizzling mixed platter of Chicken Tikka, Chicken Reshmi kabab,Lamb Boti Kabab, Fish Tikka, Tandoori Shrimp and Tandoori Chicken. The meat was a bit dry to me, but my hubby who is more of the Indian food fan liked this dish a lot. -We also ordered # 205 chicken tiki masala - naturally a classic dish to get at an indian restaurant (at least by non indian peeps.) Overall i had an ok experience - note to self - come next time with a completely empty stomach - their food is so filling!
