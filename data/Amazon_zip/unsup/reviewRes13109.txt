What's not to love about Glenn's Diner? Cereal lines the back wall, the FRESH fish of the day is on the chalkboards that line the outer windows...there's patio seating while it's still nice outside...a good beer menu (ahem).  The fish is always, in my experience, fresh, and delicious. However prepared--and these folks are great at what they do--you're sure to be pleased. I went for "all you can eat crab" night. Don't laugh, I had to give it a try. And even the crab was amazing. Of course, these things don't come cheap. Which makes me and my boyfriend a little sad. If the prices were even $3-4 cheaper, we'd frequent Glenn's more...frequently. I haven't been for the brunch, but that's high up on my list of things to do in Ravenswood.
