The food was delicious, some of the best I have had lately. We had a big group of 12 on a Sunday night and they were very gracious hosts and the service was wonderful. All the food was delicious, I did not taste one thing I did not like! I will be going back again and again. Great food, great service, gorgeous atmosphere.
