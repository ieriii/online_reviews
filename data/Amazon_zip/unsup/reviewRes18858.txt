We were walking nearby and found this place on yelp. Skimming the reviews quickly suggested this was good, so we took a leap (the name Rick Bayless did not ring a bell with me). I wasn't sure how a torta could be all that much to rave about, as I've had a few tortas at traditional Mexican establishments before. All I can say is that they share the same name. This was out of this world delicious--I wish someone could tell me where to find an equivalent in the Bay Area.  The only downside is the limited table seating--most of the seating is at a stool and counter, which is how we ate. So it is was a little off-putting at first--until we actually tried the food! We were also fortunate in that there was no queue when we arrived--sometime between 5:30 - 6:30 PM mid-week.
