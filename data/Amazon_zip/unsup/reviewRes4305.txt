I love the Green Mill and I don't even particularly like jazz. I wanted to wait until I'd been at least twice in case my first enjoyable visit was a fluke, but I went back this weekend and had another wonderful time. Even though I didn't love this second band, I still had a great time just hanging out at Green Mill. The venue itself is really cool and, as has been mentioned by plenty of other reviewers, transports you back about eighty years. The Art Deco design and the bar are lovely. I'd say drinks and covers are pretty reasonable, though mixed drinks are sort of a ripoff. As a girl who loves her alcohol, the tiny pool ball sized tumblers just don't cut it for me. And yes, it gets very, very crowded. If you show up early enough (like 7 on weekends) you should be able to snag a seat.  And I love the door guy. And the owner. Turn off your cell phone unless you want to get yelled at.
