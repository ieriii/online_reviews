We made a reservation the week before, received emails and a call to confirm, but we arrived and still waited 10-15 minutes. We found that the restaurant was VERY loud as our party of four was given a table in the center of the restaurant. Waiters and people bumped into our chairs the whole evening, which was very frustrating and distracting. The food was wonderful - I recommend the cheese ravioli, my husband was less than thrilled with the tomato based pasta dish. It was so loud we couldn't hear the waiter and he was not very helpful anyway. I thought it was a delicious. I had the panna cotta dessert was pretty good, not great.
