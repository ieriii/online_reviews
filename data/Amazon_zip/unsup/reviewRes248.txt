Pretty intense. 26 courses, lost count of the wine pairings, clocking in at over 5 hours. *Loved* most of them, and liked the rest just fine. Comes with the territory, it's pretty avant-garde. Excited to return! (Saw some people comparing Schwa and Alinea, they are extremely different. Schwa is intimate and rougher, Alinea more sterile and ordered. Both good!)
