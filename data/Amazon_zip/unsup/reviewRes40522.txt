I was brought here by my boyfriend's cousin alongside with the rest of his family for a pre-wedding get-together. The place was crowded which can only mean one thing: it's good. I am biased when it comes to eating pho because my mom's pho triumphs everyone. However, this restaurant was pretty good in terms of my pho standards. If I am craving pho whenever I'm in town, I'll probably be back!
