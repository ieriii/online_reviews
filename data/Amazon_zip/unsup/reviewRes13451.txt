Revolution is a great place that reminds me a lot of the craft brew houses in the pacific northwest. The beer selection is good and they have a rotating tap selection of guest brews as well as a cask ale for those of us who enjoy warm, less carbonated bitters. The food is great. The reuben is solid, and I'm a reuben snob. Perfectly tender corned beef. My boyfriend raves about the potato pizza which is cooked in duck confit fat. The charcuterie plate has a good selection of cured meats, but my favorite item on the menu has to be the popcorn with pork fat, cheese, and bacon - so, so good. The bar opens up its front in the summer and its location in Logan Square is great. The bartenders are nice and the place seems pretty hip. They also have tvs in the bar, so we have caught a few Bulls games and some NCAA action.
