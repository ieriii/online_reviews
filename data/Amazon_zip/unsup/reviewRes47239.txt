Amazing and unique burger selection. Tuesday's are 1/2 priced burgers. Excellent deal. Build-your-own mac & cheese seems pretty legit too. Massive portions. Expect some heavy music and lots of flat screens. Patio seating is nice. I've always had good service. Also right across from Empty Bottle, so perfect spot for some food and a beer before a show
