OH MY GOD! I LOVE HOT DOUG'S! It's the best hot dog place ever! Ok, the line is a long line, but well worth the wait! We had gotten 4 dogs, a large basket of fries, and the chili to split between 3 people (as well as ordering an extra dog when we were done). Just because the foie gras hot dog was THAT amazing. Best hot dog hands down. We had also gotten the Elk dog (it was good), the veal (delicious), and a spicy seafood one (also delicious, but a bit salty). The duck fat fries were good, but I didn't really taste the difference. Also, the 40 sausage chili is good, but since you can't distinct each sausage flavor, it basically tastes like chili. But there is a good bit of sausage in it. I'd totally wait in the 1+hr line again, except this time, order way more hot dogs.
