There's really nothing special about this place. I've dined here on two occasions and come to the conclusion that this place is all hype with very little substance. The food was ok but nothing to rave about. It's always super crowded due to the fact that it's the only place in the area that serves breakfast besides The Bongo Room. The wait was 45 minutes plus & definitely not worth it. The decor is pleasant but because there are little soft surfaces and an open layout, it's very noisy. The service is generally decent but, again, nothing spectacular.
