A friend and I went to Xoco tonight and had a really great evening. Sure, the line was out the door and yes, it was about an hour wait in line but it was a lot of fun and totally worth it. First, the decor is awesome. very simple and modern but yeah, there isn't a ton of seating. Fortunately, there is a very nice hostess who will meet you at the register, give you your order number and then take you back to your seats. I was honestly shocked when she did this because I had nightmares of eating on the floor or huddled against the wall. It is communal seating for a small group so be ready to make friends with strangers but the vibe was fun and everyone was talking about what they ordered. If you have to wait outside, it will be about an hour before you get up to the register but people were crowded around enough watching Rick Bayless walk by and once you get inside the action is much more interesting. You can see the food going in the woodburning stove and the crowd/action is more than enough entertainment. Food: one word: awesome. I've been to Frontera and liked it a lot but this is the PERFECT lunch or casual dinner place. A friend and I split several dishes, including the homemade hot chocolate (recommend the Azteca), churros (TO DIE FOR), pork belly/avocado soup (not spicy, very tasty), Jamon Torta from the griddle (definitely get the fried egg for on top) and the Choriqueso Torta from the oven (good and with a nice kick but somehow not as satisfying.) My friend and I left SUPER full and happy. I definitely want to go back and try the desserts and get the carry out. Prices were fair and definitely cheaper than Topo and Frontera. I would absolutely, 100 percent go back. Lots of fun (minus the wait)
