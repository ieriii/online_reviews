A very cool place in a very cool area. I had never actually heard of this place before I went last night, but oh man was it some good food. I forget the exact name of the dish I got(thank you,byob), but all I know is that chicken with some spicy curry and rice and some greenery is good good stuff from here. When the waiter asked me what level of spicy I wanted, I said 'very', and it met my qualifications. It wasn't the painful spicy, or the hurt your stomach spicy(last night anyways), but it was spicy enough to really add something good to the food and make it taste extra good. I'd come back here again in a heart beat. In the top tier of Thai food places that I have been to in Chicago for sure.
