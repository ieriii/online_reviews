An endless fount of creative, delicious cocktails. I've never eaten the food here, we always just get a drink or two and soak up the scene. I have always found it completely mysterious that people will go to bars, pay the ripoff cocktail prices charged at many places, and stand because there aren't enough seats. Well hooray for the Violet Hour, I'd rather be kept out in the cold than let into a horribly uncomfortable environment and served a $10 drink by some inept bartender that shakes the gin, and have to stand in a drunken crowd whilst trying not to spill my overfilled cocktail glass of liquor so sorrowfully diluted by endless shaking.At the Violet Hour, you must have a seat, which is comfy, the noise level is perfect (the curtains help measurably with the acoustics) and the drinks are properly strong.My only complaint is that the drinks are overwhelmingly on the sweet side, though still delicious. This may be a nod to contemporary tastes, but I'd appreciate some drier options. Just because I look like a tart doesn't mean I like my drinks to taste like candy lol.
