Please don't forsake me Lou's. I really, really like Pequod's pizza. Yes, the caramelized crust is just plain tasty, although I want the crust to be just a bit more crispy. Shut it you pizza-whores, I KNOW it's deep dish....but, there's no reason the crust shouldn't be a bit crispier.  The sausage was quite tasty -- do they make their own or buy it? Hard to tell, and didn't care as I was tearing into it like a rabid dog. Fresh fresh fresh ingredients -- thank you for using fresh mushrooms and not canned. The thin crust is more like a hand tossed crust -- thinn-ish, but more bready. Same issue - thin crust NEEDS crispiness. Unequivocally. Do away with the twisted edge artistic malarkey; just give it a standard edge that gets crisp on baking. Great sauce, really, just lovely. A bit of sweet, a bit of acid, LOTS of tomato flavor. Was there on a Saturday early evening, and they were able to accommodate our rather large party. But, please make sure the tables don't tip over - we had the bobble-head of tables, and had to keep the beer pitchers in the center for fear of bathing in it. One star. I really enjoyed that the owner came around and asked us (twice) how everything was....what a nice fellow, friendly, and genuinely interested in what we thought.  I'm glad Pequod's re-opened after the fire.
