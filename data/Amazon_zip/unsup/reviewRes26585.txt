I had a wonderful time in their lounge. My boyfriend and I came for sangria special and stayed for the food. The bartender served us and was extremely helpful. The sangria was seasonal and excellent. We had a well-balanced cheese platter. Then moved on to the best pork belly I've ever tasted - not too fatty and was really well seared/caramelized. I can't speak to the other days of the week, but it was not crowded on Monday. The vibe is nice too - trendy, but not overly so.
