I like this pizza, better in than out unless you pick up. The reason for 2 stars is that I recently ordered a pizza half sausage half pepperoni (not all sausage/pepperoni)and they charged me for each topping in full. When I called to correct their error they told me that's how they do it. Not cool at all! Don't like feeling taken advantage of. So I won't be back anytime soon!
