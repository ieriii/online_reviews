Was in Chicago for a convention and everyone said, "you have to try Gino's Pizza, it's the best". Seven of us went for dinner and were not impressed. The artichoke spinach dip was the best item on the menu. The pizza was not at all what we expected and ended up feeding the leftovers to the homeless. I am a pizza addict but this pizza was the worst I have ever eaten. From now on, it's New York style for me! The service was poor and the waitress seemed irritated when we had to ask for refills of our drinks. Couldn't even get a pen to write on the wall. Oh, well, won't be back.
