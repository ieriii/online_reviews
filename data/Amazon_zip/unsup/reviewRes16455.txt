Just walking into this place travels you to another universe. Such a large and expansive room with virbant colors makes you feel like you a tiny person in a strange world. The lunch food was fantastic and I didn't find anything that I didn't like. The Ropa Vieja appetizer was wonderful - great shredded beef taste, and had a mix of mangoes within it. Their homemade tortilla chips were unique and quite amazing. I know, "How could tortilla chips be unique and amazing?"... well, trust me, you just have to order them and find out. All in all, this is a Grade-A place with an awesome vibe. I look forward to coming here again in the future with a large crowd.
