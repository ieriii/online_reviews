Like a food museum where you can buy stuff and eat it! oh it's so yummy! I can just walk around all day and look! A wonderful atmosphere that appeals to all the senses! It's not for everyday grocery shopping if you aren't Oprah or one of her chef's but you can see and taste the quality. The meats even look pretty! The Cheese counter is amazing and they will help you and let you taste and i've found some fantastic new cheeses with their help. the prepared foods and cafe are also excellent! try the cinnamon roll that has to be made from croissant butter pastry it's sinful and i love it! oh and the carrot cake is delightful!
