I had an amazing experience. The staff was impressively respectful and to my best effort I couldn't stump the waiter. He was very knowledgable of the menu. The food was amazing, I couldn't have asked for a better steak. I would have never set foot in this place of it wasn't for my friend Frank. I strongly recommend a visit.
