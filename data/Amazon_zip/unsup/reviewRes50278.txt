I heard about this place through Thrillist. Went down on their opening on Friday to try it out. AMAZING Food! I got the "Triple Secret Cheese Burger" which was great. We also ordered their special hot wings. They were just the right level of hot. But I think my favorite thing this bar offers is the 40oz of the week served in a paper bag!
