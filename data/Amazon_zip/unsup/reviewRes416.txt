The longest, most expensive, and most interesting dinner I've ever had. We had the 12-course tasting menu, and it really added up to quite a bit of food, I can't see how people could eat much more! The service was VERY good and despite the dress-code and the high-prices, they weren't condescending at all, and very comfortable and knowledgeable. I'm glad I went, but this is maybe a once-every-four-years type of place, just because it's that rich - oh yeah, and I don't go to Chicago that often.
