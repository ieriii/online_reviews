My God, this space is aggravating. Those who plan on opening a restaurant must study XOCO very carefully to learn how NOT to layout their business. During lunch hour, this place gets really stressful to navigate. I ended up waiting in the wrong line for ten minutes, then was told to stand in another line, where I was pushed around as people tried to walk by me. OMG. What a mess. The seating is really awkward too. Food-wise : Meh, I've had better. Maybe Bayless is trying to present a healthier option of street food, but my torta was pretty dry and uninspiring. The bread was hard and there wasn't enough richness in the meat. The churros were good. If you want some really nice sit down Mexican you need to try MIXTECO. For a great Pepito sandwhich, please check out CAFE IRAZU (Costa Rican), or DONA TORTA for a, you guessed it, torta. Chicago is such an ethnically rich city, there really is no need for Rick Bayless to introduce us to "authentic" Mexican food.
