We've been to many Brazilian places before, and this time we came here just for the salad bar because I was told it's enough for dinner and it was! My favorite from the salad bar are seared tuna, olives, shrimp, artichoke hearts, mozzarella cheese, baby beets, goat cheese and etc. They also have hot items, fish, chicken and lobster bisque. Pretty good. After 3 plates we are done and we have a certificate from Groupon and we have no problem using it at all.  Our server Diego was great, even though we did not have the meat services and we didn't order any drinks (we are healthy water drinkers!) which some servers will give you much less attention if not the "look", but he is very polite and attentive throughout the whole service even with our Groupon. I think every server should be like him! :)
