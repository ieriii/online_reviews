Living up on the north side it's always great to see neighborhoods like Lincoln Square and North Center getting better bars with wider selections of beer and food. Located on the northwest corner of 4300 N Lincoln, you'll find Bad Apple packed on the weekend with plenty of people waiting in line for some eats and drink. Drink-wise I kept my selection simple: Green Flash Double Stout. Somehow this brew had 8.8% ABV but was smooth as a stout with half the ABV. This Green Flash might be my new favorite beer, with seemingly as deep of a beer menu as Hopleaf or Map Room, the possibilities were truly endless. Bad Apple also boasts a cocktail menu, beer cocktail menu, and there are an endless varieties of beers on tap along with ciders. Food wise, I have yet to try any appetizers but I've had the Frenchie burger twice and am addicted. Upgraded to pretzel roll and bacon, the Frenchie is loaded with spinach, brie, and fried onions. Ordered medium rare, the burger comes with a good shade of red. Fries come with options, I usually add garlic and truffle. If you are looking for something interesting on the northwest side and have a craving for fine beers and a wicked burger, do yourself a favor and head on to Bad Apple.
