There is one thing which turned me off.....Theres a dish called panang curry...it has brocolli in it...and for some reason i dont like brocolli....so while ordering i asked to substitute brocolli with bell peppers....and they said its extra $1 for substiutions...and i was like...its not a chicken-shrimp substitution or anything like that....but she said that is their policy....i am totally confused...bell pepper is cheaper than brocolli...so why charge extra buck for this substitution....they should rather be happy......anyways....since this philosophy turned me off...i didnt order food.... but really wanted to try for first time......:(
