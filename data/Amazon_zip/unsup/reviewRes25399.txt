The lady and I bought a Groupon for Geja's. 25 bucks for 50 dollars worth of food. We figured it would be a great anniversary date. Boy was it. This place is super romantic. I has pictured something looking more like an upscale opium den, but in a good way. What we got was this gorgeous cave with lots of little nooks and crannies to sit in. We were seated in the open space though. It's got a very ambient lighting as well and nice soft music playing throughout the place (no live music when we were there). Let's go step by step. Cheese Fondue was awesome. I didn't want to stop eating it. My only complaint (which will surface a view more times), is that it's a little too dark. If you're picky like me, you like to be able to see your food. I could not tell between onion bread and french bread without smelling it, much to the annoyance of the girl. So I just stuck to pumpernickel and they were happy to bring us extra. Next was our meats. I have beef tenderloin and chicken and the girl has beef tenderloin and scallops. It was good. Again, my complaint would be, it's hard to tell if my beef was the right color in the center or if my chicken was cooked through because it was so dark. The dipping sauces were ok, but nothing to write home about. Too thin if you ask me. They didn't really stick to the meat too well. Let's finish up with a bang. CHOCOLATE GOD DAMN FONDUE FOR THE WIN! Oh man, it was sooo good. I loved the short term fire and the ability to roast marshmallows that it afforded us. To quote the lady "That there is a marshmallow dipped in pudding" I also enjoyed the pound cake and the apples, but I think my favorite dipper would be the maraschino cherries. Very tasty. I didn't see the pineapple or the cantaloupe being good covered in chocolate, so I didn't bother. The coffee was great as well.
