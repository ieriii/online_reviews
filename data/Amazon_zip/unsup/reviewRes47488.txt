great burgers. HUGE and lots of choices. good atmosphere...music wasn't too loud but we wished they would play sports on the tv's...I get that they are rock and rolll...but the neighborhood west of western is in desperate need of a place to watch sports and grab food. This place has great good, a good bar set up with lots of seating and tv's, good beer selection, great specials....just think they would do better as a sports bar.
