I have been to Revolution a few times now and I am definitely a fan. Bacon on popcorn, how can that be bad! What I really love are the mussels and there are two styles: -Chorizo & tomato saffron broth -Hard cider, blue cheese, leek, granny smith apple If you would have asked me which one I would like better I would have guessed the one with chorizo but that was not the case. Both are good, don't get me wrong, but the ones with blue cheese, leeks and apples are AMAZING. I definitely recommend that one tries them. Another thing I really like at Revolution is the pizzas. The Twice Baked Potato one with cheddar, confit potatoes, potato goat cheese puree, scallion, sour cream (add bacon!) will make you very happy. Don't forget to have some of their stellar beers and you are all set!!
