After walking by a few times and always seeing it packed inside, I decided to try out Crisp today. The food was really great! I tried their original bad boy buddha bi bim bop rice bowl. Made with carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, corn, Korean radish, $1 for added chicken and a fried egg. The best part was when I stumbled upon some zucchini...my fav! The worst part, however, is that the service was real terrible. I never received a "hello" or a "thank you" from anyone...and I was the only one in the line! The three male cashiers were busy talking amongst themselves...I wish I would have gotten your names, because I love exploiting stuff like that. Anyway, I will be back for that rice bowl. But hey, take a look at my profile pic and remember it. Because next time, I'd appreciate a "hello!"
