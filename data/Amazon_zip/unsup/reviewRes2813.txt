I ate here a few months ago, and I keep forgetting to write a review. I visited on Tuesday night, and I hope for the sake of this place that they were breaking in someone new on the line. The food does not even come close to being worth the money. I ate there a few months ago, and only 2 dishes from the 6 course tasting stick out in my mind: The lobster was chewy, awfully prepared for a restaurant that is charging the prices they are. The cheese course was excellent. They do things like printing you a custom menu to commemorate your experience. This is something that might impress a suburban housewife that gets out twice a year, but honestly just seems kitschy.  Go to Les Nomades instead. It's less expensive, and the food is WAY better.
