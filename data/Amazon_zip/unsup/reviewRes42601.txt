Fogo 2 Go is the go-to carry-out pizza place for my apartment. While it's typically good, the quality of food from fo2go seems to fluctuate more than any other place I can think of. Some nights, we get these monster delicious pizzas, jammed with toppings. The next week we'll get a weak and sparsely topped pizza. When on their game, this place is close to 5-stars, other times, it's closer to 2-stars--so I settled on 3. The best pizza here is the Alexia along with the 4 quejos or 6 quejos. Also, we tried the chicken our last visit which was INCREDIBLE. Just trust me.
