I'm lucky to live so close to the Bad Apple! I haven't yet seen such an extensive beer list that's so NOT overpriced. I love knowing I can walk in there on any given day and have a delicious beer for less than $5. Their burgers are good, not the best. But I used to live around the corner from Moody's, so I've been spoiled for all other burgers. (Although BA's variety of burgers is much better than Moody's)Contrary to some, I LOVE their homemade ketchup!! (and I tell them that every frickin' time I'm in there) I'm not a huge fan of store-bought ketchup, so it's a refreshing change.It does get crowded on weekends, but to me that's a testimony of how awesome this place is!
