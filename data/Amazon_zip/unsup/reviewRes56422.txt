I LOVE this place...mostly have it delivered to work when I'm treating my employees for lunch, but when I want a great dinner I will have it delivered or dine there. The owner is a wonderful man(Tuan) who shows his appreciations and treats you like royalty. Sometimes, I have been disappointed by the young lady or gent when they've answered the phone and seemed too busy to take my order, but I love the food and the owner too much to let that stop me from being a loyal customer!
