I had such high expectations for this place...and I don't know how, but...Piccolo Sogno far exceeded them. The ambience, decor, and clientelle exuded understated elegance. It truly feels that you are inside a beautiful and authentic Italian countryside home. I was immediately nostalgic of the time I spent in Tuscany with boisterous Italian families and an abundance of hearty food and wine. House Bread-AMAZING. They have the cutest little containers of balsamic vinegar to accompany the house olive oil for dipping, and offer up 3 fantastic types of bread. Insalata di barbabietole-Farm beets with buffalo ricotta topped with shaved fennel and small pieces of grapefruit. Very Refreshing and a great start. Pasta Special of the Day-Butternut Squash Tortellini drenched in Brown Sage Butter topped with Walnuts. This was good; however I don't think it beats Tratorria No. 10's Butternut Squash Ravioli. Whole Fish of the Day: Woodfire Seabass with Sea Salt Crust. This was flaky and uber fresh; however my only complaint would be that when they filet the fish in front of you, they toss the crunchy bits and skin which to me, is one of the tastiest parts of fish, especially when woodfired and crusted. Porchetta Alla Romana-Roasted Pork-Mmm, perfectly moist inside and crunchy and thick on the outside. Dessert: Chocolate Cake filled with real cocoa gooeyness, topped with Cinnamon Ice Cream. Yum. Had Rose and a few glasses of their Red Wine Recommendation (95% Pinot Noir and 5% Merlot) which were all spectacular. I am coming back next Week!
