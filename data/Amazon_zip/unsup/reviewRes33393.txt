No joke, if it wasn't for the quality of the food itself, I would never set foot in here. The employees are absolute dicks in every way imaginable and treat payment like Dadaism. At one point, I ate at Sultan's a few times a week - by this point, I'm well aware of what the exact cost of my order should be along with tax. There have been times where I've been overcharged by as low as a quarter and as much as a dollar. Two days ago I went in here and ordered takeout of four sandwiches and a spinach pie - the total pre-tax was $17. With 10.25% sales tax, I knew my order would come out to $18.75. Somehow the woman ringing me up (after taking a few seconds to stare off into space and contemplate the total) gave me a total of nearly $19.50. Now, I'm not going to quibble the amount of .75 cents itself - the point is this, they have a fucking cash register in front of them which should be doing all the math - what's the problem here? This instance has happened to me several times (there have been exceptions, but they're few and far between). I've seen similar shenanigans when watching friends have their orders rung up as well - it makes me wonder just how much these guys are putting in extra at the end of the day if they're skimming a quarter or more extra than they should off of each customer. I know that I'm sounding like a stickler here and I acknowledge that most people won't notice or care when they get to the register, but it's still a valid point when one knows what it is they're SUPPOSED to be paying and what they END UP paying. The level of apathy the staff tends to display is a whole other can of worms altogether. If you don't mind a great falafel sandwich served up with a side of being treated like shit, then by all means - this is yr place!
