Full disclosure - ever since I read Carolynne R's fine review of Las Tablas, I had it bookmarked. So when my fellow Yelpian Space Cupcake T said he too had it bookmarked due to her review, we were off..... and skirt steak nirvana began. What a juicy, flavorful, addicting piece of meat! Both of us ordered the "very highly recommended Combinaciones" of the Entraa Skirt Steak (house specialty) and grilled pork loin, served with fried sweet plantain, yuca, and potato. As I love pork the best of any meats, I am hear to proclaim loud and clear "just get the skirt steak!" The pork loin was fine but that steak was just oozing with flavor and juiciness - one of the best I have ever had. As an appetizer, we ordered the Empanada Combination Plate - two of each type of empanada (beef, chicken, cheese). They were good, not the best I have ever had and I could take them or leave them.   One of the highlights of the evening was the Chimichurri sauces - both of which were divine. Our chatty and highly attentive server told us one was very hot but both the Cupcake and I thought the "hot" one (which was seriously not that hot) was the best, so don't be afraid to try it. Another highlight was the dessert we split - the Flan de Coco - Las Tablas' very own special, original recipe of the traditional Latin custard with a light hint of coconut and much denser than the flans I have had elsewhere. Acccompanied with fresh organic Colombian coffee, it was a perfect ending to a superb meal. Note to Las Tablas: thanks for all the Boteros! I can't remember the last time I walked around a restaurant with loads of chubby people paintings. I felt very much at home.
