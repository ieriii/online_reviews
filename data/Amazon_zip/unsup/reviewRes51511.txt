Hello! What happened here? Last time I was at Garcia's it was a smallish & plain mexican joint with good tacos and even better burritos. Now it's a...MUCH bigger and upscale looking restaurant. The taco's were as good as I remembered, and everyone else I was with seemed to be happy with what they got (tho no one had a burrito). So, I still give it a thumbs up, this is decent mexican fare. I will be back..
