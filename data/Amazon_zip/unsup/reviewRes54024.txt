Okay, I'll start with saying that I'm a cocktail snob, appetizer fiend and and desperately crave originality. That said, The Violet Hour has become one of my favorite places in this City.They had me at the lack of front window (or any other sign of existence beyond a single light bulb and knowledge that it was there before hand. I won't go over every detail about this spot (got to see for yourself) however, I will say... GET the fried peanut butter and banana sandwich and anything with gin in it. Oh yeah Absinthe. The real way man.GO!
