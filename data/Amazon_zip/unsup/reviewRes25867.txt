I've been coming to Pequod's for years and I have never been disappointed by how outstandingly delicious it is. The pizza arrives slowly, so come prepared to be patient and wait...It will be worth it, I promise. As everyone has already said, the crust is caramelized around the edge of the pan, and the sauce isn't on top. However, they haven't captured how much of an incredible experience this is; I have to exercise restraint to keep from skipping right to the crust and forgetting about the rest of the pizza! It's that good! The sauce is perfect. There's a nice balance with the sweet to savory ratio, which I feel like is a pretty delicate balance to walk when it comes to pizza sauce. Get the sausage. It's spicy and perfect, all blended in with the sauce and cheese and crusty goodness. They're also open pretty late, which is good if you're a procrastinator. :) Very well done, Pequod's!
