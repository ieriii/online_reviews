Pretty Cool Asian Fusion Restaurant....Ambience is Great - Service is Friendly - Nice Date Place. The Bloody Mary Bar was intersting and the Tea Buffet was different. Had Pancit, Loompya (funny way of Spelling Lumpia), Nasi Goreng and the Salmon Scrambled Egg Brunch dish. Tasty and Attractive presentation. Wouldn't say it is the greatest, but I'd come back :)
