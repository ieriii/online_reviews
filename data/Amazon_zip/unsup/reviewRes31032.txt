The Chicago Diner truly is Chicago's quintessential vegan dining experience. I've been in a number of times and have never been disappointed. Last night I brought my brother and a friend by to finally have a chance to try it out. We started with the basic hummus and pita bread. Beyond basic, but insanely good. They brought out extra pita bread for 50 cents, no biggie. For the main course I decided to get the chicken caesar wrap per the server's recommendation. I've gotten their black bean burgers before which were fantastic, so I wanted to try something new. The caesar wrap was amazing. It came with vegan dressing, cheese, seitan chicken, comfortably placed inside a spinach wrap. The seitan chicken was some of the best I've ever had. I think the best thing about being a vegetarian (slanting vegan!) is to be fooled by what you're eating. Awesome taste. For the side I got the always dependable sweet potato fries which are great. My guests both got the gyros which was equally tasty. Reviews complain about the "cramped" space. I think it's exciting that the Diner has retained it's original concept for beginning over 27 years ago. Wonderful food, fantastic service, and well priced. Huge fan. If you're a vegetarian/vegan there's no reason why you haven't stopped by yet. Take your carnivorous friends, too!
