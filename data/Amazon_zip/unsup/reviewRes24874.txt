I like to give stars, but this place deserves it. Live in the area? Or nearby? Hop on that Halsted bus and get your little (or big) bum to Artopolis for some Greek food lovin'. BUT save room for dessert!! They have this huge display case of mouthwatering pastries and more that is hard to say goodbye without eating one. It is nice cafe with good service and a nice wine selection. Try the stankinpita.
