Heard about this place for awhile so i finally went and checked it out with my wife and 3 other friends. BBQ of course needed to be ordered. Kalbi was better than the bulgogi, but both were excellent. The ban-chan were numerous and overall pretty tasty. We also ordered chap-chae, bi-bim-bap, soon-doo-bu, and kimchi bo-kum. All were very tasty. Service was above average as well. Pricing was about average, but overall the best Korean food I have had in Chicago. A warning for those of you who have never had Korean BBQ before. If you have clothing that you don't want to smell after eating (jackets, etc), leave them in the car. Everything else WILL smell like Korean BBQ and that's a guarantee!
