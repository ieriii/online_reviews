Great location! I used to walk by here all the time when I lived in Chi-town. For those of you who love their Starbucks, the chain store has displaced the former Zest. I was shocked, but I guess Starbucks turns more tables and makes more money than your average hotel restaurant. Last year we stayed here and had a lake view.  That room and bathroom was larger. This year, we got room 941 which is a corner room facing Michigan and Wacker in the distance.  Lovely view, esp. at night when the top of the Tribune tower changes color. The bathroom is smaller than I remember it to be, but no matter. We are usually out and about. My only complaint is that the bathroom doesn't have an exhaust fan. Love the huge mirror in the bedroom- if I could only get one for my home. The elevators are a PAIN, esp. during a busy, holiday weekend. The pool is a must visit because it is gorgeous. The bath products are now Floris (wonderful herbal scents, made in France, from the UK).
