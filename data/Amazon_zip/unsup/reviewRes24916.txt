The employees at Artopolis need to wash their hands. Seriously, no joke. I contracted a type of food-poisoning called "Shigella" from this place, and the most common way in which Shigella is spread is from anal-to-oral contact. One of the cooks must have had Shigella bacteria in their system, forgot to wash, and gave me a dumpload of bacteria in my potato salad. Lesson: don't eat the potato salad here. Just don't eat here period. P.S. Shigella is a type of dysentery which causes, amongst other things, bloody diarrhea and vomiting.
