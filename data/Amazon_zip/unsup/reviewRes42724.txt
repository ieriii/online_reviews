Walked in to order a spinach and ricotta pizza for delivery - they were rude, the restaurant was cramped and dirty, they delivered the pizza 40 min. late (90 min after we ordered), it was completely cold and had a HAIR in it! I will never ever go there again. Since I posted this review, the company has contacted me with an apology and offered a refund, which I appreciated. Hope that future patrons have a better experience than I did!
