We really liked this Diner, hidden in a strip of stores on Montrose, near the el stop. Primarily sea food and cereal, it has a true "diner' flavor with excellent service. The pan fried halibut was fantastic, as were the oysters. There are daily specials, Wednesday - most recently - was all you can eat ribs and Thursday was all you can peel and eat shrimp. Great selection of wines, too.
