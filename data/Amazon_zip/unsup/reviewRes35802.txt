SOOO glad they opened this on the Northside! Now I don't have to make the trek all the way down to Chinatown to get my fix of good roast duck and roast pork. You mean that $6 I got left from the strip club can get me a nice big plate of roast duck, roast pork and veggies over rice??? SOLLLLDDD!! Prices are cheap, dishes are overflowing and delish! What more can you ask for??
