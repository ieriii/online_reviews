I was visiting from Texas and was taken to the Little Bucharest Bistro for my birthday. We don't have original Romanian restaurants in Texas. I liked the personal touch from the owner and the waitress was in training. The food was authentic, delicious and well served. I am sure my relatives in Chicago who took us there will be regular customers.
