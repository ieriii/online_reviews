This. Place. Is. Awesome. Whenever I have a friend come into town and ask for some Chicago-style pizza, I have a simple, rehearsed response: "If you want the typical, touristy deep-dish, our options are limitless. If you want the best pizza and beer combo this city has to offer, I have a better place in mind." When my friends and family choose the latter option, we all leave happy, a bit too full, and buzzed. If you're feeling adventurous, two people can definitely finish a large pie. I'd go with roasted red pepper and onion on red, or spinach on white. Pick up a growler of the Worryin' Ale, and definitely grab a Dark n' Curvy when it's available.
