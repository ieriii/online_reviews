Although there's a lot of tourists that come through here, it's not half bad. I've only sat at the bar and knocked back a few flights, but it was a lovely pre-dinner (elsewhere) experience. I especially liked that when you ordered a flight, you got a corresponding "map/coaster" that outlined what you were drinking. I always forget what wine was what when I order flights.
