REVISED 1/26/07 This USED to be one of my favourite sushi places. I have eaten there a total of 8 times. It seems that the food is getting progressively WORSE. For two people inc tip the bill was $94. For $94 and none of it going to booze the meal should be awesome, but it was not even close.  They sat us in the front next to the valet box shoved into the window area and froze the entire meal. Don't even try to ask for a new table...no way. Our rolls were so meager in portions it was disgusting. The white dragon roll was a hair larger than a sharpie, and I'm not joking. The eel that topped our other roll was about as thick as construction paper and waaay overcooked. The tuna appetizer and the soup were tasty, but the soup was served in a cauldron like bowl with a worthless wooden spoon you could barely use. If it wasn't my girlfriend's birthday dinner I would have complained. Instead I had to hold my tongue grrr.......
