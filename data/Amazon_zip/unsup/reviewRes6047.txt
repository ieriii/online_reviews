I've been to Davanti twice and will definitely going back again. The first time our waitress was absolutely wonderful- knowledgeable, patient as a group of 6 ladies figured out what to order, and friendly. The second visit our waiter was rude, inattentive, and no help at all- we had to ask *him* what the specials were, for refills, for suggestions, to take our order, etc (this time only a group of 3). One thing that *is* consistent...the food & atmosphere. Even on a weeknight you are guaranteed a great vibe- our hour wait at the bar, flew by (not to mention the $3 beers on Thursdays!). A few of my favorite things: Burrata vasi (soft cream filled mozzarella with evoo, sea salt & warm toast), the mascarpone polenta & ragu of the day (the table presentation is a nice touch and both times the ragu was fantastic), Pizza DOC & pizza with arugula- both very good, the rigatoni with sausage, risotto with peas. The small portions allow room to try a lot of menu items without filling up to quickly. It's great to be able to share & taste a bit of everything. Pros: atmosphere (large open air windows), dcor, and food Cons: no valet, street parking difficult, inconsistent service
