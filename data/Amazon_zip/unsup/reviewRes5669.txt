Holy Pig Heaven! We had a wonderful array of dishes to share. Bone marrow, deep fried pig ears, sauteed ramps and green onions, whipped feta with cucumbers, herb salad, mussels, wagyu meatball slider, pig tails and more. We were prepared to order more, but the waiter cut us off. We initially thought, "how rude", but he knows his stuff. There is no way we could have eaten more. Service was quick and efficient, despite the restaurant being filled to the rafters. Extensive wine list.
