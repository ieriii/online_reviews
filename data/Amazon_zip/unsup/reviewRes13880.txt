Pretty good -- but not "dios mio!" -- Cubano sandwiches. Haven't found one in Chicago yet that tops the ones I could get in NJ. But combine a decent Cubano with good prices and great, friendly service, and that's why I dig making the occasional visit to 90 Miles. The inside seating is counter/stools only, and they have a nice outside patio with many tables. Can't speak to the other menu items other than the empanadas, which were really good (don't think I've ever had a bad empanada, but that's besides the point...). But the empanadas and the Cubanos were both good enough that I'll be making more visits and exploring more of the menu. I'd recommend the place.
