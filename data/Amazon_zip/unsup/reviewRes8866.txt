It's just OK. The only real reason to choose this place over any of the other options is the area is the outdoor seating in the summer. The pizza tastes alright, but it's usually pretty soggy in the middle. Nothing else really stands out or justifies the prices. I prefer Pizza D.O.C. on Lawrence for basic family-style brick oven pizza and italian staples.
