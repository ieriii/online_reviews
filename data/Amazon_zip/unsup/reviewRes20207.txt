I went to Coast recently for a friends birthday and had a great time! Everyone like the food and it was not too expensive. The sushi was fresh and the dessert was amazing!! We all ordered several plates of Mochi, which is by far one of the best desserts I have ever had! The ambiance of this place is casual and fun for any occasion. I chose it also because it is BYOB!! The only draw back of this place was that when we went it was very busy on a Saturday and somewhat felt rushed to leave by our waitress. So when you go make sure you are on time. Overall though, I will definitely be going back soon!
