So, my husband and I tried Spacca Napoli for the first time about a month ago and we have been there three times now. Even though it's slightly out of our neighborhood it is totally worth the drive and a short hunt for parking. We first ventured there as we were trying to burn through some of our unused a la card deck coupons from 2010. In our first trip, we immediately agreed upon the Bianco Nero (without the mushrooms). We are suckers for truffle oil in about anything. Yeah it is so cliche, I know, but really, truffle oil on pizza, how can it be bad? Obviously, it's great because we have ordered it every time since. Our first trip there, we also shared the Tartufo for dessert, YUM! We tried to get the Tartufo again on our second trip, but they were out of it. So far, that has been our only disappointment.  Tonight, we went back again with another couple and we all shared the Bianco Nero and the Margherita. Once again, we were quite satisfied. I only wish we weren't so in love with the Bianco Nero so we could test some of the other pizzas as well. Oh well. As we left they were handing out free cannoli. For years I thought I hated cannoli and I nearly passed up the offer. Apparently I was wrong because hours later I still want more. (It was so delicious it even took my mind off of the Bianco Nero for a while) I really hope they add this to the menu because they were amazing. Additionally, we have always had wonderful service there and I love the atmosphere. It is very relaxed and seems to be family friendly, while still being cozy enough to enjoy on date night.
