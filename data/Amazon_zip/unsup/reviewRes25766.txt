I usually head north to Argyle street for Vietnamese but I friend suggested we give this place a try after seeing it on Chicago's Best. I am glad that I did for several reasons...love the byob factor and the service was great. Now on to the food...we started with the tamarind soup, shared the whole red snapper (it was fried perfectly) and the beef and asparagus. Perfect balance of spices within all of the dishes and the servings were generous. After I tapped out and was headed for a food coma the server walks up with a dessert plate, I was quick to tell him we did not order one...he smiled and told me it was complimentary. I was shocked...fried bananas, strawberry ice cream, whipped cream and fruit were on the plate...such a nice way to end the experience. I will be back for sure...the menu was huge and with that level of customer service I will not hesitate to give it another try!
