Ambiance: very romantic. Excellent for a 5th date... It takes a longgg time to eat here, so thus- 5th date better be someone you know you can talk to for a while! It took us about 2.5 hours to eat. Food- this is where I struggle because the food provided was of excellent quality but it's all not cooked. I.e it's nothing different from what you buy at the grocery store. And if anything is over or under cooked... Well that's your own fault but also part of the fun. The cheese fondue was very rich.. Too rich I think.. Could only eat a few bites before it was too overwhelming. Grapes and hot cheese- ick. Same with apples. The 8 dipping sauces were good, but again, nothing house specialty- I can get this at a grocery store. The choc fondue course was the coolest especially the flamb portion and the smores were sooo good- somehow better than those roasted at a campfire. They had a very nice selection of pound cake ad fruit- very good. Price- I struggle with the value I'm getting ecause literally i could do this myself at home minus the ambiance. Paying these prices I would hope I'm getting food prepared in ways that I dream about for days because i can't recreate it at home. But it's not the case here. This is a place you should go at least once... But not that worth it to go again.
