Ok I must nerdily admit my favorite memory of Pequods was buying a pizza while me a friend were waiting in line to see the last Star Wars movie across the street. I brought the pie back and everybody in line was instantly jealous. We shared some of the pizza to pretty girls that asked for it.. yes we are horrible people. But at least I didn't resort to using a dog. Well at any rate. Pequods thin crust is decent to good. Pequod's pan pizza, is actually what you want. They do a good job with the ingredients, sauce is good. Its worth the wait, very good pizza and a very nice bar to catch a drink in. The pizza is unique as the caremalize (burn) some cheese on the edges of all their pies, some people don't like this, but I don't mind. Eating in can get very busy and I have never lived close enough for delivery, so can't comment on that.
