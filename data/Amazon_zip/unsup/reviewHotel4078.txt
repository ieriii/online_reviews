It's rare that I'll give a hotel 5 stars. To be quite honest, I probably wouldn't give them that fifth star, if it weren't for the following situation: Last Thursday, I came down with the flu. I was planning on staying at my apartment, but my landlord still hadn't left for Singapore. I went back to the Hyatt after making new reservations. The concierge (who, at this point recognised me by sight because I've slept in their bed more than I did in my New York apartment) took one look at me and asked me if I needed some medication. I got to my room, and within five minutes, he'd personally brought up Tylenol, because he didn't want to have the usual 5-10min delay that would happen if he had housekeeping do it. Yes, he got a nice letter written for him afterwards :) Another story: 2 colleagues and I were staying at this hotel. Since I was staying longer (did I mention I spent more nights in the Hyatt than I did anywhere else this month?) than them, we were on separate reservations. They screwed up their room -- they gave them what is basically a party suite -- one bed in one room and the other room had bunch of couches with a pull-out bed. They were upgraded immediately to the executive floor, with zero hassles. I guess they wanted to keep our hotwire.com-based business ;) To be fair, the rooms are slightly dated -- no LCD TVs, lacking iPod docks in every room, etc. Even the executive floor (don't know about the suites) look a little dated, though they are nicer. The beds are comfortable, though, and the view can be great if you're lucky -- either to Millenium Park or towards the Maginificent Mile.
