God. It's so hard not to compare this place to Kuma's Corner. I have no idea what their inspiration was when they opened this place, but if Kuma's was in mind at all, then this is one damn fine pastiche. I came here with a rather large party recently after we were basically turned away from Kuma's for having more than six people. I should have known, as I have been to Kuma's a million times. We all wanted burgers, so Lockdown was an obvious choice. We basically walked right in at like noon on a Sunday, so that's nice. I had "The Federales" which is spicy peppers, chorizo, fried egg, hot sauce, and pepper mayo. I'm a fan of spicy burgers and burgers with pork on them, and this didn't disappoint at all. Also, the fries are amazing, or maybe it's just the dipping sauce---it's a garlicky hot aioli. Damn good. I could eat potato chips or any sort of potato really, with that sauce alone. I also like that mac and cheese can be ordered as a small side in place of fries, and not just an entire entree. The beer selection is amazing. Mostly local craft beers like Goose Island, Half Acre, and Two Brothers, but it was also nice to see a couple old standbys like Stella, and a hipsterly classic Schlitz. I felt that the whiskey selection was kind of lacking unfortunately. To me, whiskey, beer, and burgers all go together, so if there was anything for improvement on the drink side of things, that would probably be it. Overall, it's a good burger spot. The "jail/prison" theme of it is a little unique and definitely different, but the burgers deliver, the location is pretty good, and the wait is nonexistent. Lastly, despite the fact that it's often compared and grouped with Kuma's, it IS a different place and it does have it's own vibe, a bit of a different menu, and a much different experience, good in it's own right. If you like burgers and beer, you will not be disappointed.
