I stopped into Coast about a month ago. My brother was in town and is a BIG fan of sushi so my boyfriend and I decided that we'd splurge on dinner that night. All the rolls that came out were fantabulous! Not one complaint. Everything was fresh and the wine we brought paired very well with our meal. The only dilemma was the service, as it was a Saturday night, and our waitress forgot to attend to our table on several requested occasions. Aside from the poor service the food was great.
