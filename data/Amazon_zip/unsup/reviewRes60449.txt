Restaurant charged a $2.50 per person fee to cut a cake we brought for a birthday. On the phone we were told it was just $1.50, which is still ridiculous, but oh, well. Then we got slammed with the $2.50 ending up to be about $30 total. That's just TOO WRONG. Needless to say, it is place I would not miss by not going.
