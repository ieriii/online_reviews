The Gage is my favorite place in this touristy area of Chicago, and it's a great place to bring out-of-towners for dinner or a drink. The beer selection is great, and I usually like to sit at the bar and have a few appetizers, especially the Poutine (fries with elk ragout and cheese curds)...ok, that sounds kinda gross but it's delish. Last night we also had the duck fat nuts and Wagyu steak salad....all great. Service is friendly and efficient...and the bar is usually crowded and loud, and one of the funnest spots in town. Outdoor seating is excellent for people-watching. Steer clear of the $10 burger...I have to assume the more expensive Gage Burger is better, but I've never had it. The fish and chips are very good. So check out The Gage after your touristy afternoon at Millennium Park or Art Institute for a great meal or a quick bite of quality food and a few good beers.
