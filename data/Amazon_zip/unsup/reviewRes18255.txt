Awesome draft beer selection and rockin' sandwiches at this upscale local hangout. The scene isn't dressy, but the ambiance of the Bad Apple is a notch up from your average neighborhood bar. A great place to meet up for any occasion. Staff is extremely friendly, personable, and professional. Really nice people running the bar.
