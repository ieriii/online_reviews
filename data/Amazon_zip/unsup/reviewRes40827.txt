My girlfriend and I went here recently after a trip to the beach, and once again Tank Noodle shoots and scores! Keep meaning to try their Pho, but still haven't... but there will be other days. This day, I decided to try something that I saw on my last visit, but didn't try out of consideration for my other dining companions since it is a VERY strange dish to Western sensibilities. I had their BBQ Pork sandwich and their Pig Innards Congee (AKA: "Uber-mega Pork Explosion OVERLOAD" rice soup). As you may have read in my Smoque restaurant review, I grew up the son of a hog farmer and have been raised around pork my whole life... so I know my pork dear readers. So when opportunity arises to taste a delicacy that I have not had since I was a child, I jumped on it. The pork sandwich was very good, kinda strange with all the veggies on it, kinda like a Chicago style hot dog in that respect, but it was very tasty! The pork Congee had the following (disclaimer for those with unadventurous appetites and who may be squicked out by pig parts) -Pork meat, pork heart, pork liver, pork tripe (intestines), uncured bacon, pork sausage, and blood cake (think tofu or jello made out of pigs blood) and little pieces of fried pork skin as a garnish. Don't say I didn't warn you. But man was it ever good! It has been a long time since I had pig heart and I enjoyed almost every bit of the soup! The only part of the soup I didn't care for was the blood cake. The texture was very strange and unpleasant and the taste was a bit too bland, yet had an iron aftertaste. All in all, another excellent dining experience at the Tank Noodle! Still need to try the Pho one of these days though.
