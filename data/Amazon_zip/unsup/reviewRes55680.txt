The staff is COMPLETELY RUDE and they do not seem to care if they get business or not. I gave them a second chance today, and again they were so incredibly rude that we left and will not go back. They also refuse to let you take a stroller inside or outside to eat. How, exactly, do you bring a newborn to eat if you can't have a stroller? They are not family-friendly or friendly at all. Thanks to the internet, we can warn people before they waste their time or money.
