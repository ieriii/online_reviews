This is a great place for a date, girls night out, or a group dinner. The menu is so eclectic and very intricate. There are so many great choices on the menu that you can't go wrong. Their paella is my favorite and I haven't found a place that tops it. Their guacamole is different and very yummy, the chips are a little salty though. As for their mojitos, absolutely delicious! Stay away from the bellinis, those are not so yummy. Definitely would recommend this!
