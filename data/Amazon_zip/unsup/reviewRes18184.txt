If I have learned anything in my years of trying new places, it's to ask the staff what the best thing they make is and order that. If you go here. Do that. Or waiter says the gnocchi was tops here. He was right. I got the gnocchi special. Like little pillows of awesomeness filled with asiago and something else. Very good. Why then am I only giving it 3 stars? Well to start, my the rest of my friends' pasta was just mediocre. I woulda been irritated if mine was too - considering it was over the $20 mark.  And the service wasnt that great either. But the topper was the 20%+ tip that was automatically applied to our check. 18% - okay, and we'll usually tip over that but to have 20+ added automatically when service was just okay put me over the edge.
