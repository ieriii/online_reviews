Great eats & great atmosphere. I came here on a work trip and Yolk accomidated our group & per diem. I came back on vacation and loved it again. The shanas delight (yogurt&granola) was awesome and not a usual order for me. It came with a apple cinn muffin which I got grilled. The second trip I had the "southern Benny" it was a bit spicy but I lined that. It is special but not overpriced. Love Yolk!
