I am a big fan of cheesecake factory- so this is an ideal place to eat! similar menu- delicious dishes with huge portions If you are also a fan of carrot cake- you must try it here! It was the best I have ever tried.... I love coming here for a awesome late lunch and getting coffee and cake Also the location makes it awesome... after enjoying a late lunch, just stroll over and watch a movie for some down time...or walk and shop to burn the extra calories you just ingested...
