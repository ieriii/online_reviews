I'm no expert on Mexican/Cuban food, so I can't say how "authentic" this place is, but who cares -- it's delicious. First off, $8 mojitos (and nice-size ones, too). Second, bacon wrapped dates. I know it's not exactly the most creative dish, but it's a classic (and for good reason). Third, chicken. Yes, chicken at a restaurant is not usually the most interesting choice. But it's so worth it - pistachio crusted, goat and port sauce...over mashed potatoes?! Yes, please. One of the best dishes I've had in a while. And I couldn't help ordering a side of plantains. Yum yum. Bonus: it couldn't be closer to the brown line.
