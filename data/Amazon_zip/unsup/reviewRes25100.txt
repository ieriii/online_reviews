Artopolis used to be my favorite cafe in the city, but a lackluster experience Friday night has opened the door for new contenders. My food arrived lukewarm. Whatever, it happens sometimes, I let it go.The waitress pretty much ignored us all night. Again, not a huge deal, at least we got our (lukewarm) food. We still left her a very nice tip. My experience was ruined when a dark haired male employee came over and rudely told me to get my leg off the other chair at my table. Leaning a blue jean clad leg against a wooden chair doesn't harm the restaurant's property in any way. If their concern was that my posture would somehow distract other patrons, they should have also been more worried about the screeching child at the next table. You would think that a cafe would want its customers to be comfortable; essentially demanding that they sit up straight is inappropriate, bizarre and outright rude. Overall, it was a very disappointing and embarrassing experience. I've had many enjoyable meals at Artopolis, so being verbally assaulted over something nonsensical by the staff was a surprise. If you are looking to be treated with respect, that is apparently no longer a priority at Artopolis. I'm considering giving them a second chance, but in the meantime am accepting suggestions for a new cafe to frequent.
