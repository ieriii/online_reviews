I'm not a huge fan of Greek food to begin with. Even when I visited Greece last summer, I was not blown away by the food. This particular restaurant though was definitely underwhelming. For my entree, I got pretty standard Greek fare of baked shrimp with tomato sauce over rice. The shrimp was not fresh by any means, which warrants 2 stars in my book, not to mention that the dish overall was too salty.
