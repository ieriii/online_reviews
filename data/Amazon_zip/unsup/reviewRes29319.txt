The Chicago diner has some of the best vegetarian food I have ever tried. I ordered the Southern and it was fantastic. The buffalo wings had a nice crisp to follow the delicious buffalo sauce. The mac and cheese was also delectable. The meal was relatively big, but sadly I did not feel very full afterwards. Regardless, I'll definitely be returning to try some of the other plates they have to offer at this fine establishment.
