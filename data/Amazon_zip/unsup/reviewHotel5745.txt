I got a discounted price through a third party, so it is easier to give this place a great review. It was a very comfortable and clean hotel and the staff was quite friendly. Wi-fi in the room is free, but you have to sign up and renew every 24 hours, which is weird. I booked through a third party that said that this hotel was in the "Magnificent Mile" neighborhood. It's really not, especially if you're carrying shopping bags, but cab fare in Chicago is pretty reasonable. Also, the Greektown restaurants just down the street from the hotel are fabulous. All in all, a really good hotel - just don't pay full price.
