I love hummus and there hummus is the best I have had thus far. I like to add siracha to it. Their gyros are good I just don't like cucumbers. My good friend took me here on my vacation and since I first went their I have been back many times and I live in Kansas City. While I am here I crave the food at Sultan's. The employees are nice and I like the outdoor seating area.
