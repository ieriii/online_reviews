This place is really quite cute. I went here for brunch this weekend and really thought everything looked good - the space (small, but nice) and then menu. The service was fine, not the friendliest, but fine. My friends both got pancake dishes that looked great. I got a portabello and gruyere crepe which sounded fantastic but fell a little short. The actual crepe was meh but the cheese was not melted at all. It was just laying in there in strips. It tasted ok but it just sort of turned me off. If I go again, I think pancakes are the way to go.
