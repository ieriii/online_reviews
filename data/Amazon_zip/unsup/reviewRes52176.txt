Deep dish pizza ... OMG I just cant get over the experience. Pretty much I forced myself to eat the pizza since it took 45 minutes and cost $20+! Many people seemed to love it and I will never know why. Probably because I am a thin slice pizza fanatic. I tried another deep dish pizza again at the O'Hare Airport and I thought that was better... I still dont get it. I probably need to try their other pizza again just to be fair. On the other hand, the buffalo wings and beer were delicious!
