the wait was no joke. wednesday evening, 1.5 hour wait. at points we considered leaving, but stuck around and were thrilled we did. we had about 8 to 10 different dishes and each one was packed with flavor. everything was perfectly seasoned and prepared, quite delicious. standouts: fried brussel sprouts, butternut squash, pig's ear with kale & milk braised pork shoulder. next time i'll skip dessert and order more of the fried items ;)
