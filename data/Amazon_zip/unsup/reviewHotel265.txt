As a single traveler (well, OK, I do have my teddy bear with me), it's hard to sometimes find cost-effective hotels to stay, especially in city centres. I've become more discerning in deciding the important things in a hotel over the years I've been traveling. Where I used to prioritise a swimming pool and not swim, I now look for proximity to public transport and an internet connection. Seneca Suites is an older hotel reflected in its dark wooden decor but its location a block east of the Magnificent Mile is its outstanding feature. It's 4 blocks from the Chicago Red line station. My room was huge - separate bedroom, living room and kitchen. Teddy and I could almost have a room each! Although I ate out on this trip, the kitchen would certainly allow self catering to cut down on costs. I didn't suffer the problems mentioned in other reviews - the water was hot for my showers and the decor wasn't worn out. The free wifi was fast and reliable. There were 2 big TVs with a great range of channels - yup, I was stuck on the Food channel most of the time. Seneca was a bargain for this part of town
