Tasty food, thoughtful menu, slightly anxiety-inducing process (wait here, order there, take this number, sit here. But it was a quick and delicious lunch that I'd be glad to repeat. My "torta from the griddle" with pounded-thin breaded chicken, black beans, and pickled jalapenos was perfectly proportioned - including a little extra bread to dip in the tomatillo-avocado salsa. The staff were slightly disinterested in the guests - but perhaps because they were working hard and fast - and more people were in the way than anyone would have wished. The food was great, relatively inexpensive, and worth fighting against the lunch crowd that descended before we left.
