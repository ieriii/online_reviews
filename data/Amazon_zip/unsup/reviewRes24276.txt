My boyfriend and I stopped in back in June after an afternoon at the beach and enjoyed their cream of mushroom soup & split the savory Icosium Crepe (roasted bell peppers, goat cheese, arugula, caramelized onions, fresh Roma tomatoes, pine nuts, roasted garlic, and baby spinach). They kindly served our split meal on separate plates. It was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. There was so much I wanted to try. I definitely will be back.
