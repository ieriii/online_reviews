For our monthly brunch get-together, my girlfriend recommended trying Longman & Eagle. I took a pre-visit menu check and was pleasantly surprised at the great farm-to-table approach and unique combinations. I am pleased to say that I was not let down today! Chosing an entree off that menu was tough, but we both loved our choices. I had the chicken and waffles with sweet potato pork belly hash while my friend enjoyed the prawns with cheese grits, collard greens, and black pepper sauce. We both tried their "weekend punch" which proved to be a delicious concoction of red wine, rum, brandy, and some aromatics. Should you make a visit for brunch, I highly recommend going before 11 am. Since we never know how to leave, I noticed it really began to draw quite the crowd around 11:30. Sit at the bar. The bartenders are extremely jovial, conversational, and hilarious to listen to. Overall, Longman & Eagle gets a rave review from both of us and we will definitely be back to try more delicious brunch and to check out dinner. My only qualm, parking is dreadful, but hell, that's Logan Square for you. Take the train.
