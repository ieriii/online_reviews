Amazing wines, especially when you order flights and then chose the one you prefer... Amazing cheeses (and I'm French, so I think I know what I'm talking about). Charcuterie plate was quite decent and the duck confit tasted like home. Very nice staff, helpful and friendly. They just lose one star for the quantities served for the price... They could definitely make an effort on this side.
