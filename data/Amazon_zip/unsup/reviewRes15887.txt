Cool, hip, classy, and mysterious. How fun. After reading many yelp reviews and hearing about this place by a lot of locals, we went off on our search for the Chicago speakeasy, the Violet Hour. Only having an address, we got dropped off on the north side, and proceeded to wait outside a random wall which happened to have a door to it (didn't look like it). By the time we got inside, the tall curtains draped the inside. What in the world??? It doesn't matter where you wait in line- they seat by number of people, so, if you're trying to get seated earlier, just grab people for the number called it and go inside. Once inside, the inside looks like..an upscale diner, with a chandelier and cool music. You can get seated in these dark booths, and the menu is definitely unique. I got The Clapless Belle. Whoooo... be aware, their drinks are rather strong. Good though, I must say. All the drinks are unique and made there, so you'll get a quality drink, no matter what. It's a little loud to my liking, but nonetheless, a great place to go after dinner or on a date. You're not allowed to use your cell phone inside too (thank goodness) as the house rules say on a sign before you enter the place. Cool, hip, mysterious, classy. I like.
