The cuisine at Calo is pretty freakin' solid. I had some gnocci dish that was excellent. It loses a star because of their decor; it is some cross between a lovely Italian restaurant and a sports bar. Their kitchen is open fairly late, making it one of a few options available to me after getting off work at my serving job. The waiter was pretty decent, seeming to try to rush us a bit because he wanted to get the hell out of there. Who can blame him for that though?
