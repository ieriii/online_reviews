I've been here more times than I can count and it's always good. But I decided to write this review today for one reason. I went to Piece and did something crazy...I broke away from the norm. When you go to a restaurant repeatedly, you tend to fall into a groove. You order the same thing you always order cause you know it's gonna be good. But a friend talked me into something different today. I always order the regular red pizza, but today we tried new haven style! And boy was I rewarded with yumminess. The new haven style is AWESOME. If you've never tried it, you should check it out next time. The mozzarella is not missed a bit. It has the perfect amount of garlic. It's generally just delicious. Piece is a trusted old standby, and today I was reminded to trust them. They know what they're doing...you can't go wrong. PS It's worth the often 2-hour wait.
