Consistently good food (a new menu!) but crowded and loud. Fortunately, the staff seems friendlier - like they actually appreciate your business. Two in the group had soups - and these are man-sized meals. Neither could be finished even though both guys eating them have quite the appetite! We also had beef and chicken stir-fried dishes. The meat is tender and a good cut (low fat). Seasoning is well done allowing the flavor of the meats and vegetables to come through.  Overall, a consistent go-to.
