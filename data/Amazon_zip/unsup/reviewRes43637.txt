i've been coming to this place pretty regularly for about three years, ever since i moved to the bucktown/wicker park area. and, in fact, since i've moved to wicker park proper about a year ago, i come here twice a week on average. the quality of the food here is reliably high, with quite a variety of option. there's vegetarian option, american-style fare, lots of drink (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), plenty of desserts, and even a rick bayless-informed cereal for sale to-go. all of it is good and i really can't say i've had a bad dish here. service is very quick, too. just for kicks, i did a "find search" in my web browser on the front page of milk & honey's yelp page, which probably holds about 15 to 20 of their most recent reviews. i am not surprised to find 6 instances of the word "rude" within these first listings. the cashier staff at milk & honey very often are rude. it is rude not to make eye contact with your customers (especially when you charge $12 for a scone and a bowl of yogurt & granola). it is rude to not smile at your customers at least once out of every twenty visits. it is rude not to acknowledge your customers when they thank you for their change and your service. and it's rude to cut someone off with a "is that it?" after they've ordered a dish but before they've ordered a beverage. while the place likely has the luxury of being rude towards its guests precisely because of the quality of their product (and, as a result, a reliable and consistent stream of revenue), their intense impatience is transparent. ridiculously busy on the weekends. in fact, pretty busy all the time. best bet is to go between noon and 3/4pm (when they close).
