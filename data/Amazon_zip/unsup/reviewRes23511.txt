I recently saw Icosium Kafe on Check, Please! and wondered why the diners on the show practically raved about their experience. Maybe it was an off day for me and/or the restaurant, but I didn't share quite the same feelings. It was lunch on a Monday when my friend and I arrived. Upon entering, I scanned the restaurant and found the decor to be pretty interesting and the noise level to be awkwardly quiet. There was no music playing - which is not a must for every restaurant but I honestly felt weird talking a little bit above normal conversation volume. Also, I remember the lights being turned off which I thought was strange. I know it was lunchtime and the sun was out, but that was not enough lighting for this place. That accompanied by the noise level made you feel like the restaurant was closed for the day and you were intruding. All that aside, I ordered the Chicago Crepe with Algerian lamb sausage while my friend had the Icosium Crepe with chicken. Both were flavorful, but nothing out of this world. Our meals came with a side of soup which were pretty good and we also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes which were nothing special. For dessert, we had a crepe filled with nutella, which again, was just ok. There was a lot of waiting around for having just one other table being served and the waitress was not very attentive. The water they served us was luke warm and there was no ice, which was a big no-no for me because I'm a HUGE ice eater and water not served cold just tastes plain nasty. Also, midway through our meal we found a gnat crawling in one of the crepes and another in the side dish. I don't know how or why they got in our food, but that was just not acceptable and I stopped eating. For the prices, I would expect better taste, service, and ambiance, but looking at other reviews it might have been an off day..a really off day for almost making me chew on the probably nutritious, but otherwise unwanted insects.
