This is easily my favorite steak place in town. The best thing about it, for me, is that I've never had to pay. Given that it's pretty expensive, I would suggest going for lunch when it's half price. That being said, I would absolutely pay full price any time. All you can eat steak is great. The salad bar COULD be worth the price of admission, but I would try to control yourself as you will fill up quickly on all the different kinds of meat.
