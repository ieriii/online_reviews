Oh RJ Grunts. I love you. Went here again a few weeks ago and tried something different. No - I did not try the salad bar. Being raised in a Greek household, my concept of salad is really different from most Americans. I am a minimalist when it comes to salads: cucumber, tomato, onion, lettuce, MAYBE some cheese. I like avocado occasionally also. And cabbage. I digress.. the point is salad bars are not that appealing to me and it is nothing against RJ grunts famed salad bar - I just love other things on the menu much much more. So this time, I broke away from my burger craze, and chose to order the Santa Fe wrap. Another one of my obsessions besides sushi = wraps. If there is a wrap on the menu, i'm ordering it. I was NOT disappointed with the santa fe wrap - in fact I think I actually fell in love with it right then and there. It was the perfect combination of flavor and spice - and did i mention it has guacamole in it? Yes, I will be giving my RJ Grunt burger craze a rest and will be ordering the Santa Fe AGAIN the next time I go there. Love.
