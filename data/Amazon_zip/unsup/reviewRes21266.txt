Superdawg was pretty good and it was a cool novelty especially since we don't have anything like that in LA. I had the superdawg and it was pretty delicious. I think Chicago got it right with the poppy seed buns. It's pretty ingenous. I also like that they are opened late. However, cash only? Maybe they need a little bit of an update. And we also ordered a cheeseburger which was not a good choice at all. The condiments they added were just not right. Was it relish? I am not sure but it definitely did not belong there. Also, the fries are advertised as amazing and they were pretty average. Overall, it was good and I'll definitely come back. It was good and that's it.. not expectacular.
