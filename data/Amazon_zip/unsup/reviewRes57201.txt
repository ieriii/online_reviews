I discovered this restaurant last year. Friends of ours had suggested this would be a great place to meet before a concert. Well, I am always looking for something different and I have found it. I have included Carnivale to my list of the best places to eat. The atmosphere is just wonderful. Even if there is a table available my husband and I like to sit at the bar for just one drink and enjoy before we sit down to eat. I love to watch the bartenders make their speciality drinks. The food is fabulous too. I always get the skirt steak and venture off when I order appetizers. I just love the fish tacos too. I had been raving about this restaurant to my family and we all decided to take my mom for her birthday. We did not have reservations and just headed there. When we got there the place was packed. They actually found us a table just right in the bar area which was fine with us (even though I love sitting in the main seating area because it is so beautiful) but I was impressed and was glad to sit there. My family loved it also. Two thumbs up!!!!
