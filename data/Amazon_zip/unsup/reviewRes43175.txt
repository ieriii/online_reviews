On my most recent trip to Chicago, I wanted to do two things: Go to the 'Home Alone' house and eat really amazing Chicago-style pizza. Luckily I was able to do both of those things. After spending a bit of time doing some serious pizza research, I decided to go to The Art of Pizza. The name alone stood out from all the other pizza places, which probably helped me make the best pizza decision I have ever made to date. We arrived and ordered two pies. One plain cheese and one vegetarian. After 40 minutes of waiting, we got our pies and the most amazing pizza experience begun. First off, I'm a HUGE fan of sauce on top... Just that switchup really transforms pizza. It automatically becomes a better pizza experience when sauce is on top. Sauce is the most important ingredient in my opinion. The sauce at art of pizza was absolutely wonderful. Really good balance of spices, sweet and tangy. The cheese was also on par. Also, I am not a crust guy, but the crust at art of pizza was good and I actually ate my crust this time. I noticed everyone but me and my friends were using forks and knives to eat their pizza, which was a horrid sight! Pizza should never be eaten with any utensil. It is purely for hands only. I was proud to get my hands a little messy. Sauce loss was initially a problem but then when I was down to the crust, I just dipped it into the sauce all over my plate. It was great. Anyways this place ruled and I was so happy with my decision to go there. They really know the art of a great pizza. I am now refraining from pizza because I want to keep that as my last pizza experience.
