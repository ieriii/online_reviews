Before I actually went to this place, I had hesitations that maybe this food wouldn't be super great but just super gimmicky. After going to this place, I can tell you that all the strange stuff you hear about isn't gimmicky at all. Everything that's done to food at Alinea is done to make it taste better. I loved my dinner here.
