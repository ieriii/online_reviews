Coast is delicious! I visited there for the second time Friday night and couldn't help but fall in love even more with the decor and fun atmosphere. Pros: Perfect for a big group, we came with 6 and once we were seated our very knowelagable and sweet waiter was super quick. He told us this was his third waiting job at a sushi place and recommended the right stuff for us. The ginger salad is also huge and well worth the $5. I would also recommend the Sunrise Roll (Mango, Tuna and Mint)! It is so refreshing and not to filling. One con: Our reservation was already late at 9:30 and we got seated at 10:15 but being a BYOB and allowing us to have a few of our drinks made that seem less annoying. I am also not a fan that a lot of there rolls have tempura crumb on top....something I am not in to. Overall, this place is pretty delicious and a perfect place to take out of town guests and show them sushi in Chicago. I would definitely recommend a reservation and bringing your own bottle!
