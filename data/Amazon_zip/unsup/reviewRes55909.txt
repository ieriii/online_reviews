Well worth the above normal prices considering you don't have to go all the way to Devon St to get excellent authentic Indian Food. The quality and selection of the lunch buffet is by the far the best I've ever seen short of the Indian Restaurants in London. From mini-samosas to chicken tikka masala, there is something for everyone...and surprisingly, a large selection of vegetarian entrees as well.I have not yet had dinner here, but it is one of my favorite spots for lunch....
