I think I've been to every location. I love trying new restaurants, but sometimes going back to what I consider classics is necessary and Wildfire never lets me down.  The chopped salad has a taste that I crave, it's just so good! My favorite dish there has to be the macadamia crusted halibut - they don't have it year round and I miss it when it is not offered. They usually have some other nut crusted fish, which are good, but not as good as the halibut. Mashed potatoes are a must as a side. Everything is delicious there - I have never had a bad meal there. Ever.  Overall it is reasonably priced for the deliciousness that it serves.
