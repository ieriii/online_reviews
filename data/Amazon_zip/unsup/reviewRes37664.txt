My most favorite place to go for mussels and a delicious beer (or four). You will be astounded and blissfully happy when you see the beer selection, and your taste buds will be tantalized if you decide to stay for dinner (which will give you the added pleasure of a roomy table in the dining area instead of the often-overcrowded bar area). Best tip I can give you: Get the mussels... Belgian style!
