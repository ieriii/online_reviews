This is a beautiful restaurant. The ambiance, the music, and the food. Sometimes I have had a good server and sometimes I have had a server that only depends on the people that carry around the different meats. This place will have you overeating, cuz the quality of food is there, and they also have a huge buffet that comes with the dinner. YOu are definitely paying good money to eat here, but you definitely will not leave this place with an empty stomach. I have been there 3 times and I am sure I will be back again.
