I came here last fall with my fellow employees and our employer and I have never been happier. I am a true carnivore so imagine my enthrallment when I walked into a restaurant that has spiced meats on rotisserie sticks being escorted through the dining room and shaved freshly on to my plate, and all that I had to do was have my little green coaster in plain site! All you can eat meat for about $60 per person? Be still, my heart! Don't forget to try their extensive salad bar, never pass on the sides of fried pallentas with parmesan and garlic mashed potatoes, and of course, dessert is a must!
