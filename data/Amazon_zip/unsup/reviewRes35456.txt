Loved the fun bar on the side if you don't want a stuffy dining experience! But your clothing will smell like food for a few hours after you leave, so considered yourself warned. As a Florida gal, I have to say their crab offerings are pretty darn good for the midwest! Service is great and their oysters of all kinds are superb. Good lord what was that amazing vinegar-like icey thing they served with our half shell oysters? Delicious! The hubby was in hog heaven, his blackened fish was outstanding. I had a bit of food envy but I was more than happy with my crab cakes!
