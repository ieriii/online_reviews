My best friend took me here for my b-day and lemme tell you....I cannot wait to go back!!! I would say this place kind of reminds me of a fusion between Japanois, PF Chang's and Coast.....all of which I will happily go to anytime as they are all delish!!! As soon as you walk in, the decor really catches your eye....all the colors, textures and pretty people to look at...oh my!!! We first had a drink at the bar and then were seated about 15 minutes later, which was fine by us as were were in no hurry.  Our server came over to greet us with a smile right away and was very nice and answered all of our questions about the menu items and even recommended a nice bottle of sake for us to try, which was awesome!!  We started off with the edamame and the Rock Shrimp apps and OMG, I am still dreaming of that Rock Shrimp. It was sooooo amazing!!! I really can't wait to go back and have it again!!! I can't remember everything we had but the standouts were the Hamachi roll with cucumber, tomato and jalapeno that was so fresh and wonderful and the Firecracker Roll was like a freaking party in my mouth!!! I can't wait to go back here and try more things on the menu!! I think that this has become my new favorite restaurant....too bad my wallet doesn't agree!!:)
