meh...I've had better sandwiches without the high price. I think that its' been overrated by people who haven't really had a great Cuban sandwich and think this is as good as it gets. I must say the Cafe Cubano is to die for! No other chain cafe can top this. Other then that..I'd go some where else for food.
