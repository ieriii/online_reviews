So... yeah. Service was worse than sub-par -- totally dismal. After waiting 20 minutes to order two tacos and another 20 to get them, they were totally wrong. Steak overcooked, all the wrong fixins. I don't send things back to kitchens; I worked in the industry too long to bog down an already busy kitchen, and I have gotten plenty an order wrong myself! But when I quietly asked for sides of the missing fixins for my pretty much bare taco, I was met with much disdain and huffing, only to have a couple of handfuls of stuff thrown in a styrofoam container and shoved my way. Um, ok. Chomped through the overdone steak nonetheless (who eats this stuff when not beyond starving, anyway?), trying to suck the powdery sludge of what they called Horchata through a straw. After enough attempts to satiate my hunger and thirst, I actually wanted to pay for said items and find somewhere else to achieve this goal. Another 10+ minute wait followed, even after going up to the register, wallet in hand. I'm all about not being waited on, per se, but being derided and ignored while being presented with some totally gross substitute for subsistence just ain't my jam. Sorry, La Pas, maybe another location on another day. But most likely not (though I might pop in just to jack some of that decent salsa from another poor schlub reduced to making a meal out of chips.)
