This tasty BYOB spot was worth the wait! We killed time by heading over to Trader Joe's to pick up the finest Champagne that $5.99 can buy, and once seated mixed up some fine mimosas with Yolk's fresh squeezed OJ. I ordered one of their specials that was forged in my dreams: pulled pork, mango salsa, mozzerella, and a fried egg on a pretzel roll. Literally all of my favorite things in one sammie, and it did not disappoint. The prices were reasonable and the service was great! She even gave us little to-go cups to take our extra OJ on the road. I firmly believe that brunch is the most important meal of the day, and yolk was a great way to start it off right.
