I've been hearing so much about this place and bascially Rick Bayless in general, I like every other Chicagoan decided to go and check this place out for myself, to see what all the hype was about. Words of advice: be prepared to wait in line.. Yes, even at 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon, since that's when we went. It took us about 30 minutes just to order our food..We even had to wait for a few minutes outside because the line was out the door. After ordering your food, you are seated by a hostess..At first the hostess, wanted to squeeze my husband and I in between a group of people just because there were 2 chairs available at the bar against the wall. I'm sorry but we just paid $30 for sandwiches I am not going to be smashed against a wall just to say I tried Rick's sandwiches. So my husband asked if we could sit at another table and the hostess hesitated and said that it was reserved.. Interesting. I didn't know tables at sandwich shops are usually reserved.  Eventually we made our way to 2 chairs against the bar and sat down. We were served our chips/guac within 5 minutes. The guacomole was good but nothing to brag about. (Sorry Rick) Sandwiches arrived shortly thereafter. I had the Gunthorp Chicken from the oven and immediately noticed how hard the bread was. I barely could bite into it. My husband ordered the Milanese and his was excellent!! I wanted to keep eating his after just one taste. My husband even sampled my sandwich and agreed that the bread was too hard, albeit flavorful. Basically the food was flavorful, but nothing orgasmic. We ended our lunch with a churo which was delicious..But like anything else, this place will soon lose its luster after the Rick hype dies down. And don't forget winter is around the corner. Because let's face it no one wants to wait outside in line in the bitter cold just for a sandwich.
