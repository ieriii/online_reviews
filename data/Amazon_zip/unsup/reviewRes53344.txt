We are just talking about hot dogs only, not the other sausage stuff. I was there today at approx 11: am. The hot dog was over rated this must be what upscale northsiders regard as an excellent hot dog worth waiting for.The topping were great, very good quality. The wiener was not hot, it was room temperature we requested a steamed dogs. The bun was not steamed. The wet wiener and topping caused the bun to fall apart. Had to eat this stuff with a fork.I have to say Iwas a little bothered by employees who are playing/texting on cell phones while working. These people have a tip jar by the cashier.
