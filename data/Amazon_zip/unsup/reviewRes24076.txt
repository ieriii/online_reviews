Irazu's get 5 stars for its milkless oatmeal milkshake alone. Don't let anybody talk you into the milk. The milk version is not bad, but its not as unique tasting as the non-milk. Surpiringly the other food is very good here as well. I haven't ever been to any other Costa Rican places, so I can't compare it, but the service and food have always been good and prices reasonable to boot. There is a nice but small sit down area with wait service behind the walk up counter, and a small outdoor seating area as well.
