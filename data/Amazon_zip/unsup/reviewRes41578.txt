I have been here twice, about 6 years apart- took my dad as part of a Christmas gift last night. I have to admit up front that I don't eat steak so I can't comment on that. What I can tell you is that the last time I went was for my dad's 50th birthday. He had been talking about how incredible the steak was every so often ever since. And last night, although the conversation was flowing before the entrees came, I was told to stop talking once his steak came so he could pay sufficient respect to his filet. He was one happy camper. I had the stuffed chicken which was fantastic.  The service is excellent, from the martinis shaken and poured at your table, to the attentiveness of the wait staff overall. Its also a really tastefully decorated restaurant, so if you want it to feel like a special night out without being overdone, this is a great choice.  Also, I'm sure its possible to come here and still have a reasonably priced dinner for the quality. Between two entrees, two appetizers, a side of garlic mashed potaties, and 4 martinis, my bill came out to $150 (the martinis were a full third of the cost!). Not cheap, but to see my dad's face light up like that over a steak, certainly worth it! I don't make it to steak houses often (again due to the my non-steak-eating) but I am so impressed with Ruth's Chris- thanks to them for making my Christmas gift to dad so well-received!
