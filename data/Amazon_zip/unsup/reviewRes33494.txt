I'm torn between a 3 and a 4 star review. What I tried: California Omlette: FANTASTIC Coffee: AWFUL. WASTE OF TIME. (burnt, thin, & disgusting-read previous reviews for confirmation) Pecan Waffle: OK but too sweet Pancakes: Very good, nice and fluffy Eggs Benedict: Disappointing (esp if it's supposed to be best in town) Strawberry & Orange Juice: Not bad, but I've had better. Location: Convenient, walkable distance to Museum Campus Service: Standard Decor/Interior: Nice and modern. In Short: I'd go back for that omlette anyday. It was pretty darn good, but that was also the worst coffee ever.  (We asked for a refund, which we got)
