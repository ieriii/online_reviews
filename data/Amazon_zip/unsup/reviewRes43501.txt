From the minute we walked through the door we were ignored. It wasn't even busy. The sign says "wait for hostess to seat you." So we waited as the young lady at the counter did nothing fir 3 minutes. Finally I ask if I should just seat myself. She tells me "Sure, but you still gotta order at the counter." Ummm, te why the hostess sign? Then we look at the menu. You can't order sandwiches until 10 am and most of their breakfast items, at least the ones we want aren't available on weekdays. Poor service, limited food. Pass on this place. It has a better-than-thou attitude it doesn't deserve. Head up the street to Janik's, it's so much better. Dang I hate giving one star reviews.
