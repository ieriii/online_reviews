While perusing the often disappointing Groupon Now offerings, I spotted La Villa doing a $5 for $10 special. Being housed in a large old-fashioned building, I had always thought it was mostly a banquet hall for events rather than a place two people could get a nice Italian meal. But La Villa is so much more than a place where you can store guests after a wedding! La Villa has a very nice salad bar that contains both vegetables for concocting your own idea of salad and mixed salads such as potato, chicken, tuna and pasta salad. They have a variety of pasta sauces available and they can and will substitute gluten-free pasta in almost all of their pasta dishes. Celiac sufferers and gluten-naysayers, you're good to go! La Villa's chicken was tender and savory and the veal (don't judge me) was flavorful and juicy. The appetizers were tasty and smothered in both cheese and what I can only assume is the essence of pure deliciousness. The house wine was very palatable and very reasonable by the glass and by the bottle. Even the complimentary bread went above and beyond expectations with seasoned butter and crusty homemade bread. The service was excellent. It's become normal in a dining establishment for the waitress to be all cheerful, but the runners who actually bring the food to you are beaten-down by life, angry and unable to do more than push a plate at you and grunt. But at La Villa, everyone was pleasant, had smiles and did not throw a single stink-eye. Bottom line? La Villa looks old-fashioned but that just means they've been doing it RIGHT since the dawn of time. The food was excellent, I asked for extra napkins and got them without issue, and my water was refilled without my having to lasso and hogtie anyone. I'll definitely be back.
