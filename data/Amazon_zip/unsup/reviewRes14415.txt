BACON FAT POPCORN - YUM! The Workingman Burger was good. The "beer onion" on the burger is pretty darn awesome. It is big and really filling! LOVED the fries and the garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes. The blue cheese potato salad was interesting...not quite as blue cheesy as I thought it would be. Considering I don't particularly like blue cheese, the bite that I tasted was pretty darn good!
