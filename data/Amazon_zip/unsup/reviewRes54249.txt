A friend and got delivery from Irazu and it was pretty good--arrived quickly considering I live on the far, far reaches of their delivery zone and the food was still warm. Had the tilapia tacos. I liked that they weren't fried, but still had all the other components of a good fish taco. The highlight was their yummy vinegar cabbage slaw. Also has some empenadas. I really like all the options for the filling, instead of just chicken or cheese. Really liked the zucchini one and the plantain one made a nice dessert.
