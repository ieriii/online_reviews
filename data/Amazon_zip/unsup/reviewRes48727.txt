Highly Recommended. I can't say that the food is the kind of earth shattering stuff that I would do things I am not pround of to score some. It is, however, very good. The key point is that it is all just a little bit different; not something you see everyday. We had a white fish dip, pork schnitzel, and duck fat fries. The best part about this place is the atmosphere. The service was great. Our waiter was more than pleasent and had some great suggestions. The lighting is low, but not dark enough to leave you fumbling. The open kitchen allows you to see the masters at work. The bar area with standing tables only is a bit unique as well. I am a fan of the common seating so you can mingle with some new folks, but if you are more private you can grab a booth. Make reservations as this place always seems to be hoppin'.  The beer list is also pretty good if you are into craft beers and imports.
