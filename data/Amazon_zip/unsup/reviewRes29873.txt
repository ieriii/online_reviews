Every time I step through the door here, I feel life's problems drain away. The troubles of the day -- the week, even -- just seem trivial as the instrumental jazz softly blankets the room and creates a hazy, just plain relaxing atmosphere. The furniture is sturdy, the bud vases freshly filled, and the original pastels and watercolors hanging on the walls (all tastefully framed and up for sale) add a fresh feel to the space. The food is very delicious, and today I began the day indulging my absolute gluttonous side with the stuffed French toast (with glazed walnuts, banana, melted brie, and banana liqueur) and a side of bacon (completely delicious, thick slices of deep red meat fried to a perfect non-crunchy solid crisp).  An added plus: the servers here are very attractive in a Greenwich Village/Chelsea loft artist sort of way. They were also very helpful; when I arrived after they'd stopped serving their brunch menu (through which the stuffed French toast is offered), I asked the server about my getting the stuffed French toast, and he went back and got confirmation from the kitchens that they would be able to make it for me. Wahoo! Overall, a GREAT little brunch place. I didn't know about its late-night hours, so I'll be sure to add it now to my list of late-night munchies destinations!
