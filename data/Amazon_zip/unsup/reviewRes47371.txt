Wow. I just read Nikki C.'s review and I can't believe she's not a dude. I am excited about Lockdown cause it's so bizarre. 14 TV's showing Aerosmith. That makes me giggle. It's loud. And you can't really NOT watch TV. But that's what it is. The burgers are alright. Pretzel buns are too bread-y, not leaving enough of the meat taste for my liking. Had a burger with prosciutto and Fuji apples and some kind of cheese. Pretty good. The names of their food items are really the best. Wings are called The Bone Collector. Try to order with a straight face. The service: well, maybe when they get some people who have served before, it will be a little less awkward. They tried. They were very nice. We had some appetizers sent out to the table, which was very sweet on the part of the management. Hummus and baba gannouj plate and some tortilla chips with a cheese dip that seemed like rotel with cheese. Which really can't be improved anyway so why bother. I might go back. It's kinda nutty. They wouldn't let us sit in the cage. Said it was reserved. I think it was a lie. Maybe if my friend who got there first didn't look like an accountant, we would have been VIP enough for the cage. It's a goal of mine now. Get. In. That. Cage. oh, and beers were well priced. FYI
