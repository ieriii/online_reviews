These people all must be on crack. This cafe was terrible! I ordered the Stonewall Kitchen Buttermilk Pancakes (two for $4.50), served with whipped butter and Vermont maple syrup, and a side of Chicken Sausage with Apples, Maple & Sage (3 links for $4). How the hell do you mess up pancakes??? These flapjacks were dense and probably weighed 5 lbs. I literally had to choke each bite down and rinse with water. Totally dry! Hubby ordered the Chef's Omelet ($8.50). "Check our specials board for today's creation." Well, there was no "specials board" to be found and forget asking what the omelet du jour is because apparently they like to surprise you with the ingredients. And surprise!! Your omelet comes with stinky-ass blue cheese today! Yuck! Eggs looked green and overdone. Service is bismal. I tried to flag down three different servers and they all ignored me. I finally resorted to yelling out "Hey!" as one whisked by and he looked me straight in the eye and kept walking!! Next time I'm in the area, I'd rather starve than eat here again.
