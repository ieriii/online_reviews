The atmosphere here was really great. I had my birthday dinner here and the waiters were really great considering our group was large. The food was great and the portions are quite large. By far the raspberry mojitos are the best I've had around town. I think this would be a great place to go on a date or even just have drinks with friends! Overall, loved it!!
