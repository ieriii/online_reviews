Um, yeah. I stayed here once while in the process of moving from New England. Thought to myself "well, how can one go wrong with a name like Heart of Chicago and a AAA recommendation?" Well, my friends, the answer is - you can go very wrong.  The place is run down (if it was ever run up I will never know) with small rooms offering shabby furnishings. The glass block window in the bathroom looks out to the alley, where on the night I was there, a 2 hour yelling argument between a pimp and his ho echoed into my room. The TV reception was spotty, and I only got 3 stations in well enough to be able to watch. The heat was broken, but not in the "off" position. Even though this was January, the heat blew on high and full force to such a degree I had to open the only two windows and sleep on top of the covers (maybe not such a bad idea anyway). It would not turn off, even for the maintenance guy the next morning. I felt like beef jerky when I woke up.  The folks in the parking lot outside were raucous and big partiers. I am not certain if they were guests of the motel or not, but noone seemed to complain or shut them up, as it went on for 3 hours. The included breakfast was a single box of Dunkin Donuts and a carafe of coffee.  My thought about all of this is, if AAA can "highly recommend" this place, maybe its time to question their level of standards.
