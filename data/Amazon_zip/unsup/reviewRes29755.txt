In short: great food, even better atmosphere, and reasonable prices. I've been here a few times, for both brunch and dinner. I honestly didn't feel like there was anything that special about the brunch. It was good food, nothing wrong with it, but I don't live in the neighborhood, so I'm unlikely to trek down unless I'm meeting my buddies that live next door. Dinner is really good, though. They have a menu that "changes," but I came two times, about a month apart, and the menu was the same, so I'm not really sure if it actually changes. They have sandwiches and appetizers that they have every day, and then they also have a "specials" menu. The first time, I had the Jamaican Chicken Curry. It was really filling, and the flavor was a little weird- not the typical Jerk flavor I expect; it wasn't bad, just different, so if you're looking for actual Jamaican chicken, this probably isn't it. The second time, I got the mediterranean salad and vegetable soup and my friend got the grilled cheese. Everything was really really good. I know it's hard to mess up a salad, but it gets done way too often, and this salad was huge, perfectly proportioned, not drenched in dressing, and really tasty and filling. The vegetable soup was chock full of vegetables. The chicken peanut soup is also really good if you like peanut sauce- it basically tastes like a liquidier peanut sauce. Overall, I'd give the food a 3.5 stars overall, because the menu is a little hit or miss (I guess you just need to figure out which items you like), but I definitely round up for the atmosphere and service. This is such a cute little wine bar, no tourists, and the servers are so friendly. There are also always people studying in the upstairs area, which seems more suited for hanging out than meeting people, so if you're looking for a place to study and drink wine, this might be it.
