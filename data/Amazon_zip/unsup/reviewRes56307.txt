This restaurant is simply great. We started with the Northern Vietnam Fisherman's Soup (Bun Rieu) which was fabulous with a light slightly sweet basic flavor enhanced with cilantro and various spices. The server provided the spices on the side so we could add them to taste. We chose two vegetable entries. I had the Vegetarian's Delite (Nam Xao Rau) and my friend had the Asian Vegetables on Crispy Noodles (Mi Xao Don). Both were excellent with fresh vegetables cooked perfectly. While this is a very busy and somewhat noisy restaurant the food and service is superb. I am already looking forward to my next visit and trying something else from the many items on the menu. Another visit and the place is even better!
