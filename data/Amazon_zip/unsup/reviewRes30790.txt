Sunda is a solid destination for Pan-Asian. Sushi - really good, fresh (though limited selection) Entrees - Unique dishes with good portions for a "scene-y" place Must Try's *Rock Shrimp Tempura app - never fails *Scallop Sashimi - Some of the best scallop sashimi I've ever had, REALLY fresh *Chicken Katsu Curry - Nice spice level, well cooked noodles Service can be spotty depending on server and time of day.
