Way overpriced and very pretentious service. All of the staff was unfriendly - I would at least expect a friendly server or hostess, at least. We had to wait an additional 15 minutes after our reservation. The food wasn't anything spectacular and I felt that the effort was made more on the presentation of the meal than the actual taste. I have spent less than $30 and have had an amazing experience at other Latin restaurants with great food and service - This is definitely not one of them. But on the good side they do support local farmers and the atmosphere is perfect for a date - very beautiful.
