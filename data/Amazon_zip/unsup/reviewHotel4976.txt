We stayed at the Allerton for 3 nights . Clean and neat and the staff was nice and gave directions to attractions....Short walk to Navy pier and shopping . we ate at the restaurant and food was really good for hotel food that sometimes can be bland . I am sure given the chance we will use this property again for downtown lodging . It's location to so many things gives this property good marks .....
