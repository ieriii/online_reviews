I've only walked thru the lobby of this hotel, and had drinks in the bar. This, though, is Classic Chicago Oldskool RichKid Elegance. I've never stayed here (why? I live in the city!) but wow, want to! The location is primo - doesn't get any better than that. Hip since the 20's. Pop! Six! Uh, uh, Cicero, Lipschitz! The iconic "The Drake" sign that is visible from Lake Shore Drive on the approach to Michigan Avenue could not be more classic. It's what I dreamt about living in LA, when I'd decided to come back to Chicago. I knew when I saw that sign, driving down LSD, that I was back home in the City that Works! Even though it's owned by Hilton now, elegance and real class still live here. Thankfully, it's still alive somewhere!
