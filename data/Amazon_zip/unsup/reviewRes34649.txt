What the hell is wrong with you people? Do you leave the confines of Wicker Park/Bucktown, like, EVER? I'm sorry, but this place sucks. It's pretty much a Middle Eastern Subway. If you're in the area and have an insatiable craving for a falafel sandwich, it'll *suffice*, but as a Middle Eastern food purist I won't even go here on my lunch breaks. Their sandwiches are always cold, soggy and crammed with unnecessary fillers to distract you from their sub-par shawarma and falafel. For about a $1-2 more per person, you can go to Semiramis or Salam on Kedzie, both of which are freaking INCREDIBLE, authentic and hipster-free to boot. I shouldn't even tell all you unworthy Sultansites about their glory, but they really do deserve your recognition and money, unlike this place!
