This is a mainstay in terms of a solid Italian restaurant to recommend to friends and family. It's crowded and loud, but it reminds me of the Italian side of my family that is exactly the same way. The food is absolutely delicious- I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered here! Service is great as well, so stop in!
