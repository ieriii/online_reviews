I didn't quite know what to expect when I first set foot in this restaurant. I had never tried Ethiopian food prior to this and I was a little nervous. On first glance however, this place did not disappoint. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very charming and relaxed. The walls are decorated with all types of art and on the night I went there was live music. The service was excellent and the waitress was extremely helpful in explaining to my friend and I what everything was. The food itself was very delicious, however there didn't seem to be much variety amongst all the dishes. Everything we ate was a little on the spicy side so at the end of the meal we ordered a pot of Ethiopian coffee. At first this seemed a little risky since a pot cost $5, but the coffee was worth every penny. It was sweet without having to put sugar in it and had a slight anise flavor. On top of the that it was served in what looked like a small clay pot, but the amount of coffee coming from said pot seemed to be endless. This is a great restaurant and I highly recommend it, especially if you want to try something new. I went with a friend who is often skeptical about trying new and foreign foods and now even she wants to go back.
