I wasn't too impressed with Sunda. The restaurant is beautiful, which is why I think it's so expensive! The food, however, was average (and somewhat greasy). The staff had way too much attitude -- c'mon, it's only a restaurant that you're working in. It's hard to take a place like this seriously when there's so much authentic asian around Chicago.
