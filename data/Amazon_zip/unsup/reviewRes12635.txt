If you're looking for a fancy restaurant to go out on a date, this is your place. It's elegant, good staff, good service too. I do like the place -- the 3 stars is for the price, which I really think it could be less. Also, this is an "American style" Brazilian food. I was born and raised in Brazil, and I do miss the traditional type of food we have over there. I wish this restaurant could be cheaper, so we would probably eat there more often.
