While visiting Chicago I knew that I wanted to check out one of Rick Bayless' restaurants. Being as I had wedding activities to take care of in the evenings it was either breakfast or lunch that I would need to visit Xoco. First trip turned out to be 5 minutes too late for breakfast and 55 minutes too early for lunch. Bummer, but I was determined and the hotel was close. Second trip. Bingo. I ordered the chorizo torta, side of churros and a agua del dia. The torta was spot on. The layers of fresh baked bread, chorizo, egg, cheese and avocado were incredible and the salsa verde on the side was a great added bonus. The churros were super fresh and the agua del dia was really refreshing. I can't wait to get back to Chicago and try more of Chef Bayless' amazing food.
