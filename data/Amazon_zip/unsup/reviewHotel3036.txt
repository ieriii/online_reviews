I felt like a sleeze in this place. It was not classy at all. It was like trashy trendy. The rooms are soooo beyond outdated and the wooden shutters that hide the bathroom from the rest of the room?...Ew. Who in the world came up with that idea? Did they assume everyone would be married and totally turned on by the sights sounds and smells of each others bathroomtime? I was only here for my job but upon immediately finding out that the W was where we were planted, I reserved myself a completely different hotel and I'm glad. My coworker said she didnt sleep a wink that night because the AC was so freakin loud. Room service was terribly slow (60 min wait time) and the food arrived cold (should've known)... The dessert with icecream on the side was totally melted. They sent us back up new orders at no cost and the food was much faster/better that time. Thank goodness. I am glad I got to experience this place for free because it was about the same class as a trendied up days inn.
