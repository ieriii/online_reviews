Hi,My husband and I have been to Davanti several times and the food has always been good, but last night not so good. Our waiter Martha was very corgial at first, when we sat down, then once our ordered was placed, poof, like a ghost she was gone.Always had to ask the bus boy to get her for us, as far as the food all was good except the pizza was terrible, very dry and they did remove it from the check.We have had pizza's there in the past, and were very good. I also ordered the mortadella pasta, was to be in a brown butter sage, which it was, but Martha failed to mention also balsamic vinegar, didn't like the sweetness on the pasta.Didn't have the experience there we have had in the past!
