New fav place in chicago. The food is top-notch and some of the classic dishes bring major surprises for the tastebuds!  I made a dinner reservation about 3 weeks ahead of time (and still had sorta a late dinner time because it was pretty packed!). But during those three weeks, I salivated and waited for this moment to try Rick Bayless's cuisine. The "tacos de lengua" were a sure-fire hit - 5 stars on that dish alone. Perfectly cooked tongue, a little bit of cheese added, and fresh handmade tortillas made this a perfect appetizer to get us excited for the main entrees. The fish catch of the day was undoubtedly one of the best seafood dishes I've eaten in years. The night's catch was swordfish cooked medium rare. The fish was done sooo perfectly too. Grilled on the outside, and yet raw/rare on the inside. Mmm Mmm. Next to the fish, Frontera added an amazing chile-based sauce that could of easily been turned into a soup - it was THAT good that I wanted to spoon it into my mouth. Lastly, I was shocked when I placed the salsa in my mouth and got hit with a fresh burst of strawberries in the salsa! So delicious. A perfect complement to the sauce and flavor of the swordfish. Pollo a las brasas is another classic Latin American dish. The meat was very tender and well seasoned. It isn't very exciting, but the food was top-notch nonetheless. This is the type of place to make a reservation weeks in advance for special occasions. Frontera is simply worth it!
