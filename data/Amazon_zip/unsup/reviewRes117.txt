This was a while back, but decided to write a review anyway. It felt like i was entering a space ship, but once i got inside the place, I was amazed by the decor. It was simple and elegant. The center piece on our table was very unique, it was actually part of our meal. We had the tasting menu, each item was amazing. It's true that the flavors burst in your mouth, each item was uniquely prepared. The service was top notch!! Although it was the most expensive dinner I've ever had, the experience was truely amazing. Expect to spend $500+ for two people and 4-5 hours
