oooooo what a great dinner. Thursday night, the restaurant wasn't busy at all so maybe next time I shouldn't feel so pressed to make reservations for a weekday night? I liked that it was cozy and welcoming, with warm tones- pretty soothing when you enter and sit back and enjoy dinner and drinks with your companions. We tried the prix fix dinner and it was pretty fantastic. I had a lemony martini--- perfect for winding down after a long day at work, not too sickenly sweet or nasty tasting at all- which seems to be the case for a lot of flavored martini's I order elsewhere. I'm lookin at you Big Bowl. So about the prix frixe menu-- it didn't disappoint. Except for the salad. I'm not big on salads anyway. I had the beef tenderloin medallions with smashed potatoes. The meat came out perfectly medium rare like I asked.. it was very good, very tender. I finished off with the hot butter rum cheesecake.. oooo that was perfect. Some of the best cheesecake I've had in a long time. And here I am about to satisfy my cheesecake craving at the cheesecake factory earlier in the month! That shut down my craving immediately. The service was very friendly and attentive. An excellent, low key experience after a loooong day. I needed that! Note to self: this would be a great date place I can walk to.
