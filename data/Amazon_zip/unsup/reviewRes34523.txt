I have to admit, I've only been here once, but when I saw the Bacon IN Waffles dish on the show 190 North, I knew I had to go. Its not your run of the mill breakfast place, its kinda cutesy with a great unpretentious South Loop vibe, who needs to try to look cool at breakfast? But its got a little flare that lets you know you aren't in here for your basic IHOP fare. The juice was fresh and my Bacon In Waffles was everything I hoped for, My boyfriend got a skillet, I don't remember which one, but I do know that I kept stealing bites because it was so yummy and different than my dish. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes a good breakfast, just be careful on weekend, we we went on a Monday and just barely didn't have to wait to be seated (because there were only two of us).
