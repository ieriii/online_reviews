If you like fondue, you can't miss this place! The ambiance definitely helps set the scene of the restaurant. The lights are dimmed and it is both intimate and romantic. We started at the bar and the bartender was extremely helpful in recommending a wine that was extremely tasty and not pricey (maybe $36). We were then quickly seated and were lucky enough to sit at a booth. We of course had the cheese, meat, and dessert. I thought that the cheese was the best part and my fiance raved about the lobster. I also really liked the type and amount of vegetables that were served with the meal. Oh yeah, the sauces were great too! There are 8 different kinds and you have to try them all!  Cons: 1. If you are not lucky enough to sit at a booth, you will be sat at a table  that is very close to the one next to it. You will pretty much be sharing your meal and conversation with your neighbors approximately 3 inches away.  2. The food was really really good...but there wasn't a real selection. I have been to the Melting Pot many times (I know it is hard to compare since it is a chain and Geja's is not) and it has so much to choose from. You can pick the cheese, oil, and chocolate at the Melting Pot, but at Geja's there is one cheese, one oil, and one chocolate.
