more like a 3.5 rating. cannot beat the draft beer selection. went for dinner fri. i like that they have a creative menu and try to use local and seasonal ingredients. we had the montreal style brisket. this was tasty, though it tasted more like corned beef (plus they served it with mustard). the mac and cheese it came with was not all that. the cole slaw looked like it would taste good, but it had way too much celery in it for me. one of the few things i hate the taste of. also had a squash puff entree which was indeed very tasty. we will be back,
