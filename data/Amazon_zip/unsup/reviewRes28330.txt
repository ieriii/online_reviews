Been there a couple of times because of all the hype about it. I recently went on a Thursday for lunch with 2 friends. The special of the day ways Bistec a la plancha con frijoles rancheros. The steak was amazing and seasoned perfectly! It was cut into strips so that was a plus. Steak was tender and just perfect. The beans were awesome too with so much flavor to them. The chips they bring you were still warm and just the right thickness. The complimentary appetizer was a ground beef and potato rolled taco with broth. It was SO good! (Sorry I know im going backward). Anyway, when the check came it was only $20! I even asked the waitress if she missed something but she said the order was correct I was so happy that I decided to come back the following Tuesday for lunch with my husband. Fast forward to Tuesday, it was like night and day. While the appetizer of meatballs and potatoes was delish, I was sorely dissapointed when we ordered the special of the day. It was supposed to be a steak with refried beans and a quesadilla, while the quesadilla was good the steak was tough and had a bland taste. I really really hate to send food back but after spitting out my second piece of leathery meat, I just had to tell the waitress I was not happy. She suggested I try the bistec a la mexicana which she said was much more tender. Well she brought the plate and it was definitely not bistec, it was more like shredded beef. I just ate some because I didnt want to fuss but I was definitely not happy. The nachos that they are so famous for just werent right either. When we got the check, it was $30 which I didnt feel the meal was worth. So your experience will definitely vary day by day. ALSO, be prepared to pay for parking! One quarter will only buy you like 12 minutes of parking so bring LOTS of quarters or your credit card for when the machine wont take quarters. :/
