Went to XOCO Chicago because we love Rick Bayless and had heard good things about this place. The food was awesome, but the dining room and setup frankly uh...sucked. You cant make reservations so there was a huge line. And you cannot get a table until you have placed your order. By the time we got through that line I would have clubbed a baby seal for a beer. So we decided to get takeout and eat at the hotel- problem solved and no baby seals were harmed during the making of our dinner. We each got something to share. First, the chips are great and taste like fresh home-made Fritos. We had a Pork Belly Vermicelli (Fideos): Crispy-tender pork belly, toasty-tender noodles, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, salsa negra. It was sort of a soup and I LOVED it. It was spicy with an awesome broth. I could eat this all day every day. We also got a Torta Pepito: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos. So amazing- awesome flavors. My (vegetarian) friend got the Woodland Mushroom torta- it was really great and you never will miss the meat. Had wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, goat cheese, black beans, and wild arugula. We had a churro for dessert. It was good but nothing fancy. Overall a great place, but go when they are not busy or just get it to go.
