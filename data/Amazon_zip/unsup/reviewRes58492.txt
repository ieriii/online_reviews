My name is Quoc-Viet Nguyen and im from Kansas City. I have been to many Vietnamese restaurant from Dallas, California, Missouri, Chicago etc. I believe Simply it has the best service and quality of food that a vietnamese restaurant ever had.I have been to Argyle, Little Saigon or Viettown in Chicago many times. I have been to Tank Noodle, Pho Viet, Pho 777, Pho 888, etc and the food their is alright. I am from UIC campus so its a long trip out there, but going to get Pho up their gave me my Pho kick when i was craving vietnamese food. At first i was skeptical because what vietnamese restaurant is in Lincoln Park and called Simply IT ? It was really strange to me, but some vietnamese guy i met at the apple store on Michigan avenue said it was better food than Viet town. So i went, and it exceeded my expectation. The PHo i have to admit was Home cooked quality, i actually left saying, Man that Pho was actually really good. Also the Fried Banana and icecream is to die for... Plus, The owner is extremely friendly and talks to all the customer. He clearly knows how to run a restaurant. I know this might sound to good to be true, but what do you have to lose. If you are in Chicago and want to try Vietnamese food or if your Craving Pho, i recommend you go to Simply It, I believe the best Vietnamese Food in Chicago.
