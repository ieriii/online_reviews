The wait.. omg the wait can be HORRIBLE and torturous.. but once you make it through that... all is quickly forgotten. This is a warm and cozy place with a great ambiance. The Wildfire is one of my favorite restaurants. I enjoy their Cedar Planked Salmon, Sword Fish, BBQ rubbed sweet potato, key lime pie, steak, and just about any thing else that they place in front of me. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable, the kitchen is pretty open and you can see them cooking over the open flame. The prices really aren't that bad, they deliver on what you pay for. I will continue coming here for years and years.
