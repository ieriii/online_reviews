On the ever bustling section of Division St., Milk & Honey is a true standout. Sadly w/ the coming winter the outdoor seating is closed up, but no worries, as the inside is quite homey, although i wouldn't recommend coming w/ a group of more than 4 since you probably won't get a seat!  There's a great selection of baked goods, sandwiches, and breakfast specialties like huevos rancheros on the weekend. Their ham and caraway havarti is awesome, and served on a pretzel roll. My friend had a black bean burger which he didn't seem to enjoy all that much, although apparently he thought it was going to be a beef burger w/ a black bean spread, so his fault for not reading the description right? :) The kettle chips are tasty, w/ just the right crunch and saltiness. I had the hot chocolate as well, which is rich, warm, and marshmallowy!  You pretty much can't go wrong w/ anything here... efficient, no frills service w/ solid food keep me coming back time and time again!
