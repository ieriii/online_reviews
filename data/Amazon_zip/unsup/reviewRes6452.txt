So my girlfriend's parents called and wanted to have a surprise dinner for my girlfriend and wanted me to orchestrate the entire night. What is a guy to do? Do I pick something uber nice and expensive, while offering to foot the bill of course, or do I stick with casual and risk them being unimpressed. I'd always heard great things about Wildfire so I thought I'd give it a shot. It's not crazy expensive but not hot dog cheap. The ambience of the place is unbelievable. Think 1940's style decor with dark wood accents and a huge dining area. Our server was great, she didn't bother us too much but always seemed to be around when we needed something. The food was some of the best I've had in a very long time. My girlfriend had the filet and potatoes while I had the mushroom topped pork chops. The filet was melt in your mouth good while my chops were hands down the best I've ever had. They actually topped my grandmothers and that is saying a lot. The night ended great and the parents, as well as the girlfriend were impressed. Good food and good times, what more can you ask for?
