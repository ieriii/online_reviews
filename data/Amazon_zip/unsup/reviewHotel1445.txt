Although the Omni is always a great choice, for some reason the bf felt like it would also be haunted. It wasn't. It was simply a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location in the heart of Chicago where you want to be if you're a first time visitor. Let me qualify this for a moment ... having been to Chicago several times for different occasions, I've come to discover that the whole Michigan Ave, Rush St, Lincoln Park thing is cool, but it's only a small part of what Chicago is really about. All those times I complained about having to go further than 2 miles from the area I was missing out on so much outside of what tourism has become of Chicago. One take on the Architecture Tour will show you all the other neighborhoods you're missing out on. Regardless, the Omni is nice, high class, great accommodations and very attentive staff. In most cities it's one of the best hotels and in Chicago it's no different although I make a convincing argument for some great boutiques I've had a chance to stay with. The restaurant has pretty good fares so room service would also be on par, but be prepared to pay a premium for having it in your room versus just coming downstairs, even if you're not dressed up.
