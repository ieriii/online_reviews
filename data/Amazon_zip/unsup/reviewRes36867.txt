Went to check out India Cafe after reading the reviews on Yelp (plus we were in the area for the Tweedy concert at the Emmanuel Temple). Ordered the crab rangoon and it was fabulous! The cream cheese tasted whipped and I think that's what makes these so tasty. The sushi was fresh and very clean tasting. We also ordered the ginger rice dish and it also did not disappoint. The service was great and the art on the walls was interesting to look at. The food prices were extremely reasonable as well! Great place for dinner!
