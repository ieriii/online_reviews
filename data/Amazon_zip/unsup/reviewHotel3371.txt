Well, its over priced compared to the Hilton next door. Our room was dirty, the bathroom was small, there is no heater or air conditioner for the room, but rather a fan where it should be. The couch in the "suite" was gross and uncomfortable. There was something all over the phone, things coming off the walls, and no handles on the closet. I think you get the picture, so if I were you, I wouldn't stay here.
