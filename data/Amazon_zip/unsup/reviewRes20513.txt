Stopped in 9:30ish on a Saturday evening to grab a quick bite. The host was very friendly and joked around with us for a few minutes before seating us at a table outdoors (great people watching on Michigan Ave!). They also didn't mind that we were dressed down and windblown from an evening of sailing. The boyfriend and I each had a burger. The burgers were cooked perfectly and disappeared quickly! Fries come with the burger, but I was feeling the need for a carb overload and ordered mashed potatoes as well and boy am I glad I did! I think they were seriously the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, perfect texture and seasoning. Our waitress was really funny and efficient. I'd like to go back and try some other menu items soon.
