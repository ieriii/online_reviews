I stayed at the Omni Hotel and had a problem. Why the 5 star review? Read on.  I chose to stay at the Omni Hotel on an overnight layover after returning from a month in Europe. I chose this location so I could take my teenage son out for some Chicago style pizza because, unlike me, he had never been before. The check in process and staff were awesome, we were greeted with a smile and they made sure to take very good care of us right down to leaving chocolate chip cookies and milk outside the door for my son,complimentary water, etc. Great start! Our suite was well appointed and very comfortable.  In keeping with our "plan" we picked up a pizza and stored it in the refrigerator to take back to the west coast the next day. The following morning we left our room for a little sightseeing before we left. Upon return to our room we discovered the housekeeping staff had thrown out our pizza. I contacted the front desk and they apologized and offered a credit at their on site restaurant but we had already had reservations at another restaurant and this didn't really replace the item that was disposed of. We left a little disappointed and I wondered why they didn't just replace the pizza as the pizza place (Giordano's) was literally just around the corner. I arrive home and within a day or two I receive an email survey from Omni hotels. In the survey I describe the situation. Within 2 days I get another email from the Omni hotel with their apologies and an offer to ship a replacement out to me in California via FedEx overnight for the Giordano's pizza that was thrown out! That is great customer service!  Every business should be run this way, when there is a problem they fix it. They have definitely earned my future business!
