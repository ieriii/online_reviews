Not much I can add to all of the glowing reviews. I love the veggie plate, especially with spinach or broccoli. The veggies change often. The oatmeal shake is where it's at - tastes like chilled rice pudding. My husband loves the chicken casado. The tacos are very good, the veggie ones are ENORMOUS. If my opinion means anything to you, or even if you could careless what I think, you should for sure visit Irazu.
