This is one of the first Thai places I had ever been to, and it is still one of my favorites. It has the hands-down BEST Crab Rangoon in Chicago. In the beginning I ordered Crab Rangoon at EVERY Thai restaurant I went to. Opart has yet to be beat. Other than that, the food is good, the portions are pretty big, and the service is always fast and friendly. Never a disappointment!
