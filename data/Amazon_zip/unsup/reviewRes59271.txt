Got a menu in the mail from this place last week and thought we'd try it out. Ordered delivery last night... crab rangoon, tom kha soup, and red curry w/ chicken. Food was really really good! Everything was well prepared and very flavorful. We are so used to being disappointed when we order thai food, but this was a wonderful surprise! We are very happy to have found a great thai place in our neighborhood and look forward to ordering from there again, soon.
