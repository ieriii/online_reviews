I was here over memorial day weekend and had no problem getting up to the rooftop lounge after dinner, probably around 11pm. There was a bit of confusion with the drinks two people in our group ordered, but none of the drinks were that great anyway. It also got a bit chilly that night and all of the seating near the heating lamps were taken. However, the ambience was awesome and I would definitely go back on a warm summer night.
