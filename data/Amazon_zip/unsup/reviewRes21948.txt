Mayan Palace is not substantively different from any number of decent, reasonably-priced Mexican restaurants in Chicago, but I will say it has better than average service and a couple of exceptional dinner specials. There are two different rooms - the front is not huge, but it's relatively tranquil and the waitstaff is attentive, while the back room (accessed by squeezing thru a long narrow corridor) is geared more for large parties and can get positively raucous. Chips and salsa are set on your table when you're seated; for my taste, they use too much cumin in their salsa. Pitchers of margaritas are half price on Tuesday and Thursday - a good value. Their Mexican menu standards are, well, standard, but their steaks are exceptional, and they have several dinner specials with tasty sauces. Wait staff is friendly and attentive but not pushy. Margaritas are a bit on the costly side at standard prices, so go on a Tuesday or Thursday if that's what you crave; be aware it can get quite noisy when drinks are cheap. I like the tables at the very front which face lively Halsted street.
