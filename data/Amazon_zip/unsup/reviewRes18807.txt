Okay.... okay.....before you read any further you must realize that this review was written by ME.... not some wild boar or venison, or even scotch egg eating kind of person. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches off of paper towels at lunchtime and macaroni and cheese right out of the pot with a spoon while I watch the 6 o'clock news. I'm just not a fancy-schmancy person. That said, I was very comfortable here. The place is warm and inviting without being stuffy. And, the lunch menu is quite complete. Even a simple eater like me could find a few things to choose from. I decided on the Soup of the Day: chilled watermelon, which when I asked for the shrimp carpacio to be left off the waiter didn't even bat an eye. That soup was the PERFECT anecdote for a hot Chicago afternoon! Then I had the Mixed Greens Salad which was topped with cashews, smoked cheddar, apples, dried cherries, and ginger vinaigrette. It was AMAZING! Flavorful, yet light. The dessert selection was fantastic, but I must say that I was more than a little disappointed with my brown butter cake with caramel ice cream. Silly me, I was expecting CAKE. Instead I got a glass filled with burnt tasting croutons, and layered with ice cream and an overly chocolaty goo and cherries. Too many strong flavors.... and none of them all that good.
