We were already in the neighborhood (at Roscoe Animal Hospital) and decided to check this place out for lunch. It's a small cafe, with just 10 stools at the counter. It's a gussied up sandwich shack, complete with a small flat screen TV near the entrance. And cable!   I ordered a Media Noche sandwich, which consisted of ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickles, mustard on sweet bread. The sandwich was delicious. I liked the combination of the meats and cheese with the sweet, orange-tinged bread. The ham was sweet, boiled ham, which I suppose is traditional in this sandwich. I prefer baked ham, but overall the sandwich was great.   He had the Ropa Vieja sandwich, which was shredded beef in creole sauce. I love ropa vieja, but I've always had it as a stew over rice. Now I know it's delicious in a sandwich, too. I admit, I had a couple bites of his sandwich. I'm just greedy like that! It needed a bit of salt, but the flavor was definitely there.   They also gave us a few plantain chips with our sandwiches, which was a nice surprise. We just had canned pop, but I do want to try their tropical shakes next time. They also carry my beloved Malta beverage. No, it's not malt liquor, fools! It's non-alcoholic and rich in B vitamins. And that's my random fact of the day, Yelpers.   We definitely enjoyed our sandwiches and I'm looking forward to the next visit. We'll be back!
