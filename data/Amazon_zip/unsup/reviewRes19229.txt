"Most dates end at the Gage, but here were are starting our day here." he said on that fateful trip. Its posh. Its a place to be seen. Its close to tourist attractions but doesn't have the huge sign to garner a tremendous amount of traffic. But gets a ton of traffic. Inside is a very metropolitan bar. It's exactly what one would expect in just about any upscale downtown bar. Drinks are pricey. And while they do have some old fashioned cocktails, the fact that they didn't have an aviation available was a bit disheartening. When I think about this place I envision corporate suits like my dad hobnobbing and going there to be seen by younger women that may or may not be pushing 30.  And while it was beautiful, nothing about this resonated with me enough to scream that I absolutely had to go here again.
