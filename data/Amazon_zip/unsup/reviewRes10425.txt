Sunday takeout special: Large pie and growler for $25.  Rainy day in Chicago. Four cold, shivering friends walking back to Roosevelt CTA station from Adler Planetarium. Somebody says, "Wouldn't pizza be awesome right now?"  Call Piece. Get the plain pie with bacon and mashed potatoes on one half, artichokes, tomato and spinach on the other half. "30 minutes okay?" voice on the other side asks. Perfect. Pick up pie and growler of Dark 'n Curvy within minutes of walking in. Final bill comes to $30. Carry home. Devour. Best. Dinner. Ever.
