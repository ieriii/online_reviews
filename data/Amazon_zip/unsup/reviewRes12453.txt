So the other day I walk out of my new temp job at 3 hoping to grab a little late lunch. Just having 30 bucks and my keys on me I walk down the street into Piece. I normally go here about twice a month and I don't think their food is that bad. I walk in to get myself a personal pizza for lunch and I'm stopped at the door. They want to see my I.D. before I can get in. I have never been carded at this establishment, and NEVER while trying to simply get lunch. I kindly explain to the person that I don't have my ID on me cause I just came down the street to get lunch, and that I'm not drinking. Needless to say they denied my entry. WTF is this? I have never been carded trying to get a pizza. Look here Piece Management, AND Rick Nielson, your pizza isn't bad, but get your heads out of your asses! I.D. for pizza? Get f'ed. I wasn't trying to buy 24 case, I was trying to buy a chicken and bacon personal pizza! Get f'ed! Really! I promise I will never return to your place and I will make sure my friends don't either.
