Just went here for the first time this past Sunday, and felt like I had to review.First off, I would like to say that our waitress was great. The place was packed, and she kept refilling our coffee, and making sure we were enjoying our breakfast.My wife was dying to go here, but after the breakfast I am not quite sure what the appeal of this place is.Just a regular breakfast joint in the same ballpark as Frances and Nookies.Overall, 3 stars.Positive: Cheap prices, OK foodNegatives: Too crowded
