Stopped into this cozy little joint for lunch and at first thought I'd entered the coffee shop or sitting area at a retirement home. A quick double take of the sign confirmed I was in the right spot even though the slightly blue haired clientele pointed to otherwise. To my surprise, the 3rd Coast hit the spot. The toasted baguette used for the Diablo's beef sandwich alone was worth it. Also loved how one of the side options for sandwiches was hash browns - a perfect way to have lunch but feel that you're not totally getting cheated out of their great breakfast.  As an aside, whoever is managing the music has solid taste. Much respect. Overall great meal for a reasonable price - well played T3C!
