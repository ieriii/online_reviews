I know people love this place. I can sorta understand why. But as a Greek this place feels more like a french bistro than a Greek restaurant/bakery. Too many rules at lunch. They have a lunch line that ends around 2pm. You go up cafeteria style and order from the daily standards and specials. I like getting the Greek country salad with grilled chicken. This salad comes traditional Greek style without lettuce. A bunch of tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, green peppers and oil and vinegar dressing. Or the chicken-mozzarella Artopita and cup of soup. The menu is limited but they do have some unconventional items. The have artopizza's that are ok. I dislike their potato salad and pasta salad (both offered as sandwich sides) because they are creamy style which is not conventional Greek style salads. I'd much rather the oil and vinegar style of both. The second floor seating is cramped and crowded on a busy day.  The bakery makes some pretty tasty sweets and fresh bread.
