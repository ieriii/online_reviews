We really love this place even though it is a complete tourist trap with crazy long waits and large, loud families. Here is why we keep coming back: AWESOME food (huge variety - if you can't find something you like...you are screwed, so just go home), warm toasty bread, huge portions, delish drinks, great service and killer desserts. Yup, that says it all!
