For a person who never eats Asian food, this restaurant made me an absolute lover of Korean BBQ. The option to cook the food at the table makes the meal feel even more authentic.  Seating can be around a standard table or down on the floor around beautiful wooden tables.  I am not a seafood eater, yet I found so many amazing choices. The seasoning and cut of the chicken was absolutely extraordinary. The meats is cut as such so that it cooks extremely quickly. The servers are more than willing to help you figure out what sauce is for which meats.  Drinks are pretty simple, soda in cans but there are also some beers on the menu. A standout unique item is the Sweet Potato Wine. I would recommend this to anyone who loves meat. You definitely get your fill here with some left to take home.  Parking is horrible. Try a side street. The hours are 10a-5a. I have never been there for a late night meal but it does not that I will not be soon. I am very impressed by this restaurant. From the outside you would never guess how amazing it really is.  Also the noodles, soup, rice and dumplings are amazing. Overall, I would go there with a group
