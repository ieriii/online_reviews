Best Killer Meat Burrito Rice be damned! This burrito is filled with a half a cow's worth of meat! Yeeeeeee Haaaaaw. Also, the place is open very late.  The salsa is very tasty as well with a generous helping of fresh cilantro.  Margaritas by the pitcher help wash it all down. Ahhhhh, a tasty beverage to quench my thirst.
