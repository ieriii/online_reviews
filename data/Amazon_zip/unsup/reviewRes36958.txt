This message is not for food- I actually really like their food. This is for their online ordering and customer service. I spent all this time on the "online ordering" section of their website ordering the food. The order goes through, it tells me how long the wait will be and I'm super excited. Awhile later, I get a phone call (which gets dropped 3 times by them) only to tell me that their computer system is not set up yet to notice that my address is not within their delivery zone (though I looked hard on their website and couldn't find their delivery zone listed). It's somewhat close to their delivery zone, but not in it. Why would you have an online delivery system set up without that type of filter? And since it's your fault, you can't just go a little out of your way this time? He did say they would be kind enough to void my order, though. Really, thanks.
