So my gay friend calls this place Wakahomo. Not nice..not nice. Anyway, I really liked this place. The rolls were great and we tried a lot of them! I can't remember all that we tried but this place stands out in my mind as a fun place to go. I do remember the Snow White and Godzilla role as being good. The ambiance is pretty nice and it's a bit bigger than a lot of the other sushi places on the north side. The price and service was fine. I think we brought our own wine and the corkage fee wasn't too bad since we had 4 people. I had no idea they delivered and now I want to try it out. I've never had delivery sushi so we'll see how good that is.
