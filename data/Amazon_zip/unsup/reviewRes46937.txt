On Thursday, I was able to make reservations at this place for Friday night with no problems! I didn't get to check out the farmer's market but my friend did and said there was nothing to look at since it seemed like they were closing up. By then, it was probably around 7:00 pm. The location is great and parking is easy! That's always a plus! I even parked on the side street and didn't have to pay! I heard good things about the sweet potato fries so we had to try them. They were indeed delicious! Nice, crispy, and full of flavor with a side of goat cheese fondue. My friend and I had been looking at the menu online and the meatloaf caught our attention, so bacon wrapped meatloaf it was for both of us! Two medium slices of an oval-shaped meatloaf wrapped in bacon and topped with caramelized onions on a bed of Yukon gold potatoes! On the side were my favorite seasonal veggies of fresh zucchini and yellow squash. Yum! Only thing is I wish the bacon was crispier, other than that, it was one good tasting meatloaf! I think I was more interested in the company and the conversation than to fully enjoy my dinner like I usually do. The place was definitely loud but happenin', and not overcrowded. I also didn't see/hear the band that was suppose to be playing tonight, but then again, it may have been too hard to talk. I'd love to go back and try brunch sometime!
