Me = fan of SPG I stayed here 2 weeks ago when I got stranded at ORD after my flight to Milwaukee got cancelled due to a storm. I booked a room while waiting for my luggage at the airport at midnight (Thu. to Fri). I was annoyed when the reservation agent on the SPG phone line didn't understand that I wanted to stay 1 night and not check out on Saturday. Not hard to grasp. Checking into the hotel proved to still be a challenge as it still wasn't clear that I would be checking out 6 hours later. Put that together with the fact that the bathroom wallpaper was coming off the wall near the toilet and you've removed one star.
