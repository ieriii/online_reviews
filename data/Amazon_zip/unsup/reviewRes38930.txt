Two visits for food and a few others for cocktails but that's a different story all together. As a bar to have a properly mixed cocktail at, it's a good time. Take a date or pick one up at the bar and order a few rounds and you'll have much to talk about. The bar area is cozy but could handle a few folks sitting for drinks with a meal. Two occasions I stopped for food with groups. Both times I left feeling unsatisfied. Two visits and not once wowed me. One for dinner having the ever popular boar sloppy Joe's and the other for brunch, trying their version of French toast. Both meals wowed me in price but not in tastes. If the boar is always served this way, I cannot see how people are loving it, it isn't my kind of sloppy Joe. I wanted to love it and came here because of word of mouth. The donuts (which I'd heard much about) that are mentioned on the dinner menu, I've had and were pretty interesting as well as the house made breakfast sausage, also pretty tasty. Other then that I haven't tried to taste their fare again. Of the two meal parties I joined, others had ordered items that were tasty and delicious, but me.. no. The drinks were a hit but the meals a miss. I hate saying this, I know my friend will see my review and be bummed. She's not happy that I won't join them for dinner here.
