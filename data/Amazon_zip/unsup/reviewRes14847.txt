Sabatino's was very nice. We came here for a big celebration so that added to the experience, lots of family and friends were there and such. This place was very accommodating toward a rather large group. If they were bothered by this, I don't think they let it show which was nice. Felt bad for our waiter as he was constantly running around but he did a good job and handled the business very well. The food was delightful and very satisfying. Overall, this is a nice little place to check out if you're in the area.  So GENIUS...
