I liked Crisp since they first opened. I would recommend the wings. A regular order is more than enough food. The BBQ flavor is a good mix of hot and sweet. I don't like hot food that is hot for hotness sake, this isn't the case with Crisp. Their portions of fries are huge too. You can definitely share them, with a friend, unless you are a fatty.
