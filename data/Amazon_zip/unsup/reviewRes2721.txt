I am confused. Very confused. How can a place like this possibly be a one star establishment? That's right. It should really be a two star establishment. I had enjoyed my meal here more than at Alinea the night before. Lemon vanilla mousse was amazing. Sweet and sour, perfectly blended together. White sturgeon "caviar", avocado, and hazelnut. Nice play on caviar, had a great sturgeon flavor with avocado, felt like a very good guacamole. Atlantic Skate was executed perfectly. Crispy skin, great flavor. I could go on forever, and ever. A lot of hits, some ok's but excellent value for the money. It was pretty darn amazing, you should go! Ambiance was super comfortable, service excellent.
