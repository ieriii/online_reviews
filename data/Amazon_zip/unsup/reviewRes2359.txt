Holy f#$%. As Neil Diamond sang in "Sweet Caroline", when I think of Hot Doug's, I think, SO GOOD, SO GOOD, SO GOOD. I had the portabella sausage with brie, bleu cheese sausage with pear creme fraiche and almonds, and duck fat fries. Duck fat fries, they reminded my taste buds of when McDonald's used to fry their french fries in trans fat. It was delicious, you can't find french fries like that anywhere in CA anymore - and I'm something of a french fries connoisseur. It was so worth the 45 minute wait in the Chicago cold.
