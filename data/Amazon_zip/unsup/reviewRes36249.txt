No need to get into how hopelessly LOST I got while trying to find this place (let's just blame it on my Chicago newness), but if there's one reason I wouldn't beat a hasty path back to Meli Cafe, it'd have to be the remote location. (Brown to Loop, walk to Blue, Blue to UIC-Halsted, walk three bewildered blocks. Sheesh.) The meal itself was ordered and consumed hastily, but it was delicious enough. My friend ordered the challah French toast, stuffed with mascarpone cheese and topped with sliced bananas, walnuts and drizzled with caramel sauce. Somehow, it avoided being cloyingly sweet and had a nice balance of flavors. I opted for a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice (a little room-temp for my taste, but it was fresh!) and a sun-dried tomato and basil fritatta topped with ricotta. Fritatta with ricotta; so tasty it even rhymes! Our server today reminded me of a line from the 2002 film classic, "XXX," featuring Vin Diesel: "Ice? Maybe we can chisel some off your heart... IF WE CAN FIND IT." Girl was frozen solid. My friend and I are sweet, courteous and very gracious to our servers, but every smile and polite word was met with a set-in-stone scowl and a curt reply. Maybe it's a Greek thing. (I doubt it.) Still, her attitude helped keep the bill down; with the menu prices as high as they were, we were plenty happy to stop at an 18 percent gratuity and call it a morning. Overall, a lovely spot if you're in the neighborhood, but there are much better breakfast places to take your destination dollars.
