I've had several meals at The Gage and have never been disappointed. Although I generally default to the fish and chips because it's SO good, I tried their steak sandwich (w/some kind of interesting cheddar cheese) the last time I was there for lunch & it was excellent. The servers are uniformly attentive and knowledgeable. I also like the way they've arranged their wine list. Finally, twice when I've been there, the manager stopped by to ask how everything was. When my friend told him that the food was great but the coffee was terrible, he was horrified; he went back to the kitchen, came back to our table and told her that she was right. He apologized and offered her a freshly-brewed (and better) cup. My only complaint is the noise level - not so conversation friendly unless you're there at an off hour.
