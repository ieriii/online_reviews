Delivery took an hour and twenty minutes for a single pan pizza. And I seriously live about 6-8 blocks away. Not a great start....Outside of the slow delivery, the food was very mediocre. Mozzarella sticks were soggy. Pan pizza was very blah. I was completely underwhelmed and definitely won't be coming back....
