To only give 5 stars is a crime! My boyfriend and I have been here twice in the past month and both times it's exceeded our expectations! The Plus': 1. Well-balanced wine list 2. Amazing food - everything we've had is fantastic 3. Very very friendly service - we even scored a free glass of wine last night because another patron ended up not wanting their order! 4. Cheese comes from a local shop: Pastoral in Lakeview -- amazing cheeses and worth the price Food: Pork neck bone, bone marrow, pork shoulder: ALL amazing. They've been out of the pork liver pate both times we've been so we're still waiting to taste that. The chicken kabob was recommended by our waiter, and it was fantastic! For a place known for their swine, they cook a mean bird. Even though the restaurant is always busy, they move people in and out quick enough that the wait isn't too long. We can't wait for the next time we go back: Christmas-ish get together with family!
