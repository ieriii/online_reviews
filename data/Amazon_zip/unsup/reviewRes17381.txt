oh Violet Hour, what have you become? As you can see from my other reviews I used to be enamored with your tasty beverages and delicous food....but the vibe has changed and I"m not sure we can meet like this any longer. My last experience at the Violet Hour included noise, a loud bar, sluts behind me talking to loud and a bar back that looked like he rolled out of his fraternity and grew some "chops" on his face in order to fit in working here. Its one thing when you actually car about the delicious cocktails you are crafting...its another when you are doing it strictly for the dollars...and I tend to wonder in which direction the Violet Hour is now leaning.
