Okay so let me just say that I love Andersonville and we like trying new restaurants so I was excited to find a new little Italian place right in our 'hood. We went for dinner on a late Saturday night (conveniently made reservations right on their website). The place was extremely busy when we got there and our table was waiting for us...great. However our server really ruined what could have been a nice dinner.  I don't know if he was just overwhelmed by the VERY crowded place or if he is just normally a rude tool....but either way, he sucked. We asked for recommendations and he answered without hesitation, but when we asked if he had actually tried what he suggested, he quickly said no.  Food was okay.....just okay. Also, they claim to have a full bar, but they didn't carry many of what we would consider staples...leaving us thirsty as we dealt with the rude waiter. So if you want bad service by someone with a "painted on smile" who has no clue what he is talking about in a really loud crowded place.....this is a great choice!
