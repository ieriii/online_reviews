Went for Dinner on a Monday night. Nice atmosphere, great beer selection on Tap. I had the Duo of Duck. (duck confit and grilled duck breast). My wife had a walnut beet salad. We shared a sweet potato fries starter. It came with melted goat cheese for dipping. I had the Belgium on tap.. (I think $4 taps is their Monday night special) and my wife had a glass of the Cava. The Duck was very well prepared and the melted goat cheese was very good with the sweet potato fries. My wife's salad was... plain. not great. I would probably go back, for drinks and maybe even their breakfast.
