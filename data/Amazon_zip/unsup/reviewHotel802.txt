Ok, they have the best showers...if not the smallest bathrooms. And really, charging for everything? And ridiculous charges at that! Sure I realize baseball players stay here and they can spend money like water, but damn...I'm not Jay-Z! They also have awesome beds with great comforters, and the place is relatively sharp, clean, and fancy...but i'd never stay here if i had to spend more than $65.
