Holy crap. All the enamored yelp reviews of this place convinced me to try it out for lunch (grocery shopping will happen when I throw a dinner party that requires more that 6 kinds of cheeses for hors d'oeuvres.) and it lived up to the hype like you wouldn't believe. I had a sandwich, on really fresh multigrain bread - turkey with brie and cranberry relish and a really light honey mustard. My stomach is so happy right now, I can't even tell you. Go. Go go go go go. It's amazing and you'll be so happy you did.
