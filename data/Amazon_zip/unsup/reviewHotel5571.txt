Very cool hotel with a great decor. As another reviewer commented, it reminded me of Mad Men as well. We booked a Jr. Suite and were upgraded to a family room (2 rooms - jr. Suite with adjoining room with bunk beds, own tv and bathroom). I almost felt guilty about all of the space. Comfortable bed:) The staff were helpful and fun. Loved the uniforms! Attached coffee shop was good. Drawback for me was that the rooftop wasn't open, so there wasn't a bar. That is why it wasn't five star for me. I like to come out from the evening and be able to have a drink on-site. If you plan to hang out in Lincoln Park, location is awesome. Short walk to the zoo, great restaurants and shopping. If you are planning more of a Michigan Ave., museums, Navy Pier, etc... The location isn't ideal. Will definitely stay there again when visiting my niece in Lincoln Park.
