What I love most about Hot Doug's is that they do things their way.  Do they need more space? Yes. Could they speed things up a bit? Yes. Could they have longer hours? Yes. Is their menu a bit confusing? for me yes. But keep in mind you are entering into the mind of a genius and your opinion does not matter.  Slow down and enjoy your longer lunch break, because it does not get much better than Hot Doug's. His inventiveness reigns supreme in the hot dog world.
