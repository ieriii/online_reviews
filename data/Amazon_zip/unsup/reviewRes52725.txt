3.5 stars, but i must admit i'm not a huge meat eater. if i was, i think it would be 4. the salad bar was nice. asparagus was really fresh. but who really goes to a brazilian steak house to eat asparagus? meats galore! from tasty filet mignon to super fat juicy shrimp to fall off the bone beef ribs and the sweetest pineapple ever. all good stuff. shared carrot cake and chocolate raspberry cake. yes, a little gluttonous, but i can't pass up dessert. with a 2 for 1 coupon, paid $50 a person (four of us total). kinda pricey, but if you're a big guy with a big appetite, then definitely worth it. for a not so big girl who'd rather eat chocolate than a steak, maybe not so much.
