I really like their take on tapas. Although I love Cafe ba-ba-reba, this was a nice change of pace. The portions are pretty small and dishes are pricey, so it is probably better suited for a special occasion rather than casual everyday dining. My only qualm would be the service. Our waiter was not very attentive nor friendly. We described our likes, but yet he was unable to formulate any recommendations.
