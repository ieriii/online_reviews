I came here during a bachelor party (the brother of the groom who was from out of town decided to put us in the middle of Andersonville, not knowing it was predominantly gay area). Except for the beer selection, I was disappointed in this place. The waitress we had was completely ignoring us for most of the meal, but it wasn't that the restaurant was busy; she had plenty of time to stand around and chat. My friend who wasn't drinking ordered a cranberry juice (I guess the only thing besides water they had), and was charged $8! I guess we should have figured at this overpriced place, they would charge for a mixed drink that contained no alcohol. The food was good, but the whole experience really turned me off to this place.
