I went to RJ Grunts for the first time because I had a major craving for a burger! The wait was 30 minutes at 8pm on a Sat. When we were finally seated we had the smallest table ever squished up against a wall. We were next to an 8 year old birthday party which was quite noisy. Then we were surrounded by people eating from the salad bar... which looked pretty blah to me... and overpriced. That's all fine and dandy but every time people walked past me the slammed into me or my chair which got really annoying really fast. The food took a while to come out and we only saw our waitress when we ordered and when we got our food. I think she hid in the kitchen most of the time. The burgers were good. Thick and juicy but at the same time greasy and difficult to eat when the bun got soggy. The grease even leaked through my napkin and stained my new dress :(. Then we were going to get dessert but it took forever for me to snag the waitress (I had to wave her down and she ignored the first couple attempts) so I figured I would cut my losses and just get the check. Also the bathroom situation needs to be reevaluated. It is one stall and there was always a line. Not somewhere I want to go back to.
