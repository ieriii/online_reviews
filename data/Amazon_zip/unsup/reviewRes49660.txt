I'm 100% Colombian, so this review is biased. Will Las Tablas be the best meal of your life? No. The menu is heavy on meats, sausages, fried items like arepas and empanadas. But, the food is VERY good and it serves it's purpose. It's a great introduction to the food from the interior area of Colombia. I'm proud of this place and I encourage all my friends try it. Order a "picada" which is a plate of food for two that has a little bit of everything. Get the arepa and chorizo and eat it while it's hot. Order extra chimichurri sauce and put it on everything. Take some home and put it on your lover. FYI, this place is no longer BYOB on the weekends. Not a deal breaker but keep that in mind so you dont show up with bottles you can't drink. For the record, Tango Sur is where you go when you are just out of college wet behind the ears. Las Tablas is where you go when you know what's up.
