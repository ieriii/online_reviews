Went there this past Sunday for lunch. We started with fried yuca with garlic, empanadas (beef, ropa vieja, goat cheese, and cheese and guava), and fried maduros (plantains) and nothing was a disappointment. Although all of the empanadas were delicious, if you want to try something unique, get the empandas with cheese and guava. We followed with a different sandwich each--cubano, ropa vieja, cuban hamburger, and bistec, and again all were delicious. I really enjoyed the ropa vieja sandwich but my favorite has always been the cubano and I wasn't let down. Roast pork, ham, melted swiss cheese and pickles on pressed, crusty bead. How can you go wrong with that combination. The only way to improve on this (and to deviate with what a cubano is) would be to add bacon--yumm!!.  There's room outside in 2 different areas if you want to eat al fresco, one under a roof to shade out the sun (and with music piped in) and the other not, but with a couple of guys playing live music. All in all, a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon with a group of people. We've got to go there some Saturday night and listen to the live music they bring in and you should too. The story behind the name is that the family fled Cuba by boat decades ago and made the 90-mile journey to freedom. All I can say is that Cuba's loss is definitely our gain.
