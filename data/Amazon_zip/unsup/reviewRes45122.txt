Finally, I made it to Anteprima for dinner! I wish I had gone here sooner! This restaurant is a very pretty spot and popular, located right in the middle of Andersonville. On a Friday or Saturday evening, I highly recommend reservations, as there will almost certainly be a wait for a table. Also, this is not a pasta/pizza type of Italian restaurant, Anteprima specializes is more of a rustic/country style of cuisine. They do have pasta dishes on the menu, but its not going to be typical Chicago Italian restaurant fare. The interior space has a casual yet a warm upscale feel. As with most neighborhood restaurants, the tables are in close proximity of each other and the noise level can get high. We sat on the patio/deck in back, which has a much more quiet relaxed vibe and has the feel of a cozy outdoor room. They do have patio heaters, so are we go into Fall, you can still be comfortable on a cool evening. We started with the Grilled Shrimp marinated along with both sweet and hot peppers, it was excellent. The bread and thin bread sticks were quite good as well.  I selected the pan-seared Scallops for my main course. It was quite possibly the best Scallops I've ever had. The wait staff was highly attentive, very helpful with wine selections and we didn't feel like we had to quickly leave to free up a table.
