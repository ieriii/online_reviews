$20 for lunch buffet? The food was good but most Indian food should be. The service was marginal, at best. My lunch buffet came with 3 pieces of tandoori chicken which I wanted to wrap up because I was on short lunch break from the office. The waiter bobbed his head from side to side and stated that their policy would not permit me to take my food home, "but I am very sorry indeed sir." Blow me - I paid for it. There... I feel better.
