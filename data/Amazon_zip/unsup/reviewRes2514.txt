We had been hearing about this place (the looong wait, the wonderful food, the ambiance) from friends and relatives for about 6 months. We must have been very lucky: went on a Monday at about 11:45 and only had to wait about 5 minutes! But oh sooooo many choices! Which one to pick? One member of our party couldn't decide and had 2. We had: Chicago-Style Hot Dog with all the trimmings, Marsala and Roasted Garlic Wild Boar Sausage with Anchovy-Parsley Goat Butter and Black Pepper Affin, Pork and Beef Curry Sausage with Spicy Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut, and Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Sriracha Mustard and Sesame-Seaweed Salad. Believe it or not it all arrived within 5 minutes. Great fries too!
