Yes, it's a massive tourist spot. However, it doesn't suck, and it's not a chain. For these reasons, I like to bring my parents here for lunch when they visit me from Michigan. My dad is old and grouchy (I love him, but he is!) and he wants good, familiar food and a place to sit when he eats (none of those hot dog stands for him!) so I brought him and my mom here for lunch last month. I've been here several times, and had a pleasant experience both times. There are more unique and more "Chicago" type places to eat, but Grand Luxe Cafe is a nice place. It's LOUD and HUGE, but no more so than any other place on or around MI Ave. It's fairly pricey, which is why I recommend coming here for lunch (which is until 5 PM now!). The last time I was there, I had a Santa Barbara chicken sandwich and it was great! I couldn't finish it (portions are very big here) so it was a great late-night snack that evening. My parents each got a half a sandwich and soup. The Tortilla soup is just "blah," so get something else unless you like "blah." The servers are nice as can be, sometimes a little too enthusiastic, but it's appreciated. They can tend to hover, but it's an attentive kind of hovering, not a hovering because they are bored or want your table. On the plus side, I've never waited more than 10-15 minutes for a table, even at high noon on a Saturday. They seem to be very organized here. Nothing spectacular, but it's good food, huge portions, good place to take the parents.
