The breakfast burrito can do no wrong at Bongo Room. It's pretty much perfection to my tastebuds. It's 'refreshing' in the summer, it's 'filling' in the winter, and it's 'medicinal' when your hung over. The pancakes are fantastic too. But the half orders are plenty big for me. They are great to split. I know a lot of people complain about the 'wait' or the 'pretentious staff', but 1. worth the wait (or sit at the bar), 2. the staff is super busy with the customers but when they have time to breathe I've always had great chats with them.  I heart you Bongo Room. I wish you'd open a Lakeview local. . . .
