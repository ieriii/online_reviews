Best Ethiopian in Chicago since Addis Abba (now closed). It's about time! Runner up would be African Harambee in Roger's Park so if you haven't been there either, you need to stop in. Demera also has some cheap wine and the South African ones aren't too bad. My judge of a good Ethiopian restaurant: full of flavor, but distinctly unique tastes. Here we tried almost everything with the 4 veggie / 4 meat option split between 2. The marinated beef (sheesh, won't be able to tell you the name of it) won us over. It was sweet and delicious, with rich undertones, exquisite. Everything on the platter was good.
