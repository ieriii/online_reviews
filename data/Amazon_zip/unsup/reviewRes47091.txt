I went to breakfast here today and the food was blah. My mom and I split the lemon poppyseed & ricotta pancakes with blueberry sauce (sounds much better than it tasted) and the breakfast melt (cheese, spinach, egg and bacon on toasted rye). The pancakes tasted pre-made and the blueberry sauce made them already soggy before even arriving to our table. The breakfast melt was greasy and gross. I would have preferred Clark's at half the price.
