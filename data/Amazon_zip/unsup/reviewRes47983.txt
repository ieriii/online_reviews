Made a reservation for a Saturday breakfast/brunch. They deserve all the accolades they have received. Granted, their food wasn't your typical breakfast/brunch food but every dish was still amazing. Their coffee was good, and the Publican Mimosa (blance (belgium beer) with orange juice was a very interesting twist of a mimosa. We had to try the spicy pork rinds after seeing it on the food network - do it. You won't be disappointed. We also ordered the chef's selection of raw oysters which is a dozen of oysters, and you're given to of each kind. I like how they give you a card that states what each oyster is. Entrees: 1) Ricotta & zucchini bread with raspberries, honey & mint 2) Market salad (poached egg, green beans, zucchini, fennel, fingerling potatoes, parmesan & creamy red wine vinaigrette) 3) Farm Chicken - very moist, tender, and the sausages were so good! We also ordered an fish entree (it was actually cool in temperature - wouldn't have thought fish could taste so good cooled!) The service was very good and the price was not bad.
