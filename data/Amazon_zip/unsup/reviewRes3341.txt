Okay, so after being a compulsive 3rd wheel to my friends, (no shame!) we decided to go here, before a show at the lake shore theater, I ordered the Buddha bowl and a drink of bon bon, which I haven't had in so many years, so I couldn't help it. To be fair the only reason I even found out about this place was because of my friend Luan N who is basically Yelp with a voicemail, he knows like a 6th sense about food which is great, I feel like he is Yoda and I am only but a young padwan...(j/k for all the trekkies)...to everyone else, yes I am a nerd! Anyways back to the food, the buddha bowl was not even the biggest one, but was enough for almost 2 people, I have a large appetite and was able to finish, well, just abouts. It was really good, but was lacking something, wasn't sure what it was, and then half way through the meal realized I hadn't put in the hot sauce....dang it! Apart from that the place was really clean, staff were really friendly, and it was over all a nice place. My friends ordered the Barbecue flavored Chicken and the Seoul Sassy, they said it was good but preferred the Seoul Sassy, the portions of the chicken was more than enough even for the two of them. Generally great, and a cute place to go, loads of authentic Korean drinks available, always a bonus!! If you get a chance definitely go, it worth it! p.s. (check out the photos of the food for portion sizes)
