I haven't had a cake from here yet, but considering how good the cupcakes are, I can only imagine they must be delicious. Those cupcakes couldn't be more addicting if they put crack in them. Just thinking about them makes me crave one. My favorites are the red velvet and the double chocolate. The sandwiches and the quiche are also great for lunch. And I love their chai lattes too. Great neighborhood gem.
