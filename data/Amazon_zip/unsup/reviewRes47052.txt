We did dinner on a Saturday night. Decent beer and wine choices. Started with the goat cheese dip and a flatbread. Both winners. Then had the rabbit which was pretty much a bland mess of a dish. The chocolate bread pudding was great though. Service was spotty and my drink went empty for 10 minutes cause my waiter disappeared.
