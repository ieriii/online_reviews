Went here for the first time last night. It was warm and cozy on a very cold night. The food was pretty good, and they have large portions. There is a nice drink menu, too. Mojitos! Service was great too; they dealt with our splitting the bill 5,000 ways very well. I took one star off because my tuna was not that great, but still, I will be back!
