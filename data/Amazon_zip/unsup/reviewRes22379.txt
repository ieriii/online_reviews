Hands down the best greek restaurant in greektown!! This place has killer vegetarian moussaka, mouth-watering tzatziki and some flamin' saganaki. As a veg, I've only tried their veggie options, but I've gone with lots of carnivores and they have all raved about their dinners as well. Trust me - you won't be disappointed!
