I keep seeing reviews saying they tried the hot dog and not sure what the big deal is. Folks, please, if you're going to wait in line for this place, and trust me you're going to wait, do NOT order from the regular menu. You have to have one of the specialty encased meats on the specials menu, also viewable on their website. As an example, today I had the Jalapeo Smoked Chicken Sausage with Mole  la Carlos and Cotija Cheese. Phenomenal. Hope that helps.
