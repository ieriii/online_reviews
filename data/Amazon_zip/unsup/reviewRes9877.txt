Mezz a mezz. Means "meh" in Italian, FYI. High end Italian cuisine, not worth the lengthy wait for a reservation. Nice patio, but in a crap neighborhood. Pretentious patrons abound. I think this is where old Hipsters dine when their Trust Fund disbursements arrive. I'm taking away the third star because it's a fairly pricey place, yet we discovered when the check arrived that two in our party that had soft drinks were charged for each refill. LOL! Very very pimpy, Piccolo Sogno. $15 for 3 fountain diet Pepsis? I know you want to be as authentic as possible, but please remember you're in a dodgy meat packing district and not *actually* in Italia. In a sentence... Food for assholes.
