i think the green mill as a bar is pretty cool. however, the staff there is rude and "clicky" if you don't know anyone who works there, be prepared for shitty service and an attitude to match. shouting at me and my friends from the end of the bar if we need anything, really? The bar is open until 5am, sorry you're tired. Definitely won't be going back there.
