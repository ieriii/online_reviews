After reading about it in Timeout and then realizing, HELLO, I live around the corner from it, I finally went with a date to Mia Francesca. Our server was friendly and funny, but not overbearing. He had good answers to our questions. I also love the whole concept of changing the menu around the freshest ingredients... makes sense! Our salads were amazing, so was the pasta we had, and we even ate dessert (as well as had a delicious bottle of Chianti). I was impressed with the food, the service, and the friendliness of the place. It is not a ROMANTIC date spot though... definitely loud and alot of fun, so just know that it's not an Italian place like that.
