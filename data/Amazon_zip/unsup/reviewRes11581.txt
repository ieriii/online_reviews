Excellent pizza at a good value. For anyone who can't stomach the heavy Chicago-style pizza, this place offers fantastic thin crust, that is freshly made and well-executed. This place also has great high ceilings, and loft-like atmosphere. Our party of 4 shared 2 medium sized pizzas, which allowed for plenty of leftovers. We tried red sauce and white sauce versions. Didn't have to wait for a table during weekend lunch hour, which was nice. Street parking is difficult in Wicker Park though.
