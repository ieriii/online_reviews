We will return for a meal later afternoon as it is much quieter! NO ACUSTICS...TOO LOUD! The noise level ruined our time there. Next try, we'll try to be seated out-doors. We want to support Nana's and dine there, mostly because they serve ORGANIC FOOD! Good friendly service as well. continued success!!
