Good hotel if you're just in town to do the tourist stuff and hit the shopping. We were able to walk everywhere or hop on a bus or train. Awesome bathroom/shower!! If you're looking for a great view from your room go somewhere else, all you'll see are the buildings next door or across the street. Room was clean, bed was fine. Only real downside was we could hear EVERYTHING in the hallways. Every ding of the elevator was clear as a bell and heard every person on our floor coming and going. Didn't sleep well due to noise but everything else was pretty decent.
