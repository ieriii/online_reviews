I love speakeasys and have no complaints about the Violet Hour. Our bartender (a girl, not sure her name) was so nice and helped figure out what I like before making me some sort of a gin cocktail -- it was superb! My boyfriend agreed. She also gave me a nightcap on the house, which I thought was such great customer service and so kind for someone who knew we were out of towners. The line outside was long, but it was worth it. 5+ stars for the violet hour!
