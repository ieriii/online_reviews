This place is great for vegans and non vegans alike. The "bacon" burgers could fool even the most dedicated and stubborn of carnivores, and give the true vegans the good old fashioned diner experience that is probably lacking in their regular restaurant experiences in Chicago. The reuben and the chipotle firehouse wrap are also very good, but they definitely have a "vegan taste" (soy cheese, seitan meat), that is hardly detectable with the "bacon" burgers, but even uncomfortably noticeable to me (an ever striving pure vegan). Not to say they're bad though. Southern style was not as flavorful and decadently southern as I would have wanted given the name, but definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for collared greens, black eyed peas and corn fritters.  Save room for dessert. The milkshakes are soooo delicious. Lucky leprechaun mint is the way to go! I also tried the chocolate chip cookie dough which was good, but not quite as flavorful as the mint.
