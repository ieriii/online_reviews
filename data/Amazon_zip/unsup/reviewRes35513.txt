Update - New Bottle Old Wine After the new Chicago Tribune story came out on 2/11, tonight I finally got to go to the new location with my family, my sister and some good friends to give it a second try. Before I begin my review, let me bring up two things; firstly, I dropped my previous 2 stars review to only 1 star now, and secondly, whenever you see ****, please insert the appropriate expletive yourself. Additional space at this new location only meant additional ****ing chaos - even at the old location, 1/10 of the size, service was sporadic when they were packed; now with the new place being 10 times bigger, getting service was 10 times harder. This place is called Sun Wah Bar-B-Que, but it can hardly live up with any Bar-B-Que standard, in my opinion. The BBQ roast pork was too lean and dry, this is because they weren't using the right kind of cut, the pork butt to make the BBQ roast pork; instead they substitute it with a cheaper cut of meat. Then come the roast pork, dry and tough with no flavour whatsoever. Aside from having the (2) Peking Ducks for dinner, we also ordered other dishes, sadly they were basically cooked like ****ing Chop Suey!!! Maybe we have forgotten to ask the waitress to inform the cooks that we are real Chinese diners.  Let me begin with the two vegetable dishes, stir fry Chinese broccoli and stir fry baby Pak Choy, which both can be tasted with burnt wok aroma and were soaked heavily in gravy. Tell you he truth, stir fry is never meant to be having excess gravy and cooking dishes with a burnt wok is just dead ***ing wrong!!! The Beef and Chinese broccoli chow fun (wide flat noodles) was simply ****ing Chop Suey style. A steamed Sole, OK but nothing excited about it. Now, here comes the Peking Ducks. Firstly, they were inadequately seasoned and hence tasted bland. Secondly, Peking Duck is served with steamed buns, so that you can wrap the crunchy duck skin and meat inside to eat. The duck is a good size bird, yet they only provide you with (6) steamed buns to every Peking Duck order. So, the end result was a lot of duck meat left but no buns to eat with!!! Then come the dishes that were included in the Peking Duck dinner, a soup made from the duck carcass and a stir fry noodles and fried rice made with the leftover meat from the duck carcass. The soup tasted just like boiled saline water. The stir fry noodles and fried rice were both extremely salty, and they looked and tasted exactly what you would get from an Americanised Chinese restaurant, ****ing Choy Suey style!!! The noodles was cooked just like Chow Mien and the fried rice was cooked with ****ing soy sauce!!! Again, we must have forgotten to ask the waitress to let the cooks know that we are real Chinese diners!!! The only saving grace from tonight's dinner was having family and good friends as company. So, there you have it, after my second time with this place, I don't think I would be back anytime soon. But, if you're looking for Chop Suey style Chinese food, Sun Wah Bar-B-Que is your ****ing pot of gold!
