May as well chime in. Two trips here, two deliciously wonderful meals. Order the ricotta/honeycomb vaso. It's insanely tasty. And if you use up all the bread, and have more ricotta, don't hesitate to ask for more bread. They'll bring it. Order the polenta of the day. I've had two different versions now, and they've both been excellent--though the real star of the show there is the polenta, which I've never liked before. Davanti's is rich and creamy and right. Most everything else I've ordered has been seasonal. It's all been absolutely delicious, however, from the cauliflower steak to the burrata and roasted tomato salad. And all the pastas I've tried have been great....only thing I didn't care for was the risotto carbonara. (Carbonara is such a pasta-dependent thing. Good carbonara sauce clings to the pasta just so, with a sheen of egg. Doesn't quite get there with rice.) Go early to get a table, as they don't take rezzies.
