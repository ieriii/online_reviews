You should be ready to wait.. you have been warned. Do not fret, your wait will be rewarded!!  I have been here more than I have been to any other brunch place in Chicago. I am not some weirdo who loves waiting in the freezing cold for an hour, I am a weirdo who loves awesome food.  I have had quite a few things on their menu and they have all pleased. I have brought friends and family and they have always left happy as well. You can order a single pancake, and when you see their pancakes menu you will see why that is awesome. I usually order 1 or 2 as an "appetizer" for the group or 1 to add to my meal.(not that I am capable of eating the portion of a regular meal and a pancake in one sitting, usually have to bring half my food to go).
