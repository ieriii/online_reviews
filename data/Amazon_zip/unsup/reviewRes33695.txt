Mia as it is so lovingly referred to among all my friends is like coming home for a good meal. It's in my top 5 favorite places to eat and the food never ceases to amaze me. There are no specials here, a menu is written up every week (?) and that's what there is. I do have to say that they are very good at accommodating you if there is something on the menu that you want altered they are more than happy to accommodate your request. If there is simply nothing that catches your eye (has never happened to me!) then they will whip up some pasta and sauce at your request. I was there a few weeks ago and had one of the best Salmon dishes I have ever had. I went out on a limb here also because I come here for the pasta but it sounded so good and I was thrilled with my meal. If something new catches your eye try it! I'm yet to encounter someone not enjoying their meal here. The appetizers are delicious as well, my standby choice is the peapod, cucumber and tomato salad. It's simple but so good! There is always hot fresh bread put on your table with butter and olive oil. The wine list is pretty good, I've discovered some new red wines here that I loved but beware because they change their wine list from time to time! This is a good place to come with a date or a group of friends, just make sure you make reservations! It can get very crowded on a weekend night and it's worth it to make sure you can get a table. There is an upstairs and a patio in the back as well as a coach house. If you're having a party try and get the coach room it's amazing! This is a favorite that I will continue to visit time and time again :0)
