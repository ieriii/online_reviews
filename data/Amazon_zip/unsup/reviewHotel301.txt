This hotel is not a five-star hotel. BUT for the 5 days/4 nights I stayed here it definitely was a five-star experience. The hotel is quaint, boutique-like, and very european. Our room was small and the bathroom was very clean and very art-deco. We didn't need much room as we spent most of our trip out and about. The staff was awesome! Friendly, we never were disturbed, and were even granted a late-check out free of charge. LOCATION was perfect! One couldn't have asked to be any closer to public trans, dining, and nightlife. This hotel is located at Clark/Belmont, borders Wrigleyville, and Lincoln Park. The price was good for what we got. Everywhere else in Chicago was atleast 250$/night. We were here over St. Patrick's Day weekend ( a blackout wkend for most hotels) and paid under $200/night. My boyfriend and I plan on coming back to Chicago when the weather is better and we definitely will be returning to the City Suites.
