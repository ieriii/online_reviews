It's the morning after and I am more in love than ever. Friday night I saw a picture somewhere of some of the things served at Hot Doug's and I had to have it in my belly...with no delay! Hearing about the line only made me more intrigued and my boyfriend and I decided to ditch the Taste of Chicago this year and instead focus on the taste of Hot Doug's. Our Best decision ever. We got there at 1:40 and the line was probably about 80 people long at that point. We needed these amazing dogs!! After 20 minutes the line behind us had another 20 or so people in it. It took us two hours to get into the gates of heaven. TOTALLY worth the wait! I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger sausage and a BLT sausage and a corn dog. My boyfriend got the crawfish dog and some fries. From the first bite I wanted to take my corn dog to the nearest church and marry the thing it was so good. My BLT sausage....the gods of belly bursting bliss were shining on it...yum, YUM, YUM!. Amazing. The cajun sauce on the crawfish dog with goat cheese...out of this world. If I was smart I would have ordered more to take home but I ended up taking home some of my bacon cheeseburger sausage with coca-cola BBQ sauce and jack cheese and loving it up a few hours later. Total perfection. Hot Doug's....I will be dreaming about you.
