My roommates and I went to Spacca Napoli to celebrate my birthday. A co-worker told us about it, and it's very close, so we figured it was a safe bet. We ordered two appetizers, and they came so fast we thought the waiter made a mistake. The eggplant didn't look appetizing, but tasted great, and was a very hefty portion (I hate small appetizers). The Insalata di Mare was good as well. For pizza, we ordered the Gorgonzola special (sausage, tomato sauce, spinach), the Diavola (spicy salami, tomato sauce, basil), and the Bianca con Bufala (mozzarella, basil). All of had different opinions on which was our favorite, but all were fantastic. This ranks right up with Coalfire for best pizza in the city (I haven't been to Coalfire in a while so I won't make a judgment). The pizzas also came out very fast which was great. One gripe would be that their didn't seem to be a ton of variety on the menu for pizza, but I'll test this on repeat occasions. Overall, this is just a fantastic neighborhood pizza place, and a restaurant I plan to visit quite frequently from now on.
