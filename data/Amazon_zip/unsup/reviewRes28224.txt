Man, this place is real chi deep dish done right. Not like those of the better known i.e. Gino's Giordano's Lou's etc. I brought an out of towner hoping to show him deep dish at its best.  A bit lighter i.e. less cheese and dough, this place is by far the best deep dish I've had. We had a medium 'pan' topped with spinach, mushrooms, canadian bacon, and sausage and could barely finish more than half.  (Note, leftover pizza that evening wasn't quite as good, I think it's best enjoyed on the spot.)  Definitely will be back here for more. Staff is friendly, and quick to refill drinks. Love it!
