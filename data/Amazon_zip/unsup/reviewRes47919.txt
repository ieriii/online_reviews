Uh yeah. Any bar/restaurant that makes people wait in line at 6 p.m. on a THURSDAY when there is plently of room on the roof is LAME.  The bouncers are evil, and waitstaff is bitchy. Never, never will my friends and I spend a dime there. It looks cool from the outside, but it's not.  I was there for my 30th birthday and was on the roof with a group of friends. We spent over $100 in about 45 minutes. My boyfriend was there and there was a line. They wouldn't let him in! On my birthday. One person. We all left immediately and vowed ot never go back.
