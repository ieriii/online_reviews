I took my wife here for her birthday and was told ahead of time by friends it's a see and be seen type of place. I think that's very true. It's got great energy and the wait staff is fantastic. I'll go with the food and say that I think its some of the best Asian fusion I've had. Let me just say the menu is expansive and our waiter helped us through the maze of choices. We ended up going with a bunch of small dishes to try many items. Tops on our choices were the specialty cut rolls, which is basically sushi. Thumbs up to the firecracker - spicy tempura tuna, with creme cheese, jalapeno, water chestnuts, etc. Just great. There was also one with a funny name - something like pigs with hidden lobster - just think bacon paired with lobster and well, it's awesome. We also did Sunda's signature rice pan fried sushi - shrimp tempura. I have to say, it sounds cool but it really just amounts to a small square of rice, browned in a pan with a glob of what looked and tasted like guacamole. My wife's cosmo martini was a good as it looked but ran about $15. So here's where they lose a star. I know I'm gonna pay a lot. Got it. But our bill for four drinks, and four sushi type dishes came to about $120. Is that bad? No. But as much as I loved the creative dishes, and the service and atmosphere, I'd just have to say it was a bit overpriced. Did it kill the evening. Not by a long shot. They tossed in a birthday cupcake for the two of us for free, which was a nice touch. So if you're looking for a nice night out, great food, good service and a bustling dining area, then go for it. It's worth a splurge.
