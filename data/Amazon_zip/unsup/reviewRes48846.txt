Went here on New Year's Day, and had a fantastic experience from the minute we walked in. The waitress was very knowledgeable; she knew the menu inside and out. answered our questions and went to the kitchen to find out about specific ingredients. She was able to offer good ideas on ordering since the portions tend to vary according to the dish. We ordered the steak frites, rapini, whole striped bass and red snapper (served sashimi-style, a nice surprise and REALLY yummy), as well as 2 desserts: ginger stout cake and the waffle with honey butter. We loved EVERY bite, not one complaint! The overall service was timely and friendly. It probably helped that we were there on NYD and the house wasn't packed.
