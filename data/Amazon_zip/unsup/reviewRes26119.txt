To those who complain about small portions: That is what Tapas is!! Very tasty stuff... we were there for Sunday lunch so they had the brunch menu, a smaller but heavily discounted menu. I agree with previous reviewers: the bacon wrapped dates are a very interesting dish! We also had the Spanish meat and cheese station... yummo (very very tasty goats cheese partnered wonderfully with Spanish Cabernet!)
