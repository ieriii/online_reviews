My hometown favorite, La Tasca, will be knocked down a peg on the Zagat Spanish / Tapas list. We've been here twice, once just the two of us and once with friends from Toronto. The food is very good and the tapas concept is great for dinner with friends. The four stars are because we had bad hostess experiences both times and, even though we made reservations and showed up a little early we had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation both times. This is not a HUGE deal, but the bar / waiting area downstairs is not huge and crowds up quickly. Additionally, although the food quality and taste is very high, the price tag is equally high if not a little higher (for some of the grilled meats, I think)... so on value for money this one is about even if not a trifle on the negative side in my book. All that being said, I think this is a fantastic place in a great location. The decor is hip and fun. The first time we were there we went a-la-carte and the 2nd time we did the tasting menu. The tasting menu is probably better value for money then "DIY" ordering and is highly recommended - they bring out a great sample of what the menu has to offer.
