I got the gift certificate for the restaurant but the meal was still around $80, and that was WITH $25 off. The waiter wasn't that nice but he at least helped us to understand the menu. I think he got annoyed because there two other couples there who had trouble with the menu. IT wasn't as romantic as everyone makes it out to be, even though we had a booth seat. The lighting was very nice though and it was a fun experience. However I did not like the cheese fondue AT ALL. It was sour tasting and neither of us ate any of it. We got the beef and chicken fondue for the main course and it was DELICIOUS. I was so happy with it. You get a lot of different sauces and it was truly delicious. The chocolate fondue...once again not a big fan. It was alright but I didn't really care for it. You get to roast marshmallows though! I enjoyed the experience but don't think I'll go again.
