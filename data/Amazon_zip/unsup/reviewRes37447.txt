I almost walked out of that place; the bartenders have the biggest ATTITUDE (no smile, no eye contact, talk to you while looking away, etc.). I waited for a table in the back to grab a bite. They were nicer there but the food was really greasy. Not impressed. I found a great bar on Lincoln Ave. by Roscoe called The Green Lady. It has a comparable beer selection and everyone is super nice in there.
