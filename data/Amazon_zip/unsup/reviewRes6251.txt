I was NERVOUS we would be waiting FOREVER on a Saturday night..so I ran a tight ship all day to ensure we were out the door at 5pm and on our way to Davanti, arriving by 530pm. We would have sat down right away if it weren't for my husband trying to find parking. So when he returned 10 minutes later the wait went from zero to a one hour wait. The patrons just poured in right at 530pm. We luckily found seating at the bar and in reality our wait time only ended up being about 25 minutes. We sat down and enjoyed every single item we ordered. The ricotta with honeycomb, truffle egg toast, grilled romaine salad, and halibut were my most favorite.  My other favorite aspect of this hotspot is drinking delicious wine at wholesale prices! A MUST GO!
