Mmm, Yolk. I want to be your best friend. I want to live right next door to you so that I can go every morning. Sadly, I can not afford to live off of Michigan Ave, so I will have to visit instead for now! The food here is unbelievably good- fresh, well-cooked, amazing baked goods/pastries baked in house, etc. You really get the feeling that you could order anything off the menu and it would be equally delicious! Its pretty popular so I think on weekends there is usually a wait, but trust me, its well worth it!
