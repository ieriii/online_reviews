We went to La Villa because several tv shows and everyone we know said it was great. They were right. I ordered the ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the braciole (because that's what Tony Soprano orders and I still have no idea how to say it). Both dishes were delicious as well as the bread and whatever that other sauce covered bread was. I didn't see the salad bar but from what I picked off the mans plate it had some tasty choices too (he thought it was too small but to be fair he was comparing it to a buffet restaurant). I don't know very much about wine but we finished a carafe of the house red (I forgot what kind it was) and it didn't give me a headache so its probably pretty good. The carafe was pretty big too. We sat in the bar area and it was lively but not too busy. There were regulars at the bar and kids and families everywhere but it was still quiet and nice. The waitress was quick and helpful and funny. The bill wasn't too bad either. I am definitely going back to La Villa soon and often.
