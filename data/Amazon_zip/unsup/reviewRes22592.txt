My first genuine Chicago dog! And you know what? It's better than a Dodger dog. I know what most people in LA are saying--blasphemy. It just tastes better in Chicago. Maybe it's in the water they use. Or the grease that covers the oh so good sesame buns, or the strange colored relish they use. Whatever it is. It's artery clogging good.
