On a cold and rainy Monday I saw my opportunity to my Violet Hour fix for the year. We got inside with no line no wait was awesome. My party actually got a table, which is one of the hardest things to get at Violet Hour. I love this place because of how knowledgeable the severs are about the menu and the different drinks. I tried the Gothic age, the dark and stromy, and the classic. All were amazing and had different characters. I'm a big fan of the decor, the staff, the drinks, and the location. The Violet Hour rocks!
