First, why is this restaurant included in the "German" category? Second, phenomenol tortas! I went for the Friday special, the Top Chef Torta: Braised beef tongue, chorizo, potatoes, avocado & salsa verde. I've never had braised beef tongue before, but my New Year's resolution was to be more adventurous, and to recycle more. Well I gave up on the recycling thing in February, but last month I tried escargot (didn't live up to the hype) in Montreal, and this month, BEEF TONGUE! It was delicious! I don't know how long they braised that crap to get it so tender, but maybe if my grandma had used that cooking technique I would like chicken liver. And what spices were in that meat? I don't know but I know they were nummy. Anyhoo, the BF had the Pepito, which tasted completely different, and was still totally awesome! Can't go wrong with either of these tortas. 4 stars because the limonada was way too sweet and the guac was not the best I've ever had but was certainly the most expensive. Now that I'm on Yelp reading the reviews I'm thinking I need to return to try the churros. Maybe tonight. We'll see.
