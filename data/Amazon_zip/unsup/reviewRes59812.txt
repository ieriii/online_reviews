I love everything about Art. My favorite thing is their cheap daily specials. Where else can you get a lasagna, baked mostaccioli, or manicotti dinner with entree, salad, soup, and bread for less than $6? There pizza is really good, too. I love stuffed pizza and they do it well. This is my go to place for out of town guests wanting Chicago-style pizza and they are always impressed.
