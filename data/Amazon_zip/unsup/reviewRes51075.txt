Wonderful dinner experience. Tasteful, soothing ambiance.  Affordably priced. Exceptional service. Our waitress, Laura was very attentive and made perfect recommendations for wine and dessert.  Food was amazing. Incredibly flavorful heirloom tomato appetizer. I'm trying to watch calories, so ordered one of the fish specials for the evening - walleye - which was cooked to perfection (I believe the waitress said "bronzed" (almost blackened)) with just the right amount of cajun seasoning and wonderful side servings of roasted potatos and succotash (which I hated as a kid, never ever ordered again until today and found I loved it - here at least). Absolutely delicious - and healthy - the perfect combo for me right now. My husband ordered the gumbo ya-ya which came with sides of saffron and a spicy sauce so it can be tailored exactly to your taste and consistency. Ya-ya! Heavenly peach tart with homemade blueberry ice cream and whipped cream. (which of course I only had a taste of ;) ) There was no one at the host stand when we left, but as we stepped out the door, the host came running out onto the sidewalk to thank us for coming.  Could not have asked for a more welcoming atmosphere and satisfying dining experience! Well - maybe just one thing. We recently returned from Charleston, SC and had a fabulously decadent dinner of shrimp and grits. Hope to see that on Big Jones' menu some time!!
