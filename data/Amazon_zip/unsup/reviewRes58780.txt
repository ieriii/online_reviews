This place was great! I only wish I knew about it sooner seeing how I just moved to Dallas. I went here for my going away dinner with some friends from work. My initial concern was that it was basically next to the brown line western stop in Lincoln Square. Well...to my delight there was no interruptions from Western nor the train. The food was very good and the service was fast. I had tofu pad thai and the rangoon both were great. For me it's alwasy been hard to find a good thai place but I finally did!
