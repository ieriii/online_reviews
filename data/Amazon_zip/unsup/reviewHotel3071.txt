Great hotel - can't complain about a thing. The lobby kind of felt like a night club. I was a bit confused because I went to check in and wasn't sure really where to go until I got ushered down by the desk staff (the front desk looked more like a bar to me). I felt darn underdressed but was still treated very well. The rooms are very modern. Lots of focus on details. I probably didn't appreciate half of it but it's dang stylish and has a serious euro feel to it. All fixtures and furniture was top notch. High quality leather seats and that square thing you put your feet on, nice desk, lamps, art, etc... There was also a pretty big happy hour crowd in the lobby for all of you who are into that. I was waiting for a friend to pick me up around 6ish and the bar near the lobby was packed.
