The food was absolutely amazing. I had the pulled pork sliders and the sweet potato cakes, which were my personal favorite. The atmosphere is fantastic and there is a wonderful upstairs area where people can hang out together at various sized tables. They have a stage upstairs as well for performances, and that is always fun.
