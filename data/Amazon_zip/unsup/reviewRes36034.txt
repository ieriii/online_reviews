This place had decent atmosphere for a N. Side Chinese place. They put some effort into the decor. The barbecue was good, and the menu had a huge long list of noodle and dumpling soups to choose from. It hit the spot on a day when the high was 15 degrees. That's why I don't live in Chicago anymore, but when I come back, I'll drop by Sun Wah again.
