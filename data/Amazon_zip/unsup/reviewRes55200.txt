Great place. The chicken is great, and the cheapest somewhat healthy fast food meal in the area. 1/4 chicken, 2 sides, pita and drink for $6 (with tax). Unbielievable. I will say that the quality is somewhat inconsistent when their are busy, but that is the case at a lot of places.There pizza is AWESOME. The staff is very nice.Go here, support the great family run buisiness
