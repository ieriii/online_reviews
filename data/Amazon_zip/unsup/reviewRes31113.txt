The food at Mastro's Steakhouse way amazing! I had the bone-in filet which may have just been the very best steak I have ever had. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes were incredible with huge pieces of actual lobster and I was very pleased with the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi. I tried the Signature Warm Butter Cake for dessert which was also very good. I would highly recommend this place to all steak lovers!
