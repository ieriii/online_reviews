I have been going to Frontera Grill for ages - I think my first visit was in 1991. I have gone at least twice a year since then. I have consistently loved my meals - until my visit on June 11th. I know the drill - get there by at least 4:30pm for the 5pm restaurant opening. We did this. We were the 12th party in line. When the maitre d got to us (with his little clip board), I told him a party of 4. He informed us that the only seats were outside. This was a very muggy 89 degree day - so I asked when an inside seat would be available. He said 2.5 hours later. I grudgingly agreed to sit outside. After we sat down, a each member of my party went to see if indeed all tables were taken. They were not. And people who were not in front of us got seats. If they have a true no reservation dinner policy, that is what it should be. To add insult, the maitre d was very rude (I asked why there were seats inside that were open, he gave the same smart #@@ed toned response regarding 2.5 hours to get a seat inside), and the waiter was even worse. I asked him if they did anything special for birthdays (not singing, but a candle in a dessert) and he gave a very abrupt no. My meal was fine, but tainted by the terrible service, the meal was not one I want to repeat.
