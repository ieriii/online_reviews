Am I the oddball on this one?! There was no pizzazz at this Brazzaz.  I came here last night with the two-for-one coupon and was glad that at least I had the coupon. The salad bar was nice, but nothing too special. The cheesy bread and fried bananas were very delicious, but you don't want to eat too much or you'll get full before the meat arrives. Then, it's on to the meat which didn't impress me too much. The only pieces of meat that I did like included the chicken and a roast type meat which was extrememly tender. All the other meats did not live up to the hype. On a positive note - the server was awesome as well as one of the gauchos. The grilled pineapple was my favorite thing there! And, at the end of the meal, we received a $25 gift card... My part of the bill alone was $72 with the coupon. We tipped off of the original price of the meal without the coupon and I ordered two glasses of wine (which said $8, but was charged $10...oh well...) Not worth the price and prob won't go back unless it's free, but glad I tried it. I definitely did not get my money's worth :(
