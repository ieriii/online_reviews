I expected more based on all of the reviews I have seen. I could have simply had a perfect storm of issues, but the plate I had was a pasta mixed with shellfish which all around felt rubbery. We were seated near the bar which contributed to all sorts of traffic moving in and out; and this was a weeknight. Most other reviewers were correct in that this place is very busy. Ask to be seated farther back in the restaurant not near the bar. The server was very nice and accommodating. I almost felt she empathized with our location and the acrobatics that took place around us. For the price, it didn't seem worth it. I would be willing to give it another go though as it was my first visit.
