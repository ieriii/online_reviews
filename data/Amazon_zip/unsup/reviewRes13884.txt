I was in the mood for some Cuban Coffee and got oh so much more :) these guys rock the Cuban Sammich and Coffee, we were in the city and I was like hey lets find some Cuban Coffee, it is a shot of crack if made right and these guys make it right but once we walked in the door and got a whiff of the food we had to eat also, The Ropa Vieja Sammich is the Bomb man I could eat these all week long, along with some yummy fried Plantains, man my mouth is watering think about that good meal we had, I see a trip into the city soon for some Cuban goodness  Good food Good Service oh yeah we will be back
