I'm not sure what to give, this used to be my favorite place to go when I lived the neighboring state. And I'd still visit now and then because of the authentic Sichuan spicy taste. But maybe 'Chef. Tony' has gotten too famous and the dishes has become bigger or the food is less. There's always a line outside, thanks to 'Chef Tony' and like many restaurants in China Town, the wait staffs are over worked so not much service if you look and speaks Chinese. Unless the rest of your party isn't or maybe you know one of the owners. You've probably read about why people like this place. So I'll just tell you why I stop going there, just two reasons. First off since my parent live in Indiana, they would always order something to go after having dinner there. And we've noticed a few times that they had made mistake on our bills. Then they'd forgot something on our to-go orders since the to-go comes after the left overs there are too many boxes to count, silly us to believe. And one time when I take my friend out, I found hairs, jet black short hairs there. I asked the waiter and he joked about it with the other staff there. So I asked for refund and they insist on a free 'replacement' but still pay for half of it. Did I mentioned that I had originally ordered it to go but they made a mistake and it's on a bowl, which I thank them for letting me see my food before I take home. I didn't end up in a hospital or anything but that was the last time I went. I paid the bill and left them my 'replacement' meal as tips because I know how 'good' the 'replacement taste.
