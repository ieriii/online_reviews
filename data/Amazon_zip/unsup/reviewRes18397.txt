I am digging the Bad Apple! I came here for lunch this weekend and I was pleasantly surprised. I love the feeling of this place. Walls painted gray with huge trees painted on with an apple here and there. Clever. Bright red accent walls warm up the gray walls. Big red orbs that resemble bad apples perhaps? I had the turkey tom.. to was LOADED with turkey, bacon, Swiss, pesto and of course tomatoes. I could only eat half, it was way huge. You could easily split this with someone. Their hand cut fries are amazing. The husband had a spicy burger with pickled hot peppers. He really liked it but he wished it was on a pretzel bun. Great beer selection! They have one of my favorite beers on tap, Lindemans Framboise. You do not see that too often so I was happy! My husband tried the Goose Island Sophie beer and it was $16! Granted it was huge and I had to help him finish it. Great service and very friendly wait staff. I will be back!
