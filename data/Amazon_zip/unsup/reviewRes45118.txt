My husband and I were very excited to visit anteprima because of the reviews we had read and we love authentic Italian food. We even took another couple with us, the guy being from Italy with a strong background in Italian cuisine. Our whole experience started out badly when we showed up for our 9:00 reservation only to be told that the wait would be 45 minutes for their patio. When I initially made our reservation, the person I spoke with said that being seated on the patio at 9:00 would not be a problem. However, the host standing in front of me said that they never reserve tables on their patio, it's first come first serve (there are only 10 tables on their back patio). While I was questioning why I was told differently, the owner showed up and instead of apologizing for the mistake, said, "I'm the owner, I think I would know..." Really? No apologies, no thank you's for even coming? He even said, "this is our policy." Business 101 tells you that that is NOT a phrase to be used with an upset client. Moving on to the food however, we started with the sweet corn and basil bruchetta and it was phenomenal. A bit salty, but very very tasty. We then had the ricotta stuffed figs with carpaccio. Equally as good. Great start to our meal. For my main course, I had the sweet corn and crab risotto. I was expecting it to melt in my mouth, but everything tasted quite separate and I never felt like it all went together. My husband had the Orichette and liked it ok, but again, he was a bit disapointed with the flavor profiles. This was an okay place, but definitely not in our top ten favorite Italian places in the city. I'll wait until the customer service improves...which means I have to wait until they change management.
