I am Neline S.'s friend who said "this is the best pizza in town."  Giordano's has good deep dish pizza. As does Chicago's. But Art of Pizza takes the cake (literally). Each bite melts in your mouth, and boom! An entire pizza is gone! And the pizza is relatively cheap compared to what I'm used to. What's nice about this place is that you can order individual slices.  Mhmmmmm, lots of butter in the crust. I'm going to miss this place when I move to Delaware.
