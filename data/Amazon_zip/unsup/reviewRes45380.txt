Walked all the way from the Tapas place to here, don't ask me why, it wasn't my idea. haha This place is very nice, the decor is great and they have Santa and some reindeers out in front for Xmas! I love Xmas (in case you didn't know) and the inside has christmas lights and wreaths hung everywhere. This is my kind of place in December.  Our bartender was hilarious, apparently he was a fact finder for VH1 (pop up video segments) and knew all kinds of strange information from the Golden Girls and Designing Women. We were quizzing him and he won, he definately knew his stuff. His sweater was strange though.... one thing I wont do is wear a Xmas sweater with Santa Claus and reindeer and confetti... I may love Xmas but I have my limits! I would come here again.
