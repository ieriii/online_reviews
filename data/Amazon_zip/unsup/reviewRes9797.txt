The BF took me here for dinner and it was a dining experience! The different food combinations were amazing and it was fun to look foward to what would be brought out next. I was lucky enough to be there for their one year aniversary so it was ten courses - yummy! It was cool to see Dale walking around and he even brought a few dishes out to us. Our waitress was super nice and the rest of the staff was very friendly, not at all snooty like at other restaurants. My only complaint is we were seated in this small back room which is nothing like the rest of the restaurant which is dim and romantic yet lively.
