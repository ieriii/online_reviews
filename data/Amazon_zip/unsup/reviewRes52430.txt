Every time I come here I can barely walk, let alone breathe when I leave. I eat so much that it's disgusting. The whole circle disc thing to let the people know if you want more is ingenious. This might sound stupid but the thing I love the most is their fried bananas. The meat is delicious but the their fried bananas are the best around.
