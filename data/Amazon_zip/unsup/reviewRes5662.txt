The service was absolutely great. Our waiter, was so informative and such a delight when it came to asking for recommendations. The sommelier was truly passionate about the wine and the food and made such a perfect pairing for the foods we had chosen. The location is a tad on the smaller side, and a wait may be in store, but believe me, it's worth it. Totally recommend the deviled egg, and the clam and shrimp dish, and the salami panini i had was absolutely a splittable size, especially after eating a couple of small plates .
