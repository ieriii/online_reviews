Went for late dinner. Ordered: -Milk braised pork shoulder -Pork liver pate -Prosciutto di parma -Salted beets -Fried pig's ear w/ krispy kale -Goat cheese with beets Food was not bad. Would love to go here for cocktails and people watching. Place gets really packed. Don't freak out if they seat you with strangers.
