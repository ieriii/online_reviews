Loved it. I hadn't really researched the band before I went last night, and was expecting something more 'traditional', which "Fareed Haque and Mathgames" certainly weren't. If George Clinton and Benot Mandelbrot had babies, this is what they'd sound like. Insane. It was very crowded around 9pm, but I was able to grab a stool at the bar. Next time, I'll get there earlier and try to get a table near the stage. The bartender was great. Cover was $12 last night (Saturday). Once you're in, it's cash or Amex only, but there's an ATM inside.
