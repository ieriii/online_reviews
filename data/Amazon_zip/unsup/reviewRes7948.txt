I love good pizza. I have an appreciation for the different styles and what each one is trying to accomplish. But of all the styles, I have the greatest appreciation for Neapolitan pizza. And this place nails it. Not only do they really "get it" when it comes to their pizza but everything else we tried was great. They choice of wines was great. The ambiance was great. The fact that they had inside and outside seating was great. The staff was great. The only minor negative is that I wish they would cut the pizza instead of leaving it whole and giving the table a pizza cutter. Now in all fairness, I was just in Chicago for 4 days and only tried 3 places. I didnt try other places as suggested by, for example, http://slice.seriouseats . But even if someone in the city makes a better pizza, everyone should try this place. We got three appetizers. The Fried zucchini with mint was excellent. The Burata was very fresh however for just two of us, it was overkill. Better to split between 4-6 in my opinion. White anchovies salad very nice. We got a margherita. The mozzarella was very high quality and the right amount. The sauce was a basic tomato puree which was appropriate for the style. The crust was perfect chared top and bottom. My only complaint was the sparsity of basil leaves.
