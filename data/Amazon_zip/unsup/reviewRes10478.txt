Joy, oh joy!  Ok, I have been here no less than 12 times since Piccolo Sogno opened and have been thrilled each time. I bring clients here for lunch or dinner, friends for dinner on a regular basis. The staff is bright, engaging and well versed in the food and wine. How can they offer good wines starting at $4.00 per glass? It boggles the mind. The dishes are beautifully turned out and authentic without being dated. Creative without compromising the true taste of the ingredients. Too many restaurants try to go over the top and create dishes which fall flat due to mismatched ingredients. Not Piccolo Sogno. Pastas are perfectly al dente, fish cooked just enough, salads fresh, crisp and gorgeous. Pizzas are probably the best in the city with a paper thin crackery crust. The wine list, all Italian, has been masterfully selected and covers all regions of Italy as well as all price ranges. And, if that were not enough, I can honestly say that this is the best cappuccino I have ever had. In countless trips to Italy and France, I have never had a cappuccino so lovingly prepared. The foam is almost the consistency of whipped cream! My only complaint? Dessert is not great. Selections don't change often enough and can be a bit dull. Maybe it is me?  On the whole, I will continue to be a loyal customer as long as they will have me. It is like dining in Italy without the seven hour flight!
