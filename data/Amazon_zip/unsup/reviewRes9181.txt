Overrated. There's no doubt that this restaurant is beautiful, and if I were in the area again I would go back for cocktails and perhaps appetizers. But the food left me wanting more. High prices and small portions for regular Vietnamese food? One would expect some kind of Vietnamese-French fusion, but that's not the case here. And I'm not Vietnamese, but do you really want to be reminded of colonial rule? History, shmistory. Anyway, back to the food. I had a bowl of pho and it was seriously the smallest bowl of pho I've ever had. The soup was fine, but I've definitely had better (yeah, nothing beats homemade). So why the 2 stars? Go here on a date, look pretty, have a few cocktails. Yep, that's about it.
