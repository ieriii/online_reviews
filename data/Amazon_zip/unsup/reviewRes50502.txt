I had dinner here last night and I usually only visit this place for breakfast. The turkey dinner was fair and nothing to write home about but the sides were great and the service was top notch as always. This place is definitely outstanding for breakfast and a go to place on a regular basis and thus I settle on the four stars which is the blend between 3 for dinner and 5 for breakfast.
