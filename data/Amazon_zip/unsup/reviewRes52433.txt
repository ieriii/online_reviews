Amazing food, unbelievable service. 15 different cuts of meat. I LOVE lamb both the lamb chops and the leg of lamb, better than my mom's lamb LOOOL...LOVE the way it is cooked. The steaks and other meats are OUTSTANDING!!! Huge salad bar, with many choices, fresh Sushi and mannny other dishes. Very trendy. Very cool music. Good prices. The drinks and wine are really...REALLY good!!! The owners and managers came and checked on us multiple times to ensure that our food and service was up to our expectations (it actually exceeded our expectations). The servers MADE sure that we got every meat and the way we like it cooked. We delicious deserts. It is BY FAR, the best Brazilian steak house in town...I have tried them all. Needless to say, I highly recommend it!
