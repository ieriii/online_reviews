I took my S.O. here for his birthday on a Thursday night. I heard how pricey it is so I was a bit nervous, although it turned out to be more reasonable than predicted. We arrived at 7:15 pm and was seated at a great table for two near the window. The waiter came and took our drink orders and then let us loose to feast! He gave us each a round plastic chip to notify the meat waiters whether or not we were ready for more food. The black side indicated, "Go away" and the orange side meant, "GIVE ME MEAT!". Before we even tried any meat though, we went to the "salad" bar, which was 75% anything but salad. This great salad bar had items like mushroom risotto, oysters, salmon, sushi, ceviche and, of course, salad. When we finally got around to eating the meat, we tried about 4-5 different items, from steak, chicken, sausage and shrimp. The other thing I like is the mix of fruit with the meat. The plantains and pineapple, surprisingly, complimented the meat well. While I heard they have great desserts here, we went home for birthday cake instead. While it may not be my favorite restaurant experience, my S.O. said it was the best birthday dinner he ever had.
