I am an ardent Ras Dashen fan (I eat Ethiopian at least once per week), so I was hesitant to try a new restaurant. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! Rather than rehash what many other reviewers have said, I will just mention that this is a great restaurant for vegetarian dishes. Their red lentil and yellow split pea dishes are much better than any other Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago. But if you are a meat eater, I would say that the beef and chicken dishes at Ras Dashen are by far the best in Chicago.
