Jenga, what? Jenga, who? Thanks to Bad Apple, my friends and I played one impressive game of Jenga....probably the best ever. Sadly, I knocked the creation over....oops (it was bound to happen, let's be honest). Also, my friend and I were introduced to shuffleboard and, I must admit, it is pretttttttty addictive. I'm glad Bad Apple stocks up on random games as it makes a typical night out at the bars that much more fun! Our waitress was pretty surly, IMO, so I went up to the bar to get my drinks. Too bad the waitress basically lambasted me for doing that, but...who can blame me? The bartenders were WAAAY more friendly. I mean, when I asked one of them what type of whiskey he had, he rattled off a list of about 20 (with their corresponding prices)....all with a smile on his face. Plus, when they found out it was my friend's birthday, they hooked up the Jame-o shouts (*ahem* my friend got a MEGA shot) and didn't mind taking a group picture for us.  Drinks were pretty cheap (6.50 for a whiskey on the rocks and 6 for a razz and tonic!). It was pretty quiet on a Saturday night, but I didn't mind it that much. There's tons of tables and booths to lounge out at. Oh, and I definitely was grateful there was a jukebox there because I couldn't take the light-rockness that was going on. (Chris Brown's 'Look At Me Now', anyone?) The birthday celebrant also kept repeating that he was "noventa y nueve", to which one of the employees told him that he looked good for being 99. Ahhhhh, good times.
