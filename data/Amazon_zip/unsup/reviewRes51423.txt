They don't season their meat. I don't care if they give you two pounds of it on a combination plate, but it wouldn't hurt to add a little cumin or cilantro so that the beef doesn't taste like dog food. There weren't even any onions cooked in with the dishes. People who don't know how to cook make better Mexican food than Garcia's. I don't know what the problems is. Is the chef or owner too afraid of offending the neighborhood with just a little garlic? Is food even a consideration at a location that soaks up business despite the food? I don't know, but I'm an adult now and I'm not impressed by a lopsided price/portion ratio when the food tastes as bland as it did.
