I love pho. I was obsessed with getting to Uptown for some pho last weekend and found (through yelp of course) Tank Noodle. Ooooh the chicken pho was sooo delicious and huge! The boy had the super sized beef pho with every part of the cow in it... they even have cow penis pho... he didn't want that one though! Anyway it was super good. I understand why Tank has such great ratings. The shrimp vietnamese spring rolls were fresh and were made quickly. They also have delicious tapioca pearl smoothies! I was so full that I almost puked, and we didn't even finish our pho! I am definitely coming back. It was worth the trip!
