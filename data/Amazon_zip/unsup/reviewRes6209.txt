My husband and I went here last night and had a delightful meal. We started with the mussels, they were deleciously seasoned, they are the bigger type mussels so if you prefer small mussels, like my husband does, then you should prolly pass on these. Then I had the macademian crusted halibat, sooo delecious. The piece of fish was gigantic and light and the cust was perfect. We also tried both the red mashed potatoes and the au gratin potatoes and they were both fantastic.  Lastly we had the hot cookie with ice cream and hot fudge, outstanding. All in all a great meal and much more affordable then Joes which we were thinking of going to instead.
