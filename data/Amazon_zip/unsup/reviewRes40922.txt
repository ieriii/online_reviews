i believe this is the sit-down store on the west side of ashland. i had to go to this store last night instead of the one at 1140 n ashland because one of the people i was dining with wanted something other than a meat taco (1140 only serves meat tacos). the wait service here is not that great. while the steak tasted about the same high-quality as next door, by the time it got to my table the meat was barely warm! important: horchata here is superior to 1140.
