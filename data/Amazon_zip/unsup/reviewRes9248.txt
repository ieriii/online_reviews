Dinner at Le Colonial was delicious. I had had French Vietnamese cuisine once before and loved it, and this was just as great. We started with the crispy Spring rolls, which were fantastic. I had the Seafood Boulliabaise, which had about every type of shellfish imaginable in an amazing saffron broth. It came with rice noodles which you stir into the sauce to soak up even more broth. My boyfriend ordered the filet and shrimp, which was also magnificent. The filet, rather than being a tall, single piece of meat, was cut in half anf barely cooked on both sides, with a deliciously rare, melt-in-your-mouth center. The shrimp were huge, and the tomato rice was interestingly, but not cloyingly, sweet. The service was excellent without being overly formal or cold. The waiter guided me to a very nice glass of wine without making me feel like a wine-challenged idiot (which I am). We sat on the patio, which gave us absolutely superb people-watching opportunities. Lots of 60-year-old men in Ferraris with their 25-year-old model girlfriends. Great date place, or place to take friends who are in town visiting.
