This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, the food is always fresh and the best thing of all: IT HAS A DRIVE-THRU!!! There's a lot of Mexican restaurants that are good but for some reason it's very hard to find some with drive-thru's. It's great if your a fast paced person who enjoys good and fresh Mexican food.
