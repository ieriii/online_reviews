Went Saturday for lunch....busy but not too crowded and service didn't suffer at all. I had the vegan reuben sandwich that has gotten lots of press - it was great, and the fries that came with it were some of the best ever. We also has a variety of the bruschetta - they were all good but the cauliflower and white beans, etc. was fantastic. I would definitely get an entire order of that. My companion had the chicken sandwich with a nice looking side salad, which was delicious as well. Huge portions - we both took home half of our meal. Our server was friendly and prompt - all in all a great experience and we'll be back
