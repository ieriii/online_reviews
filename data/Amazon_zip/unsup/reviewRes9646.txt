It's a great restaurant. It's almost a shame to give it 4 stars. But I'm just very picky. I went to Sprout to meet with someone and discuss some business opportunities for the following year. Naturally, the refined feel of sprout would seem to be a great place to have such a dinner. Yes, but with a few caveats. The food is, as you can expect, very high quality. All the meats are perfectly cooked, all the vegetables sauted to perfection. And there are other strange things... to start out with I had the foie gras with a sort of cashew-beet element to it. A pretty solid start, but definitely a strange combination I still don't think I'm entirely keen on. Plus it was whipped... which is just weird. The pork with quince and shallots was, by comparison, underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it was incredible, but by no means the best I've ever had. Quince is a great pairing for the pork, and certainly innovative. That alone should give this dish a higher "rating" . Still, perhaps it was the fact that the food was quite undersalted. Expect great things from Sprout. If it was in New York, I'd rate it as average for its type of food. But here I'm willing to give it 4, if not 4.5 stars. Definitely try it out and see what you think.
