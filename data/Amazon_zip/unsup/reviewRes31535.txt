I've wanted to visit Sunda since its doors opened. This is one of the first upscale Chicago restaurants to feature Filipino cuisine. There are many wonderful family-owned Filipino restaurants, but none fusion-ed with such upscale styling. My expectations were not let down! Everyone in my party left completely satisfied and wanting to come back. Great Chicago restaurant for those who want to try something new and non-chain.  My best advice is (if at all possible), to make reservations for happy hour, Sunda Social. Weekdays from 5-7pm, a separate, smaller menu is available with sushi rolls and appetizers for Half Price! A number of their best and most popular appetizers are included. We decided to share some so we could have a taste of everything.  - Everyone should try the Rock Shrimp (tempura-ed, cooked and glazed to perfection).  - More adventurous types will love the Roasted Duck Bao Buns. They coat the duck with that delicious plum sauce.  - Though I'll agree the sushi isn't the best Chicago has to offer, the rolls merge creative ingredients, are presented beautifully and still taste great. The Golden Child with Mango is a great summer sushi roll. Deserving of mention is the Number Ten sushi roll for those who like Shrimp Tempura.  The restaurant ambiance reminded us of luxury hotels in the Philippines, Asian Contemporary. Sunda has a nice open layout so you can see the bar and sushi bar from practically any table. We saw all types of people, mostly after work business types, but our 5 person party of casual 20-somethings didn't stick out. There were a few families with smaller children there, also. With our discounted appetizers we spent the money on drinks, perfect for martini and wine lovers. I had the lychee martini to complement the Asian dishes.  A must visit for foodies, out of towners who like Asian fusion, downtown Happy Hour folks and Girls Nights Out.
