Certainly a carnivore's dream! the pork belly here is about as good as it gets. Other notables include the potee, mussels, and roasted chicken. The beer list is quite impressive....the servers are quite knowledgeable about what the beers are like so its easy to make a good decision. I would only caution that the servers seem to always direct you toward the $30/bottle beers...
