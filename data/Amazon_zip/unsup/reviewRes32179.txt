The food was fresh, inventive and delicious. the drinks were unique! Space is cool and interesting. I had a great experience planning a celebration at Sunda. They worked with me in finding the perfect spot for my group, were flexible, and attentive. The night of the event went smoothly and our service was excellent. Highly recommend for any special event!
