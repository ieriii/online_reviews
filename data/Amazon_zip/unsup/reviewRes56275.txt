Simply a great place to enjoy Vietnamese food! Everything is fresh and made to order. They have dinner specials that are reasonably priced, tasty and filling. Fresh fruit is provided for dessert which is about all I have room for after sampling their appetizers, soups and entrees. There's always some food left over. Highlights are the lemon grass beef wraps, beef with asparagus, beef pho, and lemon grass pork chops. Worth the trip if you don't live in the neighborhood.
