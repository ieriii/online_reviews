Best Thai in Chicago!They deliver on quality every single time. I have never had a bad experience here and every time I bring a new person, they rant and rave how wonderful it is too. Friends from out of town always tell me how they crave it and wish they had it near them.The decor is fun, though it can get a bit loud in there when its busy. The wait staff could be a bit more friendly but the service is quick and your never left waiting too long. The only "negative" thing I have to say is that I wish the portions were larger cause I always want more. Its that good!
