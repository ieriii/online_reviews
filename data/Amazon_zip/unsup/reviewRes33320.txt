Meh :T heard much hype 'bout Yolk and I was sadly disappointed. Realistically 2 1/2 stars. A huge group of my friends & I finished running the Hot Chocolate 15K in downtown Chicago & worked up a wicked appetite. Debated whether to head back to burbs or stay in city. We finally decided to stick it out in the city & head to Yolk. Of course... it was JAM packed. It didn't help that all the runners congregated to the same location as us. Average wait time: 1hr-1 1/2 hrs. Wooey. So we waited outside...waited some more inside, finally got seated in the back section. I ordered coffee right away, and believe me when I say this.. I'm no coffee snob, but god dayum..it was nasty. Instant coffee nasty. Down right watery and not fresh. Thought my next cup or third cup would be better, but it was just funky. For the main entree, I stuck to what my body needed. Hearty portion of carbs, protein, and more protein.  The WORKS omelette: bacon, sausage, ham, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes. Topped with Jack and Cheddar cheeses.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. Service was great despite the madness of the joint. She was attentive and made sure we got everything that we needed. Since there's an abundant amt of breakfast joints in the city, I don't think I'll be missing out if I don't go back to Yolk.
