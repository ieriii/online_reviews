Sapori is simply one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago. The interior atmosphere is excellent, although if you're planning to hang out in the bar for a while before your table is ready, there isn't a bar seating area. In the summer go for the outdoor seating, and remember the restaurant is much larger than the front makes it appear, with a large back room. The service has always been attentive, with good recommendations without being overbearing. Recommendations: Lobster Ravioli, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Shrimp and Broccoli pasta. After several visits, we have yet to come across an appetizer, dish or dessert to avoid. Chef Anthony consistently delivers.
