I love Mexican food, and although you can hardly find true Mexican in the U.S. (like Oaxacan quesillo or arrechera), Garcia's comes very close. This place is very nice, and shall I say the burritos are the size of your head? Yes, there is a lot of good going on in this establishment...great margaritas, very friendly staff, chips and salsa refills, delicious food, and great location. I haven't been a huge fan of the change inside since they've remodeled...they opened up space, but it's less the friendly environment, more classy. But still, if you Love Mexican, you def. need to try Garcia's.
