I stayed here in March on my first visit to Chicago, and it was fantastic. It is definitely my favorite hotel I have ever the stayed at. The staff were very polite and kind, the amenities and room features were amazing, and I could not have asked for a better experience. I loved the urban, exotic, foreign feel to the place and it was terrific. I loved the decor, it was so unique! When I was staying there, a group of architects were on a tour, so I picked up a few fun facts from them. The bricks in the lobby are from old Chicago streets! and the fireplace in the lobby is the longest fireplace in the United States. The gold decor on the one wall is handmade by a world renowned artist. It's a really neat place to stay and I really enjoyed it! The downside: it's next to a fire station. You might wake up to a siren ever now and then, but the location is really great as well. We were touring Loyola University Chicago and had nowhere to put our luggage during the tour after we checked out, so the staff were very kind and stored it for us until we were finished with our visit. Overall, I had a great experience and really enjoyed it there! It is worth the extra bucks if you're only there for a night or two. :)
