Food was obviously good. I wouldn't expect anything different from Bayless, but for the prices you could probably sit down at Frontera Grill next door for the same prices. I had the short rib torta and it was okay. Kind of like a Mexican style Italian beef if that makes any sense. Also had the chips and guacamole as well as the chocolate flan cake. I think the dessert was the best part. All in all it was a nice experience. The downsides were expect to wait about 20 minutes to order due to long lines and expect to spend around $20 or more for lunch.
