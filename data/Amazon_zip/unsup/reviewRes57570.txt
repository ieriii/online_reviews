Quite possibly the most disappointing dinner experience ever. Understanding that this may have been because I went in with such high expectations I'm still giving it 2 stars. This is supposed to be the most romantic spot in Chicago. What's romantic about sitting less than three inches from the table next to you? Yes, its dimly lit and has nice decor...but my fiance and I seriously sat there and listened to the conversations of the people next to us because we couldn't talk to each other!Where are the choices? There is one cheese, one salad, one cooking style and one chocolate. WHAT? The cheese tasted like alfredo sauce gone wrong, the salad was drenched in dressing, the oil had no flavor (it was literally just oil in a pot and my piece of chicken came out looking like a chicken nugget) and the chocolate was runny. There is no presentation. Just a pot on a sterno.Service...was good. Not great, but good. He was very nice and didn't get anything wrong (although the only thing we actually ordered was wine and type of meat). The hostess was also very polite.My fiance and I have had fondue a number of times before this and it was by far our worst fondue experience. If you're in the mood for fondue, hit up The Melting Pot or pick up a fondue cook book and do it yourself. Both are better options.
