I like the Violet Hour a lot. Yes the drinks are pricey, but for a special night I really do appreciate the care they take in only allowing as many people into the bar as there are seats. The subtle violet and white walls, high ceilings, and thick draped curtains keep the noise level to a dull roar. The lighting is perfectly seductive. Then there's the drinks. I consider myself one of the best cocktailers I know, and I regularly feel like Andy Kaufmann attempting to wrestle Hulk Hogan at this joint. Not only do they have 100 bottles of booze I've never heard of, this group of fantastic mixologists know how to use them. Last night my libation of choice was the Roust About - 107 proof barrel-aged whiskey, with Calvados, vermouth, and black walnut liquer. Along with my best gal and the Stereolab album bubbling in the background, this heary warming drink made for a wonderful night.
