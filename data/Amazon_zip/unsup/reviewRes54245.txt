Irazu is THE BEST little restaurant you can only find in a big city 'hood. The steak w/ Costa Rican rice, cabbage salad and plantains is absolutely amazing and something I DREAM about. Order it spicy for a grilled jalapeno on the side. The service is lovely and the atmosphere is amazing - especially in the summer w/ the expansive porch open. It's BYOB so head to Red & White for a gorgeous bottle of wine or a couple of single beers.
