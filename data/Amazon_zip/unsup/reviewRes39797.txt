Seriously, after hearing nothing but good things about this place, and finding a card in our A La Card deck... the darling ELM and I ventured into Longman and Eagle for brunch. As we were on somewhat of a time crunch, I was a little annoyed at the wait, but I get it, we were there at noon on a Saturday. One gripe, though, the hostess could have been a touch more attentive... as in at least addressed the fact that we were standing in front of her. A simple "Just a sec" or a "I'll be with you in a moment" really would have been sufficient. I understand you're busy, and I understand that everyone cannot be a f'ing ray of sunshine. But hot damn, if you're in the service industry, at least try to show rudimentary manners. I'm really not exaggerating, this girl made it seem like I was inconveniencing her by asking for a table. So while we wait we observe the room. Awesome space! It's minimal and cool without trying too hard (cough... Big Star... cough cough). I like that you can see into the kitchen. I also liked how the ceiling was sort of psuedofinished? It wasn't exposed, but was covered in loose boards. Very different. So grumpy finally seats us at probably the coldest table in the room (RIGHT next to the door... poor planning, folks, Chicago winters are COLD). Truthfully, I'm already penning a scathing review in my head "Ahhh! RUDE PEOPLE! Ahhh! It's so cold!! AHHHH Growl!" But we order, and food follows shortly, and it's delicious. I had the Peekytoe Crab Benedict which was peekytoe crabmeat with a ridiculous Hollandaise, alongside a ridiculously cool one hour egg, all atop a perfectly toasted English muffin (in my mind, there is NOTHING that can ruin breakfast quicker than an untoasted English muffin). Yes, i just used a whole bunch of adverbs and adjectives to describe brunch. And what? The badassness of the food made me forget I was cold and grumpy. So, overall, 4 stars, would have been five if Madam Boots with the Fur wasn't a sulky grump.
