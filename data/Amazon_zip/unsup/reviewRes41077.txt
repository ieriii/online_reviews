This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. It was thanks to the excellent service we received from our server, Justin Burd, and a well prepared menu. We actually wound up at Ruth's Chris because we happened to sit next to Justin at a Cub's game and struck up a conversation. When he mentioned he worked at Ruth's Chris, we knew that we wanted to visit while in town. It has been years since I've been to a Ruth's Chris and my boyfriend had never been. They have a creme brulee that is still the best I've ever had. The menu was so delicious. The lamb chops were some of the best I've had and the asparagus was surprisingly delicious. I could have just ordered a plate of it. Yum yum! Anyway, overall, I would come to Ruth's Chris again for the delicious food, but mostly for the great service. Justin is one of those servers that treats you so well that you come back and ask to sit in their section :)
