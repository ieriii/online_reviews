OPPA!!!! We were visiting Chicago and decided to try Greek Islands after seeing them profiled on a Rachael Ray $40 a day episode. What a wonderful gem!!! The family atmosphere was wonderful and the food, OH MY GOD, THE FOOD!!!! In our five days in Chicago, we ate there three times. A must for you to try are the following: 1. The "Flaming Saganaki Cheese" which is a large chunk of Greek cheese lit on fire and put out under a stream of lemon juice. 2. Skordalia, a great spreadable mix of potatoe, garlic and olive oil 3. Dolmades, Dolmades, Dolmades!!!!! need I say more 4. Avgolemono, a chicken and lemon/rice soup.....delicious!! You can easily make a full dinner just off the appetizer menu (which we did) You will not be disappointed!!!
