Let me start off by saying I'll happily go back and try another torta here. The ingredients are quality the atmosphere is decent. I like what Bayless is trying to do. And I liked most of my meal at Frontera... But here's the deal. If I'm going to have "upscale" Mexican... and a $10 torta is somewhat upscale... I want it to hit on those specific flavors that make Mexican street food so awesome. A year or two ago the girlfriend and I stumbled upon a random street grill in Mexico City. We ordered a couple things... then a couple more... I was a bit sick but we ended up going for the mystery stew in the pot they couldn't even describe in words I knew and I'm not bad with spanish. This was so motherflippingly delicious... and it was about 50 cents a pop. It was heaven. Now that's what I'm looking for from a gourmet street food experience. I got the Ahogada, which is why I'll come back and try another. It looked beautiful, the bread was nice, the meat seemed quality. And it was sitting in a nice bowl of tomato sauce. The problem was the tomato sauce was REALLY strong. There was no where else to put the sandwich so it sat in it and complete overpowered the meat. By the time I got to the second half the bread had expanded, sopping up sauce and was hard to eat without making a huge mess. Overall it was fine but not the deliciousness I was looking for. After I left I walked by a 7-11, saw a window ad for some terrible fried crap snack and for a moment almost thought about getting one. I should be thinking that after leaving Xoco.
