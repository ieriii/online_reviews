So after walking 6 miles to Vanille and seeing that it was closed, I decided that I better leave with something in my stomach. What better than pequods? This is definitely one of my favorite deep dish pizza places, but chicagoans told me I can't call it chicago deep dish. Whatever. It's good and the caramelized cheese crust is delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the proportions of everything was perfect.
