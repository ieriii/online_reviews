these crepes are delicious! you can pick anything off the menu, dinner or dessert crepes, or build your own with all your favorite flavors, and not go wrong! many healthy and flavorful options for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. the ingredients are always very fresh, and i can always taste every single thing that is supposed to be in my crepe. the portion sizes are wonderful - if you're hungry, you can eat the whole thing. if you just need a snack, half is plenty and you can share or take the rest home. i love the soups that come with the crepes - the algerian lamb stew is delicious, the lamb is always very tender, and the vegetable soup is heavenly. the mint tea is very refreshing, as well as the other fancy juices they have, like pomegranate and mango (although sometimes they don't have every single juice that's on the menu, but i cannot fault them for that). the turkish coffee is SO good and spicy and i love that they ask if you like it sweet or not so sweet. they are always attentive to refilling your water, and the servers are all very nice. the atmosphere is very warm and inviting, a great place to meet up with friends. the decor is very cool, with hammered copper pots and rugs on the walls, and bottles of orange blossom water, pineapples, and plants in the windows. i prefer this location over the lincoln park one because it is brighter, much bigger, and has plenty of seating - although if you go on a weekend morning/afternoon, you may have to wait a little bit for a table and the seating is pretty close, but it's a friendly place, and popular for a reason.
