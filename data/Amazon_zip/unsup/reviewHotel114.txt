my family and i stayed at this hotel one night before a bulls game. the service was great. the check-in was quick and easy. the rooms were clean...the beds are the most comfortable beds i think i have ever slept in. we had a great view of the city. it was also the freshest cleaned smelling room (if that makes sense) i have ever had. i would definitely stay here again if i am ever back in the city.
