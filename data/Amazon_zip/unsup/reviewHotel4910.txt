This is from my friend Erick Bieger: VISITORS BEWARE! My friends and I stayed at The Drake this past weekend when we came into town for the Notre Dame game. We woke up just before 1am to someone running out of our room after taking the cash from our wallets. The hotel was less than helpful and refused to take responsibility for not checking room keys after midnight which is their stated policy. They wouldn't even call the police for us and refused to check the video cameras until after the holiday weekend. It's sad - we stay there every week for opening game weekend but it looks like that tradition is over.
