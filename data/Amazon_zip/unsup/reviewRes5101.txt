Oh how I wish this pig was much much fatter. Preferably tripled in size. The only thing preventing a 5 star review would be the cramped conditions we had to experience this amazing food in. I'm not adverse to communal dining at all, but it seems like 1 or 2 too many people were squeezed into each table. Such a wonderful problem to be had by a new-ish award winning restaurant. I really need to send many thanks to Anthony Bourdain for demystifying all these delicious neglected portions of the pig and old world applications. 5 years ago Pork Neck Bone Rillette would have went WAY over my head instead of into my mouth. It will win you over if you are afraid of spreadable meat. Also: I want a side of smelt with every sandwich I ever eat. Even better than fries (of the land)!
