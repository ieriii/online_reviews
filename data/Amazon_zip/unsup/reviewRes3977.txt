I won't dillute the greatness of this restaurant with an excess of hype. It is the single best food experience I have had in my life. Everything about it....from the spartan, urban "shabbiness" of the interior to the carefully chosen playlists that serve as the musical backdrop....to the FOOD....was a refreshing departure from the latest cold, perfectly decorated $300 dinner for 2 that seems to be plaguing this city. Wait...where did we just eat, Sunda? Ummm....Epic? Schwa explodes every culinary cliche with the refreshing crunch of a Metallica power cord ....and Chef Michael's brilliant , visionary creations.  The way you look at food will be forever changed....and you just might realize how SNOBBY we have become. One thing is for sure...you will NEVER forget this place. Bravo, fellas...take a bow.
