This is my favorite brunch spot in Chicago! My husband and I love coming here, and now that we're parents, we bring our little baby girl with us too. It's a very warm environment, with very nice people working there. The food is wonderful, everything from the fresh squeezed orange juice, the omelets (the "Spicy Flamenco" is my favorite), to the crepes.  There used to be a long wait, but now they have their customers walk down the street to 9 Muses for some hot coffee. I'm in no hurry, if I'm with good company, I don't mind sitting down for a coffee while I wait. I'm a bit partial to Greektown to begin with, but this place is really one of the gems of Halsted.
