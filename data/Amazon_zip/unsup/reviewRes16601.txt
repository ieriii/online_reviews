I went here for an after party for the premiere of the Color Purple when it opened in Chicago(thanks to my friend Rhett George-amazing singer, was Harpo in the play). The food was amazing...I was nibbling on the filet mignon and shrimp cocktails while rubbing shoulders with Michelle Williams, and a wide spectrum of beautiful smooth Brothas in suits EVERYWHERE! I was in heaven..... (This was before I met my BF..LOL) GREAT PLACE! GREAT AMBIANCE! GREAT FOOD!
