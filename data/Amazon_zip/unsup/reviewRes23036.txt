I first experienced this joint after a Sox game with some Asian friends who worked their magic and ordered some delish items. But, thank God we had some beers in our system to dull the pain of the spice. Don't get me wrong, I love spice, but a couple bites of the chili chicken and you've got a 4-alarm going off in your mouth! Visited again last Friday and the food was still spicy. The place was crowded, not unusual for a weekend, but we still managed to get a spot quickly. Unfortunately, it was in front of the door and the cold Chicago air took our breath away each time a patron would enter or exit.  The meals are big, quite enough for several people sharing a couple dishes. Don't let them try and tell you that you need more food. Overall, good food, quick service, and a good way to curb your fear of spice!
