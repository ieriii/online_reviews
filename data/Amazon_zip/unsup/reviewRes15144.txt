One of my favorite italian restaurants!The place itself is very Old school ,not too much up to date decor ,but Id rather have great food than some fancy shmancy decor !!They offer free valet in the parking lot ,upon entering you will come into the piano room ,bar and hostess stand .They have 2 rooms ,the better being the first room because its cozier and has these little private hidden couples tables that are aweome for when your trying to impress a date and have some privacy during dinner .All their entrees come with soup AND salad ,pizza bread and most dishes ome with your choice of potato or pasta ...great deal !Try the ribs or really any meat dish is great ... I dont eat seafood but my dinner guest have all sd it was the best they have ever had .DOnt forget to get dessert ...the bananas foster is prepared tableside and is fun to watch being prepared .
