seriously the best bar i've ever been to. yeah, i know i don't drink, but they were more than happy to throw down making me non-alcoholic drinks on par with the ones my friends were getting. the bitters are phenomenal and really set tvh apart from anywhere else. these cats can really throw down. show them respect in the form of tips. you know they earn it.
