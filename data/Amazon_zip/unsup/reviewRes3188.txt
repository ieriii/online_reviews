You know what, I like Crisp. Mostly because I really like chicken wings and they do them really good. Be forewarned, these wings are some growth hormone because they're enormous. a 5 piece order can easily accommodate 2-3 people (with drinks and side in addition, of course). Also the Original Buddha Bowl is tasty and really generous. But they dont make the best leftovers I've learned :/ The atomic wings - could stand to be spicier and less dominated by the pickled jalapeo. Then again, I just eat really spicy..
