What can be said now that you can't read in 220+ other reviews and the shining number of stars. We walked in around noon, most of us in a dazed fog from the night before, reliving it with every step. I had assorted appetizers and spicy sweet on my mind. Some of the other guys were thinking the same or spicy hot soup the answer to a foggy mind. The place was packed, every table full, yeah it's Saturday noon but damn, every last table! The cute hostess in the red cheongsam (aka one piece Chinese dress) greeted us with a smile right away, "ten minutes please wait outside" is what she tells everyone walking through the double doors. Not five minutes and a table was cleared and we were seated. Lunches with friends in these kinds of scenarios are perfect for getting a chance to taste everything you've ever heard about a restaurant and sharing a bill is always fun(with the right people). Agile R. suggested we check it out per a friend's suggestion. Everyone ordered a dish, appetizer and shared. Pot stickers, dumplings, crab Rangoon, even Tony's dry Chili chicken and more! The only entre which stunk was my choice, Ma Po Tofu, which at most places can be awesome and when ordered spicy it's even better. Theirs was clumpy, mild and boring. Maybe they forgot to add spice? I dunno. Everything else was tasteful and we tried our best to finish it all, I know the hostess was hoping we'd leave sooner than later instead of lounging around. During our feast people came and left, most would see the full room and not bother waiting. It's worth waiting though, most tables are receiving their food pretty quickly and parties are leaving without prolonged sitting. First time was great, looking forward to the next time.
