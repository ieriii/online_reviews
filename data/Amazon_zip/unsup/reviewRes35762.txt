My husband and I have gone there every year for our anniversary or birthday or holiday for the past 6 years and its the only place we celebrate because we love the food that much. Of all the wonderful places in Chicago, we pick Shaw's! The price is a bit expensive, but if you are already aware of that, then its all good. The crabs are wonderful obviously, and the lobster bisque is AMAZING and the service is wonderful! Thank you Shaw's.
