Maybe it was a bad day at Crisp but I was not impressed by their food, service or ambiance. I mean the chicken didn't taste bad. It just wasn't special in my opinion. It may have helped if I had room to actually eat my chicken. Since they appear to be doing well perhaps they will expand their seating and overall room in the future. In the end I would much rather eat at about any South side joint that serves up real fried chicken, soul food style.
