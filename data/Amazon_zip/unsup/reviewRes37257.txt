After years of excuses I finally had the opportunity to enjoy the fantastic food and drink of Hopleaf. It is deservedly packed on most nights- a substantial contributing factor to putting off a visit for so long. The 5th star is for the sweetbreads and parsnip puree entree, in both putting it on the menu and the tasty execution. Sweetbreads are the most delicious of things that are neither sweet nor bread.  Upstairs seating has the benefit of being over the kitchen and all the smells and aromas it produces. Which, excepting only the unmistakable odor of Brussels sprouts, I found pretty great.
