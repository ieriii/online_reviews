Gotta love Sultan's Market, the place that made me a fan of falafel sandwiches, where in the past I avoided them like the plague. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, quick if not polite service, and tolerable ambiance.Dunno about this talk about how cheap it is, however--I can't leave with a meal for my wife and I for less than $25. $10 for rice and falafel sandwich (including tax) seems a bit steep, though they are located in the den of bullshit boutiques that is Wicker Park, so I imagine rents are steep. -1 star for the prices and service; otherwise, a gem.
