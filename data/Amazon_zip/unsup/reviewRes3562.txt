So one of my go to places to eat was Rice Box, at this very location, a few years ago, when I lived in East Lakeview. See a Saturday night. My husband and I, in typical form, can not decide what to do so we just walked to the Broadway and Wellington area. I knew about Crisp, I wanted to try it, he hadnt had bi bim bop, we after finding a 25 minute at New Tokyo, we decided to give it a try. I got the Baby Budda and he got the Big Boy Budda. We could have easily split the Big Boy and had enough food. On a whim, he also got fries (honeymoon diet be damned) and we sat down and dug in. They have huge wood block tables that are good for communal seating and making new friends. We were there pretty late though, so it was relatively quiet.  The food was good, and yummy. I loved the spicy sauce and we used all four containers that we were given (and got some to take home as well) I loved the spinach and bean sprouts and of course, the yummy fried egg on top. I think that more veggies would have added to the dish but I didnt want to get the next size up, way too much food. The portions are HUGE for what you are paying for. It is really reasonable.  The staff was nice and the music playing was kind of funky and fun. They were also showing the Bachelorette which made me decide that I need to watch that show. To be honest, watching three people devour fried chicken was somewhat gross but according to them, it was delicious. Also good: huge rolls of paper towels on each table and a sign near the garbage can that says "can you recycle that?" Anyone who prompts recycling is good in my book!! I would definitely back.
