I am not sure what all the hype is about. I've been here plenty over the years (most recently because my fiance insits that we go). The food is good. But, you can go to other guero friendly places in the city that are cleaner, have bar service, and is overall much funner to be at. My test for restaurants is how clean their bathrooms are. The times I've ventured in--they are generally not clean and over-crowded. (stay away from the back room of the room where the bathrooms are-why? it smells like bathroom! Overall, good food but overrated. There are nicer places out there!
