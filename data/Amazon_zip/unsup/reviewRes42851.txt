Best stuffed (not-pan) pizza in Chicago. The quality control here is outstanding. If you order an extra large stuffed it will literally weigh 6 pounds and taste amazing. Plus, it's an independently owned restaurant. During the week they serve slices, and if there's one messy slice left (who hasn't received an iffy 'last slice' before?) they'll take it out of the heater and throw it out in front of everyone! Perhaps it can be argued that it's a bit wasteful of good food, but it's also indicative of their dedication to consistency. Avoid their burgers and ribs and stick with the thin crust or stuffed. Those who love stuffed spinach will be pleased.
