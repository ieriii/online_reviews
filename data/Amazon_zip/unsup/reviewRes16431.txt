If I had reviewed this restaurant last night, I probably would have been a little more generous. My entree, the halibut, was decent. But, for a $30 entree, I could have gone to any number of high-end eateries in the city for a similar dish without the manufactured Cheesecake-Factory-on-Steroids experience. Next to my friends' entrees, huge steak dishes, my little, tiny fish dish looked like it belonged in a doll house. Since last night, however, I have contracted what can only be considered food poisoning. I won't go into details. And, I wasn't the only person at the table to have the problem. I can think of 25 restaurants in Chicago that charge the same prices but have quality food and offer delightful experiences.
