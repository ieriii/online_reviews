We were visiting Chicago and happened to pass by Purple Pig. Great food! Everything on the menu was delish. The only con would be the too tight seating arrangement and if you are not seated outside (we were initially sitting outside but it started raining and they moved us inside), the noise inside is way too loud that you have to yell at each other to talk. Overall, a must place to dine.
