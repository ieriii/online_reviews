Stayed here recently for a convention. Location great. Food on site is dismal, but there's lots nearby in the neighborhood, and a grocery down the block for in-room eating. The main thing is the mattress. It's like sinking into a big tub of warm jello. I really didn't like it, needing a firm mattress for my back. Once sunken in I found it hard to turn over, and even harder to sit up. The chain seems quite proud of these mattresses, and i bet they cost a fortune, but I found them really annoying.
