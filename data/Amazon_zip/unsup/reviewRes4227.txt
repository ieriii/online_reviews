I came here as a part of group of three to grab drinks and enjoy the music. It was pretty crowded considering that we were here on a Tuesday night, but we just pulled up some chairs and soaked in the music until a booth opened up. The ambiance is romantic and I can see this being a great casual date place. Sirs take a hint, you can impress your date here with your taste in music, it's casual enough to converse, and if you're feeling awkward then just act like you're really paying attention to the performance.
