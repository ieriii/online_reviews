The more I look at my reviews, the more I feel like an old, angst-filled hater of all things that people love. I just don't get it. First of all, I don't feel like I should have to build my schedule around eating a hot dog. It's rarely open, and every time I've tried to pop in it's got a line out the door.  The dogs are pretty good, but the fries are grease-soaked and usually limp. Drink refills aren't free.  The place is fine, just annoying. Every time someone from out of town brings a lonely planet or AAA traveler's guide, I have to go again. Two Stars
