Eggs Benedict are sick, owner is nice guy. The best part is, this place can handle the rush of 30 yuppies waiting outside on a sunday, and get people in & out with out being shoved out the door. I am such a huge fan of this place, this place was actually part of the reason I moved to this hood, i can walk here hungover in ten minutes, word of advice, on the weekends, get here before 9am or you WILL wait over half an hour, after 11am, over an hour usually. I cant say enough good things about this place, the service is top notch, the menu rotates, the bloody mary's are spicy and chock full of booze. Even the ceiling fans are cool. If you are here from out of town, come here. I take people here from out of town and they are telling me how much they loved this place months later.
