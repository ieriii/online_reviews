I had a perfectly fine time at Mia Francesca - it wasn't the best Italian I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst either. The caprese salad was just what you'd expect: tomatoes with mozzarella medallions and a bit of basil and evoo on top. The ravioli con spinaci was nicely done, though I would have substituted the four-cheese sauce for a butter and herb sauce. The wine selection was what you typically find at Italian restaurants in the city - nothing to rave about. Tables are spaced quite close to each other, which probably makes the noise level seem louder than it actually is. It also means that the servers can't always see if you're out of water or finished with the meal. They do what they can, but you might wait awhile if you need service. Reservations probably aren't necessary, but I always think it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to dining out. You can usually make same-day reservations on OpenTable without a problem.
