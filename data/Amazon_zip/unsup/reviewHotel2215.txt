The InterContinental is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago, and it has a great location on North Michigan Avenue. The main lobby, a modern concoction that is not particularly memorable, helps to connect what amounts to two buildings smushed together. Try to look around at some of the older public areas and the exteriors and you will be impressed by an assortment of fine details. The indoor swimming pool is beautiful, and my corner room was terrific.
