We went there Sat. night with some friends and had a fabulous time. The food was soooo good and so plentiful! I had never eaten Korean BBQ before so it was really fun. We ordered four entrees to cook ourselves -- beef, pork, baby octupus, and squid. The meals come with soup and about 20 small plates to share. The small plates were great because they gave us a chance to sample many different Korean dishes. You don't choose the small plates, they just bring them out before the meats, and you sort of guess at what you are eating. There were some that were delcious and some were okay, but nothing that was bad in my opinion. The meat is plentiful and really yummy. They bring it to you raw and drenched in sauce. Then you cook it yourself in the middle of the table on the fire pit. It's pretty fun, and everything was easy to cook. My favorite was the pork then the baby octupus. The beef was good too, but we all thought the squid was a little too chewy, and by the time the squid came out, we were all pretty full anyways. We had some Korean alcohol (similar to Sake) and a couple beers each, and the bill came to about $32/pp which was pretty reasonable considering how much we ate and drank. The service was really fast as well. The only downside is that you end up smelling like a campfire by the time you leave, and the place is smoky and warm because of all the cooking at each table. I definitely recommend this place, especially if you are going out with a group. :)
