Simply the best. My mouth waters just thinking about a SuperDawg and fries. Oh to be back in Chicago. Best Kosher dog you can buy. The previous review by Rita J is not correct as SUPERDAWG is NOT a Chicago Vienna and never has been. Oh and don't ask for ketchup on your SuperDawg as you will not get any and the correct way to order is to ask for a SuperDawg not a hot dog or a red hot. The counter person will be the first to inform you that they only serve SuperDawgs. Enjoy!
