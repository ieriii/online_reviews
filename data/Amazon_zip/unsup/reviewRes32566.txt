Sunda is A-OK in my book. We had the rock shrimp - YUM - and the fatty tuna on crunchy rice for appetizers. Both were great starters. For the entree I ordered the Sunda Summer roll which had tuna, basil, and asparagus. I've never had basil in a roll before and it added that perfect "summer" element that the name of the roll implies: fresh and clean. My dining partner had the salmon nigiri which looked wonderful. Only complaint was that we were sitting for a while before we had a server. All in all, a great meal and really good for people watching.
