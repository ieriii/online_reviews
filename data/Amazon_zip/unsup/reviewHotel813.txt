Lucky me, I got to stay at this lovely spot on the Magnificent Mile for a whole week for work. This was my first time in Chicago and it really helped me make the most of my experience! I love the Westin's amenities, especially the Heavenly Bed. I got wonderful rest so I could make the most of my nights out and still be refreshed to do work the next day! I also love their service express, which will bring you virtually anything you need in about 30 minutes. I forgot my toothbrush, which was promptly brought to my room. I also asked for some bathroom slippers. My coworker asked for a razor and got shaving cream too (how considerate!), and even nail polish remover and a curling iron! Now, that really tells me they mean business when they call it SERVICE express. I really like the Grille downstairs too. They have a really great bar where most of my coworkers socialized every night, and had some meals. Good grill food, amazing cocktails (I love it when bartenders take their cocktails seriously).  My only complaint is that they don't have the flat screen tvs here yet. I've stayed at the Westin in Philadelphia, and the TV's really bring it up a notch. Can't wait to stay here again when I visit Chicago next time!
