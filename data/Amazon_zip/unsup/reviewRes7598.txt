The entrees are a little over priced but they were definitely good. My boyfriend had a rigatoni dish that had an AMAZING tomato sauce and I had the vegetarian lasagna that was to die for! The sauce was very flavorful and there were the perfect amount a veggies & cheese! Their selection was also pretty broad for being a vegetarian, so I appreciated that. Their buffalo mozzarella appetizer was great as well. We left stuffed! But, the restaurant had a great atmosphere, romantic and calm, and the service was good. I would definitely eat here again but maybe I'll bring a coupon next time that everyone talks about!
