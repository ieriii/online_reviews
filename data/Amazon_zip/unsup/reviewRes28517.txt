I love the pasta bowl and so does my ass! I'm just keeeding, but I could eat here everyday. They are super friendly here, its like fast-food pasta. My entrees have always come out within 10 minutes or less and super delicious. I have ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce and their gnocchi. The gnocchi is a bit heavy but the rigatoni is just the right portion, right size, and right taste. I have also ordered the goat cheese with marinara and french bread which is a yummy app. The meals are super cheap and they usually have some sort of beer special. I always order an app and and two entrees with the boy. The total has never been more than $20-$30 which is not bad at all and it is plenty of food and a nice casual date spot.
