Irazu makes me glad I live in the area.  The place is small, but the food is great and very fairly priced, especially the sandwiches. BYOB is great. The staff is super friendly and cool every time I call or go in. I've probably eaten their food upwards of 10 times and can't recommend this place enough. This place is what central american food should be. If you're getting tired of the tacos and burritos at western/armitage, take a short stroll east for this treat. I also noticed that their delivery range is extremely huge when I was there last night. They apparently deliver all the way from Irving park to Roosevelt, and from the lake to Pulaski. WOW.  You have no excuse not to eat this food! Call them! edit: the owner sent me a message to point out that their delivery range extends all the way up to Montrose now. Luckily I live close enough to get carry-out, but that's impressive!
