This will be short but sweet, since I feel like I can't say much that hasn't been said already. The food was YUM with an extra serving of yum. Went in for the first time with co-workers, saw the line, at which point they ask me "Do we want to stay here or go somewhere else...?" But I had already gotten a whiff of what's cookin' which drew an enthusiastic "stay here" from me. OK, so 25 minutes or so in line had me slightly less enthusiastic... It went by quickly for a first-timer though as I had time to study the menu on the wall and check out the other wall hangings displaying where all the fresh local ingredients come from. Pretty sweet. I can agree with people saying it's a little on the expensive side, but not really enough to bother me. Most places in the River North area where I might go out for lunch (if it's a sit-down lunch) are probably going to run me $11 for a sandwich or lunch plate and a drink. Here it was a shade over $12. Ooo...it was tough, but I parted with that extra dollar. No seriously, it wasn't a big deal :) Can't give a full 5 stars because even if there's nothing to be done and you just have to learn to deal with lines if you like popular places, I can't declare a place 'perfection' if it does business as a lunch spot yet makes you wait for half an hour before even ordering. I can't justify that kind of time commitment too often for lunch during the work day. Other than that, all around good experience. Also should be noted that I walked in noticed all the employees seemed to be in a good mood and that is ALWAYS a good sign and appreciated by the customer!
