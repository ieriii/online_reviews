Having recently moved to Chicago, I just had to visit Hot Doug's. I saw this place profiled a couple of times on the Food Network. This is beyond your average hot dog place. Yes, you can get a basic hot dog for only $1.75 which has everything on it. However, the real draw is the specialty encased meats that are a lot pricier, but you are paying for quality gourmet ingredients and friendly, efficient service. I got the Stella Ackerman, today's special, which was a lamb sausage with spicy Moroccan mustard and shreds of Provolone cheese on top, a small order of fries, and a Doc Brown's cream soda. Although I was starving when I got to Hot Doug's and waited in a long line (in the pouring rain!), the one sausage and fries were more than I really needed to eat. My boyfriend got the White Wine and Dijon Rabbit Sausage with Fines Herbes Sauce Moutarde, Armagnac-Truffle Pt and Truffle Balsamic Cream Drizzle. Does that sound rich? It is! But it's totally worth it. We will definitely be back in good or bad weather to try the duck fat fries and other specials of the week. Our only mistake was that we didn't really split our sausages in half, because the rabbit sausage was very rich. I just moved from San Francisco here and I think a place like this would do very well in the Bay Area with all its foodies and hipsters.
