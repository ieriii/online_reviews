oatmeal shakes and veggie tacos ease the pain of spending my hard-earned cash at chicago teacher across the street. irazu is a place i recommend to everyone who is looking for a new place. i love the outdoor seating, which i think just expanded recently. i usually get food to go, but outside is where it's at if you're dining in. the food is fresh and i like the mild flavors in the dishes i order. as someone who likes rice, beans, veggies, but not super spicy, irazu hits the spot.
