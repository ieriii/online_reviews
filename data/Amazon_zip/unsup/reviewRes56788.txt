I like this place, but it's sort of pricy for what they offer. I used to go here on date nights because there wasn't really anything closer to my house until recently. I don't like to mad mouth any businesses but I really like to get my money's worth and it just doesn't do it for everyday dining and our server was not friendly the last time I went.I will give it a few more shots because I like to support local businesses, but I really think it thy should revise a few things.
