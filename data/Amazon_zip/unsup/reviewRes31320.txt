Holy classy steakhouse Batman! I am impressed! So I was here for a drug company educational dinner within the first couple weeks of opening and was pleasantly surprised. I am not so much into steakhouses but I had heard Mastro's was different and it was. I loved the dark wood decor and the fact that it was not like the touristy steakhouses with people in jeans. Everyone here was dressed up (as it should be, in my opinion) - jackets for the men. The bar was beautiful - I loved how they had the bottles arranged (see photo). There was a bit of sticker shock upon viewing the drink menu, however, $18 for a huge size martini and the shaker with another whole drink inside it - was well worth it (comes out to $9/drink basically) and nice and atrong too! I had some delicious Ruby Red martini - divine! As for dinner, obviously they are still working out the kinks and there were some huge time gaps in between courses but I won't hold that against them. I love bread & butter and their bread basket was the best I have ever seen and included delightful pretzel loaves in them. To start we had these lovely sauteed garlicky giant prawns with garlic toast - superbly cooked. The Caesar salad was meh - didn't care for the dressing or the croutons - could have skipped it altogether. For dinner I had the salmon and it was humongous and perfectly cooked as well. Side were creamed spinach (I'm allergic), garlic mashed potatoes - that needed a bit more butter and garlic and creamed corn that also lacked flavor. My mother's filet was a perfect medium rare and melted in your mouth like butter - I immediately regretted my decision to go the fish route once that delectable meat landed on my tongue. For dessert, skip the chocolate cake - it was dry and gross but the cheesecake was divine! I am sure they've probably got it more together by now and once I go back and try some of the other dishes and enticing sides, the star rating will rise ...
