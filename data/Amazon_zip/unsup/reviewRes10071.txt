I have never had better pizza in my life and I consider myself a pizza connesieur. We ordered one pizza with BBQ sauce and the other with red sauce, both were fantastic. The ingredients were fresh, and the pizzas were cooked just right. We also tried the Top Heavy and the Worryin Ale, both pretty good. I am deducting a star for the host and our waitress, both were mediocre. The host told us it would be a 20-25 minute wait, when there were several tables with nobody sitting at them. After 30 minutes, he seated us at the table right by the front door, where everyone walking past ran into our table and our pan of pizza went flying off the stand more than once, Our waitress took our order, and then we never saw her again until we had to ask for the check. We had to ask for another drink from another server walking past our table. To me, that is unacceptable.
