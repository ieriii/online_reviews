Wow--so I'm definitely in the minority here, but I felt I needed to write a review because my and my husband's experience at Tru was so disappointing.We've been to many of the best restaurants in New York City, and when we had the opportunity to try Tru, we jumped at the chance. The prices were definitely befitting of a top restaurant, but the food could only be described as bizarre, even for our try-anything tastes.Most of the food we had there was cold, and the chef, whoever it was that cold winter night, thought it fitting to serve us everything in a cold, gelatinous bubble. I don't know where he/she got that idea, but it wasn't creative or fitting for a night where something warm and comforting would have been more appropriate.The wait staff, while EXTREMELY (almost to a fault) attentive, became more of entertainment for us, as every time they came to the table, it was in pairs, and almost as if they were counting in their heads, 1..2..3...AND....set plates on table, or 1....2....3....AND.....fill water glasses.There is something to be said for great, understated service, as if you almost don't even remember they've come and removed a plate, or filled your wine glass, etc. It shouldn't look like the synchronized waiter games.Again, for the food, we were definitely disappointed, especially knowing that this seems to get universally good ratings, and because we spent as much as we did. I'm hoping that, as one reviewer noted, since the menu changes, others won't have the experience we had. Unfortunately, we'll never know....
