2 1/2 really. The waiter didn't have any personality and from the begining seemed to want to rush us even though we were the 1st table to enter. The busser took away many plates as I had just scooped up the last bite and began chewing. The wine pours by the glass were meager, I felt short changed and overcharged, On the whole the food was overpriced in relation to the quality. Nothing was outstanding. The spinach with mushroom salad didn't have very many mushrooms and had a flavorless dressing. My friend liked her crab with peppers. The meat on the beef lollipops was dry, the sauce was OK. Oxtail potstickers sounded so good, but they served near room temperature, and believe it or not, they found a way to make the oxtail meat dry. My freind really like her Unagi Nigiri. I liked the special sushi roll with king crab, loster, scallops, avacado and spicy mayonaise. We also had the shrimp in egg sauce. The portion was reasonable, but the sauce was overly salty, and I like salt! My freind wouldn't even eat more than 1 piece. Dessert was rice balls with ice cream filling. 5 or 6 flavors, and it was simple but good. I think we tried enough items and I know I won't go back. I've had better, My friend liked it more than I did.
