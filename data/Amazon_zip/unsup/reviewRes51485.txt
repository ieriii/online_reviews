This location is VERY different from the Lincoln Square location. In fact, minus the food and drinks, it's the complete opposite. That location is yuppies with kids. This is very much a bar that always has football on (no, not the American kind) with some locals bellied up. I like this about a bar. It's small, a little rough, service isn't necessarily cheerful, but heck, when you want a pitcher of margs and some enchiladas, this is the place. Oh, and chips and salsa? Five stars.
