It's rare that I give a place a 5-star rating. It's even rarer that I'll wait in line for an hour and a half for a darn hot dog and fries. Lucky for me, it wasn't freezing outside that November morning and I got what I was waiting for...encased meat at its finest. Owner Doug Sohn is funny as he is genius. How can you possibly serve all of those people waiting outside when the dining room can barely seat 30? Timing, it's all about timing and Doug is the Man when it comes to hauling loads of people into his shop. What to order: Duck Fries and a Foie Gras Dog. Period. Hot Doug's has made encased meats a necessity. Doug, we salute you!
