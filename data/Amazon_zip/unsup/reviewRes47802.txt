I haven't had the food - only drinks. The cocktails are usually good, the rooftop is great. It's sometimes hard to get service (either from a waitress or a bartender) on a summer evening outside. The sangria flavors are usually good, but could use some more fruit! Service downstairs is pretty solid. One time, two people in our group ordered a beer and they knew it didn't taste right. The waitress assured us that it was the right beer, but these guys know their Victoria beer and whatever they gave us was not Victoria. Maybe the lines were crossed? They have a free shuttle that I haven't used, but am always tempted by.
