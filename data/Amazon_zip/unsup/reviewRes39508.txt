HOLY CHEESUS! We showed up early to ensure we could get a table in good time and then spent the next two hours in food and whiskey bliss. I ordered the Seared Maine Scallops, Braised Oxtail, Black Truffle Gnocchi, Celery Root, Butternut Squash, Fontina Fonduta with a blood and sand to sip on the side. Delish. Both went down so smoothly. The small plate was so rich and buttery and melted onto the tongue. I was sad to see it gone, but so happy I had room for dessert. I decided to order - Warm Gruyere Donuts, "Blis" Maple Syrup, Rasped Parmesan, Roasted Hazelnut, Whipped Citrus Goat Cheese- OH MY FREAKING HEAVENS. I have no words that can do justice to how delighful and seductive this tasted. Do yourself a favor and go put this in your mouth. Only good things can come of it. On a last note, I had a chance to try the Buffalo Trace Whitedog rye whiskey. It smelled like vanilla and butterscothch and went to down the hatch too smothly to be considered safe. It was delicious and I am seriously considering spiking my coffee with it every morning for the rest of my life.
