The experience of dining at Anteprima is getting more onerous and less pleasureful. It was a pain to get a reservation; they required me to wait when our party wasn't all there (our party was 2 people and there were plenty of open tables!); our server was borderline rude and acted irritated when we asked for anything (like when we had the audacity to ask for more water or for recommendations on the menu. Gasp!). The menu is fine but very heavy on small plates/appetizers with far fewer options for entrees. I like to support local business and independent restaurants and I will continue to do so... but not at Anteprima.
