This has to be one of my favorite in Pilsen and as a resident I have tried a decent amount of Mexican restaurants in the area but I aways seem to find my way back here. We went Saturday night 2/17/11 and while the line was out the door we only waited at the most 10mins. I had the enchiladas and it was very tasty and the hint of sweetness just took it over the edge in goodness! The appetizer that night was the chicken soup which was delish in it self; along with the chips and salsa served we did not need to order another appetizer. Although they don't accept cc, they have an ATM right inside the restaurant. All in all; great service and the food was very reasonably priced and very good.
