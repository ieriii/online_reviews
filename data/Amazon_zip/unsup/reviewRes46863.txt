I got hosed!!! Yelpers and friends a like have raved about Uncommon Ground but my experience was very lack luster. I went for dinner and it will probably be my last meal. But there were things that I really liked, the service was great (friendly, helpful, and left me alone), the atmosphere and decor are excellent (warm, trendy/hip, great local artists paintings, nice patio and a beautiful bar). I do appreciate that they support not only local painter/artists but also a lot of musicians from all over. With shows every single night you can always catch something entertaining. What absolutely killed me was that the food, it was bland and for the price...I was floored. How can you charge $15 for a chicken sandwich that tasted like cardboard!!! The fries were good (they have sweet potato fries!) but I feel cheated. Not impressed with their chopped salad either. I think it's great that they use seasonal, locally produced, family farmed & organic products. The rain vodka bloody mary was good too but thick, the kind that sticks to your bones. Dessert was also very disappointing pumpkin sorbet (good) and a piece of pumpkin/carrot cake....$8 @!# what!?!? I would go back for a drink and a show but not the food!! Also fyi a lot of families go here with kids/babies I noticed, so if that bugs you... Uncommon Ground also is a sponsor of The 10th Annual World Music Festival....check it out!!!! Going on right now in Sept.
