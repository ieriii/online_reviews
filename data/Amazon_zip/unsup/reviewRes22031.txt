"i've never been to a restaurant that has asked me to leave bc i've been here for a while. wtf!!!! i want my tip money back!!!! wtf!!!!!!!!" 2 weeks later, I've finally calmed down enough to be my normal, reasonable self. It's unfortunate that a restaurant I had high hopes for was so disrespectful that I had to come out of my non-yelping state to write a bad review. Sad.  It was 9 PM Wednesday and we were there for 2 hours, about to finish our last bottle of wine after bagging the remaining food.  That's when Jose, the host, told us "you've been here for 3 hours and other customers are waiting. If you were waiting that long, you'd want people to leave, too." We were so shocked by his rude and audacious approach that we didn't know how to respond, except utter out "we've only been here for 2 hours at the most and we're almost done" The restaurant closes soon, why are we the only ones being asked to leave? And WHO ASKS CUSTOMERS TO LEAVE???????? IS THERE A SIGN UP THAT STATES YOU HAVE A TIME LIMIT?  It's amazing how poor customer service can really kill your taste for a restaurant. The owner found us outside and apologized, saying that Jose will be reprimanded. I highly doubt that.  Food: The grilled steak was good quality, as expected at such an establishment but it's nothing to go out of your way for. If you have a good taqueria near you, stick with them. Oatmeal shake - surprisingly smooth and creamy, not lumpy with ice chunks at The Brown Sack. I would definitely recommend The Pepito sandwich - um, Chicago's favorite? I don't think so, not when the bread is chewy and the sandwich doesn't wow 3 people who ordered it.  Emapandas - bland bland bland. The "best" one was the cheese and spinach, and that's bc the cheese had to support the empanada in flavor, since it had nothing else to offer.
