I was so excited to try this place. I walked in and was very impressed by the decor. Not that I expected anything less from the blackbird crew. The bathrooms are a must see....LOL!  I was disappointed when they proceeded to seat me and my guest on top of two other couples. I could barely breath, let alone talk across the table without engaging the other people sitting next to me. I loved the idea of long tables throughout the room. It is a very European concept although they could have done a better job of creating space between groups. Especially for those that are looking for a more intimate setting. We kindly asked to move and they seated us at a table in the front windows with are beautiful.  It took a good 10 minutes to get service, but once we did we were very impressed. The menu was difficult to read but our waiter explained it to us well! You'll have more than enough beers to chose from but don't be intimidated by the list. They explained that as well. If you not into meat I would not recommend this place. The beef carpacio was perfect as well as the trout. I loves the pickles too...not your typical kosher pickle. For dessert I highly recommend the doughnuts. Overall, I would definitely return. Probably better for a big group rather than a date. I think it might have been an off night as far as service! LOve the bathrooms!!!
