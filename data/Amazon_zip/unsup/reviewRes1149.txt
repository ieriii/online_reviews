GOODBYE, YELP. Open letter to all on Yelp: Dear Friends, It has been a joy getting to know all of you and experiencing Chicago in a new way. Food has brought us together, but now we must part. For you see, I have eaten at Hot Doug's. I have had duck fat fries. I have tasted bacon sausage with wine infused grainy dijon mustard, herb garlic eurocreme and lettuce.  I can die now. I can die in peace.  MOURN NOT! Dry your eyes. I am going willfully, tranquilly. For there is no finer send off, my friends, than encased meats.
