So much for the W experience! I am so grateful that I did not have to pay out of my own pocket to stay here. They try to make the hotel look trendy, but it doesn't work.To start with, the room itself feels so dirty & cheap. It's so small too. Having the bathroom barely separated with the rest by the wooden windows was a terrible idea. The hall way, the common area, and the whiskey bar all have the same problem: way too dark! Slightly dimmed is cool & make it feel sexy, but this make it feel like a cave! The hotel staffs are way too cocky because they think they work at a cool hotel. Come on, do your job & accommodate the guests first! The lobby is not as nice as the picture. In fact, it's very chaotic there.I found out this place used to be a Days Inn, go figure! All that sleezy decor could not cover up what it really is. I was pretty embarrassed that I invited a girl to this hotel with me. The only good thing about it is location - close walking distance to all major attractions.
