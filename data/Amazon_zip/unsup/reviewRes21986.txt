Hands Down The Best Place For A Taste Of The America's! Irazu has the perfect ambience inside as well as outside....I should know I just had my birthday party there with 18 people and let me tell you if was WONDERFUL. I love their veggie burrito with Plantains...I love their veggie sandwich...I love their empanadas and when I was a carnivore I loved their pepito sandwich. Even though the salsa is too spicy for me I can't stop eating it. Everything on the menu is always fresh and delicious. Horchata and B.Y.O.B.!!!!! I have been coming here for years now and will continue to do so. Thank you for your exceptional food and service! Muchas Gracias! Love, CK
