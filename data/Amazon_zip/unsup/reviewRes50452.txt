WIshbone has a strong backbone of really good food, casual dining and friendly service. I have been to the Lincoln and West Loop locations and enjoy the southern home cooking at each, especially breakfast and brunch! The Lincoln location has a great back room that is great for meetings and social gatherings. It is fully equipped with a drop down screen usable for movie screenings and business presentations. Last, the Lincoln location is closed on some days/nights, so call ahead. During these closures, however, one can rent the space for private events and even for other unique events such as movie location sets;)
