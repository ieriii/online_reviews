I am a fan of the Sutton place. I often travel back to Chicago for work and I normally stay at the Sutton Place. It is a very modern hotel with comfortable beds and the bathrooms are big. They have a nice walk in shower and a big oval tub as well. Last time, I stayed at the Sutton Place I also tried out the fitness suite, which was small but got the job done. It has 2 treadmills, elliptical, bike and a couple weight machines and free weights. It was actually crowded in the morning hours. The location of the Sutton place is fantastic. It located in what most people from Chicago call the "Viagra Triangle". It is steps away from many restaurants. My favorite place is Lou Malnati's for pizza. I also like to stop at Mr Kites chocolate shop to get some S'mores and Mountain Tops! I highly recommend stopping in and getting some chocolate! Overall I enjoy the Sutton place and look forward to visiting Chicago next month.
