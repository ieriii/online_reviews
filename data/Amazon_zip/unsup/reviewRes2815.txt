This review is for the dessert tasting menu which when I went was a shockingly low $25 per person, but may have been raised recently. They do it after 9pm daily I believe, and it is 3 (but really more like 5) very generous courses of fruit, chocolate, cake/pastry confections and candies. Each dish looked like a work of art and tasted just as good. I was unbelievably stuffed after the nearly 3 hour experience. I'd say go ahead and forget having dinner beforehand. It was such a shame I couldn't eat any more by the time the dessert cart laden with truffles, caramels, cookies and lollipops rolled around. They even gave us mini loaves of banana nut bread on the way out. The staff truly went above and beyond the call of duty here to make sure we felt waited on hand and foot from the moment we walked in to the moment we teetered out in a haze of sugary bliss. Every move our two servers made seemed like a choreographed "dance" around our table, pouring each person's water simultaneously, changing our silverware sets between each course simultaneously, etc. It was pretty amusing. The service was flawless, and without a hint of snottiness! Now, if only I can find a dressy outfit with an elastic waist band...
