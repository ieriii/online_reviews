Unusual, tasty food. I didn't have my socks blown off by the sheer awesomeness of the food, but they were adventurous in flavor combinations and the quality was very good. Unpretentious service, fun and hip atmosphere. We had bacon-wrapped dates (yummy), warm green bean salad (yummy), goat cheese with garlic sauce (yummy yummy) and a sausage pizza thingy (not so yummy). The dessert (chocolate croquettes with banana infused marshmallow) was the reason we came in the first place and it was tasty and different, bordering on delicious but stopped right on the edge of yummy. Come with middling expectations and your tastebuds will be very happy indeed!
