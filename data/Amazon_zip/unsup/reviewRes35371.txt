Saw this place on Meat & Potatoes and decided to check it out. My daughter had the Roast Pork over Rice and I had the Roast Duck over Rice. Both were very delicious - moist & flavorful without being too salty. They served a large portion of rice. The veggies were good but we weren't too crazy about the salted egg. All in all, a pretty good place to eat at.
