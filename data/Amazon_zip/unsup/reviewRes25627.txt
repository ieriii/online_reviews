This review is for a recent delivery on a Friday night. The time quoted was 75 minutes, which is pretty standard for a Friday night delivery, so no worries there.. The pizza's arrived hot and fresh, so all good there. We got 2 large pizza's with 2 toppings on each.. the total was ~46$. I would give this joint a solid 3.5 but what kept me from giving a 4/5 is the following: 1. The qual is good but crust was a bit burnt and the toppings are way skimpy. We had one with ground beef and onion, the ground beef was barely noticeable.. The other was jalapeno and pineapple.. and same for this one, very skimpy, especially considering your paying ~3$ per topping for a large.. The only topping that was plentiful ( and actually excessive ), was the cheese... next time I will get light cheese! 2. The price is a bit expensive for the overall quality and quantity. ( another place near me serves a x-large special daily for 13$ or ~18$ including tax and delivery charge. better qual, more toppings, larger pie, faster delivery.. ) I will try this again and dine in sometime as well and post another review. As of now, its a fair deal that's worth checking out again...
