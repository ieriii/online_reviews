Total bro hang out, but has really good food, especially for a sports bar. I always order their veggie panini with sweet potato fries, which is AMAZING. It's been voted the best wings in Chicago, and I've heard their burgers are up there as well. They also have all different kinds of sliders. It has beer cocktails, which is a cool concept. Their beer selection is mediocre and a bit over-priced. However, they do have drink specials every night of the week. Good service, waitresses are always very friendly and accommodating. It's a great place to catch a game and grab some food with friends. I've only really been there on week nights, but I heard it's pretty packed on the weekends.
