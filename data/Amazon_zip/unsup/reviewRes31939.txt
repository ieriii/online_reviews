After reading all of the great reviews I decided to check this spot out. with my husband. Can someone please tell me what all the hype is about??? The food was mediocre at best, nothing we ordered wowed us, not even their drinks. I had some raspberry martini drink, it was way too sweet, I felt like I was eating dessert.  We weren't that hungry and only ordered a few things. Started off with the lemongrass beef sticks, nasty, I could barely swallow the first bite, the meat was not tasty at all. Then we had the Oxtail pot stickers, they were okay, probably the best thing we ordered all night. We also tried two types of roles, tale of two tails and Lobster with Wagyu. The Tuna rolls were good, but nothing special. The Lobster/Wagyu roll was also okay. I expected big pieces of Lobster in this roll, instead I got what looked like imitation crab shredded into pieces. Not too thrilled. For dessert we had "ridiculous" it was good, probably the best part of the whole dinner was the dessert. The atmosphere was nice, I liked the inside of the restaurant. The crowd was okay, it boggles my mind how people go out on a Sat night wearing capri's and flip flops, come on people, if you're going to spend over $200 on a dinner you can buy yourself a decent outfit!!! I won't be going back here again.
