I love Giordano's. They have, without a doubt, the best stuffed pizza in Chicago. The crust is not dry (as I have found at some other places) and it has a great taste. I have relatives and friends who request nothing but Giordano's on their return trips to Chicago. I want to stand outside Uno and Due (and the awful Gino's East) and tell the tourists to head up to North Rush Street and get some real pizza. *Update* - My last two trips to Giordano's have been quite dissapointing. I'm downgrading my love for this place. Time to find a new favorite.
