This is a great place for date night - crazy atmosphere, bright colors all around, and wickedly strong drinks. The food was absolutely incredible, both the appetizers and the entrees. I came here on a triple date with my boyfriend's friends, and it was great for a group and the waiter was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. We all had a great time and left with satisfied tummies; although our wallets might have been a little pissed.
