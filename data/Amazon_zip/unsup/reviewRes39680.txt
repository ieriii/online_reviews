I think it's time to clear up some confusion. To do it the right way at L&E, first, get a room at the inn. You won't believe how affordable it is--so affordable that by the time you get there, you're already feeling good, and this is before you and your girlfriend start in on the champagne. Sure, the artwork on the wall is a little disconcerting (Poster: "A significant episode in a life-long history of loneliness and alienation"). But otherwise the room is charming. Much, much later, as you recline triumphantly in bed, you give the room one last glance-over, admiring the austere beauty of its decor, and you marvel at your own good tastes. Now, here's the important part, so pay attention. As guests of the inn, you, unlike other customers, have the unique privilege of making a reservation for yourself at the dining room, so you get to breeze right by those other suckers on Yelp who have waited three hours for a table. You eat one of the most delicious brunches you can remember, even as a proud brunch junkie. You're admittedly very disappointed to learn that the restaurant has run out of duck egg hash--how? how?--but the crab meat and eggs benedict will suffice, especially when you wash it down with cup after cup of coffee spiked with Old Bardstown. When the bill comes, your jaw drops at the shock of how inexpensive the meal was. The Wu-Tang Clan once asked, "Can it really all be so simple?" At L&E, you'll find yourself asking, "Can it really all be so affordable?"
