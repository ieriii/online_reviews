Honestly I don't know why people absolutely rave about this place. It's mediocre at best. My Girlfriend and I ordered the buffalo chicken nachos for the both of us, they weren't terrible but weren't great. No melted cheese which is a must for nachos! but the tortilla chips were very good. The salad bar is a complete ripoff I could go to whole foods and get an amazing salad with things like chicken and bacon with out having to be charged extra for it and for half the price. The burger I had was okay but the bun was super soggy and the chips were very soggy as well. I think it's safe to say I won't be back.
