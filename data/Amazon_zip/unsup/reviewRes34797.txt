This is my favorite sushi place because I'm vegetarian and am rather picky about what I want in my sushi (i.e. I don't like cucumbers, etc). They have a good selection of veggie rolls for only $4 each which is great. I especially like the avocado rolls or the asparagus rolls. Also I adore their wasabi garlic mashed potatoes, they're delicious. As others have mentioned, this place being BYOB is great on the bill which I appreciate. There's a CVS right down the street that sells alcohol if you're looking for somewhere to grab something in the area. Finally, I will attest to the fact that they do indeed make their sushi on site, regardless of the fact that you can't see the back kitchen space. Also I've never seen any rolls looking like mayo pouring out of seaweed in the least bit.
