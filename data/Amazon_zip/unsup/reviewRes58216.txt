My husband and I ate there the other night with some work friends. We all agreed that this was perhaps one of the best meals of our lives. Pick whatever words you want: WOW, Incredible, amazing, earth moving, genius, YUM, best meal ever, food heaven!!!! I never knew that food could be this good. I am so excited to go back.Schwa is in my opinion the best restaurant in Chicago. If you are looking for flavors which compliment each other in surprising who would have thought of that. While a completely different dining experience than Alinea and Trotters, Schwa offers the best tasting experience of them all.We paid $115 per person for the 9 course meal. They brought out extras, so it was really like eating 11 courses. Each one was a complete home run!!!!!! It was worth every penny.This restaurant is totally quirky (the chefs are the wait staff, the food is the star, so ambiance takes a backseat to food.) and fun. It is very difficult to get a reservation, or to even reach someone to make a reservation. So plan ahead! It will most definitely be worth it in terms of being one of the most memorable meals you have ever had. Look, if these guys don't want to have a butt in each of their 26 seats twice each evening, then so be it. If that is what it takes for them to guarantee that they can execute these often incredibly complex (yet never fussy or pretentious) dishes, again, so be it. You must supply your own wines. They play loud rock music. You can see into the kitchen, and watch everyone work their magic. You should bring a gift for the kitchen staff. I am told that one of their favorites is a bottle of Jamison.
