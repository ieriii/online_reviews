Go back and read my other reviews. I now feel like a Grade A asshole. I should have re-reviewed a long time ago, but I've taken it for granted. I now eat here once every week or so. This place is phenomenal. Whether you're in the mood for light fresh veggie options, or greasy fake meats and cheesy cheese-like vegan goodness, the new chef, the new menu, all of the food I've tried is so so good. Both the Radical Reuben and the California Reuben are scrumptious. The Half-pipe is a gluttonous delight (and my boyfriend regularly eats the entire thing!). The Black Bean Burger, the greens and the mac and cheese make me happy! I sampled a new chocolate chip coconut walnut cookie that will be coming out that made me squirm with joy. And the service! Every single server is on top of his or her game; they are all knowledgable about the menu, friendly and efficient. I waited an hour for a table here the other day and left ecstatic. I want to give Chicago Diner 20 stars for those I have deducted in the past. This is a vegan mecca within Chicago and I'm so glad they've got their groove back.
