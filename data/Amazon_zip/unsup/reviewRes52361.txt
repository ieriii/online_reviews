Not true deep dish pizza. Very little cheese, VERY LITTLE.  Actually the crust is responsible for the majority of the pizza's thickness. But 35 bucks for 'interesting' crust doesn't cut it. In my estimation, pizza cheapskates with a cult suburban following.  But hey, gotta give these guys credit as they are great marketers with very few tables and a 'line' outside the place - routinely comprised of out of towners looking for great crust?
