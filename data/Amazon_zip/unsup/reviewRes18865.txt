Wait: 30 minutes (lunch time). Their system is relatively efficient and the staff are friendly which helps. Ordered the beef tongue torta and friend got some spicy noodle dish (which was way too spicy. And we're Asian...). Still, lots of flavor and was fun to eat. The best part was getting my churro and chocolate dipping sauce. 1 churro is not enough to finish that sauce so I got a 2nd churro so as to not waste my chocolate. Best decision ever.
