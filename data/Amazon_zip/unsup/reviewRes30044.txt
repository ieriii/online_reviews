I've been here more times than I can count. I've taken countless animal eaters here too and they've for the most part enjoyed their culinary experiences. Back in the day I reveled in faux food described as tasting like cow or chicken. For my junk food cravings, I happily turn to the Diner for awesomely huge sandwiches (the bread though leaves something to be desired -- dry and crumbly, I like me a toasty, soft bun ala Potbelly). Some faves include the rueben and the one with a million faux meats. Honestly the desserts are pretty evil (as in delish). Muffins, cakes, whathave you. Skip the breakfast with biscuits and gravy. awful biscuits. really guys? I've made better flakier ones at home. I've got to give props to the Diner since the cookbook (get it!) eased me into my vegetarian lifestyle years ago. The recipes aren't perfect but for someone who had zero ideas on how to use tofu, it made the transition smooth. still a sweet spot for vegans. glad you exist!
