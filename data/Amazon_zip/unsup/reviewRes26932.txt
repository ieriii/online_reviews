Been to Nuevo Leon on 18th St. many times and wouldn't mind going back. Food is just ok and it's BYOB. I think many people are being a bit too generous when rating this restaurant. I believe because it's a place that has been in the heart of the Latino community for a long time. But to be honest, there are many restaurants in Chicago that serve better food than NL. Last time I was there my meat was very chewy and the service was below average. The time before that, my sister found something in her soup. I'd rather not say because manufacturers also play a part in what's in these foods.
