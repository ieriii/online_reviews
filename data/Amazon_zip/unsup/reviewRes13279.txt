They do amazing things with beer. They usually have 8-10 house brewed beers at any given time plus a bunch of other beers on tap or bottled. If they only did liquor they would for sure get five stars. Their food is also good but not 5 star worthy. They just do upscale bar food, sort of a gastro pub thing. I had their burger which was tasty but for a place that crafts beers worthy of the gods, I was somewhat let down with their burger. I admit part of that was due to my high expectations. I will most likely try again in the future with an open and then update my review. P.S. They recently opened up the top floor which was originally reserved as a party space. It can still be booked for parties in advance but on a regular night there is now much more space in the bar.
