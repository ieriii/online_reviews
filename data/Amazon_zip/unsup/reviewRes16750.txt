I'd like to preface my review with saying we showed up at 6pm, right when they opened. We almost walked away when we couldn't find it (behind all that plain wood) but the guy working outside ushered us in. I really loved the dark, intimate and almost spooky atmosphere. The lighting and decor were very unique and I was entranced the whole time. Our server was very knowledgeable, and had good recommendations for us. In addition, the food was delicious and executed flawlessly. The prices are a little steep, and I wouldn't recommend coming here to order your usual. Take advantage of their rare spirits and ingenious house cocktails. I also might have had a worse time if it was packed and loud. If I lived in Chicago, I'd stop by the Violet Hour about once or twice a month. PS: The music is not what you would expect, but also not as well thought out or as inventive as the rest of the place.
