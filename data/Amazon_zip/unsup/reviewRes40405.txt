This is my favorite place to eat in chicago. Any chance that I get to eat here, I'm there. I know to go somewhat early since I'm not a fan of waiting 2 hours for dinner. Also, its open for lunch and although I like their dinners better, lunch is still pretty darn good. I love the food, drinks and the atmosphere. Ok, the food. L and E puts flavors together that just go" WOW" in you mouth. One time I was with a veg eater and they ordered the cauliflower dish. Yummy!  The next time, I had to have it. I ignored my carnivore self and dug in to this excellent meal. My favorites are goat sausage w/ black olive caramel, gulf prawns and grits, compressed melon and fig, burger, the cauliflower dish and for lunch the duck hash. The drinks. The bartenders here take their drinks seriously. I giggle when i see them shaking my cocktail and they are determined to make it excellent. And it is! For summer, i order the slow gin fizz that they make with egg whites. The atmosphere. Casual. It makes me happy. Give this place a try. If the wait scares you, then go early or late and you should be able to get in.
