WOW WOW WOW!!! is my palate in love, I flew out from SF on a whim when my girlfriends cousin was able to get reservations for this place. Thanks Miranda. I mean just spectacular and creative. I mean i sat down for 4 hours, and dish after dish was amazing, not a lot of food, just small and good. Not only was the food good but the way they presented it and the ideas behind it extravagant. Note to diners: is the wine pairing worth it? only if you want to spend 200 smackeroo's to make your mouth have more of an orgasm then it's already having. No thanks i'll just choose the 300 bottle of wine instead. All in all this is one of the best dining experiences i have EVER had, other was in Bordeaux, which is a bit different. So this is a must do for foodies, I have yet to try other top restaurants in the nation, will make my way to Per Se, and French Laundry sooner rather than later.
