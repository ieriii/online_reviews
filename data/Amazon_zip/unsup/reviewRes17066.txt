Another winner from Jerry Kleiner. This is my first thought when it comes to taking a large group out, especially boisterous out of towners you want to please. Large, loud, and grandeur really sums Carnivale up. The interior of this place is unmatched by any other restaurant. It starts out with a very large bar area outside the entrance where you can mingle over a mojito while you're waiting for your table. The dagger is entering into the theatre-like main dining room with its gigantic ceilings and wild bold color. The walls lining it are stocked with unreachable wine bottles, and large colorful lanterns hang down from the ceilings.    Oh, and the food. Fabulous Nuevo Latino cuisine; try a ceviche tasting sampler to start off; includes ahi tuna, fluke, and scallops. Try the arrachera (skirt steak) for your entree, or the borrego (wood-grilled lamb).    And don't forget to keep the drinks flowing. The reserve wine list is impressive. I'm also a weakling for a good rasberry mojito after dinner. Arrrrrrriba!
