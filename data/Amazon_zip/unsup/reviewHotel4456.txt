Beautiful and sophisticated hotel located center of Downtown. Great for couples, families, or anyone! Grand entrance doors and staff to provide good 'ol service. The rooms are very spacious. I was accommodated within a one king bed suite and the decor was beautiful: furnished with green, browns and other vibrant colors! Window looked out to Downtown, so it was cool. Has a restaurant in the lobby called 'Lockwood'. Check out my review for that restaurant: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ Also, great shopping accomodations including a friendly lady by the jewlery shop. Awesome discounts!
