Yolk is a welcome addition to the expanding south loop area. We got there early around 7:45am and beat the crowds because 30 minutes later there was a line out the door! They've got an extensive menu with several options. We enjoyed the 'Eggs Benedict Florentine' and the 'Santa Fe Fritatta' which was recommended by our server. Service wasn't too slow but we expected it seeing the growing crowd at the door. Overall, we enjoyed our breakfast and we'll definitely go back and try some of their other options on their menu. It's nice to have another brunch/breakfast nearby (the other is Bongo Room) to choose.
