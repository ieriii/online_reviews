OK, OK, the awning says Glenn's serves "the best food in the world." That's a stretch for sure since Ravenswood isn't exactly Paris or New York City, but you've got to give this place a try. I've been there once and it's really clean and cute inside, much like something you'd find in Wrigleyville or Lincoln Park. I ordered the Red Hots pancakes, which made me flash back to my childhood when I ate those little candies until my tongue ached. Did that really happen? I don't know, but I did smack my head on the iron railing of my bed once while roughhousing with my older brother. What does that have to do with flapjacks? Well, nothing, but the Red Hots pancakes were chewy, red and chock full of cinnamon domination, that's for damn sure. Yum! They also offered a Lemonheads version as a special, though I'm not sure if that's a regular occurrence or not. From what I recall, my dining buddy had an omelette and it was huge! Oh, if you have cereal in mind, you can eat as much as you want, choosing from the several boxes that adorn the wall behind the counter. I will definitely have to make a trip back for some Count Chocula.
