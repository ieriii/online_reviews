Overall, this is a good hotel with an awesome, transit-convenient location. My 3-day bus pass got plenty of use because of all the buses that stop near this hotel. We got a great deal on Hotwire for a 3 night stay, which is definitely the way to go. The major issue was the stupid fan/venting system that would not turn off! They had a digital thermostat in the room to control the temperature, but even if you turned it "off" the vent just keeping running. LOUDLY. As in, 2 of the 3 nights were miserable because there was no sleeping to be had. Yes, we should have asked the front desk, but the first night I had no idea it wouldn't turn off, the second night I was so exhausted that I just passed out, and the third night we asked the room service guy who said he could call engineering after unsuccessfully trying to turn that damn fan off. Sigh. But the room was clean, the bathroom was nice, and everyone we dealt with were super helpful. One weird thing: They have a little basket of snacks atop the minibar for sale, and mixed in with that, is an "Intimacy Kit." I don't know why, but I was a little creeped out by condoms/lube sitting in between snickers and doritos.
