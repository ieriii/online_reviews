Defintely a good dog, but not the cheapest for sure. So for those of you cheapskates, you might want to try somewhere else. I've been coming here since I was a kid, and its like going back to the 50s. You can have car side service listening to the oldies. Burgers, dogs, etc here. As has been pointed out, famous for the hotdog statues on the roof. Worth the price.
