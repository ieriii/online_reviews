Visited here on a Saturday night and was super excited about the food, given promising experiences at Curio with cocktails and other drinks. The goods: service (very friendly, prompt server), the ambiance (love the decor, love the layout of the restaurant) The not so goods: the food, (Bolognese pasta for me; white fish for my dinner mate) sadly, was disappointing. The Bolognese sauce was incredibly salty, as was the asparagus side. The white fish was standard - pan friend on both sides with a topping of raisins, pineapple, etc. I'd definitely come back for the cocktails, but not the food.
