I've been wanting to try Superdawg since they were featured on Diners Drive-in's and Dives. I ordered the original Superdawg w/fries. Overall quality and taste was very good. The fries were a bit overdone but still edible. A little pricey but not too bad. Cash only but they do have a surcharge free ATM!
