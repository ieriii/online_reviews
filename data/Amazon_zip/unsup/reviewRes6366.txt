I went here for my 26th birthday dinner and was less than impressed. To start with, our waiter was terrible!!! His personality was totally flat, and he had this awful lisp. I asked if they had Level vodka, and he said no, but I found it in a drink on the menu, so that was irritating. The appetizers were blah and my steak was WAY overcooked and I didn't have time to send it back. Luckily, my friends are nice and shared some of their steak with me, which was really good when grilled correctly. I will say that the flourless chocolate cake was excellent, but I won't say I'll be going back anytime soon.
