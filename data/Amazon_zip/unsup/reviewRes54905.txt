Do you guys know what a capacity is? Please do yourself a favor and keep it to your capacity. Your customers will have a better time and they may even get a chance to spend some money at your establishment. You pack the place way too tight! The bartenders are slower then dirt anyways. The guy i was with was standing at the bar for almost 15 minutes.....HE'S 6 FEET 5 INCHES!!!! How do you miss a guy that big? Here's a tip for your bartenders and management - serve everyone, not just your regulars and keep your business at it's capacity.If you worked as hard on getting good bartenders in there as you do on changing your beer list, you'd have a great place!
