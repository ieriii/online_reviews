Chicken, apple, and gouda sausage? Yum! Other favs of mine include: the cole slaw (I won't eat cole slaw at any other place because I generally hate it), mac 'n cheese, their corn biscuits, and the blackened chicken breast. Foodgasm!!! I've always had really friendly service here and I love, LOVE that they have red cream soda. I mean, how many places around Chicago offer the red cream soda? Why is it so neglected? Even grape soda...grape soda is highly neglected too, but even that is offered in more restaurants than red cream. I demand more restaurants offer red cream. Hmph.
