$3 Mimosa special? Yes, sir, two please! I really was just going to order food, but then there was a drink special. And they were yummy mimosas. I love when wine bars serve mimosas and bellinis... because they don't use the cheapest grossest champagne known to man. We were happy. I had blueberry pancakes, which were delish, nice and fluffy. My friend had an omelet and potatoes, which she also approved of. Service was decent, though not spectacular. And the place wasn't too crowded or small. I'll definitely go again.
