First fondue experience, might be the last. There are a million reviews on here, so I'm not going to detail sticking food in cheese/oil/chocolate but I think I would have liked more options to dip stuff into. The bread was either stale or just gross. I thought it was cool that they were conscious of people's dietary restrictions- they offer separate pots of oil if you wish. I don't eat meat, he does.  There was a table next to me that got a separate cheese pot because they had to bring their own gluten free bread.  And the strawberry mojito was tasty. I think Trader Joes has a better cheese fondue, and you get to pick the bread you put into it.
