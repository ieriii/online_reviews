Phenomenal food! Since I was in a pub-like restaurant I thought it would be appropriate to get the fish & chips and boy was that a good move. The breading was delicious (you could definitely taste the beer in the batter) and unique (fluffy yet crispy). The long, thin fries were seasoned to perfection. And the cole slaw was like no other - it definitely had a kick to it. My boyfriend had the Forest Burger which was cooked to perfect. Being a self-proclaimed burger connoisseur, he said it was one of the best he's had. Added bonus, it had a generous amount of Gorgonzola cheese, cremini mushroom, & crispy shallot toppings. Phenomenal beer! My boyfriend had the Bottom Up Belgian Wit - a wheat beer spiced with coriander and orange peel, which was so rich in flavor and refreshing. I had the Bloody Mary - it was very yummy and had a bit of a kick to it. Luckily we didn't encounter any wait. We must have gotten there right after their Sunday brunch rush.
