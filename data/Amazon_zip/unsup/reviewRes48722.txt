Maybe I was expecting too much. I went Easter Sunday for brunch, and yea, it was crowded. But, isn't it always? Plus, we did not have to wait as a walk in, so I can't imagine the crowd was more than usual. It was good, don't get me wrong. But, if they give you wine poached eggs and tell you to have the yolk run over the salad and prosciutto then it was a bummer that the eggs were cooked hard. They were cool enough to replace it, but then the toast was burnt. It was ok, but it would have been better if the food had been prepared properly. My friend got the duck hash and thought it was ok. Our bottle of water was empty for half of the meal. So, I could not really give it more than three stars. I'm sure it could be bettor on another day.
