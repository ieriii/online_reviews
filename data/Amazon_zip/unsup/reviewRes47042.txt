The food was great. The sweet potato fries (try them!!) as well as their regular fries are delicious. The food is nicely presented. The service was very good. The atmospher is relaxing and comfortable. And the reason I give this place 5 stars is the environmental leadership exhibited by the Uncommon Ground owners and all others interested in its operation. If not for the last thing I would give this a 4 star because of the expense but you do get what you pay for...
