I took my Fiance for her birthday and it was a lot of fun. It is dark and romantic and the live guitar was really nice. The food was fresh and the flavors were great. The cheese appetizer was great! The only complaint was that it was a little too dark. If I am cooking my own food I cant see if it is done if I cant see it. A timer would have been nice as well. But that aside, I really enjoyed the experience and would return for special occasions.
