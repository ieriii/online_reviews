This was the best pizza experience I have ever had (Seniore's in San Francisco is a close second). Although the wait is a bit long because they make your pizza to order, when it came out I could feel the floodgates open in my salivary gland. The wait for the pizza was roughly half an hour, so budget time if necessary. We ordered the famous special pizza and I will attempt to describe my thought process as best as possible. Pizza coming out: "Ooh this looks tasty. It's about 1 inch in thickness. Massive pizza." I was severly underwhelmed at Lou Malnati's so this looked promising. Waitress cutting the pizza: "Wow that is some stringy cheese. The tomato sauce layer on the top was sure decieving... there's an entire layer of cheese, sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc between the crust and the top!" Eating the pizza: "Oh my gawd this is some good stuff! I'm going to have to do double time at the gym to pay for all this." Finishing the pizza (two slices): "Would be perfect time for a nap right now. I am really full. This was a good Chicago experience, I am glad I came here. Probably wont be eating pizzas for a while though." Day after, back in CA: "I am craving some Giordanos..." Please see attached pictures for more detail. They give more credit to my descriptions.
