Went there for lunch with a group of coworkers. The food is absolutely delicious, tasty, and unique! For dessert we got the 2 flans, and I was a bit skeptical about the mojito flan but it was probably one of the most refreshing desserts I've ever had!The only reason it wasn't 5 stars was because the service was exceptionally slow... if the food wasn't so delicious we would have been very irate. I don't know if this is just a lunch problem. But it is still worth going to!
