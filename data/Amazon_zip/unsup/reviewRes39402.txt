The service really needs to improve. As anyone who has spent any time in Korea could tell you, Korean service is amazing. Korea is not like China, service is considered to be a necessary component of any meal, in this respect much closer to Japan. I lived there for two years and found that service in Korea was something to expected and to not receive good service is quite rare. Order three beers? The fourth one is most likely free. The attitude that the servers take here is not something that they brought over from the motherland. My advice is don't be shy about giving them a loud 'jeogi yo' when the ajummas drag eodeongi. It wouldn't be tolerated back in Korea.
