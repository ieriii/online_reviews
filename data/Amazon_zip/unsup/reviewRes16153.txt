I hate to admit it but I really really love the food at this place. Why do I hate to admit it? Because I typically turn my nose up at packed-out Italian places. It seems that places like this often get lazy in the kitchen. But not here. The atmosphere is great ... the wait - not so much. But the food is worth the wait. The wine selection seems pretty good to me but I'm no wine connoisseur. The pre-dinner bread is tasty and warm. And about every pasta on the menu is calorie-laden goodness. I haven't had anything here that wasn't delicious. The only negative is the long wait time and there is usually very little room in the bar so you end up having to wait outside or in cramped quarters in the bar with people constantly pushing past you. Highly recommend reservations here.
