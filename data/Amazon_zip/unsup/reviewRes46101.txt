Okay...my two cents for Grand Lux...(which I went to for lunch and dinner couple times a weeks for years now...) 1. It is NOT a specialty restaurant...it's...h,,,...mmm.....a fancy Cheesecake Factory. I guess if you are in low-income bracket (like a student or part-timer), it may be fancier than most....but it really is a dressed up CF, nothing more, nothing less. 2. This being said, I would recommend their pork chops and their creme brulee. CB takes 20 minutes or so to prepare, so let them know in advance. 3. It's great for quick eats/ ordinary meals between shopping on the Mile, but there are better and more special restaurants around.... Alright! Now that I said my negative comments...I will say that it is better than CF in many ways, the servers are super attentive and nice. The wait might be bit long on weekend prime hours. The valet parking is cheap and fast...and will give you even couple more hours to shop in the area and pick up your car after your meals! :D
