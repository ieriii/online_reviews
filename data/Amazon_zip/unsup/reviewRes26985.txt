The line out the door enticed us to stop in - we figured if it was that busy it had to be good. We only waited about 5 minutes to sit (just long enough for Dan to run next door and get some beer, since it is BYO). The guacamole was dissapointing - just plain avocado, but the refried beans were some of the best I have ever had. For $18 we got the guac appetizer, free chicken soup, chips and salsa, a plate of 3 huge mole enchiladas (though I wish the menu had said they contained onions, I hate onions) and 4 tasty pork tamales, both with rice and beans. Both entrees were very tasty and came out quickly. I can't get over the amount of food we got for such a low price. When I am back in Pilsen I will definately stop in again.
