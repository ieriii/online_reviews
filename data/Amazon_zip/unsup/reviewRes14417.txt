Gotta admit I failed to see the appeal of this place. I have no idea why it gets really packed. Luckily, due to various fests around the Chicagoland area this past weekend, it wasn't super packed and our group of 5 didn't have to wait too long for a table. While their brewed beer was average and I couldn't find anything wrong with it exactly (except for the lack of complexity in the taste notes), their food was the really disappointing part. I expect bacon fat popcorn to well, taste like bacon. It was regular popcorn topped with cheese and diced bacon. No melding of flavours; nothing unique. I shared a sausage pizza with my girlfriend; it was bland and boring. The sausage wasn't spiced well and the crust wasn't cooked enough. Husband had the ribeye which was slathered in some sort of sauce. While it wasn't "bad", we prefer near naked steaks. The odd part about the dish was the large side portion of some sort of pulled pork thing. Pork as a side to beef? Huh... I can't tell you what the other friends had, as I've forgotten 'cause they had no positive comments. Oh, and don't even get me started on the vile appearance of the ladies washroom. I won't post what things I had to report to our waiter on the status, but I can assure the gentlemen you might turn gay if I actually noted what some women do in there. The one redeeming quality of this place? They do have a large beer list outside of their own brews (which is REALLY strange for a brewery). Though, there are plenty of other places in Chicago with an as good or better beer list, with much better food, or no food at all (Map Room) and I will deifnitely be going to those establishments instead of Rev. p.s. there's no patio, so that's another reason to not go in the lovely Chicago summer.
