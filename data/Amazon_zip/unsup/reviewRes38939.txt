I live around the corner but even if I didn't, this would be my go-to for warm winter comfort food. Do not go here expecting contemporary atmosphere or cuisine, go here with an appreciation for nostalgia and huge portions. The only hipsters you'll find here are senior citizens with new hips, it is by no means a cool or trendy spot, but thats what you should love about it. We had a bit of a wait when we went on a Friday or Saturday night, but between the salad bar, bread and olive oil, a few glasses of wine and good conversation it was bearable and we didn't lose patience. Without a huff or comment from us, our waitress apologized for the wait time and came out with complimentary tiramisu at the end of our meal. For the price, you get a lot of food and at no expense to quality. The pizza is great, and I'm picky, but be specific about how like your pie and they can accommodate you (I like mine extra thin). I recommend this cozy joint when you're missing grandma and don't mind spending around $20 an entree here over a night out in the minimalist "see and be seen" spots.
