We went on a week long trip to Chicago with some family and the only must do on our list was Hot Doug's. We had seen it on travel channel or food network and it sounded amazing so we went. I did not read my GPS correctly so we ended up on a subway, walking, then a bus, then walking more. Two hours later we got to Hot Doug's, and as everyone else has said the line was out the door and down the block. The line only took about 20 minutes.... When we got in Doug was working the counter, and even with his line around the block he took time to give us advise on the menu, and chat with us about his experience to AZ (where we are from). We got four hot dogs, 2 regular Chicago style hot dogs, a fire dog, and a Cognac chicken sausage.... SO GOOD and a cheese fry. It was really a great experience and we can't wait to go back to Chicago so we can go to Hot Doug's.
