Nice early lunch at the Purple Pig on Monday - it was empty when we arrived at 11:30, but by the time we left, it was packed! It's awesome that they offer various sizes of wine pours, but we ended up ordering a bottle of prosecco. Veggie dishes turned out to be the stars - salt roasted beets with goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette were really solid, and the butternut squash with parmesan and pumpkin seeds was deliciously seasonal. The open-face fried egg BLT got rave reviews, as did the scallop spiedini. Neck bone gravy with ricotta was absolutely as rich and tasty as it sounds. My personal fave were the chicken thigh kebabs with fried potatoes and tzatziki - SO tender, with crispy skin. Service was fine, despite our waitress having very little personality. I would definitely go back - very cute place with yummy food!
