I've read the other reviews and understand about the service, but hey, you are in a local ethic neighborhood, get over it. The food is the star here (as it should be). Had the duck strips with pan fried egg noodles and they were the HIT of our table!! Even my husband (who doesn't like duck) liked it. It was even fabulous the next day warmed up!!  If you want good food with local atmosphere - eat here!!
