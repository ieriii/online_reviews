I hadn't been here in a while - in fact, not since they moved to this new location across the street from the old one! Then I saw the groupon offer, and remembered how good it always was - so I took a friend who hadn't been there before, on a Monday night. First, the drinks - excellent. We had some special fruity drinks, then I had a mojito - both were awesome. Then the food - the empanadas plate and then we both had combinaciones. All amazingly wonderful, perfectly cooked and spiced, just as good as I've had in the past. And last but not least, the service. I sometimes hesitate to buy groupons because I figure the restaurants probably get annoyed with the grouponites swarming in. Certainly not the case here. Our server was probably the best server I've had in a restaurant in a Chicago. Seriously. Super nice, genuine, explained everything, attentive - he was just awesome. And of course this was all before he saw how well we tipped him! :-) Really, can't say enough good things about Las Tablas - definitely worth it, groupon or no.
