The "fanciest" Indian restaurant I'd ever eaten at - I was highly impressed by the decor, buffet setup and food options. Mahi-mahi curry when I visited as well as lamb were notable items. I particularly liked the grilled vegetables as well. I actually do not like the tandoori chicken they bring to your table; They bring a fresh tandoori chicken on a sizzling platter to your table w/ your buffet orders. Unfortunately when I visited, I much preferred to eat off the buffet (particularly the mahi-mahi) and didn't feel like eating chicken - my stomach IS limited in space after all. I found it a great waste that the platter of chicken had to be taken back to the kitchen untouched (I hope SOMEBODY ate it - and not a customer). Of course they didn't let us take it home. Next time I visit I'll tell them not to bring the tandoori chicken. Fairly good service and an excellent atmosphere. Too bad they raised the price of the buffet some months back. I think I'll try Gaylord up in Schaumburg or Tiffen on Devon next.
