A different take on the Brazilian steakhouse theme as noted by other reviews. The outdoor bar on the second does indeed have a nice view and seems to be quite the gathering place. Overall, a lovely ambiance with respectable food. My issues are primarily service related. First, food. The harvest table is a more limited version of a salad bar than one would encounter at competitors. That said, the food is prepared in smaller quantities and is fresher than it would be sitting in a large bowl elsewhere. The soup was quite nice, and the mushrooms quite good. The side dishes are fine. The muffins brought to the table are different than you encounter at other similar places (cornbread like). The potatoes were quite good, and I heard the creamed spinach was nice. The meat selections are nicely seasoned and brought to the table by individuals dressed as chefs instead of in gaucho garb. So, service. Leaves quite a bit to be desired. Most of the meats made only one trip through the dining area, and there was little apparent effort on the part of the server to inquire about our welfare and the status of the meal. We were there as part of a larger group in a side room...but in such an advent one would expect more effort to be made in ensuring that guest are enjoying the meal and being served properly. We encountered, less effort. Overall: Go for the bar scene and a decent meal. Do not expect top-flight service. We will not return.
