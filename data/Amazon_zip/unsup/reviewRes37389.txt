Unibroue - Trois Pistoles? Maredsous Double Bock? Barabas? It can be difficult to choose a person with whom we've had a relationship and pick "the one." Each is unique and different in their own special way. The beer at Hopleaf? - it's the same way. None is better, nor worse, just different. I'm sure you know what I am talking about. CBJ Sandwich - Cashew Butter, fig Jam sandwich morbier cheese and with a side of mac & stilton cheese. Ahhhhh heavenly?!?!? Belgian style mussels? Hedonistic. Very cool, Sunday afternoon mixed crowd of women, men, diverse couples and singles? I enjoyed talking with you!  See you next Sunday afternoon!
