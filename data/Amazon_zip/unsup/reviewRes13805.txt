I ate here twice during the summer. For lunch I had the Chicago style veggie dog that was good but the bun was too dry. The beer was delicious (forgot which I ordered). I then went in for dinner a few weeks later and had a great dinner experience. We had a calamari appetizer that was delicious and then a veggie pizza and I requested the sauce to be the smoked marinara and it was so good! The place is usually busy so don't expect the best service. Our server was nice but not very chatty though I tried several times to have some convo she seemed to be in a hurry. Will def be back though.
