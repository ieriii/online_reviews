I'm shocked at myself for not coming here before. I went this past weekend with a bunch of girlfriends and we had a blast. Raspberry mojitos all around, mis amigas!! A couple of us decided to split some appetizers and it was perfect. We split the ropa viejas, the chicken empanada and mac and cheese. How can you say no to the mac and cheese??  We also got guacamole for the table, and I loved their chips. Overall, the place is great looking, the service was awesome and the food was good.  Plenty of seating, fantastic decor and they seem to have some live music on Sundays.  The only bad thing is, they didn't have our reservation for 9 people, but they were able to find us seating in a decent amount of time.
