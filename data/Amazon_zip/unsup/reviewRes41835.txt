Met up with a friend before heading over to show for a drink (or two...oh yeah and maybe some dessert) at Gilt Bar in the loop. Gilt Bar is beautiful. Upon arriving the place was packed, luckily we sat in the somewhat hidden downstairs area for some quiet one-on-one. Every detail was accounted for when they dressed this place up. Chandeliers, chesterfield couches, etc. The drink menu is wonderful. I ordered a gin cocktail and feel in love. Not too sweet and not too bitter, just right. Later on we ordered the toasted almond tart crme fraiche with mixed berries and honey syrup for dessert. Decadent. Lovely. Ah. The music was wonderful and I am told that they host live jazz nights. I must come back for some live jazz to try other cocktails and order off their food menu. That you can count on.
