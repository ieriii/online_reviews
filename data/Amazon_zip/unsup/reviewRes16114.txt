If you're looking for a lounge with smooth atmosphere AND cocktails, the Violet Hour is it. First of all, if you've been walking up Damen towards the five-way and wondered what was inside that building with all the posters on it, satisfy your curiosity and find the hidden doorknob on the wall and enter. Inside you'll find a smoke-free, cell phone-free, relaxed lounge where cocktails are treated with the consideration of an entree. Each drink is special, and if you're like me and love gin, this menu has a list of unique, flavorful drinks that you'll have a hard time choosing between. The chairs swallow you up and provide you with a place to rest your head, and the candles help create the elegant ambience that makes this lounge so fabulous. My only complaint is that they let their cd repeat while I was there. Quality for the Cost: 8 Service: 9
