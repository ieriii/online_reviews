This place was absolutely horrible. I went in as a celebration for a job promotion I got with some of my friends and the whole experience turned into a disaster. The food wasn't that great but most of all the service was bad bad bad! I found hair, that clearly did not belong to me and the waitress told me it was mine! My hair is pretty light and the hair I found in my plate was black! I should have not have to fight with my waitress with this kind of situation??! I eventually got a new plate (probably waited about 45 min!) but they seemed so annoyed about the whole thing. Definitely will never go back!
