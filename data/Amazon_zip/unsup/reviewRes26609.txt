Mercat was very highly recommended to me by a coworker and it lived up to its expectations. Between me and my husband, we had patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, spanish omelette, the short rib flatbread and the croquettes for dessert. Everything was great. The waiter swayed us into the croquettes for dessert and I was so glad he did because they were the best part of the meal. It is definitely worth going to this restaurant.
