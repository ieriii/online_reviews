Thanks Irazu, you are one of the few restuarants where I can take my vegan celiac boyfriend and he won't get all cranky. Give him a plate of tacos and a soy shake and he's fine. He doesn't even complain about greasy meat smells or the lack of actual vegetables in his food (you have plantains! And stuff we've never heard of!). You've added years to our relationship, as I become intolerable if not given a steady diet of tacos. Love, Alisha
