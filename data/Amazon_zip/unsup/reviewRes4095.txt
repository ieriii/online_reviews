michael carlson is a culinary genius. last night's dinner at schwa with two of our closest friends was probably the most enjoyable meal i've ever had. the food was pure perfection. there wasn't a single course that the four of us didn't love. we had a difficult time choosing our favorites and least favorites because everything was just so good. some highlights for us were (the descriptions are from memory so hopefully i'm not missing anything): chicken liver risotto with tallegio cheese, blackberry spread, yuzu honey gelee disc. raviolo with quail egg, truffle butter sauce and ricotta. potato bar soup with scallions, liquefied bacon, scallion pure, stretched cheddar and two crispy baked potato pieces with sour cream on the side. the entire experience was just amazing. and we vowed to attempt to come back at least once a year. all of that said, schwa isn't for everyone. like others have mentioned, you shouldn't come here if you intend to be pampered or if you demand a certain level of service. everyone there was so incredibly nice and friendly, but they aren't your typical michelin starred restaurant "servers". they're chefs that love their food and just want you to too. which is precisely what i loved about it. it was some of the best and most inventive food i've ever had, prepared and served by the people that made it. with no pretentiousness and with an amazing amount of heart.
