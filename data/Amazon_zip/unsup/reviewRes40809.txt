The pho here is incredible. I literally crave the broth, which has the depth and texture of the perfect blend of seasoning (strong star anise flavor). The prices are reasonable, the ingredients are of high quality and fresh. In particular, I really like the meatball and the tendon. After having had pho in several states / countries and all over Chicago, this is still the place that I look forward to returning each time. I almost always get the #7 (Vietnamese Spring Rolls) and the #40 (Pho with everything in it). The Banh Mi sandwiches are delicious as well (especially the marinated pork). There is often a wait and I wouldn't call the decor nice, but the food is consistent and I keep going back.
