My girlfriends and I headed to this restaurant by chance and couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate a girls' night out. We all chose to forgo the meat and stuck with the harvest menu which was delicious and plenty to eat. There were plenty of choices and the sauces were amazing. Our waiter and hosts/hostesses treated us like princesses. They were so attentive and upon hearing that one guest in our party was a vegetarian, they sent the chef out to walk her through the harvest area and show her what foods were made with chicken or fish products. We had so much fun that we ended up staying around for drinks afterwards. Great night!
