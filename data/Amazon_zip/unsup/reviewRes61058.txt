Went to Wishbone Friday morning for breakfast with my mom! The food was good. I had the blackened catfish breakfast. Mom had the crunchy french toast. Both were good, the hot chocolate was much bigger than I had imagined and good too. However, the service was a B-. Although it was not very busy the waitress seemed stressed. She refilled mom's coffee so fast she spilled some on her hand. The food was good, service was ok.
