The food is terrific but it's offset by the fact that the place is filthy. The women's bathroom is so untouchable (besides the fact that the toilets weren't flushing when I was there two nights ago) that one couldn't help but think what the kitchen must be like. Come one, people, how hard is it to keep your place clean? And if the Health Department hasn't been on your case by now, what good are they?
