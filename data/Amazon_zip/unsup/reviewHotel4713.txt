When I checked In initially, I was greeted with a warm and friendly welcome by David, the innkeeper and Virginia, one of the proprietors of the Old Chicago Inn. The room I was staying in with my boyfriend was 3A and it was a gorgeous room (I love the exposed brick wall.) The room was huge and well heated (We came in late February.) We were so close to SOOOOO much. We visited Wrigleyville which was really close about 3 or 4 blocks I believe, walked to boystown which is right down the block almost which is so much fun with all its shops and everything, and went to downtown Chicago on the Red Line. Which is so cool, cause the Inn is about half a block from it and its not noisy at all! Oh and David's homemade cakes for breakfast are delicious! I would definitely stay here again the next time I come to Chicago.
