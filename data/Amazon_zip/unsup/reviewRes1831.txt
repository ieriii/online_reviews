Going to Hot Doug's is like going to the amusement park; you wait in line for a really long time, but in the end it was all worth it. Like all the reviews, the line is super long. The food however is AMAZING and makes up for the long wait. The regular polish sausages and hot dogs are great, but definitely try their specialty dogs. The duck fries on Friday and Saturday are not to miss either. ;) Tip - Go here right when they open to avoid ridiculously long lines and going on weekdays also help. If the weekend is the only time you can venture out to Hot Dougs', then eat a snack before you go! Tip 2 - They take cash only, so make sure you have some on you!
