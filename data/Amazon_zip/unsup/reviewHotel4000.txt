I've stayed at the hotel multiple times with the most recent being April 7-8. We booked through http://Hotels.com and received a king size room with complimentary valet parking for $137 including taxes (valet parking alone is usually $52). I've also found great deals on Priceline in the past as well. We arrived early on Saturday morning since we were attending the Cubs game. We knew the rooms wouldn't be available, but checked in and left our luggage at the bell desk. We received a call an hour or so later informing us the rooms were ready. We stayed in the West Tower and had a beautiful room with a great view of Lake Michigan. The hotel is always crowded, but it's always been quick and friendly service. The bar is great with good drinks and food. We were checking out on Sunday morning, but wanted to take advantage of the beautiful day and bum around the city. We were told we could leave the car in valet parking until 6:00 which was great - most places will typically charge for another day if you keep the car past the check out time. The bell desk was very accommodating and even suggested we head down to the lower level and the parking attendants would bring the car around so we could preload and then park it until we were ready to leave so we could avoid the lines picking up our bags later. The hotel is centrally located - great restaurants, Millennium Park, Navy Pier and so much more in walking distance. We also discovered the water taxi stop across from the hotel and took advantage of the $4 ride back from Navy Pier.
