This place interior was nice ....it reminds me of when French invaded Vietnam for their greedy expansion. It's even funny to think about how they put their in their name to relive the history. Anyway....we went in their to have a Pho and it was just nasty. It had so few noodle it took me 3-4 bites to finish it. It was very Americanized pho which you can say similar to Taco at Tocobell. Pho itself was very salty and service we had was unbelievable discomforting....may be due to we ordered two pho in a very "supposely" a nice restaurant.  Waiter was acting like we had no money and we shouldn't be there.  Well....I learn my lesson to never go into place like that to eat cheap Pho. This place was simply pathetic for what it is. Nice interior though...
