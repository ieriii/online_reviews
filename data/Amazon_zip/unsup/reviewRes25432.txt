We go here often cause it's so close to where we live. My go- to dishes here are the spinach and feta artopita with potatoe salad. Nothing is too heavy here. The environment is one of the highlights. It has a cafe like feel with a more casual seating section and also seating alongside open walls to the outside when the weather is nice. It's a cute place, a kind of place where you pretend like you are still dating your husband or just to meet up with friends. Their pastries are the best and not so over-priced like many of the other fad dessert shops popping up in the city. My favorite are the almond cookies but nearly every pastry I've had here I've liked. There's a trade off though, the service is variable. At times we've had a really good server (singular), the other majority of times service is slow (perhaps they are understaffed overall?). Nevertheless, I really like this place.
