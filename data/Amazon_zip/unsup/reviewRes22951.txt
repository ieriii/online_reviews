Chinatown is mad intimidating when it comes to food... A friend asked me to dinner at his favorite Chinese restaurant and happily accepted - Lau Sze Chuan it was. Greasy? No. Everything fried? Nope. Lots of concealing sauce? Nada. Unpleasant wait staff? uh uh. Tacky atmosphere? Naw. I really enjoyed my food and dining experience. The server was friendly and efficient, the food was full of flavor, fresh, and tasty, the atmosphere was pleasant. All in all, I was really impressed and look forward to returning in the future.
