My husband and I enjoyed our stay here in February, 2010. What a great value. Recently remodeled, our room was more like a suite with refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and sofa. We had a large window overlooking Franklin street with extensive desk/counter space. Beautiful decor, large bathroom, and very quiet (very important feature for us). The staff was friendly and helpful. Parking is convenient and reasonable (for Chicago). A delicious full breakfast buffet was included in our room price. I was disappointed in the size of the pool and hot tub, but we had only limited time to use it. I will definitely stay here again in the future.
