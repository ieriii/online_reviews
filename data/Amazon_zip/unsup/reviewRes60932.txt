The Chef's Tasting Menu was a delightful surprise and a great variety of food and wine. I thought that the service was exceptional, friendly and knowledgeable. It was fast for a four course meal but not rushed in any way. The atmosphere was very enjoyable and relaxed. We're still smiling about the presentation of the food and the unique entree creations. We'll go there again! Nice place for a date.
