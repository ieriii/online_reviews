I love this place. I've been here a few times and it is an adventure. The food is amazing and they are ok that I will only eat seafood but my guests like everything. The staff is always kind and helpful and you can bring more than one bottle of wine to course it out. My only gripe is that they do repeat themselves. I've been when it was warm enough to eat outside and I've been in wintertime. There were 2 repeats. The scallop which is welcomed. I love that bite. But each time I've been there, and its more than 2 times, they served the same dessert. While it is yummy I want them to be more creative. Each time, and maybe it was a coincidence but I don't think so. It was the egg sandwich that was made from caramel and custard and blueberry bread. I can see from the more recent reviews that they're doing something with chocolate now which is probably amazing. If I'm gonna eat dessert I kind of want it to be chocolate. I will return. Its worth the price with or without a groupon.
