This is a tough one. My food was delicious, but I left with major questions about the restaurant. For background: we were a party of 7, celebrating 2 birthdays. One person in our party was vegan - not a big deal - she's used to eating out and she doesn't mind what anyone else at the table eats.  Food was tasty. We got a bunch of appetizers, including saganaki (how can you go wrong??), tiramosalata, tzatziki, garlic potatoes and beets. I didn't try the beets but the rest were delicious. For my entree, I did a "make your own combination" with 2 half orders - dolmades and spanikopitira. Both were delicious. Service was spotty at best. They couldn't get much right. Brought thigns we didn't order and didn't bring things we did order. The vegan in our party was told by the server that nothing on the menu could be altered or modified at all (seriously, they can't just leave a sauce off a dish??) so she ended up eating veggie sides for dinner, which was ok but also a bit ridiculous. Also, while the food came out quickly, the waiters were slow to do anythign else.  And that's where my question lies: food came out very quickly, almost too quickly. And dishes that can't be modified even just to take off the sauce?? Sounds to me like pre-made meals sitting under a hot lamp waiting to be served. Maybe they're just really that fast, but I doubt it. And that knocks them down in my book. Way better places to go that actually make your food fresh. Especially for the price.
