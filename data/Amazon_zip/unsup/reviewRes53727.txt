I check the specials on the web even when I'm out of town and have no way of getting there. I recommend getting the Game of the Week (even if it is an alligator sausage or rattlesnake or anything you've never heard of) and a second sausage. I also recommend getting the fries to split with your friends (even though they are outstanding, freshly made, and great when dipped in cheese).Be prepared to wait 45 minutes in line on a Saturday. Check the website if you plan to go - he closes, randomly, just because.If you don't like this place, I don't like you.
