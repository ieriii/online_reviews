Because of the proximity to Twisted Scissors, this is a great place for lunch/dinner after a cut. I had the avena (oatmeal) shake, and Bistec Tico. She had the Milanesa, and a side of the deep fried yucca with garlic. Everything was superb and was really too much to eat, we had many left overs. We wanted to try the empanadas but that will have to wait until next time. What a beautiful day to sit outdoors and eat! The only downside is their cash-only policy; we have gotten out of the habit of carrying around much cash, but we lucked out today.
