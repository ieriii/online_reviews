This is one of my favorite places ever! The food is delicious and their variety of wine is fantastic. I think at this point i can say I've had everything on the menu and i have not been disappointed. The service is good, and the ambiance is nice. The cacio e pepi is to die for! I definitely don't mind the wait to get a table, i know it's worth it!
