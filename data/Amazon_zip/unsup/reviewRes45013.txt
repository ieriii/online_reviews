I am a HUGE pizza lover. If I could I would make all my favorite dishes into a type of pizza. My friends and I stumbled upon Giordano's when we took a road trip to Chicago. We heard about Chicago pizza, but didn't know what to expect let alone from this restaurant. We ordered the deep dish and it was really tasty. I did think it had a little too much tomato sauce, but I still finished a slice and helped myself to another. How could a pizza lover resist another slice?! We also ordered their mozzarella sticks and calamari for appetizer. Those were good as well. Perhaps I was just hungry, but their mozzarella sticks were extra good and extra cheesy. Our server was also very sweet, which made our experience awesome. I came here with not many expectations and I was not disappointed. I must admit though it did take us a while to get our food. But I would definitely come back here if I visited Chicago again.
