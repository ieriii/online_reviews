Definitely a destination spot. Low key vibe with attentive, smart service. I couldn't decide between the trout and the ravioli so the waiter suggested a 1/2 order of the ravioli for the table and trout as an entree. Great choice. Also had cannellini beans, roasted beets and fregola as appetizers. All were excellent. My friends had the whole fish special which they filet so you don't have to do it yourself, although they still found a few bones in it. Total tab for 3 w/ 3 drinks was approx $132 before tax and tip
