I've been to VH 5 or 6 times and there is a lot to like and dislike about it. Dislikes: It is really, really expensive. There is an obnoxiously long line. (On purpose. There are open tables.) It is a bit pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious. Very popular with the Crimson Lounge dirtball/ slimeball crew. Likes: The drinks are awesome. Very unique, well crafted, great ingredients. The decor is interesting and unique. VH definitely provides something different from most bars. If you're looking just to go get a good drink and hang out, I would skip Violet Hour. If you want to show some friends from out of town a cool spot try it out.
