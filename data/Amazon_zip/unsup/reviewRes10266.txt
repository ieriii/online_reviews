OMGEEEEEE, I LOVE this place! It's so sad that my favorite pizza place is 1,000s of miles away from me! However, when I go visit my best friend Brad who lives there, we always have to go there! First, let's start with the outside. Huge glass window allows you to see what's going on inside...& beckons you to go in & have fun! The adorable logo atop the building...so cute! And...the pizza. YUUUUM. Thin crust - my favorite! Plus, so many offerings of toppings, you can't go wrong. And for the drinkers...custom brewery, so you'll definitely find a beer to your liking. And you can buy a "growler", a huge glass jug with their logo on it. : ) They offer delivery service too. Place is pretty big, but trust, it stays packed. You WILL NOT be disappointed by Piece!
