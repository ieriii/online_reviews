Geez, how did I forget to review this place??? Wilde is, hands down, my favourite Irish pub in the city. Hands. Down.  First, the decor is simply amazing. Rich, warm woods, tiffany-style domes in the ceilings, not one but two bars and the library area with the fireplace just send me over the moon. Even the bathroom is gorgeous - true story! Seriously, with ambiance like that, the food could be so-so and I'd still be happy. Fortunately, there's no need for concern because Wilde dishes up outstanding Irish fare! A few of the best meals we've had: Shepherd's Pie Blue on Blue Burger Veggie Omelet (with Irish cheddar... sharp! yum!) Mac-n-Cheese (again, that Irish cheddar!) Whenever we have burgers, we order the curry - it's kind of cute how they call it "Irish curry" when curry sauce is a staple in the majority of residential pantries around the entire UK and Ireland... one of our servers told us it was made from scratch in the kitchen but I'd bet my bottom dollar it's Bisto! No worries, though; as it so happens, I love the stuff (ahhh, Bisto!) I understand some folks have had inconsistent service at Wilde; however, that has definitely not been my experience. Our servers and the rest of the staff have always been so nice and helpful whenever we've stopped in. In fact, the last time, one of my dining partners had just arrived from out of state and was lugging her suitcase with her. The management offered to store her bags in their office until we were done - we took them up on the offer and enjoyed a relaxing, unsquished lunch! Can't say it enough. I love this place. A lot.
