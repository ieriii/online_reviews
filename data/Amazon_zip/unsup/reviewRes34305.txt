You'd think a place named Yolk could do eggs right for brunch? Wouldn't you? There are a billion egg options, but the two my friend and I got (plain ol' scrambled and one of the scramblers) both were mediocre. The former was bland and the latter mushy and runny. The decor is actually lovely and bright and open... But I doubt if I'd make a trip down here just for this place.
