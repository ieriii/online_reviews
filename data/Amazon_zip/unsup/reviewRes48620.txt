I dined with Pip G. so you may have already read his well-deserved rant about the seafood chef stationed closer to the front of the house. Chefs should always be aware of their actions in the kitchen, but If you choose to have an open kitchen, the chefs should be hyper-aware. Nobody wants to see a stranger double-dip spoons in your food. Some things once seen cannot be unseen. Fortunately for me, I was seated at the head of their communal table, so my view was not at the kitchen but instead down the length of their dining room. I dined with blissful ignorance and was happy that we had not ordered any seafood. If I can focus on the other parts of our experience, I am a very happy camper. Spicy crispy pork skins and a tasty lambic (on draft) was a good way to start as we waited for our table. The pork belly, sweetbreads and beet salad were extremely flavorful. Our server was very helpful, recommending a good bottle of wine (2007 Banegas Sangiovese, organic, very old vines) that went well with everything. Five stars for the tasty food I experienced. One star for visible kitchen faux pas. I didn't drop dead from contamination, so I'm willing to meet halfway and go with three stars... but please inform the chef, "Miss Thing, we can see you!"
