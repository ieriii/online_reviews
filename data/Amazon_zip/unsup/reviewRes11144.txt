Pizza is okay, but if you're not going for the beer, I'd stay home. I came here for a work lunch and the overwhelming stale beer smell wasn't super appetizing. Still, we ordered three different pizzas and sodas since we were with the boss and she isn't the drinking during the day type. The mashed potato and bacon pizza was good, but maybe I'm spoiled since my friend already gave me the most amazing mashed potato and bacon pizza recipe. Piece's was good, but kind of one note and the crust didn't add anything to the pie. Not a lot of flavor. We also had a spinach, goat cheese and tomato pizza that was good, but again, not great. I've heard it's super crowded at night for the live band karaoke and due to my aversion to being pushed, prodded and spilled on all night, I'm not sure I'll make it there. Still, I'd like to go try the beer at dinner some night and maybe be able to bump up the rating a star or two.
