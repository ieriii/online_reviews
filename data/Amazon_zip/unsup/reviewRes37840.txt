LOVED the deep dish style pizza!! When we crave deep dish pizza, we usually go to Pizza Uno....but thought lets try Giordano's since I had heard its one of Chicago's best.... and I agree, it is definitely GOOD! Filled with mozzarella and decent amount of toppings. I can't really compare it to the other deep dish I tried, since they are different. Giordano's gives you less crust, lots more mozzarella, and not as much toppings are Uno. Portion sizes are well worth the prices. We also ordered an appetizer the platter of Mozzarella sticks, Mushrooms and Zucchini - and it was a portion for 4-5 people! Well portioned for the price. Service was decent, nothing bad, nothing too exciting. All staff were friendly. Only one complaint - is they don't let you change any toppings on the pizza, lets say you want to switch one for another, so that was kinda hitler-ish, from the lady's tone of voice, at the waiting area which took the pizza order while we waited 45 mins to be seated. Other than her and not being able to change that one topping, all was excellent! PS: After trying it, still not a fan of broccoli in my pizza :p
