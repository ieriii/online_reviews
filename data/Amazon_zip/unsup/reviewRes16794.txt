Delicious food, nice knowledgeable wait staff and a good experience at lunch time. I was working, meeting an employee nearby when we broke for lunch. I wanted to try Carnivale since it was right there before us. Even when its location is out of the way for me, the reason for the missing star, on a noisy road through town, we sat out on the deck for lunch during a nice day of sunshine with a gentle breeze. It was a great time. One of the few summer days this year I thoroughly was able to enjoy! The food was fantastic. It was a good value for quality dishes. The drinks were perfectly prepared. I chose from exotic flavors from among the mainstays. I left thinking of a return visit. I'll be going again. Maybe it's a good place to party like it's 1999 too.
