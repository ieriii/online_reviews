A little pricey but always delicious. If I lived closer my budget would be blown by all the wonderful treats inside this store. I often grab some food here before hitting the park for a nice picnic! Amazing cheese selection that just makes my mouth water if I could handle all that dairy. F&O always makes me smile. :D
