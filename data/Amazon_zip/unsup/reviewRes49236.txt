I recently went to Alliance to order some cupcakes for my sisters birthday party. I went a couple days before hand because I was going to be out of town and made my order. I was very specific on what I wanted and the woman behind the counter was rather rude as I made my order, but I stayed polite and paid for my order making sure that it would be ready a few days later in order for the party. She assured me multiple times that they would be ready. So, the day of the pickup I got a phone call from my sister saying that they had no record of an order and she was not able to pick up the cupcakes for her birthday party. I would not have written a review if I thought it was a one time thing but right after this I heard a story of a cake being ordered and not delivered as it had been promised for an anniversary.  I would not count on Alliance to cater any thing for a special occasion that is for sure!
