I picked up comp tickets from Goldstar for the new show previewing at the Chicago Center for the Performing Arts - Green Street Theater --Passing Strange. Piccolo Sogno was close by and we decided to check it out. The outdoor seating was great. The parking was easy (pay the city meters your $6 or pay the valet lot at the restaurant). The food was good classic Italian. I had their version of seafood cioppino and it was very nice. They have a really nice list of wines by the glass. I was a little underwhelmed by the food.  As good as Maggianos.
