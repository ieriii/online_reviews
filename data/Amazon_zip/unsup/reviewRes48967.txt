I really like this West Loop bar/restaurant. When I first walk in, the openess and the long benches really visually appeal to me. Their service is prompt and very friendly, and they take pride to give great recommendations. I had the red-wine eggs benedict and maple cured bacon. The red-wine eggs benedict is definitely unique. The eggs are cooked just right, which is not too running and not too over cooked. The infusion of red wine brings a slightly tard taste to the dish, which adds texture to the already flavorful eggs ben. The maple cured bacon is awesome! If you like Clinton Street Bakery Co. in NYC, you would definitely love this one! It's sweet and juicy. Love it! Will definitely go back there again!
