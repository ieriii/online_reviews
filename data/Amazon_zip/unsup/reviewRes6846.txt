Usually I'm a sour cream and cheddar gal, but the freebie BBQ chips that came before the meal had me sold on Chicago q with the first bite... I went with the smoked half chicken, and it was no spring chicken. This was the mother hen of all chicken, as in, the portion was huge.  I barely ate a fourth of the entree. The taste was as described: smoky. The chicken came with some nice dipping sauces which were quickly described for us.  As a side I had house cut fries which were also very good. My partner in crime had the ribs and corn bread- the ribs were devoured and the corn bread was nibbled: it was a little on the dry side. I also had a ginger fizz, which for the $11 price tag was a steal. It was quite literally intoxicating. Another nice touch was dark linen napkins for the ladies at our table. We were both wearing dark dresses, and the napkins helped minimize lint on our going out wear.  Overall, a good dinner, and I'll be certain to be back for some of those ribs this winter.
