Been back twice since my first review. Solid and still ambitious. Excellent staff and whiskey list. Still cant bring myself to try the duck balls though, and haven't been able to talk any of my table mates into doing so.  That minor grievance aside, L&E continues to stand as a place you should take your friends and daring parents to.
