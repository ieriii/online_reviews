Visiting from LA. Love to eat out. Have been to a lot of great restaurants around the US and Asia. First time in Chicago. Ate at Purple Pig last night. Party of 6. Waited about an hour to get in. Had cocktails outside while waiting. Crowded and noisy, but in a good way. Tapas-style menu with lots of exotic ingredients: pig tail, pig cheeks, pig ears. The seasoning and flavors were unbelievable! Every bite of every dish was excellent. I'm in my 50s and have eaten around the world and I think this is the best food I've ever eaten. Every dish was perfection. Desserts were unbelievable. I pray that the Owner expands to Los Angeles. I cannot imagine how anyone could give this less than 5 stars. To me, price was more like $$ rather than $$$.  If you like food and are open to trying different kinds of food, you will be blown away by the magical way is place mixes flavors. I loved Chicago. It's a beautiful and clean city. And this place is heaven. I'll be back to Chi town for sure, if just to eat here!
