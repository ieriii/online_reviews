Great food! This is where you need to go if you want some hearty, homemade Cuban soul food. The la ropa vieja sandwich is good...they toast the bread so it's crispy and it complements the juiciness of the stewed meat inside. The maduros (plaintains) are a must have because fried banana is always good. The sandwiches are served with plaintain chips which are also good and are around $6. The place is BYOB, which is cool. Dinner plates are $12+, but they come with homemade sides. Also, order the espresso drinks like the cortadito...the espresso is slightly sweetened and delicious! Also, they have a Sunday brunch buffet every week.
