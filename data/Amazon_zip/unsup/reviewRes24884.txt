I had so much fun today at Mercat. We were a part of a group of ten. We made plans for this day a month in advance. The bottomless Sangria's, Mimosa, and Bloody Mary bar had a big smile on my face. All of the food we tried was fantastic. The service was slow at first but picked up after the first hour of our time there, but again, it was super busy when we got there. The staff was very very friendly which made me feel comfortable. The food: the suckling pig was delicious but I was sad when it ran out. It was towards the end of of brunch service so it was understandable. The biscuits and gravy were delectable (and I don't really care for biscuits and gravy most of the time). The Eggs Benedict were off the chain. I can't wait to make plans to go back next month. It's a great atmosphere and great for birthdays and special occasions.
