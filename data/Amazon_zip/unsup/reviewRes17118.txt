stopped by for a drink late saturday night. at first, my girlfriends and i (plus the cabbie) couldn't find the place! there's no sign, no windows, just a random, wooden, rectangular building with a door all the way to the side. a short 10 minute wait while they found us a table, then we were on our way. once inside, the decor and feel of the place is just...wow. Tall secluded booths, velvet curtains, bartenders with shirt garters...very Great Gatsby. They specialize in old fashioned cocktails ($11 each) categorized by liquor. I had a whiskey smash which was great, though a bit too sugary. My girlfriends both enjoyed their drinks too (both tequila cocktails) A random cute touch were the special giant ice cubes, 1 pure cocktail, specific to each type of tumbler. Great place for a small group to chill, not necessarily good for pick-ups or large groups (the booths and seating made it very intrusive and odd if someone were to randomly approach you)
