Still the best darn pizza in Chicago. I visit every time I am in town. The deep dish is the way to go and make sure you pre-order by phone it will save you a 40 minute wait. Giordano's has done an excellent job of keeping the taste, service and quality as they have grown I first visited in the 80's and did the Rush street location almost weekly in college. They still have the goods!!!
