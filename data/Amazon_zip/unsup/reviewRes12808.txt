It's hard to judge Chicago's Brazilian BBQ joints based on the meats cause they're all pretty decent, but the salad bar is definitely more robust here compared to Fogo, Brazzaz, and ZED451 (my girlfriend doesn't eat beef, so she actually eats the salad bars). The sangria was great, the servers were awesome (but would ask you what your favorite meat was every 5 minutes), and the acrobat person was cool too. The place is huge, and on the night I went the whole second level was empty -- which makes for good walking when you're in between eating rounds. The decor looks kind of cheesy from the outside, but it's really nice inside. And an added bonus: the meat option was $45, so you save $5-10 compared to the other places (based on my hazy memory). Conclusion: Better than Fogo, Brazzaz, and ZED451. And they've occasionally got these 50% off deals...
