Had never heard of this place, but was invited for a birthday dinner. What fun! A great cuisine change for me - and while you can get sweet or savory, I made myself get savory since my only crepe go-to, to-date has been bananas and nutella.  I got the Icocium Crepe because it had a ton of things in it that I like: roasted peppers, fresh basil, goat cheese, caramelized onion, fresh roma tomatoes, pine nuts, roasted garlic and baby spinach. Good!  Service was just okay - but we were a large group, to be fair. Also - BYOB!
