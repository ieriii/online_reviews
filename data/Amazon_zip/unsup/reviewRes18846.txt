I had been waiting to see what happened with this locationally fantastic space for quiet some time. Well, Bad Apple, you have definitely cast a level 5 charm spell on me. A couple friends and myself ventured over to the spot to check out their supposed gigantic beer list. It definitely delivered, offering around 12 tap selections of delicious craft beers and a rather extensive bottle list. The well thought-out beer list offers up an array of American micro and foreign selections as a well as a very nice selection of ciders, which you simply just don't see enough of this day in age. The menu basically consists of burgers, fries, and sandwiches, all of which looked great. My steak frites burger was extremely well executed, the burger being perfectly cooked. The meat was like butter, with a high fat content, it melted in your mouth. The fries, albeit a little cool, were still crisp and delicious. The "beer-naise"...unstoppable. I'd like to lather it on anything and everything. The cons? The poutine was a measly portion for $9! Come on, Bad Apple?! Haven't you been to Montreal? It's sacrilegious to serve a plate of poutine that small...if it's not practically tumbling off your plate with the weight of the gravy testing the architectural crispness of the fries...it ain't worth $9. Make a real poutine and the people will come. As well, I'd like to see the addition of a firkin/beer engine so they can serve cask ales....it wouldn't hurt them to put a few more barrel aged beers on their bottle list...all in good time. Oh yeah, pinball and foosball? Kick ass! The back game room is a place I hope to spend many hours in the near future. Well done, Bad Apple. You're off to a great start and I look forward to patronizing you in the future.
