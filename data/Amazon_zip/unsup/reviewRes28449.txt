Dropped by for a quick pizza before a movie later (Webster Place is right across the street). Didn't have time for a deep dish (will get one eventually), but the pepperoni thin crust was delish! Not greasy, perfect cheese and crust combination. Couldn't ask for more. Wait staff was super prompt too. Kudos.
