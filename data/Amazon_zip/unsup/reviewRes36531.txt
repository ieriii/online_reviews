The food was good but the service really left me unhappy.  We walked around 12:30 for a late breakfast (brunch?) on a Wednesday. It was moderately busy, but there was no wait, no line, and no sign of anyone coming in. We paused at the door for a while to look over the chalkboard with the daily specials and when we looked up, the hostess rudely asked "So do you want to sit or what". No "Hi," no "Good Day", just an impatient 'can I seat you now, you're taking too much of my time'. That really set the tone for a bad experience.  We both ordered the french toast and juice blends. Between the two of us, we ordered the stuffed strawberry and mixed berry french toast, both of which came with a ton of delicious fresh fruit. My only complaint with the stuffed strawberry was that there could have been more strawberry stuffed between the toast, and less mascarpone (cream cheese). The fruit juice came out at room temperature, which didn't bother me too much-it made it seem as though the fruit wasn't the frozen variety. Both were very good, but I wouldn't say amazing.  Overall, I'd come back for the food, definitely NOT the service, but I'd probably try something else on the menu.
