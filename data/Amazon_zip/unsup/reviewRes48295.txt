Gave this place another shot for brunch. Made a reservation so no wait. Decent Bloody Mary's. Publican bacon was amazing. I could have eaten 2 orders(and then dropped dead). I opted for the Maple-Glazed Pork Shoulder that was OK. The egg on it was over cooked and the polenta that came with it was like prison grits. The wife had the duck confit hash which was very bland. And for $16 an entree throw in some toast or something. I was still very hungry at the end of the meal. All-in-all, not a $57 brunch. 2.5 starts again!
