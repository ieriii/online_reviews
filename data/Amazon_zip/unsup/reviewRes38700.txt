I was in Chicago on holiday in early January and my boyfriend and I decided to stop by Giordano's for lunch on a Saturday. We had read that it was touristy and crowded but we managed to get a seat easily. And despite its reputation for catering for tourists (hey, us visiting folks deserve good food too!), we'd heard good things (on Yelp!) and decided to give it a shot. My bf's pizza was all crust. Yes, it was flakey and buttery tasting but it was sorely lacking in cheese and ingredients. My shrimp fettuccini torino was decent once I'd salted it thoroughly. The sodas are huge though, and the service good. I would not come back to Giordano's in the future, and have plenty of Lous at Lou Malnati's instead.
