The place is average at best. I went on a Friday night, it was busy, so I expected sub par service. My friend and I ordered a drink at the bar, bartender told us they were out. My friend asked a server who was standing by us at the bar and she rudely replied "i'm busy, ask someone else". It might not sound rude, but the Amy Winehouse look alike should work on her attitude. Needless to say we left and went to Hamburger Mary's.
