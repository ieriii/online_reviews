*LOVE* My husband and I thought that heading over to Longman and Eagle at 6PM on a *Monday* would surely get us a table for 4. We got there, asked the maitre d' how long the wait would be, and she responded, "just about 2.5 hours". Unfortunately, because we had guests in town, we decided that it'd make most sense to find another place to dine. For the 30 seconds that I was there, I glanced at the dishes and the bumbling crowds and knew I had to go back. The following evening, we learned our lesson from the night before and left our home at 4:30PM to get there before the dinner rush. We found parking right away and got right to a table immediately - the last open table, in fact. Each plate we ordered was absolutely delicious - one of our highlights was the Roasted Marrow Bones. We literally discussed ordering them as if we were going to go sky diving. SO happy that we 'took the leap' - it was absolutely delicious. Together, my husband and I also ordered the Meatballs & Creamy Polenta, House Marinated Olives, Roasted Chicken and the Pork Belly. The service was also amazing. Highly recommended! Some advice: Go early, be brave and try something new.
