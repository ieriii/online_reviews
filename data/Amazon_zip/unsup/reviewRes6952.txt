Cozy little Italian place in Lincoln Park! Monday nights they do family style eating... for $20/person (no minimum or maximum amount of people) you get 2 apps, 3 entrees, 1 dessert... A STEAL! I've been here for Monday night and on a normal evening and both experiences were great! The lobster ravioli is to die for. I don't even like seafood but that sauce is a little slice of heaven! Good tiramisu and really good panna cotta! If you like good Italian food, come here!
