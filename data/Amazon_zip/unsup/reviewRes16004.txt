I was impressed with the decor of this place. The carnivale theme is very festive and the place is perfectly lit with large, colorful lanterns. The food was pretty good. We started with the ceviche which was delicious! I had the carne asada for my entree and it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. My co-worker ordered the chop salad and it was pretty bad. It wasn't truly chopped and had nothing interesting about it at all. She was pretty disappointed with her meal. My favorite part of the meal was dessert. The special was a concord grape and goat cheese cheesecake. WOW..... it was the most exciting dessert I have had in a loooong time!
