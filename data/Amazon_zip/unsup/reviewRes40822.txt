if i could, i would give this place ten stars. i've noticed that come any night past 12:30, i find myself immediately urging my friends to get burritos, and not ANY OTHER burrito, but... LET'S GO TO LA PASADITA. i probably get annoying, and in fact i know i do. but it's my persistence that ultimately drives my friends to the area and they get to experience the wonderful onion, cilantro, peppers oh my god this review is making me hungry. a lot of my friends absolutely fall in love with their burritos here, as do i. only one of my friends didn't care for this place much, but she's more of a pizza and rice on calamari kind of girl, anyways. i'm digressing. go to la pasadita. there's three of them on one block: the burrito triangle. always shoot for the small yellow one on the north side of ashland first. all the burritos SHOULD taste the same because they're all the same restaurant- but ive noticed (because i've eaten here well over 100 times) that the proportions are perfect in the yellow one. i usually take my burrito, then, across the street and eat there, because- wait for it- it has seating. i'm so excited for you! go! you're going to be so satisfied.
