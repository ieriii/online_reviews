If I could give Sultan's Market 6 stars, I would. This is probably my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. I actually make excuses to come to the city just so I can go to Sultan's Market. They have the absolute best falafel I have ever had, and the lentil soup is way up there too. I'm actually drooling writing this review. Expect long lines, but its way worth it. I remember when this place was virtually unknown, and the falafel was a couple bucks cheaper. So many great reviews have made is busier, but I will deal with the crowds to get my fix. At least I know its not going anywhere!
