Nice, clean, and upscale. Neat decor, very old school, lots of fancy wood trim. I booked a group of my employees in there for a mini-conference. All loved their rooms, and there were no problems with our meeting room. The hotel bar worked excellently as a place to stop in for a nightcap, and everyone's room had a mini-bar. The hotel does want an exorbitant fee for internet access from a meeting room. That was a disappointment in this age of free wifi at every coffee shop in town. Even a modest fee would have been fine, but they wanted $400 (per day) for six of us to be able to connect to the wifi. (We got online via the hotel's free lobby wifi instead.)
