The Seneca is my new home away from home in Chicago. The staff was welcoming, professional and positive. I believe they actually like working at the hotel! Patrick at the front desk let us check in early and seemed very happy to do so. Thanks! The room was on the 9th floor, and was quiet and beautifully appointed. The beds were superb. Everything was immaculate. There was a full kitchen, which we did not use, but would be very handy for some folks. The shower was luxurious and bath products were provided. Check out took no time at all. The lobby is reminiscent of the old time luxury hotels. It was small, but beautiful. The location, as other reviewers have pointed out, was simply unbeatable. Check out Francescas's restaurant next door. Excellent Italian food and good prices. The theatre is across the street. We saw the play "Working", which I would highly recommend. For you American Girl Doll fans, the store is right across the street, next to the theatre. Michigan Avenue is steps away, but you are shielded from the noise at the Seneca. We'll be back!
