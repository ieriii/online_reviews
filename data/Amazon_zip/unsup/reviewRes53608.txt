I unfortunately had a reservation which I had to put a credit card number down for and have a 48 hour window to cancel. That part does not bother me. What bothers me is that when I needed to cancel, NO ONE answered their phones for about a week and their mailbox was full. When I finally got through the day before my reservations, the guy on the phone was extremely rude. I do not understand how a restaurant can be in business when they do not answer their phones; their voice box is full; and by canceling reservations last minute. I will not ever go there!
