I've only ordered from here through Grubhub and I'm pretty mixed on the rating. I love love LOVE the pizza. The Pao de queijo makes me so happy, much like the Guarana that I miss so much from being in Brazil. However, the chicken has left something to be desired, as did the garlic rice. Maybe it's because I got my food delivered?
