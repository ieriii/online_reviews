Had an amazing dinner here last night. Have always been a fan of Rick Bayless and glad I was finally able to eat at one of his restaurants. I had the suckling pig torta, guacamole and a churro topped off with a nice Goose Island Matilda. The pork in the torta was amazing. Tender, juicy and very flavorful. I can easily say that it was not only the best torta I've ever had, but it may have been some of the best tasting pork I have ever eaten. The habenero salsa that came with it was fiery and delicous.The guacamole had great flavor and was seasoned perfectly. A lot of times I find guac to be bland, but not here. Very flavorful and delicous. The service was great and the people working there were very knowledgeable about the food and friendly. We waited about 25 min for a table on a wed night at about 8PM. It was well worth the wait and we will definitely be back.
