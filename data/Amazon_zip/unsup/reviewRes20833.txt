Love this place - not only for the food, which is great and the wine list, which is also great - but for the wonderfully helpful staff. Was just there last night and had excellent service from the manager who couldn't have been more accomodating to the waitress who was knowledgable about the food and wine and able to help us make great choices for dinner.  Can't say enough about the customer service - a rarity these days!
