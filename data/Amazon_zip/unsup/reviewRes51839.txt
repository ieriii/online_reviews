the only reason its even getting a star at all is that the pizza is really that good! whats not good was just how Bad the waitresses was. she must have loads of money cause she did not have and interest in getting a tip at all, and in that respect i was more than happy to oblige. Management letting employees act the way does nothing but hurt their business , especially when there are other great deep dish pizzas in the area (hello.... this is Chicago)
