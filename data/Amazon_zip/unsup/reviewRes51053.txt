Man oh man do these guys make a great breakfast. The potatoes alone are to die for. The coffee is weak, like all diner-type eateries, but really tasty nevertheless. A warning to local curmudgeons however, this place is baby-central on weekend mornings. Though they've never bothered me while I was there, it is literally packed with parents and small children. And weekend mornings will mean a wait as well.
