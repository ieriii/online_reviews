Irazu is especially great during the summer when you can sit in the open-air patio. They don't have a ton of inside seating, so it can get crowded quickly! I used to get the veggie burrito (without cheese or sour cream to make it vegan, plus the optional mushrooms and spinach) cuz I just like it so much. They note on their menu that the veggie taco is great for vegans as well. Lately though, I've been ordering the potato tacos for delivery and in the restaurant. It comes with enough food for a couple meals: three mashed-potato-stuffed crispy tacos, vinegary cabbage salad with beets, radishes and cucumber, yellow rice, refried beans, maduros (ripe plantains) and your choice of guacamole or mole. The mole isn't vegetarian though, so get the guac! I have yet to try the Vegetarian Plate, though it would be another vegan option. FYI, the empanadas on the menu aren't vegan either; they have some egg in the dough. This last time in the restaurant the patacones (tostones, or fried green plantains) were a bit overdone, so they weren't as tasty as usual. But I must say, the garlic and oil "mojo" is so addicting and makes everything taste good. I shamefully admit I haven't ordered a shake in a while, but they are delicious and they do have soy milk as an option. Mango was my preferred flavour. I had one bad experience with a delivery over a year ago - the delivery person said they didn't have change for my $20 so I had to give him a $10 tip! But I haven't had any problems with recent orders through GrubHub. Service was a little unusual at this recent visit. The server would ask us if we needed anything, but then he'd turn around and walk away before we could say anything. In the end, we got everything we needed though! Irazu will continue to be one of my main restaurants in the area.
