Ah, how I love this spot. It's my new favorite restaurant this summer - has the most amazing outdoor patio (something out of Midsommers Night Dream), friendly staff, a solid wine list, and Italian food to boot. Though it's not my favorite place to carb up Italian style, the food is good. Offers a good antipasti selection, pizzas are all on par and the entrees were good. I think the overall ambience and staff is truly what knocks this place out of the park.
