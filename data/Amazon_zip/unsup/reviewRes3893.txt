crisp blew my mind! it doesn't look like much from the outside but inside it's kind of a hipster/wing lover/byob fan haven. i ordered the jumbo wings and have never had anything like it! the sauce was perfect - spicy and sweet and there was so much meat on the bones. staff checked on us a couple of times even though it's a counter service restaurant. i can't wait to go back for more!
