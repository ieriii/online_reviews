We've gone to the cafe in Fox & Obel a number of the times and generally gotten a pretty good (if slightly expensive) basic lunch, with our main complaint being that the food can be a little slow and the table area crowded. But today everything was wrong. My husband forgot to ask -- and they didn't offer-- fruit salad with his panini instead of fries. OK we thought, he'll eat the fries. But they were undercooked -- soggy and unappetizing. So he went up and explained that he had wanted the fruit, and returned to the table with the impression that they would bring him some fruit salad. It hadn't come after about 10 minutes, so he went up and asked and was told that they didn't have fruit salad left, so he asked for an orange (which usu costs 75 cents) instead. As soon as he got back to his table a worker we hadn't dealt with before showed up at our table and asked us what we ordered. We told him. He asked for our receipt very aggressively. We said they didn't give us one, but that we had ordered a chicken panini. He said peremptorily that we hadn't requested fruit salad and the panini comes with fries unless we request it. We asked if they shouldn't offer it as an option (they usually do) and he said no, we had to ask. I told him the fries were undercooked but he pretty much ignored this information and stalked away. He was extremely rude and made us feel as if we were being accused of trying to cheat them over what is literally about a quarter cup of fruit salad. The fries were sitting on the table during this confrontation, clearly untouched. Then a nicer worker, not knowing of this confrontation, brought us two oranges about a minute later. We accepted one, and thanked her. We ate the orange, wondering if the guy would come back and charge us. To top it all off, about 15 minutes after leaving, I got sick at my stomach, apparently from food poisoning from my salad. Maybe just a bad day, but we'll go to Yolk down the street next time.
