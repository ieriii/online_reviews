Wonderful hostess and waiter, mediocre food, horrible manager. I've been to Artopolis numerous times to have a pastry and a Greek coffee and I always enjoyed the place. Always friendly service, nice atmosphere, clean bathrooms, etc. Unfortunately I made the mistake suggesting it for lunch. Between 3 of us we ordered the smoked salmon, a spanikopita, a Greek country salad, and a "Mediterranean feast". The salmon was good, served with capers, onion, and cream, but honestly, it's hard to mess up smoked salmon. The spanikopita was ok as well, but the spinach tasted canned so it was really the potato salad served on the side which overshadowed the spanikopita itself. The salad was a salad, nothing special, but nothing to complain about. The problem was the Mediterranean feast which came with 4 dips. The tzatziki, cucumber dip, tasted like it was made with mayo and had the most bizarre texture, unlike any other tzatziki I've ever had. The fava dip tasted like split-peas, and the hummus was below average. We asked to see the manager just to ask about what the tzatziki was made with, and he was extremely rude and condescending in his responses to our minor complaints. He started by saying he was Greek and knew what it should taste like, but then a minute later he said that no where on the menu did Artopolis claim to be a Greek restaurant and that their focus was bread and pastries. So when all fails and you realize you can't defend your shitty food claim that food isn't the specialty of the restaurant..? And it was our problem the food sucked because we came in with expectations... ? And no offer to take the dish of the bill, though we would have paid it since we ate about 1/3 of it already, the offer would have been appreciated. But as stands, I will not be going back, not even for a pastry and coffee. Especially since we discovered that the Pan Hellenic Pastry Shop close by is not only better, but much cheaper.
