Came here based on yelp reviews and because I was in the neighborhood. Lets just say I was not impressed at all. The place was overly crowded and that means banging elbows with table to the left and right. How do you enjoy dinner when customers from other tables are elbowing you (WTF)? Food was completely uninspiring. My experience almost felt like happy hours at some sushi restaurant. The only difference was the prices here were about 10x as much as other better restaurants.  The place was so loud. I came so close to busting out my ear plugs.... Sad to say, I am never coming here.  PS: Waiter was a good guy, but seriously overwhelmed.
