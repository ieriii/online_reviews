Nothing but love for this place. Bring a full wallet, you'll need it to try all of the awesome beers on tap. The food is pretty good too-the frites are always a must order, and the CB & J was pretty tasty as well. Ultimately, everything probably tastes better than it really is because you're drinking 8% beers before you even think about ordering. Delicious belgian 8% beers.....
