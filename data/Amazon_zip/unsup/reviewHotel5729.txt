The Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro was our host hotel for our wedding. The front desk was extremely accommodating with our wedding related requests (putting a shuttle sign frame up near registration, passing out out of town bags, letting us do wedding photography in the lobby). Lena in the sales department was so good to me in organizing my hotel wedding block and answering my wedding related questions (early checkin, late check out, etc). We had booked two suites but I was in a little shock when I saw how tiny it was - we managed but that would be my only negative nit which really isn't the hotel's fault. Just be aware that not all suites are made equal!
