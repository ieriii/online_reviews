I haven't been here for about 3 years, but Geja's remains one of my faves. I have been eating at Geja's for more than 10 years. My mom used to take me every year for my birthday. I don't think I've ever been there with a guy, so yeah, it's romantic and all, but I don't date guys romantic enough to take me (even after many, many, dropped hints). I love the atmosphere, the wine, the food, and the service. They have valet service, which is awesome. It looks like a cute little french restaurant from the outside - you walk down the steps from the street and enter a dark, beautifully lit restaurant. There are a number of table/booths. The walls are lined with wine bottles and candlelight dances around the room. It is cozy, but friendly. I have had to wait at the bar for the rest of my party many times and the bartender is always nice and able to recommend a nice wine. I love that you can split the course dinners because I usually go with meat-eaters so we can all share the cheese fondue and then everyone gets their own entree to cook themselves. Mine = a plate loaded with fresh vegetables like mushrooms, small potatoes, onions, etc. And the dipping sauces are awesome! Then comes the pice de rsistance: the chocolate fondue with liquor on top that they light on fire! The fire goes out when everyone dips their marshmallows in. Then you can dip small pieces of pound cake, strawberries, and other fabulous fruits. Mmmm. I'm gonna have some food dreams tonight!
