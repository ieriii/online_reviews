This opened up right as I was moving out of the neighborhood about 7 years ago. Too bad, b/c I may have come here every week (if I had the money). As it stands, my wife and I come here a few times per year for celebrations or for a date. We were there not too long ago to celebrate friends getting engaged. The atmoshere is romantic, the food is delicious (gnocchi is right up there!), and it's BYOB, which is always a plus. We even bought some of their artwork. The waitstaff is always very helpful. Parking is usually easy in front or along the tracks. Also in front of that ugly apt building at 1907 W Wilson. Great date place in a neighborhood that looks like it's been up-and-coming for some time.
