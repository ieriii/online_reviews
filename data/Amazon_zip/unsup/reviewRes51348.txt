Alright, Garcia, I gave you another shot. A few Guinesses down the block made me hungry for a a cheesy quesadilla...so I ventured down that way. Ya know what? Your quesadilla (I got one) seemed laughably small, but it was just enough to do the trick. Tasty, cheesy, and salty, it was everything I was craving. And the price was right: Two steak tacos, a cheese quesadilla, a small order of guac with chips = less than $13. Score! Know what? Cuz you're in my 'hood, and apparently I have returned to the "burritos at 2:00 a.m. phase in my life" (I must've been drunk sans burritos when I wrote that first review), I'll be back for more salty, cheesy goodness. Although, Garcia, we need to talk about the guac. It was alright, but I felt like it need a smidge more...something. Maybe I come over and show you how I do it...cuz mine's better. Uh oh, you've just been sassed by a gringa.
