Worst pizza I have ever eaten in my entire life. The pizza took very long to come out but was cold. The dough wasn't cooked through and the cheese was gobby (the type you choke on). That would have been fine if the cheese was good but it tasted like Polly-O string cheese. I would never give this place a dime of my money again. Since this place has so many good reviews I'm starting to think if anyone has actually had good pizza.
