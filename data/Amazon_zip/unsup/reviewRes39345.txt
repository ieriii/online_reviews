I would suggest coming here with a group of four. And like one of my dinning companions ruled: no one can get the same thing. It was a nice way to sample a little bit of a lot of dishes...which you will want to do when you see all of the interesting options you have on the menu. Before I get into the food (which I think is ALWAYS the most important part), let me remark on the restaurant itself since in this case it did somehow play a factor in my experience. The wait was long. My peeps got there at 6:15 and they would not give a specific amount of time until we got a table, but then about 20 minutes later they told us 25 minutes until we'd be seated. However, we actually got sat 75 minutes after we arrived, for a Friday or Saturday night, I would expect it...but a Monday at 6:15 p.m.? This place sits at the popular kids table. The restaurant is smaller than I imagined. Everyone who works here and almost all the customers are what I would call hipsters. However, the hipsters would probably call me a yuppie. It is very crowded, even when you are sitting. There are tons of people waiting for tables or lurking by the bar inbetween tables. The service was fantastic. The hostess was super nice and spunky, the waitress was friendly and helpful, and we got "thank you for coming" from two other employees on the way out (such a nice touch). Onto the food. The award for the best in each category goes to... - Bar Snacks: fancy pretzel with dip (amazing cheese sauce) - Small Plate: pork belly (it melts in your mouth) - Sandwich/Salad: sloppy joe (a little spicy but fantastic with the fries) - Entree: fried softshell crab (amazing potato salad with lobster and bacon accompanies it) - Desserts: none. I was not impressed with any of the ones we tried. This restaurant also makes me want to explore Logan Square some more...not to mention coming back for brunch here.
