It's always a good time at a Greek restaurant, and this one doesn't disappoint. It's located in Greek town, the free valet parking totally scored star #1 for this restaurant. Star #2 is for having a really great, personable staff. Overall the food was slightly above average. We started with a bunch of outstanding apps - taramosalata, grilled octopus, friend calamari, and saganaki cheese. To be quite honest, I was quite full after the apps...but I just couldn't pass up their delicious traditional menu. For the main courses, I ordered the combination plate that included roast leg of lamb, mousaka, dolmades, and meatballs. Others ordered the sea bass, pork chops, lamb chops, and spaghetti (no...these are all separate dishes...not combined ^_^ ) They certainly give you a very generous portion and the pricing is very budget friendly. The place was actually surprisingly packed for a Thursday, so making a reservation is recommended.
