Absolutely outstanding all around. The food is ridiculous, the wine list matches and is affordable, the outdoor patio is amazing, and the service is a total 10. The owners take great pride in their food & their restaurant and how it is run from top to bottom. For sure the best Italian restaurant in chicago right now. Great work guys.
