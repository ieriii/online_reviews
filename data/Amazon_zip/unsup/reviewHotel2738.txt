Great hotel right near Michigan Avenue. The service is outstanding and they really aim to please. The rooms are not big, but nicely decorated and modern. I love the Kiehls bath amenities. The gym is also incredible--heads above most other hotel gyms. I don't love David Burke's--Joes's two blocks away has much better steaks and seafood (and is a little cheaper) but in a pinch it is not awful. The hotel is also dog friendly--a huge plus. You can even bring your pooch (of all sizes) to sit with you in the bar/lounge while you drink and order off the full menu from the restaurant. I tell all of my out of town guests to stay here.
