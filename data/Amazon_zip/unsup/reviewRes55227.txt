The meat, the essence of Brazilian steak houses, is good and diverse. The lamb was very good. The beef was good too. The bread they give you at the beginning is AMAZING. Don't eat too much or you won't be able to enjoy the rest of the food! The salad bar (or salad and side bar) was good. However, the one at Texas de Brazil is better. The service was great with bringing meat around quickly. Our waiter was very friendly and also helped with wine choices. However, they did the whole awkward Brazilian steakhouse thing where they take away your 'salad' plate and just won't let you eat meat as the same time as anything from the sides and salad bar (which had sides like potatoes and more).The atmosphere is ok. The tables feel very crowded in the weekends or busy evenings, especially if there are large groups. It is all VERY loud, we could barely hear each other, could only speak by yelling to the person next to us. Overall, great, but due to atmosphere and salad bar, I like Texas the Brazil just a little better.
