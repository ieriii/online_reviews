I can't believe that I have lived on the north side all my life, and I have never been to the Green Mill. Have waited for the bus so many times, right in front of the Green Mill. But, have never been there...until some friends took me a few weeks ago. I had a great time. We arrived about 8:30, with show starting at 8. Packed...standing room only. But, that didn't matter. The music was great - Latin jazz. The drinks were good. The atmosphere definiely the 30s. Service was quick and friendly. The crowd seemed to be an older group - maybe late 30's thru 70's. I didn't see many 20 year olds. But, age really didn't matter. All of the crowd were bopping their heads and tapping their feet. The Green Mill is easily accesible by the Red Line, Lawerence stop. Walk west 1/2 block to Broadway. The 39 Broadway bus and the 81 lawrence bus also stop very close to the club. They have a free parking lot one block west of broadway, off of Lawrence. I am now plannng on returning to the Green Mill. I had so much fun.
