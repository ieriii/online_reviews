um. what can i say thats positive. nothing. except for the cashier Catherine, everthing else sucked. The food took forever, no one knew where anything was, there were birds flying all over the place. I had to take catherine out of her cashier stand to show me where the tahini was because NO one else knew what it even was. so much for gourmet
