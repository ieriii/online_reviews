Fantastic! I had a group of 15. We ordered 4 ducks which was the perfect amount of food. I have previously had duck, but was not a big fan. But after my dinner here I can easily say, this was the best duck I have had! The duck is brought out and cut up in front of you. The rest of the duck is turned into a fried rice and soup. I did not try the soup, but the fried rice was good. The place is byob which is nice with a $3 corking fee which is reasonable. Our bill was also very appropriate. This place is perfect for groups ( call ahead and make reservations). Also could be a fun date spot.  I can't wait to bring another group of my friends here!
