I recently booked a reservation for a family member through a website that I will not name. On our way to the hotel, we decided to call to confirm the reservation, JUST IN CASE, and the hotel had stated that they did not have a reservation under my name. Now, I had a confirmation e-mail and the payment was already processed.I had to call the hotel again and was put on hold for 20 minutes. Then was told to contact the website I booked it through. I was then on hold for another 40 minutes!!!The three people I was put through to were all very helpful and the hotel ended up upgrading the room for the inconvenience so that was nice but I just did not understand the confusion.All in all the stay was very nice for this family member but the being on hold and calling back and forth was not the greatest to say the least.
