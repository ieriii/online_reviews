Let's start w/ the negatives: parking is a bitch. And on to the good! Sprout's menu lists out the components of each dish by course, however, you really don't know exactly how they'll be fashioned together. It's like dinner roulette.  I had the egg, lamb and corn. On top of that the kitchen brought out bread, soup and a croque monsieur-- suddenly three courses were closer to five and I felt completely satisfied with the $60 prix fixe cost. The food was really good and I expected it to be really good-- which usually ends in my disappointment. Also, the desserts were amazing, like lick the bottom of the mason jar amazing. I've started to just expect a throw away dish most of the time, and as someone w/ at least 4 sweet teeth, it was a pleasant surprise. My only concern down the road is that the menu feels pretty limited, and it doesn't look like it's changed seasonally-- where's the incentive to return?
