Three course meal for $39.95? Sign. Me. Up! I went here for the first time, finally, for a birthday dinner. I was super pumped to finally try out the famed Ruth Chris! Bummer that I finally make it here when I no longer eat meat, but fret not my friends. I did sneak a piece of my boyfriend's steak- sorry! Total cheater. Before I get into the food, I would like to point out the service. You expect greatness at a place like this and that we received. Our server could not have been more attentive or nice. He was right on with the drinks and was just all around a pleasant person. We had mushrooms caps for an appetizer- I think stuffed with crab. YUM. We should've ordered another, but wasn't my call tonight. Course one, salad....it was good. It's a house salad, so nothing SPECTACULAR. I had the salmon...at a steak house. So wah wah. It was a big, perfectly cooked piece of fish. My only gripe is that it tasted like it was marinated in a vat of butter. I like butter as much as the next guy, but lay off the sauce man! I don't think I should have the mentality, "That's what you get for ordering fish at a steak house." A place with such a high reputation for meat, should be able to knock a piece of fish out of the park. Everything else was great so this will in no-way deter me from returning. A great location and a great spot to bring a date or celebrate a special occasion.
