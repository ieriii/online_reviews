This place is more than just my favorite hot dog place.... This is completely part of me growing up. My grandparents who have since passed away lived in lincolnwood just a few minutes away. I used to have it all the time when I was at their house and from the time I had a license have taken all my friends there. Everything on the menu is awesome (that I have had) my favorite will always be the super dawg lounging in their oh so amazing fries! Add a root beer float and a chocolate shake and you'll be in heaven! Ps- my grandma always made me eat them with everything but now that I'm all grown up I can order no onions ;)
