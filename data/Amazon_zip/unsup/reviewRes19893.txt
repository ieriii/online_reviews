This is probably my favorite sushi place in Chicago. Usually I just get carryout, but the times I have eaten here have made for a nice night out. It's usually always busy on the weekend, so beware, but when we used to live close by we would put our name down then go next door to Danny's for a drink and have them call us when our table was ready, which is really cool. The rolls are excellent. The signature makis are great if you want to splurge. The atmosphere is buzzing and since they expanded the dining room they seem to do twice the business. I've never taken advantage of the BYOB, but that is a nice option. There is the Polonia liquor store just down the block to pick stuff up. The sushi is a couple bucks more than other places, but I think it is worth it.
