On a mission to compare Superdawg to my childhood favorite Gene & Judes, located in River Grove. I heard the food was just as good as the drive in nostalgic experience so I was looking forward to Superdawg. And the winner is.... Gene & Judes. Superdawg was overpriced, which I would be willing to pay if the hot dog and fries lived up to the price, but that wasn't the case. Maybe i'll try again another day.
