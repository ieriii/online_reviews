Although it's great to see an authentic Neopolitan pizza place in the pizza graveyard that is Chicago, Spacca comes just a tiny bit short in my opinion. I can't really figure out why... the quality of the tomatoes is excellent, the mozzarella is very good considering it's imported, and they have a 60 second bake. I'm suspicious that they do not use wild, sourdough cultures in their dough. Anybody in Naples will tell you that wild yeast is one of the most important parts of a delicious pizza, and though I don't know for sure, I feel as though they omit that here in favor of the typical cake brewer's yeast. Making a truly authentic pizza is an unbelievably difficult task, so considering how close they come they definitely deserve a lot of credit. Their appetizers and non-pizza options (though brief in number), are also pretty good. Just a tad bit pricey, but hey, it's the only place of its kind here.
