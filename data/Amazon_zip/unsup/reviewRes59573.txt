Their Korean food is really good and you will always leave feeling full. There really is something for everyone (even the less adventuresome). If you are looking for fancy, shmancy, Americanized Korean food then this is NOT the place for you. However, if you're looking for the real thing then come here. Nothing fancy. Just good food. Now my reason for 3 stars...the service is pretty terrible, be prepared for typically unfriendly waitstaff who don't like fielding questions from unneducated diners. You get what you get. Also you're better off walking than parking (their lot is impossible) and the 'Sushi' side of their restaurant is less than stellar. Stick with the Korean side and you're golden! What can I say, I'm a sucker for local joints.
