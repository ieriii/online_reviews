Where can you find a bar with over 200 different types of beer? I was first introduced to the imperial stouts here. I mean, move over guiness! Don't worry, if you don't like it hot and heavy, with over 200 beers, there's a beer for everyone.  Don't forget to try the mussels and fries! Warning: it gets REALLY busy!
