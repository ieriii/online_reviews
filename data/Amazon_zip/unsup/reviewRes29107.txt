Not bad, but in comparison to Rosded, which is right across the street, it just doesn't measure up. A little more expensive than the average noodle joint, they make up for it by the use of good vegetables, like rapini instead of the more pedestrian broccoli. Noodles get a little burnt around the edges, but in a good way.  I guess I can't really say anything bad about this place, but it's missing a certain something. I still haven't figured out what.
