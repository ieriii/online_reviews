Been going to Calo for many years (30+)- it was always good and reliable and has only gotten better with age. here are my highlights: Cheap ribs during the week (12.95) - full dinner starts with the focaccia bread then soup or salad- excellent minestrone - fresh salad (get the garlic and house on the side) Choice of side - you can't finish the whole meal The asiago cheese gnocchi is awesome -my favorite -very rich - could share as an appetizer. Great value too.
