What a HUGE disappointment. My husband and I just came back from Chicago and I was determine to go to Gino's East since I saw it on Man v Food and boy what a waste. If I had known the crust was made with cornmeal I would have saved me $27+tax on a medium pie. We was so hungry from walking around all morning that all we had was a slice. We are from Boston and are sue to thin slice pizza, but figured let try the deep dish and not Uno's or Due, but Gino's......never again is all I have to say.
