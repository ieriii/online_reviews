The Bongo Room is currently my favorite brunch spot. If you enjoy sweets, I highly recommend their various pancake and French toast options. A full order of pancakes or French toast comes with three pieces and arrives towering and impressive. However, I suggest ordering only one or two of a specific pancake or French toast so you can sample more of their fantastic offerings. This past visit, I had one pumpkin spice pancake with brown sugar cream mousse and glazed pecans ($5), one caramelized apple pancake with praline cream and toasted walnuts ($5), one white chocolate caramel pretzel pancake ($5), and one slice of chocolate bread French toast ($6.25). The pancakes are deliciously rich, sweet, over-the-top. The chocolate bread French toast is a chocolate lover's dream. The smoked duck breast benedict ($14.25) and BLT eggs benedict ($13.75) were deemed worthy as well. The portions are large. During prime brunch hours, expect to wait. The wait is worth it. They don't encourage waiting inside so you have to retreat to your car or nearby shops during the cold months. Water and coffee are constantly replenished, and bussers eagerly clear your table of finished plates. Available street parking. The south loop location is awesome, too.
