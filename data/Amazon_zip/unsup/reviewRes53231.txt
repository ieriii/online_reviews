Not at impressed by their customer service I went there with a large group of people. The food was nothing spectacular and the service was slow. It wasn't too bad until we received the bill. Come to find out if you have a large party and each person doesnt spend 20 dollars, they will charge you regardless. That being said they added over $100 to our bill without informing us of this beforehand. The management was rude regarding the matter. It wouldnt have been such a large issue if we had been told of the policy beforehand, but it wasnt posted on the menu or anywhere on site. I was completely shocked by the lack of professionalism, service, and policies.
