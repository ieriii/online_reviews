For anyone who has never had Korean chicken wings (or GASP! never had Korean food at all!), this is a good starter. I could do without the cheesy names, but if a name like Seoul Sassy will get more people to try the perfect combination of sweet, salty flavors highlighting the fried chicken, then Seoul Sassy it is. We had the Seoul Sassy and Plain Jane wings, with sides of the other sauces to try them all; Seoul Sassy wins by a long shot - Plain Jane really is plan and seems boring by comparison, although if you had it on it's own I'm sure it's fine -- nice and crispy, for certain. Service is friendly, and they've repainted and spruced it up since the Rice Box days, making it a more pleasant environment overall. The owner was nice enough to bring us a plate of "The Green and The Orange" - but.... the veggies were soggy, not crisp or fresh, and the ranch dressing on the side was clearly bottled. I haven't tried other items on the menu, but it seems to me like they're suffering from too many choices. Wings, sandwiches, burritos (a bi bi bop burrito?), salads, rice bowls and "buds" -- which can be steamed, fried or pan fried -- left me confused about what their "specialties" were. (On a side note: $10 for a bowl of rice and veggies -- essentially a veggie bi bim bop without the traditional fried egg -- seems like a lot for me -- and the meat is still extra...). Definitely come for the chicken -- and hopefully, given some time, they'll figure out the rest. FYI -- The cash only situation is on-going -- the owner told someone else it might be a couple weeks -- it seems like they should put up a sign to warn people, but plan on cash only for now.
