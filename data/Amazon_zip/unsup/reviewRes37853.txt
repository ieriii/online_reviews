I live in New York City but I'm a native Chicagoan. Whenever I come back home to visit my parents who live in Glenview, I make the trek into the city just to go to Hopleaf. The beer selection is excellent (be careful about not just the # of drinks you have but the alcohol content of some of the Belgians if you're driving... I was like, "yeah, I can handle three beers and still drive. no problem." but then I forgot some of those Belgian beers are twice as strong as your typical beer). I always get the mussels. They're a great deal. I also love the atmosphere--casual, fun, unpretentious.
