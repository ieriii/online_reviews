I waited an hour and change for my brown ale buffalo sausage. Worth it? Definitely. My brother's bacon and duck sausage was really good too, and the standard Chicago style dog my brother also got was nothing less than impeccable. Skip the duck fat fries though. While tasty, I personally don't think they're worth the extra price premium over normal fries.
