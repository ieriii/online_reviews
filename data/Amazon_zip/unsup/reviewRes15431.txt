I had heard about this place from various folks, but never really knew where it was and what all the hype was. When you get there, you stand in line and it can be down the block some making for a decent wait. Luckily we only had to wait a couple of minutes as the door dude was looking for a party of 3 & bingo that was us. inside before you get in the place, there's a holding room and once in, you're surrounded by velvet high back chairs. There's a touch of sophistication and elegance in the decor and the people are not those of your typical grungy bars in the area - more the young professionals who are wanting a chill place with fancy cocktails. It is a loud environment, so not the best place for a first date.  The food is all small plates - it was okay, definitely not their specialty as are the cocktails.
