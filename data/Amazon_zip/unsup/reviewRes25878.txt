Was looking for a romantic restaurant and this was listed as one of the most in Chicago. Knew little about it but made a reservation. Stepped down into the entryway and then into the dimly lit restaurant. Yes, this was very romantic. Dim lighting from candles, Spanish guitar music, and comfy booths. The theme is fondue. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Went the whole nine yards on the evening. Had a watermelon daquiri that was awesome but, alas, they could not make a second as they were out of watermelon. Odd. Started with the appetizer fondue with fruit and bread to dip in the cheese. Delicious. The main course was chicken, beef, and shrimp, with vegetables, to be dipped in oil and then an assortment of sauces. The protein was good quality. By dessert, we were quite full but it was a delicious chocolate fondue with fruit and cake to dip. Prepare to spend the evening, as the pace is liesurely and that works with the theme. It's a good night out if you want a romantic place and want to spend time talking and sharing food. It is expensive, though worth it for a special occasion. My only regret was that I wasted the evening on someone who turned out not to be the person I thought. Will just have to find the right person and return to create a better memory.
