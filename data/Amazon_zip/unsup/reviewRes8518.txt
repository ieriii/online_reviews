My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I knew it would be amazing. I was not disappointed. Everyone from the valet to the hostess to the guys bringing the meat around were extremely friendly and welcoming. The salad bar was great although we didn't partake much. We wanted to wait for all the meat! After salads, we turned our card from red to green and were immediately swarmed by the guys who bring around the meat. The selection of meats was amazing and we tried everything. Because there were so many types of beef offered it kind of started to look and taste the same. I particularly enjoyed the Parmesan encrusted pork. The complimentary sides were disappointing. I was kind of looking forward to trying the polenta fried bananas but I was severely disappointed. The polenta tasted like cardboard and the bananas were mushy and gross. The potatoes were delicious.  My main recommendation: don't forget to turn your card back over to red or the meat keeps coming! I made that mistake a few times.
