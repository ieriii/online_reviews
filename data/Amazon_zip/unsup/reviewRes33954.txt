I don't find anything about this place spectacular. In my opinion it's equivalent to a higher grade of Denny's. It is typically crowded and can accommodate large groups of people. I would go early if you go at all. They do have some fun things on their menu, however I've only tried a few of them. They pancakes are ordinary, the crepes and french toast are much better.
