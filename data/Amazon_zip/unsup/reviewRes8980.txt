The ambiance, service and specialty drinks almost get Le Colonial four stars but they can't quite overcome the quality of the food. Don't get me wrong, the food is decent Vietnamese but it has nothing to do with French.  Perhaps we're spoiled by really good Vietnamese restaurants elsewhere (not Chicago) but the food at Le Colonial was average Vietnamese fare. So basically you're getting take-out food in a great setting. We sat upstairs on the balcony on a beautiful night and I must admit the space was beautiful. Inside was a little dirty and even a little tired (the fake plants were bizarre to me) but overall not bad.  The standout of the evening were the specialty cocktails. Yes, they're $14 each but they're huge and delicious.  Overall an ok experience but you're definitely paying for location and ambiance. If you've never had Vietnamese the food will probably be ok. If you're into Asian fare and don't care about 'scene' I advise you go somewhere else.
