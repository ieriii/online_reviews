Been there after a horrible experience from another restaurant. Since we have been ignored there, we took our business somewhere else: The Bad Apple. I was quite hungry and a bit skeptic when I saw how busy they were, but after being lead to our table, we ordered drinks and appetizers. Although I am not a beer drinker, their list is breath taking! And so is their burger selection! But cheese curds first! And man! They came fast! And they went even faster! Man: Soooo good! Tough choice on the burgers - too much to choose from! But we were both happy with both of our (Texas Burger and the Frenchie). The interior is casual and has its charm. I recommend the place for a nice burger fix.
