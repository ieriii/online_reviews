Look, I live in Arizona. There are very few vegetarian restaurants out here. I know for a lot of people in Chicago, vegetarian food is old hat and easy to find. But I'm going to go out on a limb here and say, of all veg restaurants I've been to (including great places in San Diego, San Francisco, and even one or two in good ole AZ), the Chicago Diner is far and beyond the best. If I could give the Chicago Diner 300 stars, I would. Five stars is just not enough for how absolutely perfect and delicious this restaurant is. First, the ambiance is really cute. Diner-y, of course. The service is awesome, the servers are all super sweet and so helpful. We shared an appetizer of buffalo wings with THE BEST vegan ranch I've ever eaten. I ordered the philly cheesesteak with a side of mashed potatoes. OH. MY. GOD. I haven't eaten beef in almost five years and man oh man oh man, do I miss it sometimes. And man oh man, did Chicago Diner fake it perfectly well. It tasted like a real, meaty meat philly cheesesteak. The meat was even slightly greasy (probably thanks to the copious amounts of cheese they put on the sandwich, mm). I swear - it was almost identical to a real meat philly cheesesteak. My boyfriend got the reuben and wow - same thing. It was PERFECT. I've been trying to convince my boyfriend to move to Chicago for a long time and The Chicago Diner is always one of my reasons why it'd be a perfect place to live - it's just that good.
