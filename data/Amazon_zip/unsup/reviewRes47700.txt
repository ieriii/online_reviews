Love the rooftop during the week. Love the service staff. Love the people. Lots of professional well dressed and well mannered patrons. The weekends pull a noticeably different crowd - tourists and suburban wannabes tend to show up. The place is well managed. Pleasant and professional doormen. Nicely done chief ZEDhead, whoever you are! The crowd is always a nice balance of men and women as well. Please, please keep it that way. This will remain one of the best Rooftops in town unless you let too many posers up there with starched collars looking for a professional girl with a career to hit on. If that happens, I'm gone and so are the professional girls and onto a new undiscovered place to meet. Until then, I highly recommend the ZED rooftop. I heard downstairs is great too but don't tell too many people, especially a bunch of guys with no dates! Try the fondue...Im not kidding...try the fondue.
