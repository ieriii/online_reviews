Ambiance: Maybe I didn't read the other reviews or look at the photos that carefully but this place was not what I was expecting at all. When I think wine bar, I picture a somewhat sophisticated, slightly younger, hip crowd getting drinks after work and some tapas-style dishes. This place is more of a coffee house/diner with wine available.  It's in an apartment building so it seems like some of the tenants eat here e.g. the 80 yr old guy eating his sundae by himself at the adjacent table or the family with children enjoying cheeseburgers at the other end of the restaurant. Food: It's actually quite good and reasonably priced. I had french toast which is hard to mess up so I can't judge the entire menu, but the menu itself is very extensive (breakfast served all day). My friend got the veggie burger and ate the entire thing even though it was huge. The coffee is good too. Parking: Impossible unless you have a permit.
