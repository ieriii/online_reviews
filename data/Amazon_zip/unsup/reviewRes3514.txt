The sauces on the fried chicken are good, but try it plain jane, it's better. Want variety? Ask for some atomic (usually for the burritos) to dip the chicken in. Solid. I get the buddha bowl often, it's a very good bi bim bop, if only it were available dolsot style. Between the chicken, the bowl, and the burritos it's easy to overlook the shrooms, but that'd be a mistake, they crispy on the outside. Although you may not want to get these delivery, they're best hot.
