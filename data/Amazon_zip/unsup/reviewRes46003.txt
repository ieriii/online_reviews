Its the Cheescake Factory's big sister... Same over the top decor and huge amazing menu. The icing on the cake to any Michigan Avenue shopping spree, though I've also paid $30 in parking for a Beignet craving... yes their homeade warm fluffy goey donughts with 3 rich sauces are my reason for living !! Ask to sit in the front room with the huge chandilier that looks like a giant jelly fish and promise me you wont leave with out an order of the Beignets. AMAZING. HEAVENLY. OMG. Thank me later :-)
