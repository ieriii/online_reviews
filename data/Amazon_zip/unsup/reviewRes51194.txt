i have somewhat of a penchant for visiting restaurants which garner reviews with strong feeling on both sides of the fence...i suppose if i was a cat curiosity wouldve done me in long ago. however, big jones has given me one of my lives back! i try not to enter into any dining experience with any preconceived notions. i merely desire good food and friendly service, and am always thrilled to find a set of circumstances remarkeable enough to record. hence my first yelp review. ive actually gnoshed here several times now, usually early in the week, as im a chef and work on the weekends. ive been there when they were surprisingly packed, and ive been there when i wouldnt have been surprised to see tumbleweeds rolling through, and my service and food has been consistently top drawer. from the fried green tomatoes to the gumbo to one of the best burgers in town, big jones does it right. two parting thoughts one-to people complaining about the inauthenticity of the food, you must be nuts, and relax-i lived in and worked in new orleans for ten years and let me assure you that if you plopped this joint down on magazine street no-one would ever imagine they had been invaded by nefarious yankees two-sometimes, especially on weekends and busy days, ie holidays, your food will not come lickety split...deal with it, i did experience a bit of a delay the first visit to bj, but i was more than compensated...try being a nice diner instead of a cantankerous fop! dining out is to be enjoyed and savored, not rushed. so thanks big jones and keep up the good work
