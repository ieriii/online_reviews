It's just good food. I stop in and get carryout all the time. My carryout staple is the Cubano and I love it. I occasionally eat in with friends and the service is great. Everyone is friendly. It just feels warm. Oh and the cafe con leche is like crack. I think about it for days afterward and I just want more.
