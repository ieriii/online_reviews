The line sucks but the food was fantastic. We went later on a Tuesday night, waited about a half an hour. The guacamole was pretty good, the ahojada torta was amazing and the chocolate flan cake made it worth going in to begin with. Rick Bayless was behind the counter making orders and paused to take a photo with my friends and I. It'd really awesome if there was more seating though.
