If I was ever to open a restaurant, I would make it like Milk and Honey. It is such an efficient operation. Yes, you do have to stand it line to order, but this allows valuable tables to be turned over quickly. After ordering, you can leisurely sit and enjoy coffee while awaiting your food to be brought to your table. And once finished, you can leave as soon as you please - no having to flag down a waitress to pay. I suspect Milk and Honey is able to charge very reasonable prices for fresh, quality food, yet still make a profit, because they don't have to pay for extra staff like a hostess or multiple waitresses. And they know their nitch - breakfast and lunch - very well instead of trying to do everything. I am not gaga over any particular menu item, but everything I've had is solid. Plus their chai late is more flavorful than Starbucks. Because I work during the weekdays and often avoid popular brunch places on the weekends, I don't go often, but I still recommend Milk and Honey to others.
