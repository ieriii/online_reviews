Came without dear Thai friends for food. However, she graciously marked the food we should order. We order Moo Ping - really tender pork on a stick tiger cry - ok, slightly tough tom yum pla - great soup with fish. gaeng pet ped - REALLY yummy curry sauce pad ped pla dook - ok, loved the eggplant & beans better fried banana - OMG the best! banana coconut inside crispy spring roll thai custard - good I am truly enjoying Thai cuisine beyond pad thai, and I am in awe of the flavor combination I tried. Lovely, just amazing.
