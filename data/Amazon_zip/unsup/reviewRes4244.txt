Listed in Esquire's America's Best Bars under the "Oldest Bar" led me to Green Mill. Not only was it Al Capone's hang out during Prohibition it was, and still is, a jazz institution. I couldn't visit Chicago and not go to a jazz concert and Green Mill filled my jazz requirement. As we walked down the street we knew we had found the right place by the enormous neon green sign with sparkles. The cover charge was under $10 since it was an early show. Later shows are more expensive. The door man was a burly gentleman in a leather vest who seemed eager to dismiss us turned friendly when my mom began asking questions about his vest.  The Green Mill is splendid with its greatly preserved 1920's ambiance. The walls have impressive carvings and period patterned wallpaper. Long thin tables and round oversized booths decorated the floor. Pictures lined the walls. You can picture all the decadence that happened here a time long ago. Thankfully my mom and I arrived early because once the music started, the place was packed. A Russian woman with a heavenly voice crooned with a sultry band and I had the smallest rum and Coke I've ever had in my life. The stage was small, intimate, making you feel as if the concert was strictly for you. The Green Mill is a must see. It still maintains the glamour and charm of the Roaring '20's. You will feel like a flapper girl or a debonair playboy once you step through the door.
