Craft beer? Did you say 99 bottles of beer on the wall? Or did I just dream that. Oh wait, I did see 99 beers on the wall. I am a thirsty bitch when it comes to beer pardon my jargon. Somehow in the last year I think of myself as some sort of beer connoisseurs. I take pride in my beer drinking and I also take pride in running it off later. When I heard of Hopleaf I knew my beer obsession would go up a couple points. Their beer list is amazing and I mean there is something there for you, your grandma, and probably your dog too. If you are uncertain about what beer would suit your palette you can always ask one of the friendly servers. I had a beer comparable to a blue moon but it was much stronger and had more notes of citrus. For an appetizer I had the sausage and beans. For dinner my bestie had rabbit and I had a steak with frites! Let me tell you... everyone gets the Cashew Butter and Fig Jam sandwich but I am telling you to go out of your comfort zone and do something a litto crazay--- order a beer, eat a friggen rabbit or a cow? , show a little cleavage or if you are a guy show a little...... i mean well maybe it IS little so you might want to cover up! but ughhh .......OH you can buy a girl a beer... perhaps a girl who likes blue mooney kind of beers...like myself hehehe. A couple things to keep in mind 1. It is small in there 2. There is usually a wait time 3. It is not cheap 4. Bring good company it makes a good date spot
