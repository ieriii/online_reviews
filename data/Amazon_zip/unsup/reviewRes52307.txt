I'm from out of town and have always liked the pizza. I liked the place before when it was more of a whole in the wall. Now it looks just like any new bar/restaurant. Even though I am not a fan of the change, the pizza is still good. The did cut back on how much chesse they put on the pizza. But I guess they have to keep their margins up. Either way, you have to check it out. The other place (Lou Malanti's or something like that) does not have a pizza as good as Ginos.
