Vegetarian Haven for those non-carnivores. I've taken my mom here when she came visiting from California on a vegie kick and she thoroughly enjoyed it (stay away from the vegie Asian food tho - there's a better place on Broadway for that). I enjoyed my No Meata Fajita and we tried their vegan smoothies as a treat. Great place to hit up if you're feeling vegie!
