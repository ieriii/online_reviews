For a vegetarian who loves hot dogs (or pups) this is as good as it gets. Their vegetarian corn dogs are so delicious, I hate it that they are closed on sundays.. Even the regular hot dougs for vegetarians are very good. One down side is that they are SO GOOD that they are packed. I have waited up to 45 minutes on a saturday just to get my doug- I don't mind, just don't go hungry cuz that would suck!
