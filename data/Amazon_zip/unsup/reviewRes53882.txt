Man...oh... Man! What a great place. I *heart* this place! My friend from work found this place when she was traveling on one of her conferences and insisted I go if I ever went to Chicago. So the first chance I got to travel to Chicago, I made my boyfriend take me here. It was AMAZING. The ambiance is very nice, we were seated in a long table with some random people and were able to ask them what they were eating and how they liked it. We tried the Salt Roasted Beets, the eggplant, various cheeses and oodles and oodles of wine! The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about wine. Last week I made my boyfriend take me here again and we discovered the rillette (pork shoulder) and finally got the crispy pig ears! We sat at the bar this time since we were able to find bar seats before our table was ready. The bartender was great in recommending wines that we would enjoy. Loved the food, the wine and the prices were really good too.
