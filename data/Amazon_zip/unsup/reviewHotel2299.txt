We stayed here over the past weekend for a wedding. We got a sweet discount for wedding guests, which was really the only reason we could afford to stay here.  The good: - LOCATION! We were able to walk everywhere, which was great - Starbucks and bar in the lobby - the view! Our 39th floor room had a lakeview, and floor to ceiling windows with which to appreciate it. It was by far the best view I have ever had in a hotel.  - Our room was comfortable (king size bed), flat-screen tv, good water pressure, no smells - the elevators are fast, which is great when you are up almost 40 stories The bad: - would have liked a mini fridge and free internet, but no one is perfect - the tv lost the cable signal for about an hour; however, there was a pretty severe thunderstorm going on (of course, that's why we wanted to watch tv and see the weather...) - parking was difficult. We opted to do the off-site garage parking for $33/night (expensive, but what can you expect downtown?). The first garage next to the hotel we pulled into was full, but made us pay $6 to get out. Gee, thanks. We accidentally went by the next one, and when we tried to just do a lap around the block, we got stuck behind a parade that had shut down most of the area. So it took us about an hour to turn around and get back to the hotel to park again. The validation process was easy, however. But next time we will probably just pay the extra to valet.  If we can afford it, we would definitely stay here again on another trip to Chicago.
