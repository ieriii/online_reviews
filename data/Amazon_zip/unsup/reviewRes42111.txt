If you are looking for a place with great great wings, you need to look no further!  Art of Pizza has the best bbq chicken wings!  They also have daily specials, great pasta and ribs.  I think their pizza is just okay.  When I order from this place, an order of wings is always a must! They also give you a free 1 liter or 2 liter of pop (depending on how much you spend) which is a great plus. If you want diet pop, make sure you say so! Their delivery is typically fast too.
