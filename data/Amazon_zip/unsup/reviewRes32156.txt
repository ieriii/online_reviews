This place definitely has its good points but overall I was kind of so so on the entire experience. The service was awful but I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and attribute it to the fact that the place was absolutely packed. However, we did have a 9pm reservation and weren't seated until 9:30 AND my friend waited at least 20 mins before he was able to get the bartender's attention. The food was actually pretty good. I can't say it stood out compared to other Pan Asian / Asian fusion / sushi places in Chicago though. I probably prefer Mirai or Sushi Wabi to be honest, but I did enjoy several things I ordered including the Atlantic salmon sashimi bundles and the Jaded Heaven cocktail. I don't think I would go back to Sunda, but if I you want a moderately trendy Asian experience in River North this might be the place for you - assuming you can't get into Japonais...
