I was in Chicago to attend a wedding and my friends and I decided to get dinner/drinks at Gilt recommended by a NYTimes article. http://www.nytimes.com/2 I'm so glad we picked this restaurant.  Everything we ordered was superb and reasonably priced. To share, we ordered the sweet balsamic roasted garlic toast that everyone loved. The ricotta gnocchi, one of the best I've ever had, melts in your mouth. The tilapia was fresh and very flavorful and the cornbread was amazing! The roast chicken was perfectly cooked and the portion was very generous. The mussels had a light flavorful broth (I wanted something light that night so if you're very hungry don't order this dish).  I was with a group of 8 and they let us linger at our table the whole night while we had drinks. Service was great!  I really wish they had a restaurant like this in the washington DC area. Good food at a great price!
