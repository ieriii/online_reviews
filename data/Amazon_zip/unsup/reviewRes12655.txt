This place has a great atmosphere! It's very laid back yet sophisticated, which I absolutely adore, and it really lends itself to enjoying your time there. The always-hungry-for-Latin-food boyfriend accompanied me for our beloved "First Meal" at 12:15pm on a Saturday afternoon and we had a delightful brunch. Our server was great - attentive and engaging without being pushy or overbearing. I opted for a juice blend of pineapple and peach (I asked to have them mixed) and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was better than I thought - a bit sweet (duh, because of the peach) - but delicious. The bf had coffee which he said was decent, and then it was time for the food. Admittedly, I was feeling a bit selfish that morning and barely even asked him how his food was until he was 60% done with it (*blushes*) but it's only because my Caribbean banana pancakes were wonderful! I was happy to have every morsel I could fit into my belly. I'm not even that much of a fan of pancakes but they were just so fluffy and soft! Mmm... My one concern is that the place was a bit empty... I had wished it were a bit more full of patrons so that I can be sure it stays open. I'm hoping there were just more people in the back outside than usual. Oh, and, parking on that stretch of Irving Park? Awkward. You either need to walk to the corner and up a ramp or jump over a railing of the elevated sidewalk to pay the meter. I will definitely remember not to wear a skirt/dress upon my next visit to spare the embarrassment of offering a free panty show to people driving by.
