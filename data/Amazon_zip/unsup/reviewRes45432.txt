I popped into this spot on Broadway with a girlfriend of mine for a drink and a nice dinner. I stopped at the bar first to wait for her arrival and ordered a Christmas ale they had on special, and the jumbo crab cakes. Very nice. Ale was sweet and just the right hoppy, and the crab cakes with fresh greens, walnuts, citrus slices and a tangy vinegarette salad was tastey. Lump crab was flavorful aside from the roumalade, and looked to be pan seared. Delicious. For the entree I had the whole wheat penne pasta with kale, mushrooms and grape tomatoes in a garlic and basil olive oil. I added a grilled salmon to the dish for some good protein. Well, the kale, mushrooms and olive oil were fantastic. Salmon was flaky and moist. I supposed I'm just not a fan of their wheat pasta; a bit too grainy for me. Service was prompt, courteous and very professional. Warm atmosphere, like a brand spanking new pub with intimate lighting and a good wine list. I'll have to return.
