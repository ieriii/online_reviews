I don't get this place. I've heard so many people say hot dog's is great and they seem to love this place, but every person who loves this place are usually not from Chicago, and think ooh, look, hotdogs and a long line, and we're in Chicago, let's squeeze our ass cheeks together and waddle over there. The specialty sausages are nothing special. The duck fat fries were burnt and nothing special when I got them. It's a hot dog guys. I'm not going to wait an hour for a mediocre hot dog or sausage. Just because it's says specialty sausage doesn't make it less mediocre. Go to the store, get some Vienna beef, and some s.rosen hot dog buns, chop up an onion and get some mustard. Same thing and you save 45 minutes waiting in line.
