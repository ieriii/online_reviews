I did not have high expectations for Piece. I understood that as someone who doesnt drink/watch sports/enjoy loud crowded restaurants this may never be the place for me, HOWEVER I did expect the pizza to be DELICIOUS(as I was told).............. I was THROUGHLY disappointed. The crust was HARD and burnt, they skimped on my spinach and feta topping(and considering that feta was $2 I was most disappointed), and there was hardly ANY CHEESE on my pizza. I understand that its New Haven style(aka not a lot of cheese) but my pizza was CRUST and SAUCE with a sprinkle of spinach and feta. I consumed the pizza simply because I was HUNGRY. My friend and I split the guacamole as an appetizer and werent terribly fond of it until our pizza arrived and proved disappointing. To be fair to the restaurant perhaps we just got a bad pizza(it happens) but since Piece isnt my scene I doubt I will be venturing back to Wicker Park to give them another try.
