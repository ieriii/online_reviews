My boyfriend and I went here after visiting Garlic and Chili Thai Cuisine. I was stuffed, but he wanted coffee and, being from Chicago, he swore this place was worth it. It definitely was. Once I arrived I ended up having several cups of coffee and splitting a slice of apple pie a la mode! The service was prompt and welcoming and the pie/coffee was delicious. The prices were good, too!
