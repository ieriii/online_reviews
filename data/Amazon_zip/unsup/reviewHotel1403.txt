Just returned home from a 3 night stay in a standard King room at the Millennium Knickerbocker. I lived on Lake Shore Drive in the Streeterville area for 10 years, so I was pretty familiar with the area. It was nice to visit my old stomping grounds and see what's changed in the area. Pros: great location, close to everything. A historical landmark, and right across the street from from the Drake Hotel, an even more historical Chicago landmark. Room size is average for a downtown hotel, which means "not very big" - but the bed was comfortable and bathroom was nicely decorated with modern fixtures. Cons: in the hotel's attempt to be eco-friendly, they installed modern, low-water-consumption toilets that aren't powerful enough to flush anything down but liquids - I had to call an engineer to plunge the toilet when we checked in. Also, there was some evidence of yellowish-brown crud in the corners of the bathroom (gross). The shower was another issue - they installed a nice ceiling mounted shower head as well as a handheld nozzle, but the shower itself (no bathtub) is very small and the glass door opens INWARD, so when you turn on the shower you either get shocked by cold water coming down from the ceiling, or you drench the door and bathroom floor if you choose to turn the shower on first and let it warm up. Not a very smart layout. Additionally, if you have a car, valet parking is mandatory at $53/day (there's no self-parking) but that's downtown parking for you. On the plus side, the valets are very friendly and pleasant, and are very prompt with retrieving your car when you call down for it.
