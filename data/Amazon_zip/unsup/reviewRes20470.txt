The Gage is a solid, go-to lunch destination for me. The decor is very chic and the lunch specials are really reasonable. The service is always good and every time I go, the manager comes over to the table to inquire about our experience. The smoked salmon sandwich is excellent and a big portion too and you get a delicious roll of bread when you sit down. Warm and inviting.
