very quick and yummy and the best part is they are cheap and you get a bunch of food. I normally get the chicken shwarma but they messed up my order last time and gave me lamb. I'm glad they did because I'm going to stick with lamb from now on. I have eaten in the restaurant a few times and even though there are a lot of people running in and out, you can normally find a seat. Plus, there is a grocery store two doors down where they have a good selection of beer for BYOB.
