People. You NEED to try this place out. This place has excellent authentic taste of Pakistani food. The owner and servers are very very humble and patient. The place has a simple decor, looks like old school pakistani restaurant in Pakistan it self, but I guess that's the reason since they want to give it an authentic touch. Food is AMAZING, especially their [Chicken Tawa Rice and Lahori Chicken Chargah] again. Other commercial places in devon are usually crowded it s the hidden gem places like these places that needs to be discovered.
