I went here with a few friends on a Friday evening after work. It's like a tapas place where the food comes in small french-ish dishes. Personally, I am not a fan of any restaurant that serves a bunch of small dishes... (I'm from Texas, I like everything in big portions), but I came just for the wine and cheese. Overall, it was a very good time. The wait staff was professional and provided great service, despite the ruckus of our crowd of folks. The 7-8 bottles of wine tasted great.... we are not wine connoisseurs, so we just randomly selected wines from their extensive menu. We ordered a few appetizers that I don't really remember eating, except for the cheese.... mmmm cheese.  Purple Pig's on a good location off Michigan so a good place to go after work.  A good way to end the week. Definitely worth checking out at least once to drink a bunch of wine. Four stars for sure.
