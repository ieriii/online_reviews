So, I would probably give it a 2.5 to be fair. I just reviewed the restaurant Piece and gave it 4 stars. I just don't think their pizza is all that great when it is carried out. I have even picked it up and it is Meh....It gets all chewy like some people mentioned. I will go to Santullos next door for a good carry out thin crust in the hood. I still love you though Piece! Don't hate me!
