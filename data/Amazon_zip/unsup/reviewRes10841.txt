This place was introduced to me by an ex-girlfriend. I immediately fell in love.....with the restaurant...not the ex-girlfriend. =) Ever since then, I've paid the Bongo Room many visitations and have enjoyed the fare every single time. Definitely a tasty breakfast/brunch place to get your palette wet. To the men: I suggest you visit this place as a single man. There is many "eye candies" to be seen in this quaint Wicker Park Sunday chill spot. To the women: Enjoy the food...wish I can give you the same advice as I gave the men, but 9 out of 10 the women are definitely much more beautiful than the men. Sorry fellas, oh wait that includes me as well. =/
