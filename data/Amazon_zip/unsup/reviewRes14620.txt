I've been here twice. The first time was shortly after they opened, so I'm not holding the very-definitely-not-awesome service too much against them because that's just how it goes in the first couple months a place is open. The second time was more recently, and I could definitely tell that they'd gotten their feet under them, but the service at the bar was still slow. Not angry-fist-inducing slow, more like cranky-face-inducing slow, but still. Slow. The service is I feel like the biggest ding against this place. The rest of the stuff that doesn't wow me is pretty subjective. For example: their beer is good, but not nearly as good as I'd expect from a brewery. Their food, on the other hand, is amazing, but *really* expensive for what you get. And there are families with little kids at the tables if you go early, and I--I mean, I know, it's a restaurant, too, but I just get really freaked out by babies in the bar. Really, really freaked out.  The last time I was here, my friend and I ate, had one beer apiece, and then (nearly two hours after we walked in) we gave up on refills and went across the street to Cole's to keep drinking. So, you know. I think that probably says it all.
