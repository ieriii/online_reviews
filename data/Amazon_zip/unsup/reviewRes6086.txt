I was only in Chicago for one night and my request was for Chicago steak--here was the answer. And boy, did it please! You cannot go wrong with only choice here. Pick your steak and it will be prepared to your taste. Try a crumble (I chose mushroom). Before you get to the steak, you may get side-tracked by the bacon-wrapped scallops, or the salad, or the wine... You get the picture. We were fortunate (or unfortunate!) that we had to go to a Blackhawks game or we would have continued to stuff our faces in there. If I get back to Chi-town, I'm going to stop by Wildfire again.
