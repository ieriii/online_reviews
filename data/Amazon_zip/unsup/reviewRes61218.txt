2nd time I've eaten here - not coming back. Their guacamole was soupy - couldn't even taste the avocado (no seriously). Tacos Al Pastor were below average - didn't taste like Pork. But most of all the service was bad - where was the hostess and literally saw our waitress once until after we ordered (when we got our check)?
