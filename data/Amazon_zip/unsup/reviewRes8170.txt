What can I say? Anything that does not display a reddish/brownish/blackish color, please omit from your meal. Chances are, It's not worth the space in your precious and LIMITED stomach capacity. The chicken, salad bar, and appetizers are just filler to keep you away from the gold. (They're not that good anyways) I give this place 3 stars if you eat everything that's placed in front of you. If you know your food and plan your meal accordingly, the high-priced meal is warranted a 5 star score.  Ah yes, Red means Stop... and Green means GO!!!!!!!!! Keep that button on green, please.
