I wanted something special to cap off a last minute trip to visit friends in Chicago. So I was clicking through Time Out and happened on the interview with Dale Levitski. Top Chef contestant, new restaurant blah blah blah...and what $60 tasting menu?! This is the only idea I contributed to the trip's itinerary and thank you very much for making me look good ;) 1417, Scallop, Wagyu, Lemon. Cocktail had kick. Scallop and Wagyu cooked perfectly. Dessert that was refreshing instead of sickeningly sweet...if life is giving you lemons Sprout turned them into some kick ass dessert go try it. I'll swing by again on my next visit.
