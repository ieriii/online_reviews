So good! I often leave Grand Lux very full because I can't resist an appetizer, entree, & dessert (& their entrees alone could feed 3 people!). They have pretty good drinks as well. The only thing keeping Grand Lux from a 5 star review is the wait to get in. It seems like everyone in Chicago knows how good this place is!
