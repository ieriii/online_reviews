One of the best meals I have ever had. I was visiting Chicago a few months ago and a friend took us here, it was amazing. It is massive in size and impressive at that. The soup, bread, and appetizer options would be great on their own. Shrimp, lobster bisque, roasted peppers, etc. But be careful not to fill up on that alone. When you turn your place card to green an endless array of servers will run at you with all the meat you can consume. You name it, they have it. The Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon was probably my favorite. All cooking preferences are readily available. I was a little drunk so that detracted from the meal a bit, but it was still awesome. There was also a two story high wine cellar where a young woman fetches your bottle of wine via a trapeze. The restaurant itself is really quite impressive. It is tastefully decorated, grandiose, and a great dining experience for the most part. Only detraction is the fact that they really need to get a bathroom on the first floor. Someone else picked up the tab, but I know it was hefty. But for a nice occasion, or if trying to impress, check this place out. My only wish is that they had one in NYC.
