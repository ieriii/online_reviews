I've been to The Pig twice in the past month and I'm a fan. First off, let me say that this restaurant having a location right on Michigan Avenue might detour us locals. Don't be scared because I think most tourists will make their way to T.G.I Friday's down the street. This place is for real. If you want to grab a nice glass of vino with some fun sharing plates. I don't see this establishment being comfortable for big groups as it's so small. I think more of an intimate dining experience between 2-4 people would be more appropriate. But then again that's just me being the type of person who needs space. The dining room itself which also includes the bar is basically just one room. It looks like someone's expensive country kitchen with beautiful tiles on the wall and it's very inviting. In the warmer months, they've got choice patio property to enjoy the breeze and people watching. The service has always been very friendly when I've gone and I always hear more than enough suggestions of the server's favorites. The food was really tasty and savory. I would suggest just splitting plates between two people so you can really enjoy the portions. Style of food is a mix between Italian, Mediterranean and Spanish. That's the best way I could describe what I was seeing and eating. These are the items I've tried so far: Mixed Greens with Feta, Radishes & Red Wine Mint Vinaigrette (very tasty!) Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese & Black Olive Tapenade Panini (Awesome!) The Cured Meat Platter (seriously the way to go if you want to try it all!) They've got Smears which you can dip bread or crackers in and I believe I've tried all of them. My absolute favorite though is Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda This place is worth checking out for sure. It's nice to stop by after a day of shopping and running errands,
