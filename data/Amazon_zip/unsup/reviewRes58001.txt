This would have to be one of our favorite restaurants. They always offer generous portions of delicious food. Be prepared to wait if you go for dinner after six. Some of our favorites would have to be the bruschette and the calamari appetizers, most of the seafood pasta dishes (the menu rotates through the seasons), the pan roasted pork chops entree, and the pizza napoletana. Having a menu of gluten-free pastas is wonderful too.
