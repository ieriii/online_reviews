This place has some killer burgers that have me going back every so often. They also make their own ketchup which is tasty. Last time I had the Ella Fig-Gerald and before that I had the Red Spruce Springsteen, Black 'N Blue both burgers were worth the trip. My friend once had the The Frenchie which i plan to get the next time I go. They also have some amazing Pear Cider - try it.
