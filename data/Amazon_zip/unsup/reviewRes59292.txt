I had my birthday dinner there with about 15 of my friends the other night. Everything was perfect! The food was amazing and our waiter was so attentive! He was sure to always check with me to make sure I was enjoying myself since I was the birthday girl. Even with such a big group, the atmosphere made the dinner really intimate. Many of my friends had never eaten at Indie Cafe before, so I was so glad to share this gem with them. No negative feedback from anyone in my group! Awesome food reasonably priced. BYOB tops it all off! We will all be back again and again.
