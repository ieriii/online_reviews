This restaurant bourbon bar is the dazzling pride of Logan Square. It holds its own with the best restaurants on Randolph St. and Downtown. I remember when it used to be the Winds Cafe,local dive bar, but they've taken it to a whole new evolution. The mouth watering dishes come out of a kitchen smaller then what I have at home, and the staff is incredibly welcoming and attentive. The whole bar is soft lit and warm, but be advised that you will have a long long wait for a table just about any time of the week in the evenings. Just give your name and number to the Host/Hostess and they can call you when your table is ready. The 3$ bourbon shot list feels like a gift, and the bartender can always give good recommendations if you are unfamiliar with any of the labels. There are true gems on that list, not just token bottom shelf whiskies.The head bartender Derek believes in his cocktails, and he has trained his bartenders likewise. They will come out well balanced, delicious, and satisfying. The Longman Manhattan is a treat.
