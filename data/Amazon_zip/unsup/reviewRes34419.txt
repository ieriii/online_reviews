The best falafel I have ever had! I love that they put tons of hummus on the sandwich too and break up the falafel so it's easier to eat. You get tons of food for very little money, which is always a good thing. My husband and I can eat there for about $10 and completely stuff ourselves. One star off because it's not somewhere where I would want to sit down to eat, and the bathroom there is really super nasty (seriously, don't go in there. pee in your pants if you have to.)
