I'd been ordering a "skim mocha" for weeks and then ordering one on a certain day was told that "there are no skim mochas." Oh well. Fake out from the coffee bar. The breakfast service was a bit slow. The lunch time cafeteria was rather expensive for a lunch but the chicken kabobs were HUGE and fed us for several meals. Good Greek and Mediterranean salads. Lovely atmosphere.
