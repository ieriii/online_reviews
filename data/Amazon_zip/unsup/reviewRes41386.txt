This is the hot spot for anyone who comes into Viet-Town in Chicago, IL. Location: Located conveniently at the corner, it's hard for anyone to miss this busy restaurant. When I lived in MIchigan, this was the hot spot to go to find food of our taste when we visited Chicago. This is a good location for people to sit down and have speedy service to get good Vietnamese food. Service: Though the service of preparing the food is speedy, the actual rating for service at the table is another story. You better know what you want before you sit down or you will definitely get gestures such as eyes being rolled at you, deep sighs to let you know it's for you, and don't think you;l get the waiters attention back as you will be ignored several times before you can get the waiter/waitress back to your table. They really don't want to waster their time but they really don't care about yours. They try to get you in an out and that's that. Food: It's hard to find a place that provides goo Vietnamese food. Their food was good and they have a variety to choose from. There are other restaurants up and down the strip but they aren't as good as the quality here. When I moved to IL, of course this was the only place I thought to be the only one in existence. BUT, i was wrong...I have searched and found others that you can find in my other posts.
