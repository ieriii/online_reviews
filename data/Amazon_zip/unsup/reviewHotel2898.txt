They have the BEST beds. But they need to work on the cooling situation. The hotel was so hot when I was there and the air didn't work in any of the rooms. And what's a comfortable bed when you're sweating in your sleep? You just can't have one without the other if you're looking for a good night's rest. We stayed here for my friend's wedding and the hotel brought us girls complimentary champagne and strawberries the night before the wedding. That was pretty nice of them. And I love that they have Starbucks coffee in all the rooms. It sure beats Folgers! Be careful with the valet though... apparently if there's a "shift change," as one employee explained to us, then they can lose your car. We were 45 mins late to the rehearsal dinner because they lost our car and it took them an entire hour to find it! Com'on, Really?!
