It isn't called the Heaven Burger for nothing. You'll have a come to Jesus moment the minute you bite into a glorious combination of double cream brie, sliced pear, smoked berry jam on a toasted oatmeal bun. Paired with their sweet potato fries (and a most excellent barbeque sauce), it was certainly heavenly bliss on a plate. Fifty/50 is a standard sports bar, but with a unique menu, a fairly decent beer list (Founders Dirty Bastard was my drink of choice for the evening), and some intriguing cocktail options. Unfortunately, I'm just not a cocktail kind of gal, but the descriptions certainly sounded good for those who are. Apparently this place has the best wings in the city, and they boast a mac and cheese waffle - reason enough to try this spot. I mean - mac and cheese waffles? Genius, my friends. Sarah E., Jamie Z. and I stopped by this place at about 8 p.m. on Friday, and had a number of tables to choose from. Considering it was negative 50 outside, I wasn't surprised. The service was great, and the vibe is very chill. Gotta love a sports bar with a twist.
