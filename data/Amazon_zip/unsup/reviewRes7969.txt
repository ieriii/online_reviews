I consider myself somewhat of a pizza snob and Spacca Napoli did not disappoint. There was a special salad of the day which was roasted beets. It was basically sliced beets and onions. NOT GOOD at all. It was a chore to eat it. I have never seen so many beets in my life. Ordered the diavolo pizza- Came out perfectly cooked. The cheese was rich and creamy, loved the spicy salami as well as the basil. The crust was real crispy, but a tad soggy towards the middle. Beautiful char on the bottom. Some of the best neapolitan pizza I have had. Overall I give it four stars for the below average service and that god awful salad. Check it out!
