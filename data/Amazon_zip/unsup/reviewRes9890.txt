I keep going back and I don't know why. Oh yeah, because it is right down the street and the beer is the best. Their Sunday deal is perfect (a large pizza and a growler for $25) But.... We definitely got food poisoning here. No doubt. I would never make this claim if I weren't completely positive. I went with two other people and we shared a few pizzas. We all got sick the next morning. I still had some of the leftover pizza in my fridge (turned out it was the white pizza) and my boyfriend unknowingly ate some and got the same symptoms we did. My mom, who I was with originally, let them know as a courtesy to them (just a heads up), and whoever she spoke to denied it saying it was impossible and we must be wrong. Well I basically ran a controlled experiment and determined that it was, indeed, their pizza. At least pretend you're sorry, don't accuse us of making stuff up and imply that we call pizza places and say they poisoned us for sport. This was a while ago and I'm over it, but their customer service has plenty of room for improvement. The service is hit or miss. I've had wonderful servers, I've also had one very terrible one in particular. Same goes for bartenders. 3 stars because even after all of this I keep coming back. Clearly this place is popular enough that no matter what the Yelp reviews say it will always be packed.
