I have been wanting to go here for months, finally made my over on a Thursday night. It was around 8:30pm and wasn't overly packed so we were seated within about 10 minutes. Food I tried: chips/salsa/guac, shrimp torta (which is not on the menu, but happened to be the special that day), mushroom torta, limonada, pineapple/mint drink (agua del dia), churros with chocolate dipping sauce, classic hot chocolate and almendrado hot chocolate. I was full to say the least. The chips were just a tad bit too hard for my taste, but I really liked the tomatillo salsa and guac. The limonada was sour in a good way and the agua del dia was sweet but not overly so. I liked the shrimp, but didn't love it, the flavors just didn't mesh well for me. The mushroom torta was fantastic, I think the goat cheese really makes this worthwhile. The churros are the best I've ever tasted, soft and sugary and warm, yum!! I would seriously go back just to get these and nothing else. The classic hot chocolate was great, but the almendrado wasn't sweet enough. I wasn't a fan of the seating arrangements, but I shall return to try the caldos next time!
