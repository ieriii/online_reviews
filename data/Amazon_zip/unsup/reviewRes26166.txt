Finally Pequod's! I have had you bookmarked for too long. I am a big fan of deep dish pizza. I have heard good things about Pequod's and was happy to get the opportunity to eat here. So I put on my pizza eating pants and made way for Deep Dish.  Most of the time I got out to eat, I am a Lone Ranger. So I don't normally go to pizza places because I feel awkward ordering an entire pizza to myself.  I went for the Sausage and Pepperoni with/ Onions Deep Dish- Here's a couple things you need to know about Pequod's Pizza.  1) The Crust is dark and a little charred 2) Most of the deep dish will be dough The ingredients were spot on. The sausage was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The spices in the sausage were insanely delicious. The pepperoni's were average. The crust is crisp and the middle of the pizza is doughy and delicious, but not undercooked. The sauce was flavorful. This was a excellent pizza. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ http://www.yelp.com/biz_ I would recommend this if you are ever in this area. The pizza is some of the best deep dish I have had.
