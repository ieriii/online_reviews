The concierge at our hotel recommended this restaurant located in Greek Town, and it was not disappointing. After drinking the Greek beer, our party decided to order the combo that came with samples of three appetizers, salad, four entrees, and three desserts. The combo was $21 per person and was way more than we could eat. I would recommend one combo for two people.  The food was very tasty and service was prompt. In particular, the in-house made gyro was excellent, the pastichio was delicious, the Greek chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender, and all three desserts were divine. Our only misstep was an eggplant spread that nobody at our table enjoyed. The atmosphere is fun and festive, right down to yelling "Huppa!" when our waiter lit the flaming cheese appetizers. If you feel like pretending you are Greek for an evening, check it out. You won't be disappointed.
