Glenn's is a small, casual place that has walls lined with chalkboard menus and a small back counter lined with ceral boxes. The first time I went there, on the glowing recommendation of a friend, I went for dinner and I was not disappointed. I liked it so much that I went back to try their breakfast and again.....I was not disappointed. It's a very relaxed neighborhood place that has good food and good service.
