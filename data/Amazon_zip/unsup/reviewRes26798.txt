This is the most unique, best pizza in the city hands down. You know, we all have those nights when we are hungry, drunk, or bored, and think, why not put a frozen pizza in the oven, and let the crust burn, and eat it. Now you dont have to do that, just order Peaquods. Somehow this burnt crust makes the pizza amazing, and the rest aint bad either. We usually order food, but with the upstairs redone, it is not a bad place to eat and watch some games.
