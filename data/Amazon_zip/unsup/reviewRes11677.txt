i found my new favorite pizza place. the plain pizza is delicious with goat cheese, spinach and broccoli. the crust is perfect and the sauce is to die for. the atmosphere is awesome too. very open and inviting with great light coming through the mostly glass roof. definitely a place i will be frequenting this summer.
