Really no need to add another 5-star review, but this place literally blew me away, I couldn't resist. AMAZING service and food. And really, you get your money's worth. The best cuts of meat you can get, not to mention the fantastic salad bar and sides. Cannot wait to go back. I can't imagine any of the Brazilian steakhouses in Chicago being any better... so I'm just going to keep coming to Fogo.
