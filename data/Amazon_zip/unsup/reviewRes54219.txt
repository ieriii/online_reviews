First of all, I was thrilled when I called here and asked what vegan options were on the menu, and the gentleman on the phone actually knew what I was talking about!! There are many vegan options, and the food is delicious. The portions are huge and the guacamole is awesome! Word of warning, the fried plantains are addictive. They put this awesome garlic sauce on them.
