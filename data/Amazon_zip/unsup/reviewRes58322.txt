The tables were too cramped together for this fine dining restaurant. We had no privacy what-so-ever. The service was sub-par, there was no menu explanation, even after we were asked if it was our first time there, which it was. The appetizer we ordered was calamari, shrimp and crab cakes. What we were brought was a sorry display of some fried seafood that would not even match Red Lobster. Overall, for the price we paid, the food and service were nothing like we had expected and we will not be returning.
