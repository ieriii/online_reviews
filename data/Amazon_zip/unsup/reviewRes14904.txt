OMG. Best. Buns. Ever. And I'm not just talking about mine {har har har... lame joke, sorry}. No really though, the sandwich + hamburger buns are the best damn hunks of carbs ever. They make all their bread in-house and being the bread connoisseur that I am, I can safely attest that the soft, dense, not-too-sweet, not-too-salty buns are hands down, Chicago's finest. And fine... since most normal people care more about what's between the buns... you'll be happy to know that the burger was solid {he just asked for a plain burger + bacon... nothing fancy pants... he likes it one way :: boring + delicious, and that's just how they delivered}, and the chicken sandwich was even better. The chicken breast was really moist, and it comes with two pieces between those buns, so it's kinda large and in charge. I scarfed it all down though... it was too good to stop! The best part of the meal - bottles of sriracha chilling on the bar. Perfect. Speaking of the bar... bar seating is my usual preference which is a good thing here. We put our name down for a table on a Friday night and the hostess said it was a 1.5-2 hr wait. We lurked around the bar for our first round of drinks and voila ~ scored ourselves a cozy spot at the bar between Chatty McChattersville and Mr. Too Much Cologne. Regardless of our surrounding company, we had great service at the bar... our bartender didn't bat an eye when I was a complete pain in the ass about my sandwich {hey hey, don't judge... I'm picky fo' sure, and dairy is scary... you don't want lactards eating fontina cheese...I was doing a public service}, and didn't make me feel like a sinner for ordering wine in a brewpub. And to top it off, the bartenders know a lot about their wine offerings and helped me make some good vino choices that night. Thumbs up.
