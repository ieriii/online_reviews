We placed an order for pick up an were told it would be ready in twenty minutes. We showed up in thirty minutes and the hostess was completely clueless about our order. She first brought me the wrong ticket, then she said the order must be under the wrong name. Then she disappeared for a few minutes (likely taking so long because of her sky high heels) and brought back our handwritten order. It was very clear to me that they never put the order in the system, but the hostess never explained the delay or apologized. After another ten minutes of waiting, she brought me my bill and disappeared for a while again. The next time I saw her I asked how long it would be and she said she was just going to the kitchen to bag it up for us. Ten minutes later (now almost an hour since we placed our order) she brought us our bag. The ticket stapled to the bag said IN HOUSE-ON THE FLY, confirming that they forgot us entirely. We were very disappointed that we didn't get an explanation or apology for the problem. That being said, the food was OUTSTANDING. I was very sad about our initial experience because everything we ate was wonderful. I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich with a massive piece of corn bread and my husband got the q2 with pulled pork and ribs with fries. We also ordered a side of cole slaw and greens. The cole slaw was average but the greens were outstanding. Pros: The taste of the food, they cut the ribs for us, the barbecue sauce is delicious. Cons: Take-out service needs some tweaking and the place was LOUD. We'll try it again, but they've lost a few points with us.
