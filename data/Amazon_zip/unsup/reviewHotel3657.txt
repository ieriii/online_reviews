Beautiful hotel with a kind and helpful staff.  Carlos the doorman has all the 411 for everywhere you want to go. The room was very nice and comfortable. The only complaint I have is that it was too warm! I pumped down the thermostat to 60 degrees and still had to kick the covers off. Don't know what was up with that.
