We live directly behind Irazu and wish that we could go back.. but we will never go back. The manager is rude to customers every time we've been there. Yes you are busy some nights, this does not give you the right to yell at your paying customers. The food is slightly better than your average taco joint, including the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Cafe Lagaurdia (cuban) on Armitage is much better in every way.
