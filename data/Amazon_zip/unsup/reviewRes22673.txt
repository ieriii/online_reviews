After seeing this on a Food Network Show (I don't remember.. Good Eats?), I was curious why this place was so good. I was entranced by their website, so my boyfriend and I drove out here to check it out. It was a unique experience in which you pull up to a spot, flip a switch, and make your order through the speaker. Ten minutes later, your hot dogs stuffed with fries and other goodies are delivered to your car. The dogs were good, but nothing special for the price you pay. You're better off going to Gene and Jude's for the same taste and cheaper price. The only reason you would come out here is for the experience. Also, it is difficult to get in and out of the parking lot.
