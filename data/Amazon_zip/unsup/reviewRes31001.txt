Ever wondered what "Asian Fusion" means? Well, gotta try Sunda. Really good food experience with unique combinations of asian ingredients. If you try one thing on the menu - gotta try the signature roll w/Kobe beef over fried sticky rice. Really good and unique combination that makes you want to have more and more. Looks great on the plate and even better in your mouth. Second thing must try is the their spicy "tail of two tunas" roll. The combination of two kinds of tuna, avocado, and the spicy sauce makes it a magic tasting roll. I could eaten two whole rolls by myself.  But let's back up. There are a few other unique things to start with like the seafood fried rinds that arrive on the table as you sit down. Incredibly colorful pieces that you hesitate to eat because they look beautiful. But do take a bite - taste like a light pork rind. Also try the warm edemame with a tiny bit of salt. Then order the rock shrimp in tempura batter with mayo sauce and candied walnuts. The one disappointment was the other signature roll with fried tuna and jalapeo. Kind of a bad experiment that tasted like fried fish in buffalo wing sauce and a jalapeno on top. Dessert was also pretty good. Can't remember the custard that we tried but had this ice cream covered in caramel and candied walnuts that was the bomb. Wow. Also, shout out to the white orchid tea from mighty leaf. It was lunch and feeling a bit of a cold so I uncharacteristically ordered tea for drink. Glad i did. Add the really cool (yet a bit trendy) atmosphere and you have a place that you must try.
