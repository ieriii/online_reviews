The food was great, but the atmosphere made me go from a solid 4 stars to 3. Went here with my parents and boyfriend for an early Saturday night dinner. The lights were dimmed so much that I had to squint to see the menu- I noticed other diners with mini flashlights as well. The music was all contemporary, which clashed with the upscale decor, a mix of rich colors and velvet. It felt like it was trying too hard to be a hip place. Our waiter was definitely attentive and had super hearing- once mention of a menu item when I thought he was out of an earshot and he would rush over to explain the dish in detail. I had a crab claws as a starter, which were fine as crab claws go. Then I had a Caesar salad, a bit heavy on the dressing for my taste. My boyfriend enjoyed his "house salad" which had blue cheese and shrimp- not your typical fare. My filet was cooked to my medium liking, and served on a searing hot plate. Definitely try the gnocchi and brussel sprouts as sides. We had butter cake and cherry cobbler for dessert- served with a HUGE bowl of whipped cream. Desserts are definitely share able- 2 was more than our party of needed. The food along would bring me back, but the noise level and dark interior were a bit disappointing.
