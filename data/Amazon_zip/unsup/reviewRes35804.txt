Actually a 3.5 I have been to many Chinese restaurants in my time and this one is satisfactory. It is not amazing by any means, however it has a number of dishes that I could eat without feeling disappointed. I have yet to find a really good Chinese restaurant in Chicago so this place has become my default Chinese stop. It is not NY/London/HK quality Chinese but then again I am in Chicago so I should lower my expectations a little. Overall it is the best of the bunch and has enough good dishes that I don't feel like it is a bad experience. Plus the prices are very reasonable and the serving sizes are generous.
