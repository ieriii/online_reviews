I really hate writing negative reviews, but I had an unpleasant experience here last night. I was supposed to have dinner here with 3 of my friends. Two of us showed up and were told that we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. So my friend and I sat at the bar, ordered a couple glasses of wine, and then got the prosciutto bread balls because my friend was starving. The third member of our party showed up and the place was starting to get extremely crowded (it's very small) so we nicely asked if we could be seated now, because our fourth person was going to be there in 5 minutes. They still wouldn't seat us. A few minutes later, our fourth person arrived and we went to the hostess stand and let them know our whole group had arrived. We were told it would be an hour before a table of 4 would be available. My friend looked over her shoulder at a huge table with nobody sitting at it and said, "Why can't we sit there?" And the hostess said, "I have a party of 10 coming in soon and I have to seat THEM there." So, basically, they don't take reservations or hold tables...for most people. And they'll hold a table for 10 people who haven't shown up yet, but 3 girls out of a party of 4 can't be seated. So we left and I have no inclination to go back there. The wine and food were good, but overpriced (sorry, $13 for a decent but not amazing glass of wine is just crazy to me). I know this is a very hot restaurant and I really wanted to like it, but I was disappointed in the experience
