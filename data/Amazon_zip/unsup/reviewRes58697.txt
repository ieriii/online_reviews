One of my favorite restaurants ever! I've been twice and had the tasting menu both times. The first time I was completely floored at the amazing variety of items they brought out. It was almost too much food. Almost. The second time we ordered our favorites from the tasting menu and some additions.My Favorites:*Anything A la plancha - the wagyu beef skirt steak is amazing as are the shrimp.*The amazing salad that comes wrapped in serrano ham...*Bacon wrapped dates in blue cheese fondue*The to die for butternut squash dumplingsThe presentation is amazing and the service is great if you engage your server and ask what is the best new thing.I want to go on their once a month outing/lunch with the head chef to the green market here in Chicago. I'll let you know how that experience goes.
