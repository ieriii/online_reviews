I used to like this place a lot, but I'm growing more and more disenchanted. If you eat in, it's okay. I've had some nice meals in the restaurant, but it's been a while. The last times I ordered takeout, it was really unenjoyable. I would have been better off at the grocery. The fish wasn't cut well, with large, chewy pieces of fat. The flavor wasn't really there. I was disappointed and I've stuck closer to home ever since for my takeout sushi.
