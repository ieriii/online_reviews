The Allerton hotel is so beautiful, a mixed of contemporary and modern altogether. The staff was nice and respectful, the rooms are small but it is not that bad as some portrait them to be. The view is beautiful if you get a room overlooking Michigan Avenue. I loved the Hotel, it was next to everything! I am coming back next year and will book the same room again.
