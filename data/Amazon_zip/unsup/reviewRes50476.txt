I LOVE Wishbone. If I had to choose a last meal, it would be this: salmon cakes w/ hollandaise sauce, scrambled eggs, cheese grits, a biscuit with jam, and an iced Mississippi Mud. It doesn't get better than that. I've also had the corn cakes w/ red pepper sauce & they were quite tasty. But really.. blackened catfish, shrimp & grits, crawfish cakes.. how can you go wrong?
