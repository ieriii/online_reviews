Went here on a Friday night after work to see what all the buzz was about. Overall, this is a good attempt at the cured meats/small plate/cheese concept, and has the makings of being really good. We arrived at around 6pm, and it was already getting crowded. The space is quite small, and I can see that there are probably seating issues later in the evenings, but we did manage to score a nice, two person table in a corner. The decor is warm, and I particularily liked the tilework on the booth wall.  Our service was fantastic. Our server was well informed on the different cured meat, cheese, and wine choices, and helped us select a delicious spread to chow on prior to sampling some of the small plates. The pig's ear was decent, and the Wagyu steak was tasty. Not spectacular, but definitely decent. Dessert was also a big plus. We had a fried doughnutty thing with cheese and chocolate filling, as well as the butterscotch pudding.  Both were delicious! Overall, I think the minor issues should be panned out soon. We had no trouble finding the restaurant, as there is signage right off of Michigan Ave. Perhaps this is a new addition. This is a cool joint in an area that I almost never frequent, so 4 stars it is!
