I was writing a couple of poor reviews for some businesses and I wanted to write one about a place I LOVE. Wishbone immediately came to mind. What can I say? I've been a SUPER FAN of Wishbone since the days that we'd wait out the door at Grand and Wood. Those meals, often served to me by the wife of cartoonist Chris Ware (random!), were a big part of why I learned to love Chicago. Sure, it's changed a bit since then ... but I think it would have to as a result of the sheer volume this restaurant and its sisters do every week (particularly on the weekend). But the food! It's amazing. I've really had basically the same thing at least one weekend a month (sometimes more) for 15 years. The crawfish cakes are AMAZING. And the wait staff if pretty stellar -- quick, efficient, accurate and, my favorite, nice. Yep. A perfectly positive review for a perfectly positive place!
