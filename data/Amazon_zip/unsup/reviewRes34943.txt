Solid spot for BYOB sushi. Sashimi is always fresh. Awesome ceviche roll, cool little spot. It's pricey for BYOB. Definitely delicious but my tab here is always more than Butterfly, granted Sushi X is better because of the Sashimi and the service. This place is not clearing your table as you finish your food making room for the next group. They let you enjoy the dinner. I would say this is the spot for a date night or small group dinner. I eat from here often, and will eat here again.
