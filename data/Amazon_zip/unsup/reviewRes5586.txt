I will start out the review by saying the food was great. I know a lot of people (myself included) scan the first sentence of Yelp reviews for restaurant recommendations so no real problems with the food. The night started out pretty rough. The hostess stand is right inside the door but you have to get to that by walking through the outdoor patio and it's not really a hostess stand, it's just one of those tables where servers usually enter orders. We were shuffled inside by someone that when I started to ask where to put in our name, directed me to the bathroom. Once I had toured the restaurant, and realized my/her mistake I made my way to the hostess stand.  We put our name in and she started to show us to our table but realized the third member of our party had not yet arrived and about as rudely as possible, told us they did not seat incomplete parties. A little stunned (since our table was ready, and would remain so until we sat) we went to sit outside and wait for our friend. I get the policy if you have a party of 25 and 2 of them have not yet arrived, but 3? When it started pouring (there is no sheltered waiting area, we thought surely she would reconsider seating us. "What if we promise to order an extra cocktail and start ordering food." Alas, she upheld the rules and three seats sat vacant for another 15 minutes.  Like I said before, the food was great. My only real complaint is that everything was super greasy. They should incorporate some celery or carrots to cut the grease between plates.  Stupidly bad service, too cramped, but the food was good enough that I'll go back.
