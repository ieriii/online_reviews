Great breakfast joint - they do everything a little different here (my french toast had crushed corn flakes covering it). The bloodies are about right and since this place is always packed, you can feel how good this place is. I sat at the bar in the back, and since there was only one bartender, the service was a bit slow - not that I expected more from one person.
