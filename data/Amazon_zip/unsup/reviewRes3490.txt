This place is a revelation! My friends told me that we were going to a place with great chicken wings, and I thought, "Eh, how great can they be?" After I had a bite, I was blown away. First off, the wings are huge. Ordering five wings is like ordering half a chicken. The skin is perfectly crispy and the meat is tender and juicy. I ordered the Seoul Sassy sauce for my wings, and it was sweet, a little spicy, and had green onions on top. Perfection. I also ordered the original Buddha Bowl. This is what they call their bebimbop. It was also huge and should really be shared with another person. Vegetables were nicely marinated, and I really like bebimbop, so I was digging it, though it definitely didn't outshine the wings. While you're there, you might want to try some of their Korean soft drinks. My friend ordered a milk soda, which was pretty good. I didn't see what other offerings they had, but now I'm curious. I wish they had a Loop location because I'd go there for lunch every week...well, maybe I'm glad they don't have a Loop location.
