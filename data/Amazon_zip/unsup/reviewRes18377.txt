I would have given XOCO 4 stars if it wasn't for the 30 minute wait. That being said, it went during lunch time on a beautiful day--it is to be expected. I got the Chipotle Chicken sandwich which was delicious. I would have preferred if it was white meat as opposed to dark. The flavor was delicious and the bread was the perfect texture. My mom got the side salad--too boring for me, but she enjoyed that with a side of chips and guac. The guac was great; however, the salsa was a bit mild for my taste--it was very flavorful though. I would definitely come back here again and try to Vegetable Bowl.
