I love this place so hard. The food is always above and beyond FANTASTIC. I would pay so much more for it (shhhh). Never ever again have a bad experience eating Asian. If you want fried rice, they have it, but it is the BEST FRIGGIN' FRIED RICE YOU WILL EVER TASTE! If you want fancy soups, holy moly- talk about comfort food/ cold busting' amazingness. Everything I have tried here has been OUTSTANDING. The service is great, the community dining experience is fun, the owner/ managers are caring and helpful, and this is BY FAR on my TOP 5 places to eat in the entire city. Anthony Bourdain would LOVE THIS PLACE! LOVE!
