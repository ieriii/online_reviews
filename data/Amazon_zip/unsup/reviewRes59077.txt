Don't go on the weekends!!! Unfortunately, I made that mistake.  The place was LOUD as hell, immediately giving me a headache.  I thought I was in a concert hall.  This place has huge ceilings, which seem to amplify every sound, there was even an echoe!  The food was bland, nothing special.  The mult-grain pancakes I ordered were too thick, not light and fluffy at all.  I thought I was eating compressed wheat dough! There is no consistency in the quality of food at Yolk. I've eaten at the one in River North and the multi-grain pancakes were perfect (I got that after eating the horrible buttermilk pancakes which tasted like lemon? ) If you want breakfast in the South Loop, save yourself a headache and go to Eleven City Diner around the corner from Yolk on Wabash.  Their pancakes and apple turkey sausage are insane! The quality of their breakfast food makes Yolk look like White Castles!
