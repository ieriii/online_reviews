Took my wife and 9 year old son here for breakfast and had an outstanding meal. My corn cakes/black beans were delicious, and my wife's Eggs New Orleans were awesome. Even my son's grilled cheese sandwich was a standout. A wonderful addition to Andersonville, and I'm sorry it took me so long to try it!
