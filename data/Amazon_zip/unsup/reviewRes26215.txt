That pizza was delicious! As everyone said, the caramelized cheese crust is crunchy and good and it's my favorite I've had so far. A 10 inch deep dish is the perfect size to split between two people, and I loved that it wasn't greasy and the crust was light instead of doughy. I didn't like that it's $1.50 for each topping. What the heck? Also when "fresh basil" is an option as a topping, I'm looking for a layer of basil leaves, not a few scattered slivers that don't even seem like a topping at all. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was relaxed. Parking can be a bit of a pain, but I'd definitely go back when I'm craving some crunchy cheese crust!
