I took a visitor here with me for dinner on a Saturday night. We waited for a table for about twenty minutes before being seated in the tent-thing outside the front of the restaurant. Surprisingly, given the cold weather, the space heaters in there kept us nice and warm. Vegetarian dishes are a bit sparse on the menu, but I was able to make do. The creamed feta and cucumber smear was amazing! The feta itself was deliciously unhealthy, and the toast that came with it was lightly oiled. That course alone made the trip here worthwhile. The restaurant itself is very loud, other customers were sat very close to us and sometimes their shouted conversations in the small space were off-puttingly loud. Still, that's not really such a bad thing, it just goes to show how popular this place is.
