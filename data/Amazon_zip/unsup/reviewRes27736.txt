HFS - This food was amazing!! And the price was reasonable. Service was great and decor was nice but not overwhelming. Simple and welcoming. Several people ordered the fried chicken, I ordered the Ahi tuna. AMAZING!!!!! I mean really AMAZING!!!!! The flavors of everything we ate were great. Order the mac and cheese and the fried chicken, but then order something moderately healthy, like the tuna, so you don't feel awful. Nice wine list and freindly bartender if you wait for friends before dinner. One note: While I disagree with pretty much the entire review of Matthew M (who was apparently there the same day as I was) and Randy M, I will agree that the popcorn was actually just odd. I would be happy with bread, please. And the carrot cake was gross. tried to do some gastronomic artistic thing and we all simply found it dry and bland. With better desert and bread, I would have given the place 5 stars.
