This place has some awesome food. My family and I came for a very early dinner around 5 pm...Thankfully we did because the place really picked up during the more regular dinner hours. For myself at least I can say that this was the best Mexican food I have had by far while in the states and that is no matter what part of the city, Chicagoland, or even outside of Illinois. The service was very quick but otherwise just ok...The server did forget our hot chocolate (we think so anyway) but otherwise no problems with the service. You get a free cup of soup and chips and salsa (the soup was delicious) what could be better?? I highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone who has an urge for Mexican food, you should not be disappointed. P.S. You have to pay the meter for street parking but it was really close and easy for us...
