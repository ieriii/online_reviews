Rick Bayles: I get it! There are HUNDREDS of other Mexican places to go in Chicago for the staple burrito or taco that are good, but how XOCO stands above the crowd is by bring you to the authentic taste you would only get going to visit your Abuelita (grandmother) in Mexico and having her make a sandwich for you. The fact is, Xoco's unpretentious food can't be found in any other restaurant in Chicago. Depending on your palate, it may not make you feel like fireworks just went off in your mouth, but it the love put into it is undeniable. The prices are not really high (average $12) but the portions could be a little bigger for the cost. The real reason that XOCO doesn't get 5 stars is the lack of parking and long lines . Then again, maybe I should have only given it one star just so I didn't have to wait behind YOU in line! More for me!!!
