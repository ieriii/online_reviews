No review yet from me for COAST?? WHAT?!?! I don't even see how that's possible considering I go to Coast almost once a week... I see a lot of negativity from my fellow un-coast-friendly Yelpers, but I'm one to go against the grain and I think Coast is the MOST!! Yes, it is difficult to get a reservation on a weekend night at Coast but that is because they dont reserve the whole restaurant. They save half for walk-ins so that people who live in the neighborhood can actually swing by on a Friday or Saturday night with a bottle of their favorite booze (mine: Sapporo....Mmmmmmm) and have a chance at getting seated without having calculated a reso months in advance. Amen!! How nice to not just be turned away.... Maybe I'm the sole sushi maven to appreciate that and take advantage of the walk-in aspect frequently... yes, sometimes there is a wait but alas!! The place is BYOB... so uncork your Pinot Grigio, relax and enjoy the company of whomever you're with... or, come back on a Wednesday. Either way it's all about the food... I love the sushi. The sashimi and special maki alike.... A few highlights: *The spicy miso soup.... made with jalapenos. A total sinus remedy... Hayfever BE GONE!! *Coast Crab *White Dragon *Volcano *Crunchy Spicy Tuna *Hamachi Carpaccio *Toro Sashimi Yum Yum Yum. It's decorated cute... cherry blossom wall paper, candles, dark wood and nice low-lighting... cute for date nights and girls' night out... the byob is key and keeps the bill cheap... And if you really want to be a complainer about reso's and waiting... they DELIVER!! Wooooo!!!
