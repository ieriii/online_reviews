delicious every time I go! There are plenty of choices for the adventurous and also a good selection of vegetarian (i hope/ they claim) dishes. The Hot Pot is tons of fun and an enormous amount of food for the price; if you can get a group of at least 4 non-squeemish friends together I definitely recommend it!  Otherwise you will definitely be able to find something on the ginormous menu to order, I wish you the best of luck in choosing just one item. Lastly, the tofu is very nicely prepared, a definite plus.
