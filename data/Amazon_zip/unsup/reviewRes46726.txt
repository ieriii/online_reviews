I have been going to RJ Grunts for 30+ years and eat there as often as I can. The range of food satisfies everybody from vegetarians to meat eaters and the salad bar is to die for! The location is superb, valet parking is available and the wall hangings are legendary. Ron, the manager of the Mothership makes you feel very welcome....It is a flashback to the 70's, it is exactly the way I remember it. Come here to experience the legendary Lettuce flagship and stay for the food, music and good service. Peace, love and soul!
