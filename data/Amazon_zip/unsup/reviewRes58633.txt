My roommate and I went out for a relaxing Sunday 4:30 cheese and wine dinner. What started out a great experience turned into us being pushed out by 3 different members of the staff after and hour and fifteen minutes.We had reservations and arrived right when the restaurant opened. We were seated within 10 minutes and our waitress seemed really nice. We didn't want to do the large plattters, we just came in for cheese and wine. We said we were going to order a bottle and the waitress recommened one that was very good.Now I know that it is the waiters/bussers job to fill waters, but their was gentleman in a pony tail that came around every 5 minutes to refill our waters, even if it didnt need refilling.  He asked us 3 times if we wanted to get dessert and I repeatedly told him no.  It just seemed very rude since my roommate and I were trying to catch up and he could see that we were talking and were still eating the food in front of us.After he came around a bunch of times, another waiter asked us if we were ready for dessert. We said no, and that we were all set, at that moment our waitress walked towards our table, and you could see by her face, that he had given her a look about us. You could tell because she gave the Thank God they're finally done look. I know this because I've waited tables before, however I would never do it on the floor around guests. I'm sorry that I didn't order the $50 dollar plate and I saw their were people waiting for tables. But we were there for only an hour and 15 minutes. We shared fondue, some hard cheese, and a bottle of wine. I wasn't going to down the bottle of wine, I wanted to enjoy it and take my time. The last 15 minutes ruined the great fondue and wine that I had there.  We still tipped her 20%, even though I don't feel it was completely deserved.
