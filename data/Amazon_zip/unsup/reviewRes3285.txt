A bunch of Yelpers inspired by Rocky's ROTD decided to put this place though the paces tonight. I thought about ordering the Seoul Sassy in honor of my birthplace but I ended up ordering the "suicide" Bud's Buffalo wings as I have a reputation to maintain (GO HOT HEADS!).  When I asked the guy taking my order how hot the "insane" was, he took a deep breath and looked me dead in my eye and said "they're HOT". Some of my crew ordered the "spicy" and it looked and smelled good so I knew I was on the right track. The "suicide" wings looked like the "suicide" wings at Buffalo Joes in that they were topped w/ a healthy portion of sauce and jalapenos on top of the wings. The "suicide", sadly, were not hot. As a matter of fact, they weren't even spicy. Hot Heads: 1 Crisp: 0 Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals so that was a good sign. I recommend you reading the other reviews if you want a non Hot Head take on the place. If you're into spicy meals, you're better off looking elsewhere for your fiery delights. +1 for having chilled Bacchus D available.
