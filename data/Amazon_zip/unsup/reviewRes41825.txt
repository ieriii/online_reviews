Con: It's always crowded. Pro: It's always crowded because it's the best. Everything else is pro. Take-out can be had with a surprisingly short wait. The best Vietnamese dish I've ever had was here - this oily pork in a claypot, extremely spicy, and tasty as hell. Nothing on their menu has ever failed to please me. However, the pho doesn't really stand out... not bad, just not super. I'd say Hai Yen, 777 or 888 are better for that. Don't go to Tank for pho, go to Tank for their house specials.
