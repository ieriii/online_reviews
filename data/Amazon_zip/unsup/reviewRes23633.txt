Went to Icosium for my wife's birthday and pretty happy with my meal. The savory crepe was delicious (I think I had the Palace Crepe) when I added lamb sausage. My only complaint was that there wasn't much sausage added for $3. I was impressed. Soup, followed by a great crepe with a cup of flavored iced tea followed by half of a dessert was $20 per person. Add in the fun decor and you've got a great casual dinner before you hit the bars etc.
