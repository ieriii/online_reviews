My second dinner experience at L&E proved just as enjoyable as the first. Since the menu is ever changing, I'm not going to go into everything we had, but I will say that between 3 people we split about 6 things on the menu and not one was disappointing. The food is different and inventive and L&E definitely lives up to the hype. I also thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere her. You can dress up and have a fancy night out....or dress down and not feel out of place. Service was great the second time around as well. Overall L&E just nails all aspects of the dining experience and I'll be back time & time again!
