A friend recommended Glenn's to us. We went there for lunch to celebrate her 2-year-old's birthday. We had a stroller, and although the place had maybe 3 tables filled, the waitress greeted us with a "Hi." and "Does that thing fold up?" I understand that when that little dining room is full, strollers need to be folded. But at 2pm on a Tuesday, I did not appreciate being badgered about it. She begrudgingly allowed us to sit in the corner where our stroller replaced a chair and took up no extra space whatsoever. Our waiter sat at our table with us several times and made awkward comments. Otherwise, he was alright. The food was decent. We split the lobster fettuccine alfredo and the crab cakes, and we got a grilled cheese for the baby. Nothing blew our minds save the bill. We ended up spending $50 on mediocre food served in a dining room that made me feel claustrophobic with unpleasant service. For that kind of money, I would have rather gone to a nice restaurant downtown. A diner atmosphere with diner-quality food should reflect diner prices. We won't be back.
