Delicious. Everything we had tasted good, and I just had Spaghetti and Meatballs, the staff was accommodating when we had to change our reservation at the last minute.  Yummy place, a little on the expensive side, but if your a little north of downtown and hankering for Italian this place is about as good as your gonna get.
