One of the best Sushi options in Chicago. The fish is always fresh and the sashimi plate offers generous cuts of a nice variety of seafood. Spicy Creamy roll is the perfect combination, Spider roll is also excellent. The place is usually packed and definitely attracts the byob crowds. Table service can be dicey, the server turnover appears to be pretty high, I would recommend setting up shop at the Sushi Bar.
