It was our first time here and the waitstaff was VERY helpful, a bit too helpful, but not over the top. The food tasted wonderful. We ordered the Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries, the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki and the Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey. The chicken was tender and the skin was crispy, the pork was tender and had the perfect amount of sear on it. My complaints: It would have been nice to put on the website that this was a place where the food doesn't come out together and the plates are meant to be shared. Not from Chicago, so I looked for places to eat before going, and no mention of that whatsoever on the website. We chose to sit out on the patio and we were put right next to the speakers and the busiest foot traffic of the place. That really knocked the enjoyment down a level. When it came to order, I ordered, and then the waitress just turned around and thought we were done ordering! My boyfriend was a bit offended, and he even said he didn't even feel like eating anymore. Needless to say, I diffused the situation and he got to order what he wanted. My last complaint is, since my boyfriend's order was taken last, and mine first, my food came last! We finished eating the pork and waited for another 10 minutes before the chicken came out. The food tasted great. That's all I can say about this place. I would eat here again, but only if I was in the area. I would not make plans to come here again though.
