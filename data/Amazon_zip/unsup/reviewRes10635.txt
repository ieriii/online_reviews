We showed up Saturday morning and were able to be seated right away. Our group of four chose four plates to share family style and walked away with more for later. Both of the the eggs Benedict flavors were delicious and the chocolate french toast was gobbled up quickly. The red velvet pancakes were tasty and very filling. I would certainly recommend it to others.
