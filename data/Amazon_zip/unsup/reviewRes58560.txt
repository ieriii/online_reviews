If I was basing the review on the food and beer alone it would be 5 stars, but due to the service I had to knock it down a star, maybe even two. I have been going to piece for over two years and they must have an extremely high turnover rate because I have never had the same server twice and sometime the service is excellent, other times it is horrible. Take this Sunday for instance. Our pizza came out burnt on the edges. We were a little upset because we love the crust, and it being charred and all was not something that we enjoy. When we mentioned it to the server, he responded It looks perfect to me Well, sir you need new glasses, because burnt crust is not acceptable in my book. I glanced at other tables to see if their pizza crust was burnt, and it was not, so either we were lucky enough to get a perfect pizza as out server said, and everyone else's pizza was wrong, or our server was just being lazy and rude. I'm going with lazy and rude. We called the manager over to complain about the food (Not the server as we should have) and she promptly apologized and comped one of our pizza. So go for the beer and pizza, but be prepared for mediocre service. Oh, yeah, they are a craft brewery, TRY one of their award winning beers, and stop drinking Miller and Bud light people, come on now.
