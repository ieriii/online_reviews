I have several vegan friends and sometimes vegan + gluten free is difficult to come by. Not so at The Chicago Diner! They have a great gluten free menu with tons of choices. My tried and true meal is always the Tofu Stir Fry with Braggs. It is so so so good. The gluten free desserts are not quite my faves, but the main course is so filling you won't be left hungry, I promise.
