Don't let the outside fool you! What this place lacks on the outside (windows, signage) it makes up for inside. The doors open at 6pm and by 6:15pm there was a line of people waiting. This is a great place for the girls to go & catch up or a couple that wants to enjoy each others company. They don't allow you to talk on your cell phone inside (texting only.) LOVE THAT!!! The decor is simple, and elegant. The room is sectioned off by high back lounge chairs. The drink menu is very diverse. You are sure to find many tasty treats priced at $12.00.The appetizers are tasty with a great presentation. The service level is very personal/attentive. All around this was a great place to experience!
