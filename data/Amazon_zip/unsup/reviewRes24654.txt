Excellent experience at the brunch here. Curiosity brought us here and we will be back. More than enough -- maybe too much -- food for a group of six. A tasting menu that changes each week. A carving station that offered rack of lamb done perfectly. Cheeses, salami, and a sweet table that was modest and not overdone. 'Bottomless' Bloody Marys and Mimosas were not. they were charged as each. But, the Bloody Mary bar ( do it yourself ) was everything a Bloody Mary fan would want. The Mimosas were made with an excellent sparkling wine that did NOT cause an immediate headache. Both were worth the price at each. Sangria was determined to be -- meh. Definately one of the best brunchs in town because it knows what to serve you. Not your average brunch. You'll like it. We're going back for the standard menu. Restaurant is located in the Blackstone Hotel and it does have Valet Parking.
