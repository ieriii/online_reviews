Slightly uneven but very high marks overall. NOT TO BE MISSED DISHES: Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries Lingua Agrodulce Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Calabro Ricotta (the bread that comes with this is fabulous) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes Sicilian Iris (possibly the best doughnut in the world!) Festa di Santa Lucia Crema (if you love chocolate sauce) DISHES TO SKIP: Chorizo Stuffed Olives Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg All surprisingly bland The cheese course was nothing special. Maybe we ordered 3 average ones. They were out of Manchego too which was weird for a Friday night. Bread Pudding with Marsala & Citrus - we had at least 3 other desserts that were better than this one. They forgot one dish which messed up the pacing of the meal... things were coming at a fast pace until they realized we were short a dish. It took 20 minutes or more to recover it and they never did find their footing after that. Service was friendly and fun however.
