Glenn's Diner was a great dining experience in all the main areas: service, atmosphere and food quality!  I made reservations, but it looked like they had the Sunday Father's day traffic calmly under control. The Bloody Mary was an appetizer in itself. Strong in liquor and flavor. All the entrees we ordered were not only fresh, but perfectly prepared! Seriously perfect. This was my first visit, but the scallops are something I will come back for. Not to over use the word, but perfectly seared and fresh. The service was just what I like, helpful but non intrusive. It was obviously busy, but we were neither rushed nor ignored! I liked this place so much it inspired me to post my very first yelp review.
