Still loving this place on another level. For being in Chicago, they have excellent delivery service and the charge is minimal. Only $3 delivery fee and minimum order of only $10! I had an idea to send out a birthday lunch delivery order to my boyfriend and they deliver as far as 600 W. Chicago! Delivery is a great way to get the food you want, even when you can't get to it! Oh, and check out their lunch specials. I ordered the Siimply It sandwich lunch special which came with sandwich (we chose grilled pork), soup, salad, minin veggie eggroll, tea, and a fruit desert. All for $6.95. My bf LOVED it! What a value! If only I worked closer to this place all the time!
