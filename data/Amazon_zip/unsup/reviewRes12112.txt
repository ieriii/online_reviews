Ive been here for brunch twice, and been very happy both times. The food is top notch, it's sunny, comfortable, and has something for all ages. The prices are a tad inflated, but not out of the ballpark.  Speaking of all ages, I was worried this place might be a little sophisticated for my 10 month old, but in fact they offered me an on-the-house mickey mouse shaped pancake, complete with fruit features. My little one was delighted, and so was I! Plus, the have one of the best looking hosts/bartenders (male) I've ever seen. Yummy all around!
