This is a review for Hard Drive- the club in the lobby. At first I thought the idea of a club in the lobby was a little odd. The club is sectioned off with ropes, so people walking through the lobby can look in at the clubbers. The music at first was mainly techno/house, but later on in the evening the music changed to hiphop. Overall, it was a fun place, but very pricey. Normal cover is about $20, and drinks were expensive as well- $10 for a shot.
