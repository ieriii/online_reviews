I love the Omni. Staff is really friendly and they make sure you have a great stay. Before you go there definitely sign up for their Select Guest Program. (It's like one of those mileage program or hotel loyalty program. No fee) Once you sign up without doing anything your already a Gold member which means you get complimentary Wi-Fi (really, all hotels should have free Wi-Fi), pressing service, shoe shine, morning beverage delivery, bottled water on the day of arrival. And the morning beverages are great, you get 2 beverages of your choice including coffee, tea, orange, grapefruit, tomato, apple juice, bottled water or hot chocolate. The gym isn't huge but it has lots of elliptical machines and treadmills. It's only open from 6am till 11pm though. There's also a pool and hot tub but according to my friend there's a high level of chlorine. It's on MIchigan Avenue which is like 5th Avenue in New York so it's close to everything. I especially liked going to get breakfast at the Pierrot Gourmet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ ) The rooms are all suites so you will have a living room with 2 arm chairs, desk and a sink with flat screen tv, bedroom with a tv and bathroom. I also got a mini fridge and a microwave because my stay was a little long. (no fee) There was a waiting list but it became available in like 2 days. There are no charge for the fridge but you need to request it.
