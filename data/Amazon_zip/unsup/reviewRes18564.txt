My husband actually found this on Yelp before we took a trip to Chicago for a concert. I had the Cubana and my husband had the Pepito. And for dessert we had to get the yummy and fresh churros! I had it with the Mexico City Thick, and he got the Aztec. All the items we had were delicious and and we would certainly go back! (My profile picture was taken while we were there). The guacamole was perfect as were the tortilla chips that came with it. I will say that they do not have enough seating. When you place your order you will receive a number as to where you will sit. (if you want seating inside. Otherwise there are places where one can stand outside) We eventually were seated at the high counters, which was fine. It was a bit noisy as we arrived on a warm, mid afternoon on Saturday. Overall we loved what we had and though we may try another place for our next visit, it was still great.
