Went here on a DATE WITH THE SWEETEST GIRL. Good thing I had a reservation because the place was packed (good sign). However, we had to wait 20 minutes before we could sit down anyways. Once we sat down we ordered an appetizer that included a few different foods from Cuba, named "Taste of Cuba." It included empanadas and croquetas served with a saffron sauce and it was great to quench our waiting appetites with some fried food. For dinner I had Cuban roast pork, which was tender and plentiful. It was served on a bed of beans and rice. The beans and rice were actually my favorite part. Not sure if they added a little secret sauce, but it was a great switch from re-fried beans and dry rice most Mexican places serve. I would recommend this dish. My girlfriend went with butternut squash soup, I think, which was a little bit watered down. She also got the shrimp cedillas off the appetizer menu, which were amazing. The shrimp were cooked to bring out a lot of flavor and they also added a great black sauce. I would choose the shrimp quesadillas over the "Taste of Cuba" for best appetizer. A note on the margaritas at Cafe 28. The ingredients escape me, but I had an organically made margarita where they substitute some exotic nectar instead of sweet and sour mix. They did put a lot of tequila in there, but I would just order the regular margarita next time. The waiter and busboy were high quality, making up for the hostess who had an issue honoring our reservation. For the price this a great place to dine and I would come back.
