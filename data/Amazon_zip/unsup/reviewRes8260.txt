Helpful hint. Don't eat all day and don't eat dinner the day before you plan on coming here. MEAT STORM. The food here is delicious, their Brazillian special Sirloin and the Beef Ribs are my favorite, but everything is good. I'm in heaven, if only they had fried chicken. The experience of men with swords walking around and offering you meat is priceless. The price of such gastronomic goodness (other than terrible weight gain and stomach cramps and loss of consiousness do to blood rushing to your stomach), is quite high money wise. But its worth it once in a while. If you can afford it.
