I will pretend that Frontera Grill really needs my review to get their name out there. Usually it is that 936th review that makes a difference. All I will say is that I have been to dozens of Mexican restaurants in the city of Chicago. Every time I go to Frontera, I ask myself, "Why would I ever go to any other Mexican restaurant? ". Be prepared to wait a bit. But most of the times that you have to wait for your food, there is a good reason for it. If you haven't been here, GO.
