YUM! We went for the lunch buffet and definitely felt we got our money's worth (next time we plan to starve ourselves for a day so we're extra hungry). Lots of options to choose from at the buffet, and their chicken tikka masala was fantastic. We tend to steer clear from buffets because sometimes they are not well attended, food is cold, buffet dishes scraped empty, etc.. But this was not the case - they did a nice job of keeping everything fresh and filled. And it beat driving all the way up to Devon for some authetic Indian food.
