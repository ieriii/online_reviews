This place is one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I had a dinner with 4 other people and it was a wonderful experience! Nice inside with a sit down side and a bar side with some live music. We ate dinner and had drinks and appetizers. All the appetizers were good. The dinner was some of the best steak I have had ever. It was a little 9oz steak, but melted in your mouth. We went over to the bar side and had some more drinks and oysters. Live music was really good. The drink menu was awesome, since I had about 10 different drinks while there. Great dinner place, and would highly suggest going here while in Chicago.
