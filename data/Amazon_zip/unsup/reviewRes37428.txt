Now that I live in the proper city I'm becoming more of a food snob than I thought possible. I want to try it all and experiment at home. I'm more of a cook than a restaurant frequenter. So one day my partner came home from an interview raving about Fox & Obel. Of course I knew what it was. Mario Batali and Morimoto have been there! (Food Network whore here!) I always wanted to go and now she's been...mild jealous to be inserted here. For my birthday weekend we finally used the 2 free movie passes to see Indiana Jones which at this point was only playing at the huge AMC down the road. When asked what I wanted to do afterwards I pointed to my left and there we went! I was so excited! A new food store - although not convenient whatsoever for my north side ass! This place is adorable! I love it. Although it is quite, let's just say interesting, to navigate. But what better place to get lost! I was drooling over salsa and olive oils and cheeses. I found the Chinese 5 Spice I had been looking for forever and hadn't been able to find (and no, I have yet to go to Spice House, it's on my to-do!). The veggies looked amazing! I had a recipe in my Shape magazine I wanted to try that included eggplant, zucchini and yellow squash. I found little packages of mini each of these vegetables and spent a grand total of $4 on vegs! Nice! And so cute, compact and the perfect size for my meal! I wish this place exited elsewhere but I'm glad I finally got to go in. I'll definitely be back to explore some more...and what's that!? Free valet parking for their customers? Uh, unheard of!!
