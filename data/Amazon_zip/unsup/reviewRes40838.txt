I just went there on Sunday for the first time and I was thoroughly impressed! Great steak nachos (called Chachos) that were tender and juicy with a ton of flavor. My only complaint was that the guacamole on top was unnecessary. I am thankful this place is in Chicago because otherwise I would become obese because of it!
