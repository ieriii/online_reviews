I have been trying to come here for a while and I am so happy that I finally got to go. This was much more than a meal. This was a culinary experience. My only complaint was that a lot of the items on the menu had sold out before we got there. I guess they had a really busy Saturday night. The best items we had were the braised pork shoulder, the octopus, and the bone marrow. These are all items that you must have. The soft serve pistachio ice cream was a great way to finish off a total masterpiece of a meal. It's not cheap but I feel like you get your moneys worth. This is one of my new favorite places in Chicago. GO NOW!
