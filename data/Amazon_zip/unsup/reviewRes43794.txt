My husband I went here Friday evening last week for our anniversary. We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arriving. The whole staff, from the hostess to the waiter were very pleasant. We were asked if we were there for a special occasion and said it was our anniversary. We ordered Wild Mushroom & Gorgonzola Cheese Tart and Blackened Scallops for appetizers. Both delicious! We also ordered two 12 oz NY strip steaks, I had the steak with a parmesan crust and my husband had his steak with the horseradish crust (I only wish I would have picked a more flavorful crust, but the steak was good). My husband was happy with his steak. As a side I ordered a baked potato and my husband had the Lyonnaise potato gratin which he didn't like much.  For dessert we split a profiteroles ( I believe it was on the house) which had "Happy Anniversary" spelled out in chocolate sauce. Very nice of them. Overall we had a good experience and will probably come back....
