We made a reservation for the last time slot of the night at 9:30 pm on a Friday. We understand that the restaurant closes at 10:30, but reservations should not be taken that late if service will decline at that time. The server was great, but the meat service was not. We never once had anyone come around with lamb, beef ribs, or shrimp. We requested shrimp on multiple occasions and never received it. I would have no problem in this decrease in service, if we were not spending over $150 per couple. That is a lot of money to spend to sit there and have to consistently ask for specific items that never come. We have always been a fan of Brazzaz but to be honest, after this visit, I will highly consider their neighbors Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil.
