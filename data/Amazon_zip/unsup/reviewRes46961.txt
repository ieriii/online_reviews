This Uncommon Ground location has never been a terribly close or convenient dining option for me, but I've been here a few times because friends really like it. The atmosphere of the dining rooms are what appeal to me most - the food has had it's ups & downs, mostly good but not mind-blowing. If not for the cozy & comfortable surroundings I might give the dining experience a so-so overall review. I've been here for both brunch & dinner, and I have definitely much preferred the brunch experience - service is friendly and attentive, the coffee is good & strong, and the bloody marys are thick & spicy. It's sometimes more chaotic & busy in the evenings, and service suffers a bit especially if there's a live show going on. They have a teeny parking lot which fills fast but I've been lucky to find a spot most times I've visited. Wouldn't travel way out of my way to dine here, but it's a good solid choice if you happen to be up in the Rogers Park/Edgewater area.
