This place is excellent. Our party walked almost 2 miles from dinner to have this "second dinner" and it was well worth it. We got a half cheese, half meat pizza and I had a slice of the meat (pepperoni and sausage) and it was delicous. The crust was amazing, made from corn meal and was very buttery. If it wasn't for the fact I had that other meal, I think I could have had another slice
