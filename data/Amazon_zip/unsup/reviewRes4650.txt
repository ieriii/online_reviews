The headline: Overpriced for what you get, which is pretty ordinary. We headed over to the PP for a late lunch on a weekday. We found an interesting wine list (no US wine, but plenty of Old World choices) and a very hard to navigate menu. We were looking for lots of porcine options, but found surprisingly few. We ended up with a range of four appetizer or tapas-like choices. While everything was OK, the quality was very ordinary and the prices very high. For example, the Catalonian Fuet turned out to be a small plate of small slices of salami. Ok, fine, but not for $7. When I asked for some bread to go with it, I was told, "we don't have bread service." Credit to the servier, who snuck out a few slices of toasted bread at no charge. The "Fois Gras" was not fois gras, not even pate fois gras, but a small cup of fois gras-flavored cream spread. OK, but not for $15. In all, we hade one glass of wine each, spent $75 and left feeling hungry. The outdoor seating area, just off Michigan Ave., was very pleasant. On a nice day PP might be a good place for a glass of wine after work with a side nibble. Otherwise, pass. Perhaps the main mean choices are better?
