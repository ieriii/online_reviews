Best chocolate chip cheescake EVER! I'm not even vegan or veg., but it seriously tops any cheescake I have ever had. I even let my sis have some and she was shocked that it was vegan. Anywho, the food is tasty. The only bad thing is that it is a bit pricey. $7 for a shake. Yikes! But then again, this is quality food so I guess I can understand. I would def. go back when I feel like treating myself.
