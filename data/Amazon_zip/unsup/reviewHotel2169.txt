Stayed here during the MEG convention and i was not disappointed. They upgraded me to a suite and it was gorgeous - 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, huge bathroom. I had my own little living room. They always had an elevator ready to go. It was in a great location in the city. You can walk to all the stores and there were a ton of restaurants within walking distance. Expensive, but if you can afford it, stay there.
