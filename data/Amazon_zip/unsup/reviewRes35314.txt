Shaw's was very close to a five-star rating, but just a couple of things I had were not the best I've ever eaten. I've been to Shaw's twice now for Christmas Eve dinners, and had lovely experiences both times. My family and I ate there for this Christmas Eve, and everyone really enjoyed their food. To start, I got the lobster bisque, which was good, but not nearly as good as the lobster bisque I've had at the Palm in DC. My father had oyster sampler, which he said were "good," which in Dad-speak means "very good." We had the crab and shrimp fritters and those things were GOOD. They come out with Russian dressing for dipping and were a big hit at the table. For the entree, I got the lobster, brie, and penne (can you tell I like lobster?) My sister got the seafood sampler (crabcake, scallops, and lobster), my mother jumbo lump crabcakes, and my father the crab-stuffed grouper. My entree was very good - I wish there had been a little bit more lobster in there though. I was kind of searching for more lobster when my bowl was getting empty. But the cheese sauce was really great - real cheddar and brie, not Velveeta-ish. Everyone else loved their meal. I was too full for dessert, but my mom got a scoop of chocolate ice cream (which came out with fudge to pour over) and my sister got some of the green tea, which she said was decent. I don't like key lime pie, but I hear Shaw's was recently voted best key lime pie in the city. Service was great and very attentive. All in all, great food and I'll definitely come back again.
