Being married to a woman who split time between Southern and Deep Southern homes growing up, Big Jones was both a great find and a dangerous find. We have been a few times for brunch and when I ask where she wants to go, invariably, she says Big Jones and I don't mind. They take reservations which is great because I don't wait for brunch. Brunch waits for me. The eggs romero is one of the best brunch foods, that I have had this side of Irish Breakfast. Poached eggs over pulled pork over grits with a drizzle of Carolina BBQ sauce (basically cider vinegar with spices). It was great. With the poached eggs, it was unctuous with funky, salty pork and sour sauce all over a bed of sweet and salty grits. My wife read that they serve pimento cheese which apparently is the Cheese Curd of the South (by that I mean that it is an embarrassingly humble nostalgic treat). After sampling some, she made me drive around the city looking for some. Did I mention that they offer complimentary beignets? They do.
