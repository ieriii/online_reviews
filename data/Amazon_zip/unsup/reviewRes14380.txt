My husband And I have been meaning to try this place for a long time, and we were not disappointed. We both had the chicken dinner, and it was excellent. Fantastic grilled onions and beans and rice, and plantains. Yum! We also tried the beef empanadas, and the ham croquettes, and they were both good too, but not that different than what I've had elsewhere. I've heard the sandwiches are amazing, I look forward to going back. I wish there was a little more comfortable seating, but only because it was too hot for their patio.
