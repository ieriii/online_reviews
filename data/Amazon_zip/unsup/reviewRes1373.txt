Honestly, someone needs to tell me why I've been missing out on Hot Doug's all this time. Was someone hiding it from me?! We did lunch there today-- 1:30ish on a Tuesday-- and there was a line out the door the entire time we were there. We did a corndog, the celebrity dog which was a cran-apple sausage with sage mayonnaise and a gouda-esque cheese, and the spicy chicken sausage with chipotle-ancho mayo. All three were stupendous. The corndog was honestly a revelation-- I couldn't believe how good a corndog could possibly be... The fries were yummy, the drinks good, and the dogs? YUM. All in a totally family-friendly environment that's kitschy without being lame. We'll definitely head back over there the next time we have out of town guests. A perfect Chicago restaurant that's easy on the wallet.
