Lettuce's take on the Chicago Steakhouse. Too big, too loud, friendly and familiar service, excellent food. I had beef tenderloin medallions, medium rare. That comes with parmesan crust and mushrooms. Succulent, tender and delicious. For my side I chose scalloped potatoes. This looked very unappetizing on the plate. The cheese was good, but there was just too much of it. If I return I will order the wild rice instead. Our kids loved their NY Strip and surf and turf. My wife didn't really care for her cedar plank salmon; "too sweet." Cottage fries and fresh-cut fries were very good, if not terribly creative, sides. Calamari was tender. We always cringe in anticipation of rubbery squid. Not a problem at Wildfire. Wine was adequate. I didn't get a wine snob vibe from the waiter which was fine. It's just not that kind of place. The triple decker chocolate pie was good but we were already about to explode from the unhealthy portions. That's about it! If you want a fantastic steak and don't want to pay too much and can put up with the loud atmosphere you'll dig Wildfire. I'd hit it again.
