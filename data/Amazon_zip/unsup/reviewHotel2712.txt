A couple years back my boyfriend took me to this hotel for my birthday and I still think about my stay there to this day. From the moment I stepped foot in the hotel the staff made me feel special. They were extraordinarily attentive and the customer service was excellent. Our suite was gorgeous, with a beautiful view of the city and modern, hip, yet comfortable furniture and decorations. The staff brought up my surprise birthday cake along with a bottle of champagne all beautifully presented. When we were looking for a place to have a special birthday/valentines dinner the hotel representative patiently weighed out our options with us and helped us find the ideal spot we were looking for, they even made the reservation for us! The James Hotel definitely made my birthday one to remember!
