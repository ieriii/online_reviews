The rooms were nice, and I didn't pay much to stay here, but there were a few things that were pretty annoying. 1. The whole joint smelled like the pool. Strongly smelled of pool. 2. The elevators were so slow, I thought it was a joke. It was not. I, at one point, caught an elevator going up just so I could eventually go down. 3. The walls were paper-thin. I heard children running, families talking (not yelling), a dude whistling in the hall through the door. Worse, was the guy puking his guts out in the bathroom next to ours all morning.  If I had kids, I would stay there again and toss them in the ultra-chlorinated pool while I enjoyed some Webber Grill treats at the adjacent restaurant or took a nap in the very comfortable bed. Since I don't, I will stick with nicer, quieter, more romantic places for now.
