2nd visit was disappointing. Cole slaw not as good/creamy as I remembered.  I had a "flight" of appetizers as my entree -- chicken, pulled pork and brisket.  Chicken was WAY too dry.  Pork a little too dry.  Brisket too much fat.  Large portion and perfect for dinner.  My friend enjoyed her 1/2 slab of BBQ ribs.  Sauces were good.  Last time I thought they brought a flight of 5-sauces.  Last night only 4.  For dessert, my friend had the sweet potato poundcake with candied walnuts and vanilla ice cream (very good).  Q treated me to 3 cookies & milk for my b-day.  1 out of 3 cookies was great -- the double-chocolate chip.  Others were just "eh".  Prior experience I thought the food was much better. Service was still good and the room is very nice.  Just didn't feel like the food was up to par.
