The bake goat cheese and the Norwegian Crest are amazing. I highly recommend these two dishes. My brother and his girlfriend loved it.If you're a college student like me, the pastries are just in range for your budget. I highly suggest the mango mousse cake andFeeling like a late night snack run? Artopolis does not close until late. The service is great and the waiters have enthusiastic personalities. The style of this place looking very European and refreshing.
