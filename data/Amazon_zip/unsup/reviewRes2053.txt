Jeers to Hot Doug's for being closed promptly at 4pm on a warm summer day. They're open from 10am-4pm, apparently. Of course, I arrived twenty minutes too late.  WTF? Seems like a strange choice to be closed at 4pm-- I would think they'd get quite a bit of business, at 4:20, and for the late night crowd.  So, I was not able to have a taste of this lovely Chicago delicacy-- and doubt that I will return, unless I just happen to be in the neighborhood.
