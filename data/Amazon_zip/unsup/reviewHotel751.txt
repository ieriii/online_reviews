If you are visiting Chicago and planning to do some damage on the credit card, this is the place to stay. Located at the northern end of Magnificent Mile, this is a great place to start off your day of shopping (I even went back to drop off purchases because I only got about a block away). Plus any touristy location you'll want to visit is within walking distance from here (Navy Pier, Art Institute of Chicago, Millennium Park, etc). The hotel itself looks newly remodeled and clean. The staff was friendly for the most part but didn't care that we were Starwood Preferred and told us to go to the back of the line when we were checking in. Other than that person, everyone else was courteous and helpful. The rooms were on the small side but that's to be expected due to its location. I didn't have time to enjoy the amenities or try the restaurant, which looked like a popular choice for tourists.
