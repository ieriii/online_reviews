My favorite place to go for Korean food. I usually order the spicy pork belly. Love the mackerel. The bulgogi and kalbi are alright, bi bim bop is the most disappointing. Of course my feigned reason I go is for the small side dishes. You know how Olive Garden has lunch specials like soup, salad, and breadsticks for $5.95. I wish Korean restaurants do spicy tofu soup, banchan, and rice. One thing I always wonder is since when did Korean restaurants start incorporating mac salad and potato salad into the banchan. And yes I agree, it's hard to get service in here.
