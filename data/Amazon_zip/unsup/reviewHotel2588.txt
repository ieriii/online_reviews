This club is in the middle of nowhere. There's no way you'd just stumble upon it. It has to be a destination with address in hand for you to even end up there. It's not near any of the other clubs in the West Loop. I'm an idiot and thought it was a real hotel that just had a cool lounge, and was wondering why the hell anyone would choose to stay all the way between two factories while visiting Chicago. Anyway, we went here on a Friday night for a special event a friend was promoting and I really enjoyed myself. Music was good, drinks were pricey but strong and the staff was friendly. We were also able to find a parking spot fairly easily, which is a huge plus.
