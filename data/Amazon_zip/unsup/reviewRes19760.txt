This may have become my new favorite restaurant in the city. I've gone twice now and both times blew me away. For being located on Michigan Ave, just across from Millennium Park, and having to deal with all those tourists, this place handles the crowds well and move diners in and out at a great pace. The decor is nice with large booths and tables for any sized parties and a great downstairs area for private events. The servers are very knowledgeable and friendly. The wine list is amazing with many selections to pick from. The food is of a quality that reaches the top in my book from the amazing poutine, to the halibut, the great brussell sprouts side, and finishing off with an amazing dessert. If you're coming to Chicago and want a great dining night out, come to The Gage.
