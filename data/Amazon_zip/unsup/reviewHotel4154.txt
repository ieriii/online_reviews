I booked this hotel through Priceline's name your own price. The hotel is in a very convenient location. Right next to the water and not right in the middle of downtown were traffic can be congested. Our room was on the 26th floor and had a great view. They had a floating bed which was pretty cool. There was a convenient bar/restaurant in the hotel. The food was decent as well as the drinks. The bad. There was no bed cover sheet on our bed. It was simply a regular sheet that was tucked in. For someone who moves around while he sleeps, the bottom sheet constantly came undone and was exposing the bare mattress. Not very comfortable. The room size was a little small as well. As soon as I walked in, the doorway was narrow and there wasn't much room to maneuver around. Also, the walls were very thin so we could hear everything from our neighbors on both sides. Overall, this hotel was decent. Again, for the money, it wasn't a bad selection. However, I don't think I would want to stay there again.
