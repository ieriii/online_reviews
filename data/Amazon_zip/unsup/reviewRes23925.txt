I finally stopped into Irazu for merienda (spanish word for a snack before dinner) and I had a charming experience. I sat in the semi-enclosed patio and had an oatmeal shake and a taco tico. Both were absolutely RICO!! I really liked the chips and salsa verde they set on the table before my order arrived. My server Chris was really laidback and nice. I also talked to another server named Mandy who was very friendly and sweet. I had been her server the night before at 90 Miles (holla!) and we talked about the similarities and differences of Cuban and Costa Rican food. Anyway, back to the food...the oatmeal shake was all I hoped it would be and more. It had canela sprinkled on top and the texture and taste were just outstanding. Next came my taco tico, served with a heaping portion of cabbage and traditional salsa lizano. I usually don't dig cabbage, but let me tell you, I gobbled every last bit of it up at Irazu. It complemented the taco really well and was very light and refreshing. I look forward to my next time at Irazu!
