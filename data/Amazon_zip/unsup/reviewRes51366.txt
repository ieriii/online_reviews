You can never go wrong with the fish tacos here. Enchiladas are pretty great too. Parking is a bit of a pain but you can usually find a spot after a few rounds around the neighborhood. The dining room is really nice now, after the remodel. The washroom (the one time I've ever been) was actually clean, I liked that they have sensored sinks so you don't have to touch any handles to turn it off. Staff are ALWAYS so nice. There usually isn't a very long wait. Prices are very reasonable.
