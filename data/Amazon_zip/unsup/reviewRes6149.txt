I had my birthday dinner at Wildfire a 2 years ago. This place was recommended to me by a friend of a friend. I knew from the minute I walked in that the meal was going to be great. The minute you step inside you smell the aroma of delicious steak cooking in the open kitchen. We were seated in a booth, which was great, love a booth. I remember that I ordered they trio of filet mignon they have but being late in the night ( i guess chicagoans go out to eat earlier than new yorkers) They ran out of the pepper coated filet. They were nice enough to comp my prime rib which was delicious and juicy. The best part of the meal was the twice baked potato. the potato was huge and everything you except of a perfect twice backed potato. To this day I still crave that twice baked potato.
