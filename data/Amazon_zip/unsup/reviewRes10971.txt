The pizza is good, I'm not gonna lie, it's REEEAAAAAL good. But it loses a star because I hate eating at the place. You always have to wait forever to get a table, the bartenders suck, and then once you get a table service is always ridiculously slow (explains why it takes forever to get a table). I just seriously hate going here. HATE HATE HATE it. Sooo my advice, get take out. But beware, it's a pain in the behind to even get in the door to pick up your food to go.
