Anteprima flat out brought it. From eats to service to atmosphere, this place got it done. First impression was great as it was our anniversary and they reserved a special table for us right by the window and it just got better from there... Starters: Choices were overwhelming, but our server was very helpful in narrowing down the winners and losers. We went with the pork meatballs and grilled octopus - both were exceptional. Mains: Had the entree portions of the ravioli and orecchiette which didn't disappoint. About the only thing I would change about the whole experience would be to get the smaller portion of the pasta so I could try one of their main course dishes. Dessert: Passed on dessert, but they brought us out each a glass of dessert wine to celebrate our anniversary. A nice touch. Ambiance: Very romantic and a touch loud, but if you can score a seat by the window and watch the hustle and bustle on Clark, it's almost perfect. Service: Server was very attentive and helpful in selecting some of the best options from the menu. Host also greeted us warmly upon entering and wished us a happy anniversary.  Overall: Would definitely recommend Anteprima for a date night or intimate evening with friends. Awesome experience!
