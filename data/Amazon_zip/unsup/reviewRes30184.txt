We went to Sunda for my birthday recently and it was DELICIOUS!! Troy was our server and he was amazing!! So attentive and suggested such great food and drink selections. Although, the food was so great that I have to go back for more to try new things. Menu has so many options you can't possibly try them all. But from what I had, I am sure everything else is just as great. Highly recommend going and requesting Troy as your server!! You won't be disappointed.
