YO THIS IS THE SPOT! This place was extremely well put together. Great blend of contemporary design with downright colonial millwork and feel. They take gastropub to that next level son -- none of this intestinal or gaseous business. I mean, I suppose when it comes down to it you could call it a Gastropub, but I would consider this contemporary American gourmet with an emphasis on the civil war (the wall paint is reminiscent of the Confederate Army's uniform (among other things)). Gastropub seems so..... German. This is American (which I suppose you could argue holds very strong German roots, but that's beside my point). Meal display is great, ambiance superb, and fuck the food is good! The waitstaff seems new, but so is the place so I'll cut them some slack.
