Simply fabulous Italian food. My friend and I met here for an early dinner, and stayed a little past the dinner rush, and the waiters could not have been nicer, not pushy but very attentive. We were swooning over the food: rich, but not heavy. I had the Caco e pepe, and it was perfection, good level of spice and fresh pasta. My friend had two antipasti, both delicious, but I loved the truffled egg. The ambiance is warm and not too loud for conversation. I didn't much care for the music (top 40s esque) but everything else was perfect. Oh, and well priced. Two people with appetizers and entrees for under 40 bucks.
