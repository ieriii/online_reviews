I'd always heard rave reviews about Piece, but it seems I'm only in Wicker Park on the weekends. Since I have an aversion to long lines for food, I'd never gone to Piece. When I found myself in Wicker Park on a Tuesday night, I took advantage. We were seated right away and ordered the goat cheese appetizer. It was delicious. We ordered a red pizza with pepperoni (keeping it simple). It was fine, but didn't blow me away. I returned a couple of months later and ordered the New Haven-style pizza. I thought that was a lot better. In fact, I ate half of a medium pizza. Don't judge! The pizza is good, but the house-brewed beer is what really makes Piece special. The have a few standards and then rotate seasonal brews. If you come on a busy night, you won't be disappointed while you sit at the bar and wait on a table. I would LOVE to come for live band karaoke sometime, so I'm hoping that will bump Piece up to a 5-start joint. Stay tuned!
