I haven't had many crab rangoons--mostly because I'm slightly allergic to shellfish and I'm lactose intolerant--but theirs were pretty good. They're tinier than ones I've seen in the past, but these were more tasty because the skin wasn't too thick and they had a good amount of filling. It went well with the thinly sliced carrot shreds and the sweet and sour sauce they gave us. We both liked the signature curry dish (potato, squash, cashew) with pot roasted beef though. The curry isn't nearly as spicy as I thought it'd be. It is made with coconut milk, and the squash is very good... Kenny and I both thought it was eggplant because of the dark skin, but eggplant doesn't have that yam-like texture. It comes with a little bit of crispy egg noodle on top. Very delicious. Ask for a spoon though. I don't know why they don't serve it with a spoon. I thought that was odd. I'd come here again for the same curry dish.
