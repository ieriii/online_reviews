I went to San Soo Gab San for the first time this Valentine's Day and I am happy we did. It was my first Korean BBQ in Chicago! We went around 9:00pm and it was still packed. We couldn't be seated till our entire party was present which is fine. A friendly lady working behind the counter offered us chocolate and made us feel welcome while my partner and I were waiting for our friends. It was a very short wait for a table after they arrived. I don't ever expect to be treated like a princess by wait staff at a restaurant but some of the ladies working there just didn't seem to be having a great day. We ordered beer with the rest of our food but it didn't arrive till we asked for it mid meal.  I was having a pretty positive experience until the very end. Our waitress and a busy boy came and collected our plates as quickly as possible (which yes is a good thing) but they also blocked us from actually leaving the table. It was a weird and difficult departure from San Soo Gab San. Did we not run out of there fast enough?? I had to get my coat on... sorry. Anyway, the food was good and I love barbecue so I'd consider going back during a slower time of day and not assume that anyone will be nice to me there.
