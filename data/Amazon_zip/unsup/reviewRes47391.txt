Half-price burger Tuesday is pretty damn great. Had the Punk Bitch (mustard, gruyere, and prosciutto) with mac and cheese. Felt like I wanted to be alone with the mac and cheese it was so good---gooey and covered with bread crumbs. Top that off with sitting in the back patio in beautiful weather and a delightful waitress, and eating at Lockdown is a superb way to spend a Tuesday night.
