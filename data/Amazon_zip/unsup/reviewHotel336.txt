It's a great location, safe, but you get what you pay for. The rooms are medium sized, stale, old fashioned. The beds and pillows are cheap and old. There are pipes inside the bedrooms and the TVs are CRTs that I didn't know still existed. The windows are 100 years old and have 100 years of paint on them -- not child safe as you can raise them on the 14th floor and climb right out. My bathroom was updated, but my tub had a liner over the old tub which you could feel had a hole in the bottom. AC is a window unit that the maid turns off during the day, so it's stifling when you get back late at night. The maids didn't get to my room until after dinner each night, but they did a good job when they got around to it. No mini fridges. Slowest elevators. Free internet! Nice staff! I paid $170 a night for two twins (we wanted a queen) in late July. There are probably better places for a little bit more, but we took advantage of the walk to the park every single day. It was quiet, probably due to two factors: sturdy construction and unoccupied rooms.
