No line on Friday night - good start with friendly hostess and server. Food was just ok - there were 15-20 minutes between each "course" even though it's tapas. The ragu was 15 minutes too overcooked - worst dish of the night. Service dwindled quite a bit - I was looking at my watch and she asked "do you guys have somewhere to be or something?" well no I just dont know why it takes 20 minutes between 2 appetizers. She didn't even offer us a dessert menu. We also ordered drinks - we were never offered a refill. 2 stars for ok food and prompt water refills. I would never eat here again and have no idea why it has such high ratings. The service was a disgrace.
