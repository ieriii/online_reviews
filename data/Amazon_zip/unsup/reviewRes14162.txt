The only reason this place doesn't get the fifth star is because the stuff I had the first time was so good, I haven't branched out to try the rest of the menu yet to get a good sense of the breadth of this places' awesomeness. We went to try the new Triple Fist, which was really really tasty. (I like Iron Fist and Double Fist, too, but Triple Fist was definitely the best so far). There was a large group of us so we got the bacon fat popcorn. Last time we ordered it, I didn't really like it, but this time, it was quite enjoyable. I don't know if there was something different about it or if it had just grown on me. The apple pork pizza is really good, the the tart, crunchy apple makes a great contrast to the rest of the pie. Now here's why I can't get to other places on the menu: The Goat Cheese Croquette Salad. It's insanely good. When they serve it up, it looks like there won't be enough goat cheese, but don't fret. There's enough of the creamy delicious goat cheese to go with every bite of slightly sharp arugula. The candied walnuts and slices of apple just take the whole thing over the edge. This is one of the few times I clean my plate. It's not heavy at all, but still satisfying. And, to be honest, it makes me feel a little bit better to have eaten a salad rather than a giant burger when I wash it all down with one (or two or three) fantastic beers...
