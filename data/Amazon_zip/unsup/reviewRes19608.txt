Great lunch at The Gage while in Chicago. Very cool decor, great craft beer focus and delicious food. Just trendy enough but still very welcoming.  The price is right at the edge of the expensive and affordable, which is perfect for a place like this right across from Millenium Park. Looking forward to trying dinner there on my next visit. I recommend the wood grilled mushroom sandwich and soup combo. It comes with fries and was way more food than expected. The sandwich had truffle oil, arugula and a fresh baked ciabatta.
