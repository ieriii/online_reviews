I would've never eaten here if it wasn't for Jerry and her goodbye to Meat get together. Not too thrilled but I'm glad I tried it. I don't know if it was because there was 14 of us but the staff was not so kind to us yelpers. We had problems with the reservations, then on the orders, then because apparently we weren't cooking fast enough, and then the bill. I will say that even though you cook the food yourself, everything was quite tasty. The spices on the chicken were really good, along with all of the side dishes (soooo many side dishes). I couldn't tell you what half of them were or how to pronounce the rest but I couldn't get enough. I have to give a shout out to Brett D (first time meeting her and she is a darlin') who had a brilliant idea to put the white rice into the soup, very yummy. I would've given more stars but between the service, having to cook the food yourself, and then how much you smell after you leave I couldn't. But the food is great and it's an experience!
