The food at this restaurant tasted very good. It was presented in a timely fashion as well. I was very happy that the soup was served with the other appetizers and was hot! It is hard to find places where the soup comes out hot! We ordered three dished for three people to share and we still had plenty of leftovers. I would suggest the basil and jalapeno dish. Very spicy and great with chicken! I also like this place because it is byob.
