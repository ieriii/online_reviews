Yummy yum yum in my tum tum. I went with my cousins and we had a great time. Got some wine, ate some delicious grub, sat around and just enjoyed our time. The service was great - very nice people. The food was delicious. The wine was ... well.. fine. It was a good experience. Really open lay out though which for an ethiopian place I like something a little more intimate. Good though - I'd check it out if I were you. I also hear they have music on the weekends which would be a nice plus. But that area has the green mill right by it so you can go catch some jazz after dinner if you want!
