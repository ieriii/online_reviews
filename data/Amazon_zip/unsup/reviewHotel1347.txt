The location is great! Right off of Michigan and within walking distance of everything. You are close to Lake Michigan, shopping, dining, etc. The rooms are small but while on vacation, you are supposed to be out on the town! :) The hotel staff is extremely friendly and responds promptly to requests.  Parking is expensive no matter where you go so if you don't absolutely need to rent a car, don't. From O'hare, the cab fair is about $40. In the city, you can walk everywhere, take the Ele train, or city cabs.
