I came here with friends to blow off some time before a wedding. The atmosphere was pointedly Greek without being too in-your-face about it. Whether it was the soccer game on the TV or the smiling Greek women working there, it certainly did not feel fake.  Pastries are decidedly good here and the hot coffee drinks as well. One major major disappointment is the baklava, or should I say a honey-drenched and-soaked diabetic's nightmare swimming in a plate of honey - I am not exaggerating at all. I barely finished one bite. Sans the honey, I'm think the baklava would be quite tasty.  I'll be back for their entrees. A very chill place for a Saturday morning.
