I loved my stay here!!! I loved my room! So spacious, I felt like I had a studio apt. in the heart of Chicago! The bed was great, the shower had great pressure...though a little slow on drainage. I loved the lobby and the service from David Burke's restaurant. We took bikes out for a ride on the Lakeshore path. And we took advantage of the hotels driver to get us around. I loved the decor and the location -across the street from Starbucks and Trader Joe's. Plus it's a block or two off Michigan...great location....definitely I'll stay here again. I've stayed at the Dana which is just a block or so away...and I prefer the James....I like carpet and not so many windows. Sleep well. Cheers!
