I was part of a group of 6 who visited Grand Luxe last night, tues Aug 9, what a train wreck!! From the temperature of the place, the extremely long wait for the meal and the quality of the food, the experience was poor from start to finish. We all live in the neighborhood and have several restaurants to choose from. We will never return to Grand Luxe.I utilize yelp for restaurant reviews, especially when I am traveling. I rarely post a review, only when a restaurant is outstanding or poor. I had to post my disappointment with Grand Luxe and hope their staff makes improvements on their preparation turnaround time and the quality of their food. Turning the ac up from 60 degrees may help too.
