We went at 3 on Saturday (9/19). It's still dealing with the initial rush, so there's no take out. We got a table at 3:38, guac and chips shortly thereafter. Our sandwiches finally came at about 3:55. We ate them in 5 minutes, just in time to save our car from the meter. Pepito (braised beef short rib) - 5 stars. Wow.  Cuban (pork and bacon, and a little twist on the traditional) - 4 stars. Though a bigger pork fan might give it 5. Place is ultimately a ripoff, and it's way too packed right now, so it's not a good experience. Bill was 37 (two sandwiches, a hot cocoa, a beer and guac/chips). Yikes. Can't say the food isn't excellent though. Only a celebrity chef could sustain this impractical place.
