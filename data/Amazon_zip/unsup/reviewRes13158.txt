Was Going to write a review for the time I ate there (which was so-so) but instead I'm going to write a review for the time I didn't. I tried to make a reservation for one, to grab a quick bite, but was told (at 7pm) they were closing early (around 8pm) because they're slammed and running out of food. Number 1, you're a diner, you have a wide variety of food. Number 2, don't assume anything about your customers. I could have found something you had that I would like. In the grand scheme maybe I'm overreacting, but when the dude initially took my call it sounded like I was going to get a table. :-/
