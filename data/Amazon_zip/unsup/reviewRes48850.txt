Our table for four was constantly covered with a variety of seafood, red meat, and vegetable dishes. Every single item was great. The celery salad with tuna was especially tasty. The food gets the highest marks, and the service was solid. The only thing we didn't like was being penned into our table with awkward swinging doors. It felt too much like we were the pigs in the paintings on the wall waiting for slaughter.
