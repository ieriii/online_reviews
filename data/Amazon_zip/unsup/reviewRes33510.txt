This place was just okay... i had a cheese omelet with mushrooms with a side of potatoes and potato pancakes. the omelet was pretty standard and the potato pancakes were way way too salty and garlicky. the orange juice was pretty good......i duno - i think that as far as breakfast goes i still like bongo room the most. i will probably come back and try something else...the nutella crepes sounded pretty good.
