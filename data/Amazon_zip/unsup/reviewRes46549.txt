I love this place for many reasons. The first one being the fact that it's super close to my apartment, the second one being that the atmosphere is fun and warm, and the food is totally great! My parents used to come here back in the day and there's just a friendly vibe in this restaurant that you don't get very often. Their menu is really fun, there are little cartoonish people drawn all over it and fun descriptions of the food. Random items adorn the walls of the dining room and their salad bar is the bomb. Anything you want is right there. They have a tiny little bar right when you walk in to the right. If you can snag a seat, it's nice to just people watch. Grunts can get pretty packed on the weekends, especially in the summertime being right next to the zoo. There are parents and baby strollers galore. I on the other hand, prefer dining during the week to avoid the crowds and tourists. It's then that you will come across the neighborhood folk (more my style). Try their Chili, I think it's pretty amazing. Everyone has their opinion on what makes good Chili, but Grunt's has their up to par! Their Cajun Chicken Sandwich makes my mouth water and their burgers are pretty darn amazing. I usually leave this place busting the buttons off my pants, but it was time well spent. The staff is generally very friendly and animated. I've never had a bad time, and will continue coming back.
