Pretty good.......for vegetarian food!I came in here not knowing that the vast majority of their menu is vegetarian. I got hummus for an appetizer (great!) and the buffalo wrap as an entre (very ok). However, being a vegetarian place, I was surprised at the variety of food available on their menu. I'll definitely suggest this to my vegetarian friends and take them here whenever they visit! I'm not sure I'd come back here in the near future, due to my love for the meat but i thought i'd push it to 4 stars for being vegetarian friendly!
