Geja's claims to be the most romantic restaurant in the city... and it just might be. The fondue is tasty, but what you're really paying for is the atmosphere. It's very cozy and intimate and there's something a little naughty about sitting in the dark dipping things into hot oil and chocolate.  The tables are very close together, so be prepared to use your inside voice, unless you don't mind if other diners hear you drunkenly tell your date that you think you're ready to "do it" with him.
