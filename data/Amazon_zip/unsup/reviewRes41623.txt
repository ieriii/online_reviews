I read so many wonderful reviews about Bonsoiree that I had to try it when visiting Chicago - especially because I love tastings. I was very disappointed. The food was NOT GOOD. Our table was literally next to the kitchen and back door of the restaurant - I'm talking 3 feet from the kitchen door (or should I say sheet - yes, the kitchen is not covered by doors but a sheet). Very unique looking people were walking into the restaurant from the back door and going into the kitchen - hippies and stoner type folks. The waiter was very nice and service was decent but the food was awful. I felt like dishes were made to sound cool, not taste appetizing. Maybe the food would have been better if we were high like the cooks and wait staff. I was hoping to walk to a bar after dinner but the neighborhood looked pretty rough. Definitely not what I expected for the exorbitant price we paid.
