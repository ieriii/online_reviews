There are MUCH better places for brunch in Wicker Park. Fine, but overrated.I don't understand what they're trying to do, exactly. There's no table service, but you have to be seated by the hostess--THEN (and only then) you can go to the counter to order. The food came without silverware (we tracked some down in a basket over the fireplace). No one came to offer us refills or ask how the food was until we were about to leave. Even though you have no wait-service, they still expect a tip. I left one--but I'm not even sure who it went to. Don't even *try* to order before you're seated--the cashier went bat-s**t crazy on someone ahead of us in line when they misunderstood the convoluted ordering system. It's hard to mess up breakfast food, really, and they do the requisite extravagant pancake-topping-thing. That would normally get you pretty far with me. But the food wasn't great. My advice would be to go somewhere else. Almost anywhere else.
