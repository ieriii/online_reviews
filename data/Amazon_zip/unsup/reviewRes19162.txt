My wife and I were looking for a place to get dinner within walking distance of our hotel on a recent trip to Chicago. A bit of searching Yelp we discovered The Gage based on the ratings and proximity. We were able to get in with ease on a Sunday night using an OpenTable reservation. The draft and bottle selection was nothing to write home about but it also wasn't any slouch either with a nice variety of selection. I had a bottle of Kwak (served in the traditional Kwak glass). After I made a comment about my wife being pregnant the waiter was very kind to offer up just a small little sample of a wine to go with her meal. That really went over well with her as it was just a small amount to give her a taste and nothing more. The menu is laid out in first, second, third and fourth courses, of which you can order any or none of. Off the first (starters) section we had: Hot Poached Shrimp Sambal,StickyRice,HerbBroth$11 The shrimp and stick rice were excellent, just the right combo of succulent shrimp and stick rice. The portion size was extremely small with just three pieces of shrimp. We next decided to try something off the seconds as well and had: Caramelized Lobster LemonQuinoa,Basil,Chili16 The caramel on the lobster was just awesome and the slightest taste of basil that came through on the foretaste really made the dish. When it came to the main course I had the following: Today's Fish and ChipsGuinnessBatter,MaltTartarSauce,Lemon17 Fish and chips were plated with a nice helping of fries and four nice big pieces of lightly breaded fish wrapped in the traditional paper cone. I decided to wash it down with a pint of guiness. Normally I'm one for having no problem knocking out all my food but after the first two plates I left a few fries on the plate. My wife had the: Daily Risotto WinterVegetables,GranaPadanoPQ The price for the day was $19 and she had no problem making short work of it and said she'd get it again. Overall the price definitely factors in the location of it being on the park but for what we paid, the service we were given, and the quality of food I didn't have a problem with it and would highly recommend it for someone looking for a nice place to go without needing to be to dressed up and the ability to get in and out in relative quick fashion.
