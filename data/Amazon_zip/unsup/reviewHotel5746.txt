So I ended up here after my apartment flooded this summer (anyone else remember that wonderful random downpour??) Anywho, back to the story... so I walked in to the front desk (after much pleading with the valet guy to let me just leave my car in a parking space just so I could inquire about a room, but Ill talk about that later)... so the ppl at the front desk were pretty understanding of my situation and willing to negotiate - a bit... so long as I was checked out by friday morning so that they could charge the next guest full weekend price (but, hey, I cant hate - it is a business after all) sooooooo, I decided to drive my car back to my apartment and take the el back in, cuz it was 30-something dollars a day to park my car... and they wont even let you park there for 5 minutes to unload your suitcases without a fight!! URG ppl, should i leave my car in the street or what!!?? Needless to say, they dont go out of there way to help you with bags either (I guess it saves me on tipping, but still... a lil help would have been nice!!) The rooms themselves are VERY nice... my king bed was HUUUUUUUGE with plenty of pillows and the entire room was VERY clean... my only complaint about the room - no microwave or fridge. Which 99% of the time i dont need, but in this case, where I was stuck there for the better part of the week, it would have been nice to keep some juice and yogurt in a fridge rather than running to starbucks or walgreens every time i wanted a quick snack. Now, on to location.... this place is perfect (save for the fact that is RIGHT next to the highway - but you wont hear traffic noise with the balcony doors closed anyway... Oh, did i mention yet that this place is smack-dab in the middle of greektown!?!?! YUUUUUUUUM!! Overall, the place was nice, but a bit pricey, and a fridge/microwave would have been nice :)
