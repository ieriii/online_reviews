I sit and write this in a meat coma and we even have tons of leftovers for tomorrow. Go on a weekday with wine to take advantage of the BYO(wine only). Started with the empanada combo appetizer that was pretty good. But considering the size of the entree's, was a foolish choice. The wife went with the Matrimono which is a combo of steak and chicken and it rocked. But the real winner was the Bandeja Paisa which was ribeye and pork belly and a ton of sides. Fantastic steak with great flavors while the pork belly was more for show but nice to nibble on.
