Big Jones holds a special little place in my heart. Not long after they opened up, I ventured in and was so happy to have done so! First off, the customer service is probably the best I've experienced in the city. The waitstaff is attentive, quick to respond, and really, really friendly. Secondly, the food is really good. I've loved pretty much everything I've had here. The eggs Rochambeau are amazing!! The black eyed pea fritters are delightful. The burger and fries...oh dear god. Everything is high quality! I could drink their sweet tea like it's going out of style. For dessert, definitely get the Mississippi Mud Pie. To die for! The food is definitely rich, so be prepared if you have a sensitive tummy! In my opinion, it's worth every cent. Very reasonable with great service! What else could you ask for??
