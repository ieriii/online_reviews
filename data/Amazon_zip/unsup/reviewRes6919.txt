I'm a big ambience person, and if I were judging solely off of that, this place is off the charts. Exposed brick, candles on each table, multi-level dining room, open-air when it's nice out, nice bar, perfect music.... The food is nothing short of delicious. I ordered seafood pasta in red sauce and was not disappointed! Could have used a few more little pieces of seafood in it, but I'm not complaining. The red sauce was tasty, I received a very large portion, and took a majority of my meal home. My boyfriend ordered the filet - potatoes were delicious, as were the veggies. The meat was cooked just to how I like it (though I'm not entirely sure if he was 100% pleased...we're usually pretty agreeable, though.) Our server was very helpful with our wine and entree decisions, as I may be the most indecisive person when it comes to restaurants. She gave me a fair evaluation of each entree I was deciding between rather than giving me her own personal preferences, and I ended up being very happy with my selection. My only complaint is that the oil pourer is very difficult to get oil out of. You need to shake it a LOT in order to get any oil out, and my boyfriend ended up with a few little oil spots on his brand new shirt. (Thank God for moms!) We needed to refill our oil plate a few times for a small loaf of bread - something we were not too keen to do once we noticed how much it splashed. This place is fantastic for a quiet, romatic date or to take your parents to when they're in town. I will certainly be back here!
