What is this world coming to when you show up at Revolution on a Wednesday evening at 6pm and there is already a 25 minute wait? Logan Square has never been so trendy. Luckily for us there were two seats at the bar so we didn't have to wait for a table. I started with a workingman and the girlfriend had the iron fist pale ale. Both were very good. Had the bacon fat popcorn which was ok nothing spectacular but come on bacon on anything makes things better. The girlfriend had the fish and chips which were good and I had a workingman burger which was fine. The second round of beers were just as good as the first even though I can't remember the names of them. The bartender (Amy) was great and spent lots of time talking about the beers and the space. We didn't have room for dessert but I am sure we will be back soon just need to figure out the best time to get a seat.
