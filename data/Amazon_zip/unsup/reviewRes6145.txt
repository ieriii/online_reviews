To get the negative out of the way, Wildfire is a bit crowded and loud, with generic decor. There were a couple of blunders made - the bar waiter spilled a martini all over me and the table server forgot to bring our salad - but they were more than made up for in apologies, four(!) comped drinks, an offer to pay for dry cleaning and a comped dessert. Kinda made me wish drinks were spilled on me everywhere I go. The food was awesome and portions huge! I'd say the best items at our table were the bone-in ribeye cooked blue (rarer than rare), which nearly melted in my mouth, and the chopped salad. Each of us were really pleased with our other dishes though (crusted filet trio, prime rib, delicious stuffed potato, and much more...did we think this was our last meal or something?).  We also really enjoyed the wine flights for $12-14. They're generous with the pouring, I tell ya.
