The interior of this place is very quaint, with pressed tin ceiling tiles, dramatic lighting, patterned carpeting and smooth, polished woods. We ate outside, which was nice last night, had we not been repeatedly accosted by homeless people. I'm all for helping peeps out, but please do not jab your finger into my food. We were approached twice, which makes me think management there must know that this is a problem, but I didn't see any of the (very handsome) waiters or busboys discouraging the roaming panhandlers. The food was good. I don't have much experience with Vietnamese food, so I'm not the best judge of its authenticity or otherwise properness, but it tasted good. The martinis were strong, but not so that I was seeing vapor trails. It was fine. Didn't knock my socks off, but I'd go back willingly if part of a group.
