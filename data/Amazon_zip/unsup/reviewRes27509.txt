Your selection of good Mexican food in Chicago are plentiful, especially on the south side. Nuevo Leon is by far my favorite in Chicago. I live on the north side, where Mexican food is not as good, so I travel all the way to Pilsen to eat at this gem. I have many favorites but for breakfast I usually go for Huevos Rancheros and/or the Menudo (tripe soup). It's always consistently good, never bland or watery as many places serve. For lunch my favorite is the Bistec A La Mexicana, try it with the melted chihuahua cheese on top. Another great item for lunch or dinner is the Pollo En Mole, the mole sauce is the best I have had in the city. Also the Asado De Puerco is a must have. The good thing is they usually serve this as a complimentary appetizer. My favorite appetizer however is Nachos Dias. The tortillas here are my favorite, the corn and even more so the flour ones. They sell them at the counter to take home, which you will do once you try them when you eat here. Parking can be a bit of a challenge, more so on the weekends. First try the free parking lot just east, around the corner. If already full, metered parking along 18th street. If you go on a Saturday or Sunday between 10 AM and 2 PM, you can expect a long wait in line to be seated.
