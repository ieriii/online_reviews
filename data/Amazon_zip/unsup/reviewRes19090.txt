Just stopped in for a quick meal, but this place was super awesome and delicious. The burger is no joke, it's delicious! Great fries too. I had the scallops, they came with some perfect broccoli rabe and FRIED CHICKEN SKIN. Are you kidding me?? Amazing. Great beer selection, can't wait to come back for a full meal!!
