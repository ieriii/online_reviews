One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in while in Chicago- conveniently located, room was comfortable and quiet, and the hotel seemed clean- a much better option that the Sheraton if you're into SPG. The only downer is that the concierge lounge breakfast was a little poor- some eggs would be nice.
