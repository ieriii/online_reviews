We've heard a lot about Piece and put it on the top of our "must visit restaurants" list. We went on a Friday night and are here to report that it has disappointed and didn't hold up to the hype. We were aware that there would be a very long wait and had no problem with waiting for a table while sipping on some of their craft beer. The beer was good, but the ambience lacked something. It was as if the owners decided to throw a pizza place right into the middle of a barn. The service was below par (waiter was busy and did not engage at all) and I've had much better thin-crust pizza. We got a red pizza with a couple of toppings. We'd go back only to try something different, but probably not anytime in the near future.
