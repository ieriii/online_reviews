in a neighborhood filled with good food options, this humble cafe on the corner often gets overlooked. personally, it took me a few years of living in the hood to finally try this place out. boy, was i missing out on something!my boyfriend and i went on a sunday morning, and there was no wait - perfect. we had the amazing turkish coffee and then split a bowl of seasonal fruit, complete with sliced almonds and mango chutney. now, as someone who eats fruit on a daily basis, it takes a lot to make fruit stand out, but this was the best fruit bowl i have ever tasted - literally!! i've been thinking about it ever since....for our meal, we each turned one of their crepes into an omelette and we were both delighted by the yumminess. the ratio of ingredients to egg was superb, which is not always the case at other restaurants. no full bites of only egg here - all bites contained goodies!all in all, this is a great place to have breakfast, and i can't wait to go back a try a dessert crepe (and get another bowl of fruit!!) also of note, the service was quick and pleasant, which is always a plus. way to go icosium!
