Never went here for dining in, but the both the thin and stuffed pizzas are predictably good, compared to the other Giordano's, a good sign of consistency from one restaurant to another. While YMMV, I have a bit of a prejudice towards all Giordano's with its staff and service; luckily for this restaurant, I get delivery, but that's for later... Both thin (which is not thin) and stuffed (not deep dish) are tasty, as are the added condiments - I always go for the SMOG (sausage, mushroom, onion, and green peppers), and its always excellent: tasty crust, sauce is good, and the ingredients are great. Since I never dined here, I always get it delivered - delivery times are actually not too bad, considering the time it usually takes to get a pizza from Giordano's; almost always get it under 75 minutes, a reasonable time to wait considering the prep to cook, cooking, and delivery. Excellent in my book!
