This pizza is fine, but not for me. The pan style for which they are well known, is not my favorite, so admittedly I have a bias. The sauce had decent flavor but was applied sparingly and I found the cheese lacking. Ingredients seemed fresh and the little "char" on the edge of the dough/crust did have good flavor, but overall the taste and flavor of your average bite was lacking. If pan style is your favorite - I prefer thin crust and deep dish more - then this place is probably worth a try and you may find it a 3 or 4 star - but otherwise, I wouldn't bother.
