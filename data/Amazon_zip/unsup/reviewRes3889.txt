I want to douse myself in the seoul sassy sauce so I can keep licking it off.  We came to Chicago for a concert and were looking for something unique near our hotel, Crisp came up with rave reviews, and they lived up to them.  We shared a seoul sassy half chicken and the Buddha Bowl.  Though the buddha bowl was absolutely delicious (especially the lightly pickled cucumbers) it was the seoul sassy chicken that stole the show. Eating this chicken was like getting the best hug I've ever gotten in my life. I wanted to feel it's warm embrace for the rest of my life and possibly find myself married to it. I know my groans of pleasure were distracting to the other diners, but I lost all control over public decorum. If you find yourself anywhere near this restaurant, run to it.  Get the seoul sassy chicken and change your life.
