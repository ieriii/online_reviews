This is my first review, oh my sister will be so proud!! Let me begin by stating that I am not a big fan of trying anything new and different (I'm pretty much a hamburger/pasta/chicken/mexican food girl, boring yes). Getting me to agree to a place like this was surprise enough to me! Once we walked in, the owner greeted and sat us immediately. This was around 3:30pm on a Saturday, there may have been 2-3 other small groups in the place. The decor was easy on the eyes, not over done but definitely there. Within a few minutes our waitres, Caitlin, came by to introduce herself and inform us of items that were not on the menu. This was my first time in Icosium, so I needed a bit to look over the menu. She was very patient and understanding with my indecisiveness, which I appreciate. I was at Hollywood Grill the night before and it was a different story.... As for the meal, we decided to try the Turkish Kafe. I'm not a fan of black coffee, but this was incredible! The consistency is a little odd, but the flavor makes up for it! Being a sort of picky eater, I went with a create your own crepe dealy. Mixed baby greens, roasted peppers, roasted garlic, carmelized onions, pistachio nuts, fresh cilantro, Muenster cheese, and chicken breast. I was a little curious to see if those would mix well...sure enough, it was fantastic! And the soup that came before hand, vegetable puree, delighted my taste buds more than I thought it would. Incredible service, absolutely delicious food, filling portions, and plenty of options to keep me interested enough to need to go back. 5 stars all around.
