Great late night spot. I usually go after I frequent the Evil Olive. I have become good buddies with the employees. They are very friendly and hospitable when you enter their restaurant. Now I will get to the food. It is a very simple menu. Sure you can complain it's greasy and that there is too much oil, but the the taste is addictive. There are only a handful of menu items at the original pasadita I go to. Barbacoa Carne asada Tongue Chile rilleno I usually get the carne asada and the chili rilleno. The steak is so tasty, and it is simply mixed with cilantro and onion. It's super delicious guey.
