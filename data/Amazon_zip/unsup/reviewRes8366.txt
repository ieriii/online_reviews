I LOVE THIS PLACE!! So much so that my boyfriend and I have a wager going on, loser in the NCAA bracket challenge buys dinner at Fogo. The meat here is amazing. My advice, skip the salad bar (its fun to look at but why waste room in your stomach?) and pace yourself with meat. The first time I ate here we were so overwhelmed at the quality of the food that we just accepted everything that came and we ate so fast we filled up quickly. Pace yourself and enjoy your meal!
