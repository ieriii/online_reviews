I stayed in the hotel over the weekend of Lollapalooza 2011. Yes, it IS a little bit out of the way (~20-30 minutes by train to downtown) and the nearest subway station is about a 10 minute walk. (Carmak-Chinatown of the Red Line). However, the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, well-maintained and spacious, and the hotel itself is upscale, clean and gorgeous to look at. I would recommend staying here. I would not recommend walking around the neighborhood after midnight by yourself, but my female friend and I walked home at 11 pm on two brightly lit, busy streets with no problem or harrassment. Some additional information about the hotel: 1. Helpful front desk. Want pizza delivered to your room at 4 am? No problem. They have menus for Sarpino's, a delicious pizza delivery place nearby. There's also a menu in room for Chinese food. They also called a cab for me at 4 am for the airport. 2. Huge lobby, bar, restaurant and general store for supplies you may have forgotten. 3. Business center with computers and Internet and a printer for use. Free coffee in the business center. 4. Huge rooms, comfortable beds, HUGE bathtub. 5. Friendly housekeepers. 6. 10 minute walk to Chinatown and nearest subway stop. 7. Bus stop right in front of hotel. (#29 bus) 8. Taxi stand in front of hotel. 9 Free wifi in rooms. And it was fast! Much appreciated! I very much enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again. The only downside is that it's further away from central downtown Chicago.
