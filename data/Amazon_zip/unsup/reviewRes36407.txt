I like the small plate of spreads with an assortment of whipped butter, maple syrup and two kinds of marmalades. It makes spreading your toast or pancakes or whatever some variety. Meli's didn't blow my mind but the space was clean and cute (tho M Henry's is a lot cozier) and food was good. Our fresh omelet (spinach, tomato, artichoke, bacon, fresh mozz) had a funky dusty color to it but tasted fine. Came with a big heap of potatoes, slice of cantaloupe, and a couple slices of toast (I liked our 7 grain wheat!). To satisfy our sweet tooth, we got the Meli's Honey Cakes. I appreciated the cornmeal texture and how they didn't overdrench them with honey and powdered sugar. Syrup and fresh whipped cream on the side were good to pair with. It's always nice to be able to share so you can get your fix of both sweet and savory. I thought the service was friendly and decent but my friend had a problem with them at the end when various servers came by to clear our tables and we (well mostly me picking at the ends) weren't done with them yet. I could care less seeing how it's a packed Sunday but I know people would have beef with it.
