Love love Fox & Obel, though I'm generally too broke to purchase food/ groceries here regularly it is a great holiday splurge. When I gave birth to my son at prentice the first thing I asked for was for my husband to run down the street and get me a cake here in celebration. They have a fantastic selection of meats, we bought a Christmas goose to cook last year and it was amazing. They stock all sorts of things for gormet chef's from duck lard to marzipan.
