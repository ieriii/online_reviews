MMM this was one great dining experience, the waiters were friendly, not overbearing or pretentious like many other Chicago Steakhouses. The drinks were stiff, they must stuff their own olives with blue cheese. Everyone at my table opted for the bone in cowboy ribeyes medium rare which were phenomenal. Our waiter suggested a great Merlot and we had some mashed potatoes as a side... of course the steaks done to perfection were the real star of the show. It was truly succulent cow sizzling in a light butter. The deserts were wonderful as well... the duo of chocolate combined a mini molten cake with a chocolate mouse (they said chocolate creme brule but it was chocolate mouse) and the chocolate sin cake was great too. It was truly a great find.
