What more do I need to say for this place that hasn't already been said? Its quick, its cheap, furthermore its nutritious and delicious! They have a variety of sandwiches, shawermas, kebob, rice, hummus, falafel, salads, at reasonable prices. I am personally a big fan of the lamb shawerma. tasty~ You can't go wrong. Cash only.
