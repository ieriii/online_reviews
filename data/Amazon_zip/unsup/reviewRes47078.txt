My friend and I had our farewell to Chicago dinner here right before we both moved. Lovely, lovely restaurant with an amazing drink list and top notch food. I had the most amazing duck dish and a gorgeous hibiscus-infused cocktail with an honest-to-goodness flower on top. We both wished we'd known about this place earlier. It's the perfect ladies' night out, friends outing, date night spot. And not too hard on the wallet either, if two poor grad students like us could afford it!
