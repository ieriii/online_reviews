Delicious! Everything. Really. Just go here. Trust me. Sure, we spent way too much, and ate more than we should of, but it was all delicious. There were many different varieties of oysters to choose from. Crab cakes were sweet and flaky, with a slight outer crisp, perfect texture. What else? The lobster bisque was just the right creaminess. We also had a few other sides to go along with our meals. Everything was very pleasant. I was happy, happy, happy, like the little trees Bob Ross paints. Okay, that was random.... But, do go here. Bring your appetite, and your credit card (or in my case, just my appetite, because Bri took care of the bill!) ;-)
