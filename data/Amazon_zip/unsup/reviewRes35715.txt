Well now Sun Wah...you've got me hooked. What do you have to say for yourself?? I can't say I've had the pleasure of being at the old location, but from what I hear, it wasn't that pleasant but the food was good. Now they are in a larger space and even then the place is packed on a good night, so plan to wait if you don't make reservations first. Ok so...what can I say? I'm a fan of most things on the menu here...just not some of the fish...I'm picky with my fish, and that's not Sun Wah's fault. It's also cheap and that's great if you want great food without the price range to go with it. They are AWESOME for big groups so bring everyone you know and most likely they can accommodate you. And yes! They have beer! I can go on and on about the many dishes here, but I'm not because the only thing you need to wonder about and order every time is the duck. GET THE DUCK. Get. The. Duck. Do you hear me?? It's awesome, and I don't consider myself a duck eater usually. But here....oh my gods you'll be full for days if you eat enough of it. And they slice it right in front of you, so if you have only veggie eaters with you, you may want to have them look away. And not only do you get sliced pieces of heaven to eat between Bao-like buns, they take the remainders of the duck and bring you duck fried rice and soup made with the bones! Yes, that last part sounds disgusting, but NO! It's delicious! The bones flavor the broth, and holy crap is it good. Just don't be alarmed if you somehow find a piece of spine in your soup. I would also call ahead and reserve one if that's what you plan to eat. And you will, because I said so. The staff is nice and quick and amazing and friendly. With the crowds it can be a pain to be seated comfortably without pushing your chair into your neighbor, but I don't mind if I know I'm about to have a wonderful meal with wonderful friends. And trust me, your neighbors won't mind either.
