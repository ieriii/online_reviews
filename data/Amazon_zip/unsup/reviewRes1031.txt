Best hot dogs ever. Like others have said, you have to get the specialty dogs. Also, if you cant eat one of them (i.e. allergic to shrimp, etc) you can get the toppings on a regular hot doug ("char -dog") for the price of a regular hot dog! you cant beat that. To avoid lines, go early or late, and never go on a fri/sat. I dont think the duck fat fries are worth it, and there are other places that do things with the fries. This is a must -eat for anyone living in chicago and anyone who plans to visit. Oh yeah, cash only, ample parking, may be up to an hour wait if you go between 11-3pm.
