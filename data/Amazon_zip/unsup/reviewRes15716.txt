LOVED THIS PIZZA! My partner and I ordered Calos Pizza the other night on a whim, and were VERY happy with our pie! We had the "Stuffed Pizza" with green peppers, garlic, and onion... a combination that had a light and yummy flavor. We had a large, and were unable to finish with just the two of us... and had a battle over the leftovers the following day. GROOD (great + good) PIZZA! TRY!
