When my friends told me we were going to the gold coast for brunch I was nervous...I figured I'd never have enough cash. But the 3rd Coast was really surprising to me. Not glitzy in all the right ways. Very "homey" feel in the middle of many high-rise apartment/condo buildings. No sense of pretension here. We walked in at about 1:30 on a Sunday and were seated immediately at a comfortable table for 4. I had an omelet that was really nicely sized--I hate feeling guilty for leaving an enormous-but-rubbery egg creation on a breakfast plate. I didn't have to worry here. It also came with some of the best hashbrowns I've ever had...seriously. (And I'm a breakfast person).  Price-wise, I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices all over the menu, especially for the area. I've paid more for brunch at Ann Sather's, so I considered this a great find. And the entrees my friends had looked great too. Even though I was going "lumberjack breakfast" that day, I was shocked at how good and non-brown the fresh fruit looked--especially for February in Chicago. My only slight annoyance was that the service was barely mediocre. On an early Sunday with eggs and bacon in front of me, I don't want to have to beg for coffee. I will, but I don't like it. And I had to. However, after observing some of the other servers, I think this issue might have been with our particular guy and not as an indicator of the general experience. I went there last week and was so bummed because I couldn't remember the name to even write this little Yelp review. But, after some checking, I found it and I"m glad...I'd definitely go back. In fact, I may be planning my next visit soon.
