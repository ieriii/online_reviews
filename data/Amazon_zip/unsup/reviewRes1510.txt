Sometimes waiting in line is rewarded with a reassuring meal that validates the wait. And sometimes you realize it was like waiting 20 minutes for the women's bathroom at a club; you got what you waited for, but you left feeling empty and with a little toilet paper stuck to your new heels. Happy to say that Hot Doug's was the former, and that their bathroom had no wait and was relatively clean. In our case, we waited around 40 minutes, but the weather was nice, and the other people in line were fun to watch (mostly people in their 20s and 30s, many with children, since it was a Saturday). After waiting in line, the man at the counter was so friendly that you almost forgot there were three hundred people behind you. After you order, you can eat inside or outside (really an alleyway by the restaurant, but it's clean, and the servers will bring your food to you). They have a case by the counter with local and mainstream sodas. We ordered the spicy Thai chicken sausage with sriracha mustard and seaweed-sesame salad, the cranberry and shiraz wild boar sausage with sweet curry mustard and grand canaria cheese, and the duck fat fries. I think the Thai chicken sausage was the superior of the two, but it was nice to share both to alternate the spicy with the sweet. In case you were curious, having the seaweed-sesame condiment is absolute genius. Both sausages were cooked nicely and retained juices inside while having a little of the grill on the outside (if you know what I mean). The duck fat fries were quite nummy but not very crispy. Still, I had to tell myself to stop eating them. We shared one order of the fries between the two of us. If you have the time to wait, the experience is fun and gives you a story to tell your friends.
