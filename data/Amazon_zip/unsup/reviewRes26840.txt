I came to Graham Elliot prepared to eat food that would blow my taste buds with wonderful flavors. I instead left the place only with a blown up credit card. My wife and I wanted to have a nice dinner in the City of Big Shoulders so we stopped by Frontera Grill to get our Rick Bayless on, unfortunately that kind SOB decided to close the restaurant and take his staff on a summer vacation in Mexico. Graham Elliot was only a few blocks away so we made reservations and found ourselves eating a bucket of popcorn topped with truffle oil and cheese only a few minutes later at Graham Elliot. We ordered the Octopus, Foie Gras, Crab Cakes, Lamb, Salmon and Crme Brulee. I wanted to taste great, bold flavors and all I got was weak, poorly seasoned, undercooked food. The octopus was overly salty, the crab cakes were not cakes and the lamb was too pink. The saving graces of the night were my wife's salmon and the foie gras appetizer that was not only pleasing to the eye but also tasted great with a mix of salty and sweet flavors.  The place just didn't cut it, I was expecting Whitney Houston (before Bobby Brown) and instead I got Courtney Love. So sad as all I want to do is feel the heat with somebody, Yeah I wanna dance with somebody.
