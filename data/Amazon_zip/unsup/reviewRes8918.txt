Had been wanting to try it for some time, finally got the chance the other day.  Nice interior, cool vibe, friendly and helpful staff, decent beer selection. Unfortunately the food was really underwhelming. Not sure how this is rated so highly. Had the chenjeh & koubideh combination dinner. The ribeye was very tough and the flavor was unmemorable while the ground beef lacked any redeeming flavor or texture. The rice and grilled tomatoes were good, but that's about it. My GF had the lambshank and was similarly unimpressed though she liked her dill rice. Interesting side-note: I took the uneaten meat home to my dog but when it was put in front of him, he gave it one sniff and looked up at us like, "what else you got?"! Very overrated in my opinion. There are many other much better options nearby.
