Fabulous. Service was very good. Sauteed scallop appetizer was delicious.  Caesar salad was great. Croutons were awesome. My wagyu strip steak was the best steak I ever had. Lobster mash potatoes. Super yummy. Crab, truffle gnocci. Even better. Butter cake was addictive. We have our new favorite place. Will definitely go back.
