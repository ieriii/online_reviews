I ate at Wilde's for my birthday, and it was delish! Don't go if you are against food babies. They know how to serve up the heavy. I had the macaroni, and though I was afraid they wouldn't be able to serve it sans-bacon, they totally could, because this isn't some pre-made pop it in the microwave kind of establishment. yum! I docked a star because our table was so close to the tables next to us that the waiter had to move them for me to get through to the bench to sit [and i'm friggin skinny]. And then when other patrons filled those tables, I was trapped there. That wasn't cool. Just take away one table and you won't have to do that dudes. Also, the music was dance-club loud. What is up with that? You should go!
