This is a review of Geno's East frozen pizza- I bought this pizza last night and I opened it up to find this tiny, little joke inside! The box is like 50% empty space with the pizza shrink-wrapped onto a larger piece of cardboard so the tiny, little pizza doesn't rattle around in the big, empty box!!! What a rip-off!!! see photo here- http://www.flickr.com/ph
