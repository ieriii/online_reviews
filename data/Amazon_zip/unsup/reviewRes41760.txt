I"m really not sure what happen , but the downstairs bar wanted my group out of there. Oddly, we are all 30 something professionals, who were dressed reasonably well. Moreover, no one was sloppy drunk or any thing like that.   However, it soon became clear we were not welcome. The Bartender informed us we weren't aloud to stand and drink near the bar. Fair enough, so the twelve us sat in a booth. The bar tender/server came over an informed us that we were "crowding the couple next to us". Then said we could sit separately (which we obviously weren't going to do). Basically, we're going to create rules until you get out of here. The bar staff was very unwelcoming and unprofessional. We headed down the street to a nearby by bar and dropped a few hundred bucks there. I hope the couple we "crowded" covered their lost revenue. Needless to say, I won't be back.
