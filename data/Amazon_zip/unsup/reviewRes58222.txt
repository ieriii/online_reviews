I am not one to review a place without actually eating there first, but my experience with Schwa was so disappointing and frankly upsetting that I had to warn others, just in case. I had a reservation made about a month in advance, and celebrated the fact I got through on the phone! We were celebrating my friend's birthday, and had people come to town just for that evening. About 2 hours before my reservation I received a call that Schwa would not be open that evening due to sewage and plumbing issues. The person telling me this was being quite condescending, saying things like I guess you could come in...but I wouldn't want you smelling like sh** I told them I understood but was so upset.This would not be such a big deal if I did not go on twitter hours later and read various people's postings about how wonderful their dinner at Schwa was that evening (including some famous comedian, who I guess I was bumped for). Not only that, I read online that the sewage/plumbing excuse is recycled on a regular basis, and if you are the chump like I was, you'll fall for it. For someone who likes to be treated with respect, and believes that CUSTOMER SERVICE is an essential part of dining, I will not be returning. It's too bad, I heard so many great things about the food. Moral of the story: Always have a back up plan!
