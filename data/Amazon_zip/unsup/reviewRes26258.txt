Yeah anyway the pizza really is some of the best in Chicago if not America. Duh. One night in here I got into an argument with my friend Eric (the guy who dresses in suits to be "zany"). We had just started on our pizza when he made a bizarre comment. Read on. Eric: "You know, Ryan. You remind me of John Travolta when you eat." Me: "Oh, thanks. Very nice of you to say that." Eric: "I didn't mean that as a compliment." Me: "Oh." Eric: "It's just...an observation. Like. When you chew, your face, it looks like Travolta's." Me: "Fat Travolta or hot Travolta?" Eric: "Um. Fat Travolta. Sorry." Me: "That's cool. I could probably lose a few pounds." Eric: "Yeah. We all could." (awkward silence) Me: "So." Eric: "So." Me: "So maybe. I dunno." Eric: "What?" Me: "That's probably the dumbest thing you've ever said in your life." Eric: "Just an observation, dude." Me: "Oh really? I mean, would you like it if I said, `Eric, when you wipe your hands on your napkin, you look like Mickey Rourke. Not the young and hot Mickey Rourke, but the old and tired Mickey Rourke with the botched facelift and ugly tattoos." Eric: "You're overreacting." Me: "God. I hate you sometimes." Then we finished our pizza (excellent) and took a bus to a bar.
