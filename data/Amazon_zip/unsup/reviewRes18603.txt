This place is cool, a great decor inside. 2 menus welcomed us, a big one and a small one... the larger for BEER, not food! Lol, excellent. No matter what your beer taste, I'm sure they have something here to make you happy... ciders, lagers, darks, lights, organic, you name it! (prices range greatly) The menu is small, but definitely adequate. They're known for burgers, which I had to try. It had sirlion on top of the burger! And I was so happy when I was able to get a side salad instead of fries, appreciated! Most were under ten bucks, as well. I'll be back!
