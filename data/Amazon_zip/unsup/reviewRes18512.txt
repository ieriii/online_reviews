8AM weekday breakfast at Xoco was one of the most preposterous and also most worthwhile meals I've had over the past few months. The dipping chocolate also deserves its own paragraph. I would trade my dignity for more of that stuff (slash may or may not have - couldn't see my friend's look of disgust and/or embarrassment, as was too busy licking my finger and getting chocolate all over my face...)
