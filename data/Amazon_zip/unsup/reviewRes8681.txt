Wow...I have trouble putting the proper words to this place. It's meat-tacular! Definitely not for vegetarians. When you turn your card over to go, they will bring the flaming hot beef, lamb, chick and pork to you until your stomach can't take anymore. I went there to celebrate getting a new job with my wife. We ordered a few Caipirinhas which were mixed to perfection...if you haven't had it before, give it a try, it is the national drink of Brazil. The salad bar is good, but save most of your room for the meat, its worth it. Only negative is that it will be an expensive night, but don't go for the cheaper Brazzaz nearby, Fogo is definitely a cut above!
