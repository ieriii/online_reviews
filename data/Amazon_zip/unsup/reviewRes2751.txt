Set: American Psycho meets Men in Black. Far too serious and humorless; lighten up! It's just food. This is clearly the Cali in me, but I feel like food should be presented from a "warm" place - not cold and sterile and littered w/ financiers from London. (Then again, if they didn't have this place, where would said financiers eat? Touche, inner voice! Touche!) The food was well-presented and executed; dessert was exceptional (chocolate bar!); and my company was delightful, so three stars.  That being said, places like this make me die a little inside. A cold, bleak, plane-crashes-into-jagged-snow-capped-peaks-with-no-survivors kinda death. No offense.
