Damn, almost 200 reviews on this place? What could I possibly have to add? Well, I finally had to get my own Piece.  My friend Harry and I were out walking, with no destination in mind, waiting for the other two in our group, and we just wandered into Piece. I'd heard good things, noticed that this place has a TON of reviews, and even ran into none other than Molly on her way out a while back, so we figured we'd give it a try. We got a table almost immediately, right next to the door, which was good and bad. The pizza (a 'Red', IIRC) was good; it neither tasted nor looked like the cookie-cutter 'pizza' that seems to be the bane of our existence here in Chicago. With the exception of an admittedly small stretch of time when I had to literally flag down our waiter, service was excellent, and even that could be choked up to the Friday evening rush. Unfortunately, I did not get to sample any of the homemade beers, although the names were humorous- full frontal and Top Heavy Hefeweizen come to mind- as were some of the descriptions- dark bier- its a dark beer! if memory serves. But I was already under the weather from working next to Typhoid Rich all week- the Cubs fan who wouldn't go home even though he was contagious (another reason to hate Cubs Fans?) and drowsy from the Tylenol Sinus, and not sure how it would mix with alcohol. But I will be back, and I will try some of their award-winning beer, and I'll update my review at that time. For now, four stars; if the pizza stands up to memory the next time, and the beer is all it seems to be, this could easily become five stars.
