I love this place! I'm a huge fan of Ethiopian food, and this is one of my favorite places. The food is delicious and affordable. They offer a sampler for two people that is great for a date, and only $23.50 for both people. I love the Sambussas and the Wots. I could eat them for every meal. Parking is difficult on Broadway, but there's usually (free) parking on Lawrence, across from the cemetery. And it's right next to the Red Line.
