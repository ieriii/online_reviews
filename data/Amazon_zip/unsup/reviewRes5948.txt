Horseradish Crusted Steak - How I long for thee.. I love Wildfire.. it is by far one of the best places to get a decently priced good steak in Chicago. I know there are way better steak houses in the city, but the atmosphere and food make a great combination in this place. Don't get me wrong, it is still a bit on the pricey side, but I feel it is a little bit better of a value then the major steak houses in Chicago. If your not a big steak eater, the Chopped Salad will blow you out of your chair! It did for me.. or maybe that was the strong drinks.. who knows, but who cares, it was great! Give it a shot here, or at one of their other locations in the suburbs.. you probably* won't be disappointed. *You may not have the same tastes... so I could be wrong.
