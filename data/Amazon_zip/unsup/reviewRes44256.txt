Oh, and if you are in need of a library that serves coffee, provides wifi and has no books...the lounge next door to Alliance is where it's at. :) The seating area is the quietest, most focused group of people I have ever witnessed. No complaints, just don't come here for a chat with friends...you'll get the evil eye. Solitude, silence, focus...yes. With caffeine. And sugar. The perfect library. Without books.
