I would come here again if only for the view - it was awesome. We were in an east facing room and got a great view of the right break of the river and the merch mart itself. At night all over the city had colored lights (but wisely turned them off somewhere around midnight) and it was just gorgeous. Great location too. It was a quick inside walk to the Purple and Brown lines, breakfast was a short ways away also, and it was a good central location to a lot of activities. The one issue we encountered was finding dinner - it seems to be a very business area so most restaurants close around 4pm so we had to cab it places (it was 10 degrees). If you are there in the summer and walk or just don't mind dropping $7-10 on a cab all the time then it's great. (I'm a city walker but the weather was a bit prohibitive) The pool was nice (once they got the heater working) and they had a well stocked gym and a nice sauna. The price was reasonable for an inner-city hotel. To my friends' delight we were there during a conference of teenage girls so they got to be dirty old men sitting in the lobby one night....I Yelped...
