Grand Lux schools Cheesecake Fizzactory. Fact. If I'm looking for a fancy pants brunch on the Mag Mile and STARVING, this is my go-to. Also good for moms, aunts, ... you get the idea. The wait is inevitably shorter than CF, the decor brighter and more pleasing, and the people watching from the window tables is unparalleled. Oh add a huge menu to all that. If you want it, they got it. They give out pagers that actually work from a fair distance, which is nice. I've tried my luck by wandering into Ann T. once or twice and it buzzed like it should. The staffers are always friendly, probably used to chatty tourist traffic.  Saving the best for last: crab and asparagus omlette. My favorite restaurant breakfast food of all time. Order it and thank me. SO so So good.
