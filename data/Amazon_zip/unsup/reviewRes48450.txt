Ok. So you want to know how to get any easy 5-stars from Aaron? Surprise him with a giant pile of prosciutto.  I went here for brunch with a friend the past weekend. We showed up rather later (around 1) and they were out of both of the top choices. The waitress was nice enough to talk me into the red wine poached eggs with country ham (see the above prosciutto) and my friend into the Pork confit hash. Both of us were pleasantly surprised by dishes full of flavors rich and robust enough to stand up well against the Bloody Marys.  Speaking of the Bloody Marys, whose idea was it to serve it with a beer-back? I'm not sure, but all I could say was "Brilliant!!" The beer serves as a nice palate cleanser and a welcome rinse from the Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary itself is a bit thick (like a liquid salad) but very nicely spiced. While I do think the 7-times distilled vodka is overkill for such a drink, I am not going to complain. This is a definite place for many returns.
