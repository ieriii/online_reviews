I love Piece. One of my favorite Chicago spots to waste an afternoon with friends, pizza and beverages. The pizza is reasonably priced, massive and outstanding. The atmosphere is comfortable, relaxed, and in the words of my friend "Colorado-esque". And the beer is THE BOMB. Recent brew favorites include the Full-Frontal Pale Ale and Golden Arm Kolsch. Definitely check out their Sunday deal for $25 large pizza and fresh beer growler.
