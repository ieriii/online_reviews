Four stars, and here's how you'll find them: Go for a latish lunch, around 1 pm (on a weekday!) when you can find some parking the lunch rush and the worst of the Stroller Brigade have passed. The place is much quieter and almost peaceful. Get a nice booth by the windows so you can people watch. Order the black bean cakes with mango salsa. You get two sides. One must be the sweet potatoes. (Don't bother with the delicious kohlslaw as the other because it already comes with the bean cakes.) Enjoy!
