This is by far the BEST Mexican Restaurant EVER! Their Queso Fundido is amazing! The tacos, Burritos and enchiladas are also really good! Margaritas are super tasty and strong! I'd recommend the mango. If you haven't tried this restaurant yet, you are really missing out. My friends and family back home crave this place all the time, ever since I brought them there. You wont be disappointed!
