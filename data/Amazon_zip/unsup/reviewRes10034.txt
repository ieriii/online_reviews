Food: Good to great Interior/decor: Great (Outdoor Patio) Service: Not good enough Bottom line: Liked it, but with all the Italian options in Chicago i would probably not go back! Let me elaborate: The food we got ranged from good, but nothing spectacular to some really good sea food. Pretty much the service dragged the average down (but that can of course be very individual). The guy was literally sweating (and it was not a hot day) that he dripped on our table. He spilled our wine (he tried to 'make up for it' with saying dessert is on him - that was for some reason only dessert for one!). Maybe I'm hard on the scale, as the food was good and the patio amazing, but there are so many other places that are good, so... Well, go try it, maybe your service is better - maybe not! Uh yes - They don't have Tiramisu which in my book do NOT count well...
