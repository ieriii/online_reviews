wow. garcia's has been a regular meeting place for me and an old friend since high school. there were the early days where you just grabbed a seat and hot, greasy delicious mexican food flew out of the kitchen. then came the post 'check, please' days where you waited for twenty minutes to be seated and side stepped down the narrow aisles to make your way to the have-you-had-all-your-shots bathroom. dont get me wrong, i was still a regular. tonight, i finally took my maiden voyage into the newly remodeled garcia's. wow. the space has more than doubled in size, everything looks pristine, there are some nice industrial touches along the lofted ceiling, and it seems as though it's easier to have a conversation at a normal speaking voice. added bonus: i barely finished putting in my order and it was already on the table. reunited and it feels so good.
