IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD AT CRISP It's totally hyped up, relatively cheap, in trendy lakeview - a unique concept restaurant with pretty good food.  It also totally wasn't what I expected it to be.  I didn't expect the complete absence of any Korean workers or cooks. I didn't expect the 2 absolutely gratuitous large Flat screen TVs behind the cashier that flash pictures of the food and are absolutely not visible to anyone else in the restaurant. I didn't expect the long wood communal tables. I didn't expect them to be closed on mondays (Man I was craving it that day!!) P.S. Why Crisp? I didn't expect their buffalo sauce to be bought from a hot dog stand while their other sauces are homemade I didn't expect the random magazines strewn about the place I didn't expect their phone number to be 877-MY-FUNKE because, you know, that makes perfect sense... I like the paper towels, but they're freaking IMPOSSIBLE to tear off with one hand so I was desperately trying to figure out how to tear a piece off without leaving my BBQ-Buffalo-Buddha-Sassy-Mess on the remaining towels You know, just wierdness. Is this why I'm not a northsider? Is this stuff just normal here? Anyways, food again pretty good. All these reviews say pretty much the same thing. Personal preference: The Seoul Sassy Wings I haven't had Greats Seas in a while but from what I remember these are pretty close in taste but drier and crispier Again the buffalo is pretty good but I've had better elsewhere so if I had to give any advice to Crisp it'd be: 1) Stop being so weird. 2) Make your own buffalo sauce 3) Change your paper towel holders
