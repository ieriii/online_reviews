What an incredible meal! Alinea rocks in all facets, from service, to food innovation, to check presentation. Exceptional meal, exceptional service. The food is incredibly innovative, which I adore, but some of my less adventurous friends would be sorely disappointed had they joined us. No picking which ingredient you want or don't...it just arrives in perfectly timed & orchestrated intervals throughout the night. And plan on being there for a while...our "tasting" of 12 courses took 3 hours for 5 of us. So go with people you like and enjoy talking to! I strongly recommend doing the wine pairing with the meal. Its expertly paired and a really nice addition to the flavors of the food. I wish I could afford to eat there more often ($360 tasting w/ wine pairing + lovely Cook County tax), but I hope to venture back at least once a year. Do it. Savor it. It's a meal you'll cherish for the rest of your life!
