I think Bin 36 is the largest wine bar I have ever been inside. What it lacks in the stereotypical wine bar coziness it makes up with a very approachable wine list and reasonably priced flights. Each wine has a fairly detailed description, perhaps for the wine novice who has no idea what they were drinking? I think it definitely made everyone feel really comfortable about choosing something they normally wouldn't drink. I wish I could write about all the different cheeses they have but I went to Bin 36 after an insanely large meal so no more eating for me. If I lived in Chicago Amie and I would have a permanent table reserved in the corner where we would gab (and drink) the night away.
