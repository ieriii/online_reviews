Fellow Yelpers and I came here on a weeknight to feast on an endless tornado of meat. Like it's competitors, this churrascaria has very knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff that gets you started with drinks. Our server, Raoul, recommended a delicious pitcher of housemade red wine sangria that we enjoyed. It's probably the best sangria that I've had more so than at any tapas place. The beverage was a bit sparkly and not harsh on the palate at all, which is probably why I had about a glass and a half of it. The pitcher is also the best bargain on the wine/beverage list ($29 for a giant pitcher that could probably serve a party of four with two rounds). Our server then gave us a run-through of the generous and varietal salad bar including offerings such as a lobster bisque soup and appetizers like stuffed mushroom and potatoes au gratin. Texas de Brazil (TdB) sends it's many attentive gauchos around the dining areas as well to scout for dining cards flipped to the green side (also known as "go, go, go" to gauchos to pile meat on my plate!). Within minutes, a gaucho swarms to your table offering delicious cuts of perfectly seasoned and cooked cuts of meat (flank steak, filet mignon, pork ribs, lamb chops, sausages, etc.). The one big difference is that TdB also has a sushi bar ... with a dedicated sushi chef that sculpts beautiful rolls of sushi. Yuuuummmm. So oodles of meat and sushi? I must have died and gone to heaven. I barely got down a plate of salad and some meat when I must have fallen into a deep food coma. I was so intent on getting a few more pieces of sushi, but never made it off my chair unfortunately. Raoul did bring the dessert tray around towards the end of our meal and we ended up sharing a banana foster pie that was to die for. Overall, great service, great food, and a great selection. I'd recommend readers give TdB a try. Just make sure you wear the baggy pants or oversized overalls.
