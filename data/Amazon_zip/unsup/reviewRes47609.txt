I've been here a couple times now but not for dinner... for drinks and appetizers on the roof! Drinks are fantastic, the cajun maple smoked bacon slider and beef fondue appetizers are TASTY, and it's a great place to hang out on a warm afternoon/evening. This place is trendy but not pretentious. It can get crowded on the roof, just depends on the day. I highly recommend the Parisian Blackberry Cocktail!
