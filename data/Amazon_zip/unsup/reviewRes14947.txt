Spent my 26th here, and they easily accommodated a group of 9 with no issues, and even though we had to wait a few minutes, the comfy couches in front were worth it, as were the selections of beers, both home brewed and otherwise. The menu was creative, but I wasn't blown away by the popcorn which everyone seems to fawn over. The burgers looked impressive, I had the stew, a good staple. A bit sweet, but wouldn't stop me from coming back.
