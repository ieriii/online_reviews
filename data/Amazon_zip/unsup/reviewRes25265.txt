A friend recommended Pequod's to me when I put a plea out on facebook for the best pizza in Chicago.  Fun place, tasty pizza, I loved their "caramelized crust" that everyone raves about. I would more describe it as, burnt in a good way. I think we got some sort of supreme with veggies and meat. They put a good amount of toppings on, which I love, I'm a toppings girl. The pizza was filling, the salad was plain and simple and just what I like with my pizza. We were eating pizza leftovers for days, worth it.
