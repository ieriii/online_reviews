After a few visits I must rave about Mia Francesca's. Although the menu is not very extensive, I think that's because they have mostly daily specials. It may not be on the menu every day but ask for the spinach ravioli with vodka creme sauce, you will not be disappointed. Also a very plentiful wine list and very friendly service. Be advised the tables are close together, so you may get friendly with your dining neighbors, which can be fun unless your fighting with your girlfriend or a hermit. I did not see any bugs running across the floor so they must have taken care of that problem, although don't fool yourselves there are probably bugs in every restaurant you eat at!
