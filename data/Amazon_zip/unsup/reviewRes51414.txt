Necessities of a good Mexican restaurant: 1. Late night hours--Garcia's is open til 3 am, with bar open until 2 am. 2. Amazing margaritas--Had the Mango Gold margaritas, and they were amazing, with actual chunks of freshly blended mangoes. 3. Homemade chips and salsa--Brought to you right when you sit down. 4. Flavorful, food that hits the spot after a long day--My chicken quesadilla warmed me up from the gross weather outside, and I still had enough to take home to the hubster. 5. Lively atmosphere--Unfortunately, Garcia's loses a star because they didn't even have music playing in the background. As nice of a place as this, I expected festive music playing to keep our girl's night out going. Instead, we had the lovely sound of table chatter, the margarita blender and the clinking of silverware against plates to jam out to. Will definitely come back, but hopefully they'll get an iPod before than.
